Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported from fitness and sports facilities.

What is added by this report?
21 COVID-19 cases were linked to an index case in a fitness instructor, who, along with a patient who was also an instructor, taught classes less than 1 day, 1 to less than 2 days, and 2 days or more before symptom onset; aggregate attack rates were 95%, 13%, and 0%, respectively.

What are the implications for public health practice?
To reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in fitness facilities, staff members, and patrons should wear a mask, and facilities should enforce consistent and correct mask use (including during high-intensity activities) and physical distancing, improve ventilation, and remind patrons and staff members to stay home when ill. Exercising outdoors or virtually could further reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.

[The study results indicate that SARS-CoV2 transmission was likely facilitated by practice of not wearing face masks, extended close contact during fitness sessions, and poor room ventilation. The fitness instructor's shouting during class might have contributed to transmission; as aerosol emission during speech has been correlated with loudness (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-38808-z), and previously COVID-19 outbreaks linked to intense physical activity and singing have been reported (https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6919e6).

The authors conclude, "This cluster investigation highlights the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in certain settings, including indoor fitness facilities. To reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in fitness facilities, staff members and patrons should wear a mask, and facilities should implement engineering and administrative controls including improving ventilation, enforcing physical distancing and consistent and correct mask use (even during high-intensity activities), increasing opportunities for hand hygiene, and reminding all patrons and staff members to stay home when ill. Conducting exercise activities entirely outdoors or virtually could further reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk."

Random variation is an essential component of all living things. It drives diversity, and it is why there are so many different species. Viruses are no exception. Most viruses are experts at changing genomes to adapt to their environment. We now have evidence that the virus that causes Covid, SARS-CoV-2, not only changes, but changes in ways that are significant.

As the scientific community becomes keenly aware of the dangers SARS-CoV-2 variants present, increased sequencing efforts seek to uncover new mutants before they begin to spread widely in the population. Among the new variants discovered in recent weeks is the Japanese variant (B.1.1.248) identified both through spread in the community and in their COVID-19 isolation facility. This viral mutant is nearly identical to the Brazilian (P.1) variant and carries similar mutations to the infamous United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and South Africa (B.1.351), but also has one mutation unique to its structure, further complicating the COVID-19 puzzle for Japan and the world.

In early January [2021], The National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan detected a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 in travelers arriving from Brazil a few days earlier. The new variant carried identical mutations to the spike protein as P.1, aside from one additional point mutation -- V1176F. Notably, B.1.1.248 carries the N501Y mutation, which is documented to increase the virus's transmissibility, and E484K, which increases the virus's resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Mutations to other proteins were not included in the published literature.

P.1 is a particularly nasty variant of SARS-CoV-2. It has reinfected people in Manaus, making them sick once again after infection earlier in the pandemic. It is also highly transmissible and reportedly resistant to antibodies from both vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies.

The unique point mutation V1176F is located in the 2nd heptad repeat of the virus. The heptad repeats form a helix structure centrally-located on the virus. These helical bundles are essential for the viral fusion of the virus to the human cell. A mutation to this region may increase the transmissibility of the virus by optimizing viral fusion, but further investigation is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

Japan's COVID-19 timeline mirrors that of the United States. In April and July [2020], there were spikes in infections. Late October [2020] through mid-January [2021] saw an explosion in cases, peaking around [9 Jan 2021]. Recent weeks have brought about much lower infection rates as the 3rd wave has seemingly passed, but a new, more transmissible and antibody-resistant variant could complicate progression.

The new variant has been detected in 93 cases throughout the country, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, but that number is likely higher due to unreported cases. Ideally, these cases would be isolated to prevent further spread, but only time will tell if B.1.1.248 creates more significant inroads in the country.

B.1.1.248 is but a short entry in a more extensive COVID-19 anthology. As we continue vaccination efforts worldwide, variants potentially resistant to vaccines are appearing in tandem, including the Japanese variant. B.1.351 has even recently been detected in the United States. Not to mention, there may be other point mutations that have similar or greater effects on antibody resistance yet to emerge.

In the past month, many countries have seen a deep decline in COVID-19 cases, like the United States and the United Kingdom, but elsewhere cases have plateaued or even slightly risen, like in India, likely due to these new variants. Whether a repercussion of vaccinations, increased natural immunity, luck, or a combination of these, we mustn't falter in our Covid-19 prevention efforts. These variants present a great risk.

As the influenza virus returns every year with a different strain, the same could be said for SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies developed from natural infection or administered via vaccine will not last forever. As they decay, the virus will find ways around our immune defenses. The front line of defense has to remain public health measures. Social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation must continue as the stalwart protections against a potential new wave.

[3] Comparison between SARS-CoV2 and influenza
Date: Tue 11 Feb 2021
Source: Forbes [edited]
https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/02/11/covid-19-could-end-up-like-the-flu-or-worse/


The more we learn about emergent variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the more obvious it becomes that we underestimated their potential impact on our lives. Between growing evidence of increased transmissibility, immune evasion, and possibly even lethality, I can now say with certainty what I could only speculate before. Right now these new variants are a serious cause for concern, and they could continue to be for many years to come.

The question, then, is no longer if SARS-CoV-2 will vary, but how -- and in this respect it bears resemblance to another notoriously harmful virus, influenza. One theory, based on years of intensive research done by evolutionary biologist Jesse Bloom and his collaborators, is that these viruses can evolve within and across multiple scales of time and space. Though evolution, at least in the popular imagination, is generally thought to be a large-scale endeavor occurring at the population level, the common prerogative of viruses to alter themselves endlessly is as present and feasible in an individual body as it is across their host species. Per this logic, the variations that arise over the course of someone's infection can be the same as those seen in the pandemic at large, achieving a striking degree of spatiotemporal coherence.

How can scientists possibly observe such a phenomenon? Though influenza and SARS-CoV-2 can mutate no matter the health or background of their host, immunocompromised individuals tend to develop longer-lasting infections that are easier to study. For them, what a healthy immune system can neutralize in a matter of days can take weeks or even months, giving the virus more breathing room to experiment with the very slight alterations -- sometimes as miniscule as a single amino acid -- that might improve its fitness. When researchers cross-referenced these changes with those in variants either already dominant or on the verge of it, they found a remarkable amount of overlap--hence the term "parallel mutations," a phrase that captures the fact that the same mutations developed independently of one another.

One such study [https://elifesciences.org/articles/26875], published in 2017, examined 4 immunosuppressed cancer patients who developed very persistent and severe cases of the flu from 2006 to 2007 (Figure 1). For several months researchers obtained weekly samples of influenza virus that they sequenced, analyzed for mutations, and compared to one another. Notably, besides having a common foe in cancer and influenza, the patients were quite different -- diverging in age, gender, pre-existing health conditions, and duration of infection. Patient W, for instance, was a woman in the 25 to 44 age group who was being treated for Hodgkin's Disease, a type of lymphoma, prior to catching the flu and died 80 days after her first sample. Meanwhile Patient Y, a man in the 45 to 65 age group with leukemia, tested positive for cytomegalovirus and cold-causing coronavirus over the course of his infection but eventually recovered.

Two major findings came of this study. First, the researchers were able to identify several mutations that developed in two or more patients in parallel . While these mutations appeared across nine different sites in the influenza genome, five of those sites were located on hemagglutinin, a surface protein critical to the virus for both binding and fusion purposes. Second, variation in four of these 5 hemagglutinin sites was also prevalent in influenza strains circulating globally, with 2 mutations in particular -- V223I and N225D -- reaching high frequency in the decade after the study participants were first infected.

Today we see the same parallels arising between immunocompromised COVID-19 patients and the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. In May 2020, a man living in London -- I'll refer to him as the London patient -- was hospitalized and diagnosed with COVID-19. He recovered and went home, only to be readmitted the following month when his symptoms came back with a vengeance. This time he was administered, at distinct yet overlapping intervals, a plurality of treatments, including the steroid dexamethasone; 2 rounds of remdesivir, an experimental drug therapy; and convalescent plasma, a highly potent preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, from not one, not 2, but 3 different patients. Like half of the influenza study participants, he was being treated for lymphoma prior to his diagnosis.

Over the course of the London patient's 2nd hospitalization, which lasted more than 100 days, researchers extracted, sequenced, and analyzed more than 20 different viral samples, a process they describe in a research paper [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.05.20241927v3] currently undergoing peer review (Figure 4). They were able to observe the evolution of the virus in real time, watching as some amino acid changes came about in competition with others, then became fixed. One example is the H69-70 deletion in the N-terminal domain of the spike -- a surface protein comparable to hemagglutinin in function and significance -- which went on to become a defining feature of the B.1.1.7, or UK, variant.

The London patient is not the only evidence of parallel mutations in SARS-CoV-2. Another example is a 45-year-old, immunocompromised man in Boston who had COVID-19 for nearly 5 months. A case study of his infection, published mid-November in the New England Journal of Medicine [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2031364], revealed that the E484K mutation, the very same to appear in the B.1.351 variant originating in South Africa and the P.1 variant circulating in Brazil, was detected in his viral samples. So was N501Y, yet another substitution in the spike protein most prominent for its likely role in increasing the transmissibility of the UK variant. A research paper published in Science early this month [February 2021; https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/02/02/science.abf6950] added a 3rd precedent to the list, a cancer patient in Pittsburgh who had COVID-19 for at least 74 days before passing away. They, too, were immunocompromised -- and they, too, had SARS-CoV-2 replicating inside them that sported mutations found in the UK and South Africa variants.

Recall that researchers began following the case of the London patient when he was readmitted to the hospital in June of last year [2020]. The world didn't catch wind of the UK and South Africa variants until a full 6 months later --meaning that the surface protein mutations researchers identified in this single patient anticipated those to come globally. Sound familiar? That's because the same sentence could be used to describe the outcomes of the 2017 influenza study. The similarities don't end there, either. The variation mapping technique that first established the E484K mutation could reduce the neutralizing power of convalescent sera up to tenfold was also used on hemagglutinin back in 2019. That data pointed to a related but more general conclusion. Anti-flu antibodies recognize a portion of the surface protein so tiny, a single amino acid change is all it takes for the virus to evade the defensive attacks mounted by convalescent sera.

Is it the case that mutations don't just arise in parallel within immunocompromised hosts and across global populations, but that the former originate the latter? We can't be sure. What is almost certain, however, is that the evolutionary pathways traversed by SARS-CoV-2 are too close to influenza for comfort. We know that nonlethal human coronaviruses occur seasonally like the flu, each time in a new guise. Partially immunized populations, it seems, buffer these viruses much in the same way that a weakened immune system bolstered by sera does -- the flipside of introducing new measures against contagion or disease being an increase in pressure on the virus to surmount those same defenses. We may think we have a grasp on the direction SARS-CoV-2 is headed in -- predicting it will become less lethal or capable of causing serious disease, akin to a common cold -- but allowing optimism to cloud our judgment only sets us up to be blindsided by more unpleasant surprises further down the line. At this point this virus has proven itself so flexible and wily, to think it might cease to change and conveniently fade into the background isn't just optimistic, but naive.

Influenza has caused 5 pandemics in the past 100 years and continues to kill tens of thousands of people annually -- and it isn't nearly as lethal as COVID-19. If we don't strengthen our efforts to contain this disease considerably, taking a line of attack aimed at not just eliminating the virus, but averting its evolution into more dangerous forms, we can expect it to mirror influenza in this respect, too -- continuing year after year to add to the toll on human life that is already too great to bear. Analysis of persistent infections in immunocompromised patients gives us valuable insights we can use to improve our drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines, which is why my next article in this series will take a closer look at the patients from Boston and Pittsburgh.

Random variation is an essential component of all living things. It drives diversity, and it is why there are so many different species. Viruses are no exception. Most viruses are experts at changing genomes to adapt to their environment. We now have evidence that the virus that causes COVID, SARS-CoV-2, not only changes, but changes in ways that are significant.

[As the COVID19 pandemic continues into 2021, the interventional strategies mainly vaccination of populations and the resulting evolutionary pressure on the virus will be important to track. WHO released the COVID-19 Strategic Pandemic Response Plan (SPRP) for 2021 [https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/3rd-edl-submissions/who_sprp-2021final18022021.pdf] which states quite aptly, "As we enter 2021, it is again important that we take stock of the evolving epidemiological situation around the world, including the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, review the lessons learned about the virus and our response, identify the gaps in our knowledge while anticipating the potential challenges ahead, and ensure a gender-responsive and equitable response based on a respect for human rights. We must adapt our strategic approach to COVID-19 at national and global levels to plan and support the rapid and equitable deployment of new tools such as rapid diagnostics and vaccines.

COVID-19 will not be the last health threat or emergency -- many countries have already been forced to manage concomitant crises. The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder that the costs of effective preparedness are dwarfed by the costs of a failure to prepare. The world now has an opportunity to build on progress made in 2020 and move towards a sustainable future of emergency preparedness and readiness built on a foundation of strong and resilient health systems."

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (76 905), Brazil (65 387), and France (31 519) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 429 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 23 Feb 2021 to late 24 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, India (17 106), Italy (16 402), Czech Republic (15 861), Poland (12 147), Russia (11 749), and Germany (10 774). A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 28 of the 53 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 1.02%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 15.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 11.5% decrease in daily reported cases and a 26.3% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Similar to previous assessments, the global daily reported cases totalled over 440 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 113.08 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.50 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. And 7 day average daily newly confirmed cases and deaths are dropping from previous days calculations suggesting there may be a leveling off in improvements seen. - Mod.UBA]
