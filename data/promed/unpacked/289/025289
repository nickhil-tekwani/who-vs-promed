Badger vaccine project generates 'delight'
------------------------------------------
The UK's 1st independent badger vaccination project has proved that
the technique is "viable and affordable," according to the charity
running it. The Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust vaccinated 35 badgers
during the summer against the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB)
in cattle.

The government wants to fight cattle TB in England through culling,
but animal groups see vaccination as preferable. The trial did not
look for any impact on disease in badgers or cattle. Instead, the idea
was to see how feasible it would be to train staff and vaccinate the
animals, and how much it might cost.

"We are delighted with the results (which prove) that there is an
affordable alternative to the proposed cull," said Gordon McGlone, the
trust's chief executive. Bovine TB is a big problem, but local culling
of one of our much-loved native animals is not the answer. Scientists
have spent the last 12 years investigating whether killing badgers
will halt this serious disease in cattle, and the answer they are
getting is that it could well make the problem worse."

The UK's so-called "Krebs Trial," the largest investigation of badger
culling undertaken in any country, found that culling can reduce the
incidence of bovine TB in the target area. But if it is not done
thoroughly and consistently over a large area, it can actually
increase the disease burden, as badgers roam further from their setts
when others die, taking bacteria to other farms. Conservation groups
argue that vaccination does not carry this risk.

But the Gloucestershire experience suggests it might be more expensive
than culling, with the wildlife trust reporting an average cost of BP
51 per hectare. The true cost of culling will not be known unless and
until it happens, but farmers' leaders believe it may be in the region
of BP 20 per hectare.

The Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust hopes it will never happen. They,
and other conservation groups, argue that a combination of tighter
restrictions on farmers and vaccination will be more effective, and
that in any case, badgers should not be killed as a matter of
principle.

The National Trust has also begun an implementation trial, at its
property at Killerton in Devon. Other wildlife trusts are expected to
begin similar projects now that the Gloucestershire group has reported
its positive experience.

The UK government, meanwhile, is midway through a 2nd consultation
period on its culling proposals for England. It is not against
vaccination, but believes the approach will have much more success
when an edible formulation becomes available to supplant the existing
injectable dose, which could take another 4 to 5 years.

In Wales, plans are on hold following the election in May 2011 of a
Labour government.
