[Since 2005, Honduras has reported Newcastle
Disease previously twice, in 2007 and 2009. This
particular outbreak involves backyard birds as
was the case in 2007. In 2009, the outbreak
affected more than 11 000 birds in a commercial
layer setting. Other countries in Central America
have also reported the disease including Belize
with 15 outbreaks since 2005. Guatamala has
reported a suspicion of the disease but nothing
further in terms of confirmation. Mexico has reported 94 outbreaks.

The location of the outbreak can be seen from the
