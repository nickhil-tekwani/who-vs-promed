A person with suspected tick-borne encephalitis has been reported to Hastings Prince Edward Public Health (HPEPH) and is under investigation, the health unit said in a press release issued Fri 10 Jul [2015].

Tick-borne encephalitis is a rare infection that can cause fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures and memory loss. Long-term neurologic problems may occur. There is no specific treatment, and people with severe infection often need to be hospitalized to receive respiratory support, intravenous fluids, or medications to reduce swelling in the brain.

HPEPH conducts surveillance on ticks to determine whether a tick is a carrier of infectious diseases by means of tick dragging and tick collection. The information collected is then used to determine high-risk tick areas.

The best protection against tick-borne illness is to avoid tick bites. Tick-borne encephalitis can be transmitted in about 15 minutes.

Public health is asking those who find a tick attached to them to bring it in to one of the public health offices in Belleville, Picton, Trenton or Bancroft. It says that the ticks are tested only for surveillance purposes. This test will not be useful to determine whether or not a person has been exposed to [tick-borne] diseases.

Public Health also advises people to do the following to protect themselves from tick bites:

- Avoid areas with a known high concentration of ticks. Ticks live in humid environments, including wooded and bushy areas with high grass and a bed of leaf litter. To avoid ticks, walk in the centre of the trails, and avoid tall shrubs.

- Wear protective clothing: light-coloured clothing, long-sleeved shirts and pants, closed-toe shoes and socks pulled over pant legs.

- Use insect repellent containing DEET (active ingredient to keep bugs away) or Icaridin. Spray this on your skin as well as on your clothing. Always read and follow label directions.

- Perform daily tick checks

- Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, even in your own yard.

- Use a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of your body.

- Parents should check their children for ticks under the arms, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, behind the knees, between the legs, around the waist, and especially in their hair.

- Examine your gear and pets. Ticks can ride into the home on clothing and pets then attach to a person later. Placing clothes in a dryer on high heat effectively kills ticks.

- Remove ticks from your body

- Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it.

- Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick by the head as close to your skin as possible. Pull it straight out, gently but firmly.

- Clean the bite area using soap and water or a disinfectant.

- If the tick has been attached for more than 36 hours or you begin to experience symptoms as noted above, you should seek medical advice.

[Although Powassan [POW] virus was 1st isolated from a child who died of the infection in Ontario in 1958, there have been no ProMED-mail posts of human infections in that province until now.

The USA CDC states: "POW virus is maintained in a cycle between ticks and small-to-medium-sized rodents. In North America, 3 main enzootic cycles occur: _Ixodes cookei_ and woodchucks, _xodes marxi_ and squirrels, and _Ixodes scapularis_ and white-footed mice. _Ixodes cookei_ and _Ixodes marxi_ rarely bite humans. _Ixodes scapularis_ often bite humans and is the primary vector of Lyme disease. There are 2 types of POW virus in the United States. The 1st type, often called lineage 1 POW virus, appears to be associated with _Ixodes cookei_ or _Ixodes marxi_ ticks. The other type, lineage 2 POW virus is sometimes called Deer tick virus, and is associated with _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks. Both lineages have been linked to human disease." (http://www.cdc.gov/powassan/transmission.html).

The precautions given in the report above are worth considering, as with spring temperature increases in the north central and northeastern states in the USA and the southeastern Canadian provinces, the risk of exposure to Powassan viruses increases. These areas have had heavy snow cover during the winter just ended, further increasing vector tick survival and the risk of Powassan virus infection. Avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure that can be taken.

Mod.CP noted: "According to the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses), Powassan virus (POWV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_. Specifically, it belongs to the mammalian group of tick-borne flaviviruses and is closely related to Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Human cases of POWV infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada, and Russia. In the United States, cases of POWV disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region." (See ProMED-mail archive no. 20131226.2137895).
