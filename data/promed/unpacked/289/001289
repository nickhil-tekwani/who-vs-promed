In the Cholul commissariat [administrative division], 32 people are receiving treatment against rabies [post-exposure treatment] after 3 dogs contracted the disease in the area, reported health authorities

For the past 15 days the Secretariat of Health has maintained an epidemiological barrier 15 km [9 mi] around the Cholul commissariat. Alvaro Quijano Vivas, state secretary of health, stated yesterday [27 Feb 2012] that the epidemiological barrier in the Sitpach and Cholul area was established due to the 3 dogs that were rabies positive.

To avoid people in contact with the dogs getting infected, anti-rabies [post-exposure] treatment is being given to 32 inhabitants of the area [who presumably were in physical contact with the dogs].

Quijano Vivas indicated that no rabies cases in dogs or cats have been registered for the past 3 years. "The important thing is that no cases have occurred in people, and moreover, measures [to control?] movement have been carried out in time."

Also, he announced that on 11-17 Mar [2012], the National Anti-Rabies Vaccination Week for Dogs and Cats will be carried out with the slogan, "Have you already vaccinated [your pets] against rabies? They are part of your family and their protection is your responsibility."

Daly Gabino Martinez Ortiz, state zoonoses coordinator, stated that rabies [virus] is commonly transmitted by hematophagous bats [vampires, usually _Desmodus rotundus_] to street [unowned or stray] dogs by bite. [Subtyping of rabies virus isolates from bats and dogs would be required to establish that chain of transmission. - Mod.TY]

During the 1st week of the National Anti-rabies Vaccination Week for Dogs and Cats in Yucatan, 312 580 doses will be administered to these animals.

[Rabies virus is endemic in Mexico. So far this year (2012), rabies cases have involved cattle and equine animals, with virus transmission having occurred through vampire bat bites. In May 2011, there was a canine rabies outbreak in Hidalgo state [see ProMED-mail archive no 20110508.1420].

The report above is a good indication of the need for owners of mammalian pets to maintain regular rabies vaccinations for the well being of their owners and of the pets themselves. This requires constant public education, and practicing veterinarians can play an important role in reminding dog and cat owners (and livestock owners, too) of the need to maintain ongoing immunity.
