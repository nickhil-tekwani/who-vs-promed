This formal report to Paris confirms the pathogen as _Bacillus anthracis_. Subsequent to the events in the 1st report the veterinary service visited the suspect farm and sampled the bloody soil around where the animal was butchered. A wise decision. They have yet to discover how that cow got infected. I am optimistic that they will succeed.

With thanks to my colleague Cristina for extracting this information from the OIE report. - Mod.MHJ
