Mosquito-borne disease kills woman on N.C. Outer Banks
------------------------------------------------------
KILL DEVIL HILLS -- An Outer Banks native died during Friday evening of
complications from Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a serious disease
usually contracted through mosquito bites. The patient, a 48-year-old real
estate agent, died at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. Further information
about her death was not available, and results of tests to determine how
she contracted the virus are expected within a few days.
Dare County Public Relations Coordinator, Dorothy Toolan, stated that she
couldn't recall another case of EEE in the area. Toolan said, "I really
feel for the family. We are trying to do all we can to make sure mosquitoes
aren't as present as they have been since hurricane Floyd. Rain has caused
the mosquito population to increase, and three additional spraying machines
were brought to the area on Saturday".
Although the death has not been attributed officially to a mosquito bite,
EEE is a rare disease spread to horses and humans by infected mosquitoes.
The disease affects the central nervous system, though most people have no
symptoms. About half of those exhibiting symptoms may die eventually. The
others experience a mild flu-like illness with fever, headache and sore
throat. Toolan urged Dare County residents to try to stay indoors between
dusk and dark. If going outside cannot be avoided, people should use insect
repellent and wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts.

[It is unclear from the report when and how the diagnosis was established.
It is also unclear what tests are being carried out to determine how the
deceased contracted the infection. Eastern equine encephalitis virus is
maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle involving birds and a mosquito
vector. Equine epizootics are not uncommon along the East coast in summer,
and small sporadic outbreaks of human disease may occur. This fatality in
North Carolina may be an isolated occurrence or the fore-runner of a local
outbreak. An EEE virus vaccine is not available for general use and
protection of the population depends on efficient measures of vector
control. - Mod.CP
