There are already 252 persons affected by the outbreak of acute gastroenteritis that last week [week of 8 May 2017] ravaged the Hospital of Bellvitge, in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat [Catalonia]. The Public Health Agency of Catalonia (ASPCAT) has reported the increase in the number of victims, which last Fri 12 May 2017, had been set at 190, all workers at the health center.

In all cases the symptomatology has been mild so, despite the high number of affected persons, the outbreak has had no healthcare consequences; that is to say, the hospital has not had to reprogram surgeries or close operating rooms, always according to the governmental organism.

The department has also indicated that the analysis of samples is ongoing but that, so far, 2 of them have been positive for norovirus, the reason why this pathogen is suspected to be the cause of the massive infection.

Although the information is still preliminary, it also seems to confirm that the source of the infection would be none other than the sandwiches served in the cafeteria for hospital staff between Tue 9 and Thu 11 May 2017.

[Only 2 cases appear to have been diagnosed as norovirus-related but at this point, it is reasonable to attribute this prominently sized outbreak to this virus. It is not stated if any patients were involved. - Mod.LL
