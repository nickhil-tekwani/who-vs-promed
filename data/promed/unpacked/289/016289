The NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) division of ZVO [Western Military District] has been put into operation for the eradication of the foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] outbreak in the Vladimir oblast.

On [Saturday], 22 Oct 2016, a group of soldiers arrived in the area of the territory Sobinsky agricultural plant "VKV" for the processing and incineration of animal carcasses.

The focus of the outbreak has been successfully isolated. According to TASS, the outbreak involves about 1000 cows potentially infected or at immediate risk.

[The 1st part of this media report quotes the Federal News Agency's report on the deployment of the army unit, as presented in item 1 above].

In line with a decree by the Governor, the territory of the village Vyshmanovo, Sobinsk district, has been put under strict quarantine and fully equipped security posts are operational around the clock.

Signs of FMD were detected in 120 cows. The Ministry of Emergency Situations in the Vladimir oblast reported that a state of high alert has been declared in 5 districts of the oblast. The focus of the disease is secluded, preventing the disease from spreading. Vaccination of cattle has been completed. According to TASS, the region is also forbidden to sell unpasteurized milk.

[Clearly, the authorities have undertaken drastic measures to control this enigmatic outbreak. As reported above, this included the deployment of the army's professional NBC unit to speed up the culling, incineration and disinfection activities.

The last outbreak caused by FMDV serotype Asia 1 took place in Russia in January 2006. This occurred in the far east, more than 5000 km [3100 miles] away from the current event. The current outbreak is also very distant from Asian countries currently known as Asia-1 endemic.

Most of Russia's territory has been recognised by the OIE, since 2015, as FMD-free without vaccination. The zone in which routine vaccinations are being continued stretches along Russia's southern borders (map at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/map/A_Russia.jpg). The multi-valent vaccine, applied there, includes FMDV serotype Asia 1.

The village in which the affected dairy farm is situated, is about 14 km [about 9 miles] distant from Russia's federal FMD laboratory (FGBI ARRIAH), where the diagnosis was performed and, notably, where vaccines are produced and tested (map at http://tinyurl.com/h7n8wme).

Results of the isolate's genotyping and of the epidemiological investigations are anticipated with great interest. In case a vaccine strain is involved, the application of (the homologous) vaccine is expected to be highly protective. - Mod.AS
