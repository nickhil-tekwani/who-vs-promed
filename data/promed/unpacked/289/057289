You can read the full text of the account of the spa-related cluster of
hepatitis A cases in the most recent Communicable Diseases Intelligence,
Vol 21, Number 23, 25 December 1997 - An outbreak of hepatitis A associated
with a spa pool (by Graham Tallis and Joy Gregory) at the following site:
<http://www.health.gov.au/pubs/cdi/cdicur.htm>.
The epidemic curve of known related cases suggests that the index case did
indeed infect the others.

[The original posting said: "Health authorities are warning people to take
care in spas after seven Melbourne boys caught hepatitis A in a domestic
spa hot tub." That threw me off a bit and stimulated me to ask for more
information; I wondered where the index case was. I checked out the web
site address kindly sent by Mark Veitch. The report indicates that seven
boys became ill (one the night of the spa party and six a month or more
after that). Thus, six (not seven) boys caught the virus in the spa; one
(the index case) already was infected when he entered the spa. - Mod.CHC
