[The following perceptive comment from a correspondent relates to the
subject of ProMED-mail post Influenza, prison - USA: (CA)

Influenza, prison - USA: (CA), related information
--------------------------------------------------
There is a current health advisory in the USA to vaccinate against
influenza, anyone colonized, or infected with current or past MRSA
(methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_). In addition, MRSA
has become common among IV drug abusers who are likely to compose a
fair proportion of the prison population in California prisons. I
will be surprised if MRSA is not a complicating factor in the
severity of illness in this influenza outbreak.

I suggest it is time for prisons to start providing inmates with
influenza vaccinations and education about the increased risk for
influenza complications with MRSA.

"Abstract
---------
Infections, in particular soft tissue infections (cellulitis, skin
abscesses), are the leading cause for emergency department visits and
hospital admissions of drug injection users (IDUs).

_Staphylococcus aureus_ is the most relevant bacterial pathogen in
this population. It is the main cause of soft tissue infections and
of severe infections such as endocarditis and bacteremia. Moreover,
epidemic spread of methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) among
IDUs has occurred in Europe and North America. Nasal carriage of _S.
aureus_ is associated with an increased risk of subsequent _S.
aureus_ infections, and it has been shown that active IDUs have a
higher rate of colonization with _S. aureus_ than the general
population. However, it is still unknown why an individual carries
_S. aureus_. In particular, repeated injections do not appear to be
the main predisposing factor for _S. aureus_ carriage."
