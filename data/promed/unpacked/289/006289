Tickborne illness on rise in area
----------------------------------
Massachusetts state health officials and local physicians are warning of a
sharp rise in the number of cases of a tickborne illness that has sickened
73 Berkshire County residents so far in 2003. The illness, ehrlichiosis, is
caused by bacteria carried by the deer tick and transmitted to humans via
tick bites. It is not contagious among people, but can be serious or even
fatal in some cases if not treated. The disease causes flu-like symptoms
very similar to the more prevalent Lyme disease.

"We started seeing this about 4 years ago," said Dr Jon M Valigorsky, a
pathologist at Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, MA. While he at
first diagnosed only a smattering of ehrlichiosis cases in his laboratory,
this summer he saw a dramatic spike in local cases.

Valigorsky said he has spread the word about the illness to physicians so
they will be on the lookout and test patients who may have it. "It's
entirely treatable," he explained. The bacteria respond well to
tetracyclines, a class of antibiotics.

One Pittsfield woman was diagnosed recently with the disease and recounted
her experience. She said she was bitten by a tick in a nearby Connecticut
town, and about 10 days later, "started to feel really tired, with a
constant headache." It was during a stretch of rainy days, she said, so she
blamed it on the weather. But when she began waking up nauseated each
morning, lost her appetite, and dropped 5 pounds in a week, she worried
that she might have Lyme disease and got a blood test. While the Lyme test
was negative, she was positive for ehrlichiosis, and was treated with
antimicrobials. "I started feeling better within a couple of days," said
the woman.

Another local resident said that his wife, who has diabetes, began feeling
achy, along with joint pains and a fever. She was quickly admitted to the
hospital, but at first, according to her husband, "They couldn't find
anything at all." It wasn't until 5 days after her admission that she was
diagnosed with ehrlichiosis. The woman is home, but her husband said, "It's
a slow, slow recovery."

The variety of ehrlichiosis that is affecting the Berkshires is called
human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), and was first recognized in 1993.
The extent of illness can vary widely for someone infected with HGE, from
no symptoms at all to severe symptoms that can cause death. Typical
symptoms are sudden onset of fever, muscle aches, headache, and malaise.
Less common symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
anorexia, joint pain, confusion, or a rash.

According to Dr Bela Matyas, medical director of epidemiology for the state
Department of Public Health, the increase in reported ehrlichiosis
"reflects that there's a lot more attention being paid" by doctors to
looking for the disease. In February 2003, the illness became "reportable"
to state health officials, meaning that doctors are required to report
cases so that the state can track them. Before, reporting was voluntary,
and physicians weren't necessarily aware of the illness or looking for it.
For that reason, the increase in reported cases must be highly qualified,
noted Matyas.

The state is investigating 73 probable or suspected cases of ehrlichiosis
in Berkshire County. State figures include only Massachusetts residents,
and a count of local cases that includes patients from nearby New York or
Connecticut towns who see Berkshire doctors would likely be higher.

For 2002, the state had 5 probable or suspected cases in the Berkshires,
compared with 113 statewide. The previous year there were no Berkshire
cases, and 25 probable or suspected cases statewide. By comparison, there
were 69 confirmed Lyme disease cases in 2002 in the Berkshires, with 1789
statewide. In 2001, the numbers were 50 in Berkshire County and 1193 statewide.

[_Ehrlichia phagocytophilia_ (or _E. equi_-like agent), which causes
erlichiosis, is indeed spread by ticks of the genus _Ixodes_, which also
transmit the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis and babesiosis (a
protozoan intraerythrocytic infection). The symptoms and laboratory
abnormalities are similar to the monocytic form due to _E. chaffensis_.
This organism is also tickborne but usually spread by _Dermacentor
variabilis_ and _Amblyomma americanum_. The increase in cases in 2003 is
likely to be primarily related to increased recognition and reporting, as
noted in the article. - Mod.LL]
