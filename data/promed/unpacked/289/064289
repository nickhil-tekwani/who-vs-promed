Tests on Deceased Vietnamese Prove Negative for Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
Tests performed on a patient suspected to have type A H5N1 avian
influenza proved negative, the Ho Chi Minh City-based Tropical
Diseases Hospital stated on Sat 16 Sep 2006. The 30-year-old patient,
whose name and sex were not released, died on Thu 14 Sep 2006 after
being hospitalized with bird-flu like symptoms, such as high fever
and cough. But the tests confirmed he had not died of bird flu, a
hospital official said.
In similar cases, the hospital had admitted in July and August 2006 2
other patients suspected to have the deadly disease but who tested
negative later. At a meeting in Hanoi on Fri 15 Sep 2006, an official
from the International Federation of the Red Cross hailed Viet Nam's
progress in bird flu control, saying the country had set an exemplary
model for other countries to follow.
Viet Nam has to date reported 93 bird flu cases, but no new human
cases have been found since mid-November 2005.

[This report, although negative in context, is important in that it
highlights the success of the Vietnamese authorities in controlling
avian influenza infection in the human population of Viet Nam. There
have been no confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in the
country since mid-November 2005, when Viet Nam led the world with a
total of 42 deaths attributable to H5N1 influenza. - Mod.CP]
