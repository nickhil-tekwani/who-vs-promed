Could someone familiar with the fatal H5N1 Hong Kong patients tell us
whether influenzavirus was isolated from organs outside the respiratory
tract, such a liver, muscle, brain?
I believe that some avian strains of influenzavirus A are capable of wide
non-respiratory organ replication. Did this occur in these patients and
could that have accounted for the lethality of the virus?

[Malik Peiris, University of Hong Kong was kind enough to provide us with
the following appropriate information. - Mod.CHC]
Dr Paul Chan and colleagues at the Chinese University of Hong Kong have
looked at post mortem (PM) material from 3 patients - two had full PMs and
one a limited PM. They failed to detect influenza A virus outside the
respiratory tract (lymph nodes, liver, spleen, GI tract, brain) using
immuno-histology, by virus culture and in one case by PCR. It must be said
that 2 of these patients (who had full post-mortems) died after many weeks
on ventilators, and long after disease onset. By the time they died they
were culture negative from the respiratory tract as well. The only patient
from whom PM tissue was available relatively early in the course of the
disease had a limited PM and though lung was available (and was virus
positive), other tissues were not available for study. So, although further
studies are ongoing, the jury is still out on the issue of whether H5N1
disseminates outside the respiratory tract in human disease.
It is certainly true that in chickens, H5N1 is a disseminated disease.
