Four people in the east Malaysian state of Sarawak have been confirmed to
be infected [sic with the pig-borne Nipah virus that killed 105 people
between 1998 and 1999, officials said Wednesday. State health director Yao
Sik Chi, quoted by the official Bernama news agency, said the 4 were from
the Sibu area. He said that 2 worked at a quarantined pig farm and the
other 2 at an abattoir. They had tested positive for the Nipah virus [sic
in the course of blood tests on 160 people and would be referred to
hospital for further examination.
"At the time when their blood was taken, they were all healthy," he said.
Yao said the department was currently collecting blood samples from farm
workers and family members at eight newly-quarantined pig farms.
David Teng, state public health assistant minister, said that as of Monday
15 pig farms in Sarawak were quarantined pending the result of blood tests
conducted in Australia.
In peninsular Malaysia more than 1700 pigs were slaughtered recently after
some were found to be infected, but there have been no reports of human
infections.

[It does not take great sophistication to recognize that antibody to Nipah
virus is what one wants, it is not a sign of illness, or of current disease
or infectivity. There is a huge difference between "be infected" (the
wording of the report) and "have been infected" (my words). Let me put it
this way: You (the reader of this message) likely have antibody to the
polioviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, and more. Does that mean you are
now infected? Of course not. It means you likely are immune to infection
with these viruses. That probably is the situation in Malaysia. Finding
otherwise healthy people and pigs with antibody to Nipah virus no more
means these people and pigs are infected than finding a person with
antibody to West Nile virus in New York City means that person is currently
infected. This is Microbiology 101.
Another message to ProMED-mail indicated that newspaper reports that the
virus had re-emerged rattled many Malaysians, especially the Chinese
community, which consumes pork. What we have here is a lack of
communication, and information. Alternatively, if these four healthy people
seroconverted (from no antibody in the first blood collected to antibody in
the next blood collected, that would be a different story. - Mod. CHC
