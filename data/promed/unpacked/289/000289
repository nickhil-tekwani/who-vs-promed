WHO initiates enhanced global surveillance in response to acute respiratory
syndrome in China, Vietnam, and Hong Kong, special administrative region
(SAR) of China
--------------------------------------------------
In response to recent developments in southern China, Vietnam, and Hong
Kong, the World Health Organization (WHO) has initiated global surveillance
of cases with acute respiratory syndrome of unknown etiology (1) and
provided the following case definition for hospital based surveillance:
Suspect Case
A person presenting to a health care facility after 23 Feb 2003 with all of
the following:
(1) sudden onset of high fever (>38 degrees Celsius);
(2) myalgia;
(3) one or more respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of
breath, difficulty breathing)
AND one or more the following:
(1) history of travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, Special Administrative
Region of China, or Hanoi within 2 week of symptom onset,
(2) history of having cared for, having lived with, having had face-to-face
contact with, or having had contact with respiratory secretions of a
probable case.
Probable Case
(1) a suspect case with the following;
(2) chest x-ray findings of pneumonia or Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome
WHO asks for every suspect and probable case to be reported to national
Public Health authorities and then to WHO on a daily basis: fax (+41 22 791
1397) or email (<outbreak@who.int>).
Until further information on these episodes is available, WHO recommends
that any patient presenting with atypical pneumonia and possibly related to
these outbreaks be isolated and cared for using barrier nursing techniques.
On Tue 11 Feb 2003, WHO was notified by the Chinese Ministry of Health of
an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome in Guangdong Province (China)
(2). From 16 Nov 2002 until 9 Feb 2003, 305 cases, including 5 deaths were
reported in 6 of the municipalities of the province. The syndrome was
described as an atypical pneumonia, with non-specific symptoms, including
fever, headache, joint ache, and overall fatigue and weariness. 2 of the
cases were diagnosed with _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ infection, but no cause
has been confirmed in the other cases. Investigation of this outbreak
continues.
In late February 2003, a Hong Kong resident became ill with a pneumonic
illness shortly after arriving in Hanoi, Vietnam. He was initially cared
for in a hospital in Hanoi and was then evacuated to a hospital in Hong
Kong. Approximately 20 hospital staff involved in his care in Hanoi have
subsequently developed a similar illness. In Hong Kong, an outbreak of a
similar respiratory illness has occurred among hospital workers in another
hospital (not the hospital in which the Hong Kong resident from Hanoi was
cared for).
Despite intensive investigation, no cause for these outbreaks has so far
been determined other than the 2 cases of _C. pneumoniae_ infection in the
Guangdong outbreak. Influenza virus infection has not been demonstrated. No
clear epidemiological link between these 3 separate outbreaks has been
identified, nor any link with the earlier outbreak of influenza due to the
avian influenza A H5N1 in Hong Kong reported in February 2003 (3).
The signs and symptoms of the illness in Hanoi most commonly include an
initial influenza-like illness (rapid onset of high fever followed by
muscle aches, headache, and sore throat). In some cases, but not all, this
is followed by bilateral pneumonia and occasionally acute respiratory
distress requiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are
recovering but others remain critically ill. Laboratory findings may
include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and leucopenia (low white
cell count).
A Global Alert Response Network/WHO team is assisting with investigation,
clinical and laboratory management, and outbreak control in Hanoi. References:
