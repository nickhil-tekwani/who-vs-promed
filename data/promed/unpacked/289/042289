China Province Battles Rabies Outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------
A southern Chinese province's worst rabies epidemic in a decade has
prompted authorities to kill unvaccinated dogs and limit the animals'
movement between counties, the government said.
Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong, reported 244 cases of the
disease during 2004 -- an increase of 41 percent from 2003 -- the official
Xinhua News Agency said. Rabies has been reported in 8 cities in the
populous province, Xinhua said.
The provincial health bureau has ordered the killing of all dogs that have
not been vaccinated within a 1.5-mile radius of villages where rabies was
reported, and in counties where 2 or more cases have been reported, Xinhua
said.
Affected counties have also been banned from selling or transferring the
dogs that have been killed, and are not allowed to import dogs for one
year, Xinhua reported.
The report did not say whether there were reports of people affected by the
disease.
During 2004, Guangdong had more than 5 times the average annual number of
cases reported in 1995-2002, Xinhua said.
An increase in the number of unregistered dogs and fewer vaccinations have
contributed to the spread of the disease, Xinhua quoted the province's
Health Bureau as saying.

remark that the dog-raising in the Guangdong region is almost entirely for
meat and fur, and that the agricultural exemption is why the dogs are not
vaccinated. - Mod.AS]
