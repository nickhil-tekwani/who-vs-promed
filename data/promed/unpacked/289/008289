On 8 Jun 2006, an officer from BSES Ltd. collected suspect samples of
sugarcane found on a property near Childers, Queensland (400 km north
of Brisbane) showing symptoms of sugarcane smut. This was confirmed
on 12 Jun 2006 by the nominated reference diagnostician and is the
1st detection of this disease on the east coast of Australia.
As of 16 Jun 2006, multiple infected plants have been found in one
block of cane of the same property with another suspect plant in an
adjacent block, indicating some spread. The property remains
quarantined, with movements of host plants and machinery prohibited.
Surveillance is presently being coordinated by the Queensland
Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries to determine the
origin of the disease and to quickly identify further risk
properties. Surveys are in a 10-15 km radius around the infected
property and in other cane growing areas.
There is national coordinated response involving both government and
industry sectors to ensure this outbreak is bought quickly under
control. This includes the implementation of the sugar industry
contingency plan for this plant pest.
Canegrowers in Queensland and New South Wales have been alerted and
asked to immediately report any suspect sightings of the disease to
the Smut Hotline on 1800 303 310.
Smut was 1st detected in the Ord River area of Western Australia in
1997-98, but has been largely controlled through the replacement of
susceptible varieties with more resistant varieties. A small
proportion of the current Queensland production crop has any degree
of resistance to smut. The Queensland sugar industry is valued at 2
billion [?Australian vs. US dollars] and accounts for 95 percent of
the Australian crop.
Sugarcane smut is caused by the fungus _Ustilago scitaminea_ and is
characterized by the formation of black "whips" from the growing
point of the cane. Whips are formed in shoots developing from
infected cane cuttings and have a thin membrane which, when broken,
disperses many spores. Infected plants are usually stunted, and
individual stalks are thin with a grass-like appearance.
