[The WHO numbers look promising with no new reports of cases or deaths. But then there is an extended lockdown, a definite hardship for the population affected, and early closing of schools. Furthermore, in the report below, it appears the public health infrastructure is struggling with inadequate funding.

According to Helen Branswell, "Uganda's health ministry acknowledges only confirmed #Ebola cases, which does not tell the whole picture of this outbreak. Adding the 21 people with Ebola-like symptoms & epi links who died before testing began, the outbreak has now led to 157 cases & 74 deaths."

The numbers still don't add up exactly but are close. - Mod.LK]

[2] Ugandan schools

Uganda will close schools nationwide later this month [November 2022] after 23 Ebola cases were confirmed among pupils, including 8 children who died, the country's first lady said on Tuesday [8 Nov 2022].

Janet Museveni, who is also the education minister, said there had been cases in 5 schools in the capital Kampala, as well as the neighbouring Wakiso district and Mubende, the epicentre of the outbreak. She said the cabinet had agreed to close pre-primary, primary, and secondary schools from 25 Nov [2022], 2 weeks before the scheduled end of term.

"Closing schools earlier will reduce areas of concentration where children are in daily close contact with fellow children, teachers, and other staff who could potentially spread the virus," said the minister and wife of veteran President Yoweri Museveni.

On Saturday [5 Nov 2022], Uganda extended a 3-week lockdown on Mubende and neighbouring Kassanda, the 2 central districts at the heart of the outbreak that has claimed more than 50 lives.

The measures include a dusk-to-dawn curfew, a ban on personal travel, and the closure of markets, bars, and churches.

Since the outbreak was declared in Mubende on 20 Sep [2022], the disease has spread across the East African nation, including to the capital Kampala.

But the president has said nationwide curbs were not needed.

According to government figures dated 6 Nov [2022], a total of 53 people have died of Ebola out of 135 cases.

The World Health Organization (WHO) last week said Uganda had registered over 150 confirmed and probable cases, including 64 fatalities. Uganda's last recorded fatality from a previous Ebola outbreak was in 2019.

The strain now circulating is known as the Sudan Ebola virus, for which there is currently no vaccine, although there are several candidate vaccines heading towards clinical trials.

Ebola is spread through bodily fluids, with common symptoms being fever, vomiting, bleeding, and diarrhoea.

Outbreaks are difficult to contain, especially in urban environments.

Uganda is struggling to contain an Ebola outbreak that has already infected at least 156 people and killed 74, including in the capital Kampala.

The outbreak, first detected on 20 Sep [2022] in a small farming town in central Uganda, is caused by a relatively rare strain of the virus for which there are no proven vaccines or antiviral treatments. It has since spread to 8 districts throughout the East African country, including Kampala, a crowded city of around 5 million people, prompting warnings from the World Health Organization that neighboring countries should prepare for imported infections.

On Tuesday [8 Nov 2022], Uganda's education ministry said it would close schools on 25 Nov [2022], 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the school year. A day earlier [7 Nov 2022], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert to American health workers to be on the lookout for patients who have traveled to Uganda in the last 3 weeks and show possible symptoms of Ebola, such as fever, headache, fatigue, and unexpected bleeding. Last month [October 2022], the US restricted arrivals of travelers from Uganda to 5 airports where they undergo extra screening.

Ugandan health workers and local officials say efforts to contain the outbreak, now the 2nd-deadliest in the country's history, have been undermined by a lack of funding. The Ministry of Health faces a USD 13 million shortfall to equip hospitals, pay contact tracers and health workers, and counter rampant misinformation about the virus, Henry Kyobe Bosa, the ministry's Ebola incident manager, said last week. He said the ministry was working with donors to obtain extra funding: "What we have raised so far from our own resources is not enough."

Meanwhile, an appeal from the WHO to donors has received just USD 10 million out of a USD 68 million target.

The Ugandan government has placed 2 districts at the center of the outbreak under lockdown since mid-October [2022], closing down markets, public offices, and transport and telling people to stay home unless absolutely necessary. More than 2000 people identified as contacts of Ebola patients have been ordered into makeshift isolation facilities or told to self-isolate at home.

Christopher Kwefuga, a government councilor in the district of Mubende, where the outbreak was first identified, says locked-down residents have been left without support. Contacts of known patients aren't receiving the promised food deliveries, forcing some to venture out in breach of the rules, he said.

Ambulances supposed to transport patients and contacts routinely run out of fuel. One patient with Ebola-like symptoms waited more than 8 hours for an ambulance to take him to a hospital, Mr. Kwefuga said.

"People are helpless," Mr. Kwefuga said. "Many are bearing untold suffering in their homes, and there is no help from government."

On Monday [7 Nov 2022], 1500 trainee doctors across Uganda, including in the districts battling the outbreak, went on strike, saying they hadn't been paid in 3 months and lacked adequate protective gear. The Ugandan Medical Association said health workers directly involved in the Ebola response haven't been paid special risk allowances. At least 18 health workers have been infected in the outbreak, and 7 have died.

Elijah Okeyo, the head in Uganda of International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian agency, said inadequate funding has hampered the contact tracing, educational campaigns, and community engagement that were instrumental in containing past outbreaks.

"Cases of families exhuming buried Ebola victims for proper cultural burials and patients escaping health facilities all point to the gaps in risk communication, surveillance, and community engagement," said Mr. Okeyo.

In one case last month [October 2022], 43 people were infected after they exhumed the body of an Ebola victim in the district of Kasanda. Six of them have since died, according to the health ministry.

Emmanuel Ainebyoona, a spokesman for the health ministry, said the delayed payments to trainee doctors were due to bureaucratic holdups in the finance ministry and that salaries would be paid by the end of the week. "This is not the time for them to strike, when we have an Ebola outbreak," he said.

Mr. Ainebyoona added that the ministry was raising funds internally to address logistical shortfalls. "We are containing the situation," he said.

Natalie E. Brown, the US ambassador to Uganda, said last week that America had spent USD 22 million to help fight the outbreak but has routed funding to international agencies and nongovernmental organizations because of concerns over government corruption.

[4] mRNA vaccine
Date: Mon 7 Nov 2022

https://go.nature.com/3UHaVys


COVID-19 vaccines that rely on mRNA technology are credited with transforming humanity's fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The vaccines -- one made by drug giant Pfizer with German biotech firm BioNTech, another by US pharmaceutical company Moderna -- sped through clinical trials in just months and gained approval from major regulatory bodies less than a year after development began. Now, as Uganda battles a type of Ebola without proven vaccines, is an mRNA vaccine against the deadly virus on the cards? And would such a vaccine similarly transform the fight against Ebola?

There are 2 vaccines that are already proven to protect against Ebola: rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo), sold by Merck of Rahway, New Jersey, and Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo (Zabdeno/Mvabea), sold by Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, New Jersey. But the vaccines are thought to protect against only one species of the virus: Zaire ebolavirus, which caused a large epidemic in West Africa between 2013 and 2016. There are no proven vaccines against Sudan ebolavirus, the species responsible for the current outbreak in Uganda, which has so far caused 132 infections and 51 deaths.

"Public health in Africa would benefit from further options," says Heinz Feldmann, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' Laboratory of Virology in Hamilton, Montana, whose research contributed to the development of the existing Ebola vaccines.

It would be ideal to have a vaccine that confers protection against multiple filoviruses -- the family that includes Ebola virus and other pathogens that cause haemorrhagic diseases, such as Marburg virus -- rather than having many separate vaccines, says Alex Bukreyev, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. This would make vaccine distribution easier in poor and rural areas because costly new vaccination campaigns wouldn't be needed with every outbreak of a different Ebola species.

Both current Zaire ebolavirus vaccines use technology that relies on another active virus, which limits who can receive them. In most circumstances, Ervebo is approved for use only in people over 18 -- and its side effects can be unpleasant. Johnson & Johnson's regimen can be offered to people one year old and up, but it must be given in 2 doses, 8 weeks apart, which is not ideal in a rapidly growing outbreak, Bukreyev says.

mRNA vaccines could remedy some of these challenges, says Norbert Pardi, a vaccinologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who specializes in mRNA technology. Unlike many other delivery platforms, mRNA vaccines don't contain a virus. Rather, they use messenger RNA to encode key proteins that are found on the surface of a virus. When the mRNA enters a person's cells, the cells start to make the protein, which triggers an immune response against the virus.

It's easy to tweak the proteins that the mRNA encodes if a new species emerges, or to include different strands of mRNA to induce protection against multiple filoviruses at once. mRNA vaccines also have the benefit of "real-life evidence" of their safety and effectiveness when it comes to protecting against COVID-19: they have been administered to more than 5 billion people, Pardi says.

But COVID-19 and Ebola are very different diseases, Feldmann notes. The COVID-19 vaccines have been most effective in warding off severe infection and death, rather than preventing infection. This limitation is caused in part by how quickly immunity-evading variants have cropped up. It's crucial that any Ebola vaccines help to prevent infection -- as well as stopping severe disease -- to avoid onward transmission and contain the lethal pathogen quickly, he says.

Ebola viruses don't mutate nearly as fast as coronaviruses, so constant evolution of immune-evading variants is less of a concern, Pardi says. But it's not clear whether a single mRNA shot can provide robust protection against infection with Ebola, says Feldmann. And, like the current Zaire ebolavirus vaccines, mRNA vaccines must be stored in cold conditions, which can complicate distribution.

Answers might be coming soon, but probably not soon enough to help with the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Uganda. Moderna, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is close to securing a deal to develop an mRNA vaccine against Ebola and other filoviruses, according to news agency Bloomberg. But it's unclear which species Moderna hopes to target, or whether it wants to develop one vaccine against multiple species.

There is some research suggesting that the mRNA approach might work to tackle Ebola. In 2017, Bukreyev and his colleagues found (Ref 1) that 2 mRNA vaccine formulations produced immune responses in guinea pigs. None of the 10 inoculated animals died after they were infected with a guinea pig-adapted ebolavirus, whereas all 5 control animals died or were killed because of severe sickness within 10 days.

Bukreyev, who worked with Moderna on the study, says that if the deal goes through, it will probably take about 3 years of research in non-human primates to find out whether the vaccine is effective in the animals, and then human clinical trials will be needed.

Pardi hopes that Moderna and other firms will try the mRNA approach and seek protection against multiple species. "We don't know which Ebola virus will cause the next Ebola outbreak," he says.

[A broadly reacting filovirus vaccine would definitely be the best approach since it would preclude scrambling to get up to speed when the next outbreak occurs if it is neither Zaire nor Sudan. However, having such a vaccine will take years of work and clinical trials. In the meantime, we need to get the Sudan ebolavirus outbreak under control and maintain a strong public health infrastructure ready to meet the next challenge. - Mod.LK
