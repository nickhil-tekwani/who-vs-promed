>From 4 Jun to 10 Jun 2005, 10 new severe enterovirus infections were confirmed
in Taiwan, bringing the total number of cases to 60. Of these cases, 5 deaths
in children under 4 years of age have been reported; the latest case died on
31 May 2005. The case number and death toll of the disease from 1 Jan to 10
Jun 2005 are much higher than those within the same period of time last year
(2004), which were 14 cases with no deaths.
So far, all these cases are less than 5 years of age. This year's enterovirus
epidemic occurred predominantly in the Central Taiwan with 34 cases, followed
by Northern Taiwan (14), Southern Taiwan (11), and Eastern Taiwan (1)
respectively. The epidemic curve of reported severe enterovirus infections in
Central Taiwan and Northern Taiwan has been gradually descending; however, it
seems to be slightly rising in Southern Taiwan, according to our surveillance
data analysis.
Of these 60 confirmed cases in 2005 so far, at least 30 cases (50 percent)
were associated with enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections, which were lab-
confirmed either by virus isolation or neutralization antibody tests. Since
1998, Taiwan CDC has paid special attention to EV71 infections. The VP1 region
of this virus strain would be targeted and sequenced for routine EV
surveillance and viral genomic study. The major outbreak of EV71 infection in
1998 was caused mostly by subtype C EV71 (based on VP1 phylogenetic analysis,
ref: J Virol 1999, 73: 9969-9975). Almost all EV71 sequences in our lab from
1999 to 2003 were subtype B. However, in 2004 all EV71 strains in our lab were
subtype C. It is still subtype C for 2005 so far.
The sequences are very close among the isolates either from 2004 or 2005. Even
though all Taiwan EV71 isolates in 1998 and 2004/2005 belong to subtype C,
they are somehow different based on the sequence comparison. Either subtype B
or C will cause severe and sometimes even fatal cases in Taiwan. Rabbit anti-
EV71 (1998, subtype C) antiserum can neutralize either subtype B or C EV71,
including isolates from 2004.

[Dr. Wu's update on the current seasonal epidemic of hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD) is informative in that the Taiwan CDC has identified the
subtypes of EV71 that make up 50 percent of HFMD cases of the outbreak. ProMED
appreciates the report. In general, ProMED encourages transparent reporting by
health authorities throughout the world, so that any outbreak of infectious
diseases can be closely monitored, studied, and controlled by means of group
efforts within the global village.
Subtype C of EV71 is responsible for the current HFMD season and those of 2004
and 1978. The 1999-2003 outbreaks were attributed to Subtype B.
ProMED would like to know from our colleagues if there is any meaningful
difference in pathogenicity or case fatality rate (CFR) between the 2 subtypes
of EV71. - Mod.RY]
