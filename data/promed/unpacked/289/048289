Mystery Pig Deaths Spread Through 3 Provinces
---------------------------------------------
Animal health authorities are trying to learn what has killed nearly
200 pigs in 3 separate provinces. An unknown number of pigs have died
in the provinces of Battambang and Kampong Cham, while nearly 150
have perished in the southern province of Kampot.

Health officials said the disease appears to be bacterial, making an
outbreak of H1N1, sometimes called swine flu, unlikely.

On Monday [2 Aug 2010], officials began blood tests of pigs in
Kampot, where the latest and most severe outbreak has occurred.

"On Saturday [1 Aug 2010], we started the blood tests on 7 pigs," Kao
Phal, director of the animal health department of the Ministry of
Agriculture, said Monday [2 Aug 2010]. "But until now we do not know
exactly the disease that happened to the pigs is."

The animal health department is also appealing to farmers not to
transport any pigs from their farms to market for the rest of the
month of August [2010], he said.

[The report does not provide any clinical, pathological or
epidemiological data upon which speculation on the possible etiology
or etiologies of the condition could be made. Even the indication
that a bacterial agent is involved is lacking a satisfactory explanation.

Such data, and particularly results of the laboratory tests will be
useful. - Mod.AS]
