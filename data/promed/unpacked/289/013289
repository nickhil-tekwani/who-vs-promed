Authorities in Spain have detected bluetongue in cattle in 47 farms
in the southern region of Andalusia, a regional government official
said Friday [31 Aug 2007].
The councilor in charge of agriculture in Andalusia's regional
government, Isaias Perez Saldana, told a news conference the disease
could spread to the southwestern region of Extremadura and the
central region of Castile-La Mancha.
Rules restricting the movement of livestock in the affected farms, as
well as in farms found within a 20 km (12 mi) radius, would be
"rigorously applied," he said.
Bluetongue affects ruminants -- animals such as cows and sheep, which
chew the cud -- but not humans.
It is transmitted by insects and causes high fevers, mouth ulcers,
swollen heads, and turns the tongue of an infected animal blue.
The disease has hit livestock in The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium,
and northern France in the past year after previously being confined
to countries on the Mediterranean basin.

Spain's follow-up report no. 1 to the OIE (World Organization for
Animal Health), dated 29 Aug 2007, notifies 2 outbreaks in Andalusia,
in the provinces of Huelva (24 Jul 2007) and Malaga (14 Aug 2007).
Out of total susceptible population of 1753 sheep, 213 goats, and 21
cattle, 58 sheep were reportedly affected of which 7 died and 3 were
destroyed. No cases were seen in the goats or the cattle. The
serotype involved was reported to be BTV-1, a new serotype in Spain
(recorded for the 1st time in July 2007). The full report, including
a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6054>.
The current media-derived information, according to which 47 cattle
farms have been affected, should be regarded as suspect until
officially confirmed or otherwise. In particular, it is important to
note if clinical disease has been observed in the bovines or just
seropositives. In previous years (2004, 2005, and 2006), bluetongue
in Spain was caused by BTV-4. The disease involved mainly sheep. - Mod.AS]
