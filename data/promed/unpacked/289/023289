A rare infectious skin disease is popping up in North Texas, and
there is no cure. It's called Leishmaniasis, or "Baghdad Boils" by
the troops serving overseas. The disease is found in South America,
Mexico, and the Middle East. But now, it has made an appearance
locally. The 9 cases found in North Texas over the past 18 months did
not originate in the Middle East. The particular strain that doctors
are finding is called [_Leishmania] mexicana_, and it originated here.
Dr. Doug Hardy, an infectious disease specialist at UT (University of
Texas) Southwestern, described the disease. "They can look kind of
like an abscess, but they're not really an abscess. They can look
like an ulcer," he explained. "It might look kind of wet, but it
doesn't really drain. It's a little parasite, and it doesn't respond
to antibiotics. It doesn't respond to the standard treatments that we
might use on a fungal skin infection."
The disease is typically transmitted by infected biting sand flies,
not human-to-human. Although there is no cure, the boils will go away
by themselves within 6 to 12 months. According to Hardy, there is not
a cure in the United States because the disease had not been prevalent here.

[_Leishmania_ is a single cell protozoan parasite. _Leishmania
mexicana_ has been described from Texas before (Nelson et al. J Am
Acad Dermatol 1985; b12: 985-92). The reservoir is small rodents and
the infection is transmitted by the _Lutzomyia_ fly. It is not true
that there is no treatment. Pentavalent antimony drugs are usually
effective and amphotericin B is an alternative. Documentation for the
new, oral drug for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, miltefosin,
in mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is limited and one drug failure has
been reported (Calvopina et al. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2006; 75: 1074-7).
The report suggests an increase or reemergence of leishmaniasis in
Texas. - Mod.EP]
