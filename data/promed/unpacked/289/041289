Scientists have identified a novel strain of avian influenza that contained several genetic mutations.

A team of researchers at Bangladesh Agricultural University examined 15 dead or sick birds from 13 clinical outbreaks of avian influenza in Bangladesh. The birds in their sample included ducks, geese, chickens and turkeys. Researchers used RT-PCR [reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction] (a laboratory method used to detect genetic material and specific proteins) to detect the virus that affected the birds in their sample. Results indicated that the birds were infected with a new variety of H5N1 influenza.

The new iteration of the virus combined various genetic markers from other low pathogenic influenza types that were found in the region since 2013. Researchers hypothesised that this newer version of the virus will supplant the current strain that is infecting poultry and wild birds in Southern Asia.

The researchers also concluded that the mutations, detected in the H5N1 samples, could be associated with increases in the virus' ability to infect mammals and reductions in its susceptibility to antiviral agents.

The abstract follows:

"A total of 15 dead or sick birds from 13 clinical outbreaks of avian influenza in ducks, geese, chickens and turkeys in 2017 in Bangladesh were examined. The presence of H5N1 influenza A virus in the affected birds was detected by RT‐PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on full length gene sequences of all 8 gene segments revealed that these recent outbreaks were caused by a new reassortant of clade 2.3.2.1a H5N1 virus, which had been detected earlier in 2015 during surveillance in live bird markets (LBMs) and wet lands. This reassortant virus acquired PB2, PB1, PA, NP and NS genes from low pathogenic avian influenza viruses mostly of non‐H9N2 subtypes but retained HA, NA and M genes of the old clade 2.3.2.1a viruses. Nevertheless, the HA gene of these new viruses was 2.7% divergent from that of the old clade 2.3.2.1a viruses circulated in Bangladesh. Interestingly, similar reassortment events could be traced back in four 2.3.2.1a virus isolates of 2013 from backyard ducks. It suggests that this reassortant virus emerged in 2013, which took 2 years to be detected at a broader scale (i.e. in LBMs), another 2 years until it became widely spread in poultry and fully replaced the old viruses. Several mutations were detected in the recent Bangladeshi isolates, which are likely to influence possible phenotypic alterations such as increased mammalian adaptation, reduced susceptibility to antiviral agents and reduced host antiviral response."

HPAI H5N1 has been reported in poultry in Bangladesh since 2007; the 2008, the 1st human case was reported. Since then, 7 additional human cases have been reported, of which 1 fatal: 2011 (2 cases), 2012 (3), 2013 (1, fatal) and 2015 (1). - Mod.AS
