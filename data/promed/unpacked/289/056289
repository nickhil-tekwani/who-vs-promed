Miami-Dade County has now seen more than 50 reported cases of West Nile virus [infection] this year [2020], health officials say, and 5 more cases have been announced.

On Friday [11 Sep 2020], the Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County announced 5 more human cases of West Nile virus infection from local transmission in Miami-Dade residents. This brings the county's total to 54 cases in 2020.

The county has been placed under a mosquito-borne-illness alert. Miami-Dade's 1st 2 cases of West Nile virus were detected in May [2020], both in county residents and through local transmission.

On 4 Aug [2020], Broward County saw its 1st West Nile virus case since 2012. Monroe County is dealing with its own mosquito-borne illness outbreak as 47 people have been infected with Dengue fever.

Miami-Dade County's mosquito-control chief, William Petrie, said in late June [2020] that this summer's resurgence of West Nile probably reflects the heavy rains that cause mosquito populations to explode.

The county's health department has been working with the Department of Solid Waste Management to introduce mosquito control prevention efforts in the exposure areas, health officials said.

Roughly one in 5 of those infected develop a fever or other symptoms, which typically appear between 2 and 14 days after the infected mosquito bites. Fewer than 1% of people who contract the virus develop a serious or fatal illness.

People 60 and older and those with weakened immune systems are at an increased risk for severe disease, health officials said.

The state Department of Health says West Nile virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States. There are no vaccines to prevent it or medications to treat it.

Health officials say to "drain and cover." Drain standing water in garbage cans, gutters, buckets, pools, coolers, birdbaths, and pet water bowls. Also throw away old tires, drums, bottles, cans, and broken appliances.

Cover skin with clothing and apply repellent that uses DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or IR3535 for protection from mosquitoes.

[West Nile virus (WNV) transmission in Miami-Dade County is very active, with 54 human cases reported. As the above report mentions, the occurrence of heavy rains likely is responsible for increased virus vector mosquito breeding. Additional heavy rains are occurring currently in western Florida due to hurricane Sally. It remains to be seen if these rains will result in even more mosquitoes or if the flooding will wash away their larvae and pupae. The virus is maintained in bird populations, with spill-over transmission of the virus to humans and horses.

WNV is now established in the contiguous 48 states of the USA, and cases can be expected in any of them, including Florida during the transmission season. So far this year [2020], as of 9 Sep 2020, the CDC has reported 81 cases in 18 states (https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/preliminarymapsdata2020/disease-cases-state-2020.html). Transmission of WNV across the USA will occur until the onset of killing frosts ends mosquito activity for the year [2020].

Since a commercial human WNV vaccine is not available, individuals living in localities where human or horse cases have occurred this summer [2020], or where positive mosquitoes have been trapped, should follow the recommendations given above to avoid mosquito bites. Horse owners should vaccinate their animals. - Mod.TY
