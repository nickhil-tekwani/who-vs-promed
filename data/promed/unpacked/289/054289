In response to comments and questions from Dayton L. "Pat" Prouty, DVM and
Anna Stites regarding _Pfiesteria piscida_ (ref. (02) above) I refer you to
the May 14, 1999 MMWR Possible Estuary-Associated Syndrome (PEAS) notice
(web address and text included below).

Notice to Readers
Possible Estuary-Associated Syndrome
-------------------------------------------------------
Pfiesteria piscicida (Pp) is an estuarine dinoflagellate that has been
associated with fish kill events in estuaries along the eastern seaboard and
possibly with human health effects (1,2). CDC, in collaboration with other
federal, state, and local government agencies and academic institutions, is
conducting multistate surveillance, epidemiologic studies, and laboratory
research for possible estuary-associated syndrome (PEAS), including possible
Pp-related human illness.
The surveillance system tracks PEAS rather than Pp-related illness because a
Pp toxin(s) has not been identified and therefore a biomarker of exposure
has not been developed. Detection of Pp or fish with lesions in water has
been used as
evidence of suspected Pp toxin(s) (3). However, Pp has been found in waters
where there were no reports of harm to fish or persons. In addition, lesions
on fish can result from various biologic, physical, and environmental
factors. Therefore,
detecting Pp or observing fish with lesions may not be indicative of the
presence of putative Pp toxin(s).
PEAS surveillance criteria resulted from a series of CDC-sponsored
multistate workshops and differ from criteria developed in 1997 (3). Persons
are considered to have PEAS if 1) they report developing symptoms within 2
weeks after exposure to estuarine water; 2) they report memory loss or
confusion of any duration and/or three or more selected symptoms (i.e.,
headache, skin rash at the site of water contact, sensation of burning skin,
eye irritation, upper respiratory irritation, muscle cramps, and
gastrointestinal symptoms) that--with the exception of skin rash at the site
of water contact and sensation of burning skin--persist for greater than or
equal to 2 weeks; and 3) a health-care provider cannot identify another
cause for the symptoms.
It is unclear whether persons exposed to Pp while swimming, boating, or
engaging in other recreational activities in coastal waters are at risk for
developing illness. PEAS is not infectious and has not been associated with
eating fish or shellfish caught in waters where Pp has been found. However,
persons should avoid areas with large numbers of diseased, dying, or dead
fish and should promptly report the event to the state's environmental or
natural resource agency. In addition, persons should not go in or near the
water in areas that are closed officially by the state and should not
harvest or eat fish or shellfish from these areas. Persons who experience
health problems after exposure to estuarine water, a fish-disease event, or
a fish-kill site should contact their health-care provider and state or
local public health agency.
Several states have established PEAS information lines: Delaware, (800)
523-3336; Florida, (888) 232-8635; Maryland, (888) 584-3110; North Carolina,
(888) 823-6915; South Carolina, (888) 481-0125; and Virginia, (888)
238-6154.
