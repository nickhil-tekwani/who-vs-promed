Following increased reports of tularemia over the past few years, a patient who recently contracted the disease while gardening has died of other medical complications. Boulder County Public Health spokeswoman Chana Goussetis said the Lafayette resident tested positive for tularemia after developing symptoms of high fever, headache, and general malaise. It is believed the patient contracted the illness while mowing and gardening.

While this person was the 1st to test positive for tularemia in Boulder County in 2015, the county health department says 3 other cases were reported elsewhere in Colorado. All were associated with people who had recently been gardening or landscaping. Seven animals have also tested positive for the disease in 2015.

"People become infected with tularemia through skin contact with infected animal tissue or through the bite of infected insects, most commonly ticks and deer flies," Goussetis said. "The bacteria can also be inhaled when infected animal tissue is broken up into small particles and spread in the air, such as when an infected carcass is mowed over." In 2014, 16 people tested positive for the disease in Colorado, Goussetis said. Five of those were residents of Boulder County.

"Symptoms of tularemia include an abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, difficulty breathing, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure," Goussetis said. "Symptoms also include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea, or pneumonia. Tularemia is treatable when detected early."

[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter. Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can be infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are important in its ecology.

Humans become infected through various mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type of exposure will dictate the form of the disease manifestation, with cutaneous exposures usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms.
