1200 Cases of Dengue Reported in Venezuela; 20% are hemorrhagic
---------------------------------------------------------------
New cases of dengue have been found as expected by the Ministry of Health
and
Social Assistance, reported Francisco Araoz, director general of
Epidemiology. About 60% of the cases reported have been from the states of
Lara, Tachiar, the Federal District, Merida and Aragua (in order of cases
reported). An epidemiological alert has been declared in these states owing
to the numerous cases resulting from an atypical lengthening of the rainy
season.
In the last 10 weeks about an average of 120 cases a week have been
registered, bringing the total to 1200. About 15-20% have been hemorrhagic
dengue, which is within the expected frequency according to Araoz. During
the
rainy season surveillance will intensify especially of febrile cases that
present in the sentinel clinics in order to differentiate them from cases of
influenza which currently is afflicting many.
In Caracas and the central littoral areas, 195 cases have been reported
according to Eva Rodriguez, chief of Epidemiology for the Federal District.
The areas most affected are El Junquito, El Valle, La Pastora, San Jose,
Santa Rosalia and Catia La Mar. Of the cases reported 68 [35% were reported
as hemorrhagic dengue; 50% of these cases have been hospitalized. Rodriguez
observed that a result of the physician's work stoppage [around the start of
the year, the number of cases of dengue has been under-reported, with only
emergency cases being taken into account.
Health authorities have indicated that up to now they have not fumigated
since "the disease has been found at the expected levels and does not
require
such actions for its control." Measures by government authorities to
eliminate mosquito larvae have been emphasized as well as informing the
population about ways to minimize contact with mosquitos and to eliminate
breeding areas. In addition, Ministry of Public Health officials have
provided advice for those with symptoms, including an emphasis on
rehydration,
seeking immediate treatment, not self-medicating and above all, avoiding
aspirin.
