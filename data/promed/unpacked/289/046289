It now appears that food outlets in the South Auckland suburb of
Clendon are not the source of a typhoid outbreak in the area.
Earlier in January 2007, health officials investigated 4 retailers
for links to several cases of the disease, but tests on 26 workers
came up negative.
Dr. Greg Simmons of the Auckland Regional Public Health Service says
that based on what he has seen, it is unlikely the infection is water
or food-borne and is likely to be transmitted from person-to-person.
Investigations are continuing.

A typhoid epidemic seems to be sweeping the Pacific and there may be
links with the recent outbreaks in New Zealand.
Samoan health authorities are asking athletes heading to the South
Pacific Games to be vaccinated for the disease. The head of the
Games' medical team, Dr. Stanley Dean, says they're trying to stay on
top of the problem and don't want a new outbreak.
More typhoid cases have been reported in Auckland since 4 Clendon
locals were infected and officials believe the source of the disease
is not local. Since November 2006, there have been 17 cases of
typhoid in Auckland, most of them linked to overseas travel.

Samoa's health ministry is urging players and officials coming for
the South Pacific Games in August 2007, to be vaccinated for typhoid.
The head of the health ministry, Dr. Stanley Dean, says the island
has a problem with the disease, with at least 20 cases being reported
a month. Dr. Dean says it's not compulsory for the teams to get
vaccinated but they don't want an epidemic during the event. He says
it's more than likely other Pacific nations have the problem, too.

[The games are scheduled to take place from 25 Aug to 8 Sep 2007.
With an incubation period of generally 1-2 weeks or longer, if
acquired at the games, the disease may not be manifest until the
individual affected returns home.

A Scotland cricket player has been diagnosed with typhoid fever
during a tournament in Africa. When the 29-year-old fell ill medics
thought at 1st he had food poisoning, which affected several of the
15-man squad in Mombasa, Kenya, for the World Cricket League. But
after tests in a Nairobi hospital, he was told he had the more serious disease.
The Australian-born spin bowler, who lives in Stirling, was not
hospitalized and is expected to make a full recovery. Coach Peter
Drinnen said: "He has been put on antibiotics and is recovering in
his hotel room."

A child at a daycare center in Espoo has been diagnosed with typhoid,
the southern Finnish city's health authorities told the Finnish News
Agency (STT) on Mon 29 Jan 2007.
The other children of the center might have become exposed. However,
a vaccination program for the children and staff has been launched
and the centre continues to operate as normal.
The child is thought to have contracted typhoid abroad. All those who
have come into contact with the child have been vaccinated.
In Finland, there are about 5 typhoid cases a year.

[It is not stated where the infection was acquired but in the
developed world, outbreaks of typhoid (which are usually spread
through contaminated water) are uncommon. A daycare setting, however,
especially with children who are not yet toilet-trained, may be an
ideal site for spread.
