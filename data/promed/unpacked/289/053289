MALARIA - TURKMENISTAN: REQUEST FOR INFO
******************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html
Date: Wed 16 Dec 1998
From: Jack Woodall <woodall@bioqmed.ufrj.br>

When you see Malaria on a ProMED-mail post, you know something bad has
happened, because we only report spread to new areas, or spread of
resistance.
Can anyone confirm a report weÂ´ve heard that malaria has returned to
Turkmenistan after 30 years, with over 100 cases in several foci?
