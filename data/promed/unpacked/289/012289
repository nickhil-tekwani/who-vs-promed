With the last vaccination campaign of this year [2015] in progress, officials announced the emergence of yet another polio case on [Tue 15 Dec 2015] in the Pehalwan Goth of Gulshan-e-Iqbal Town, raising the number of victims to 7 in Karachi and 12 in the province [Sindh].

The latest polio victim was identified as 17-month-old [male child], who never received even a single dose of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) during the current or previous vaccination drives in the city, said health officials.

They claimed the Pashtun parents of the unfortunate child always turned vaccinators away whenever they approached their residence.

Five of the 7 polio cases confirmed in Karachi have emerged in December [2015], while the rest surfaced during the past 2 months [October-November 2015], reflecting the ineffectiveness of vaccination drives conducted every month all through this year [2015].

Another grave problem is the rising number of refusals by parents. It has been learnt that so far in the ongoing vaccination drive in the city at least 6000 parents have refused the polio vaccine for their children.

According to Director Health Karachi Dr Zafar Aijaz, the father of [the grandfather of the poliomyelitis-affected child] had lost an infant daughter just a few days after receiving the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) drops. "After that, he decided not to vaccinate his children or let them have polio vaccine drops," he said.

"So the family used to hide the child during polio campaigns, telling the vaccinators that they had no child in the house under the age of 5."

He described refusals as the biggest "cause for concern" for polio officials and said a new strategy was required to deal with parents who were denying their children a chance to avoid catching the crippling disease.

A senior official from Sindh health department also confirmed that cases of refusals were on the rise in Karachi.

"Our interaction with parents reveals that they are fed up with repeated campaigns. Nobody wants polio vaccinators knocking on their doors every other day," said the official, requesting anonymity.

"Most of the parents assume that getting their children vaccinated once or twice is enough to prevent them from getting the crippling disease."

Unfortunately, he said, international agencies, including the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef, were paying little attention to creating awareness among parents while focusing more on conducting repeated polio drives in the city.

"People living in slums, those from low-income groups have a different mindset. They have other problems to deal with than the health issue of a nation," he said. "Whenever, international health agencies ask us to carry out a vaccination drive, we get busy preparing for it instead of dealing with the issue by motivating people and persuading them."

Dr Jean Marc Olive, chairman of the Technical Advisory Group (TAG), a highest technical body advising Pakistan on the polio eradication programme, along with WHO and Unicef officials, met Commissioner Karachi Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui and discussed with him the strategies for eradicating polio in the metropolis.

Siddiqui is the chief of the Karachi Task Force for Polio Eradication and also enjoys the powers of the chief secretary and the health minister and secretary to deal with government officials engaged in polio eradication to ensure effective vaccination drives across the city.

Accompanied by Unicef team leader in Pakistan Aidan O'Leary and WHO representative Dr Abidi Muhammad, Dr Jean Marc Olive also discussed with the commissioner the steps being taken by the task force to eradicate the disease from Karachi.

The commissioner informed the delegation about the measures taken to vaccinate children, and claimed that not a single child would be spared from getting the vaccine.

[Pakistan had hoped to stop polio transmission by the end of 2014, but failed to do so. It has now established a new timeline of stopping polio by May 2016.

Polio this week as of 9 Dec 2015
------------------------------
Two cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus were confirmed in Myanmar this week. The Ministry of Health is implementing an urgent outbreak response with the support of the partners of GPEI.

Around the world, thousands of polio workers have selflessly dedicated their lives to stopping polio in their communities. Five people have been honoured with Heroes of Polio Eradication (HOPE) Awards, presented by Bill Gates and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.

In 2015, wild poliovirus transmission is at the lowest levels ever, with fewer cases reported from fewer areas of fewer countries than ever before. In 2015 so far, 66 wild poliovirus cases have been reported from 2 countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan), compared to 324 cases from 9 countries during the same period in 2014.

Pakistan
-------
Six new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week: 4 in Sindh province, 1 in Balochistan province, and 1 in the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA). The total number of WPV1 cases for 2015 is now 49, compared to 275 by this time in 2014.

Two new environmental samples positive for WPV1 were reported in the last week, both from Gadap Town, Sindh province, with collection dates of 12 and 17 Nov [2015].

September and October have historically been the months with the highest disease burden, as it is in the middle of the high transmission season. Epidemiologists are further evaluating data from this year [2015], to more clearly ascertain current transmission patterns during this year's high transmission season. This year, onset of paralysis was reported for 8 WPV1 during September and October [2015], compared to 79 WPV1 cases in the same period in 2014.
