Probe into mysterious child deaths in Senegal
---------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Senegal are looking into the unexplained deaths
of about 20 small children in a poor suburb of Dakar, a regional
medical chief said Friday [7 Mar 2008].

"Investigations have begun to find out how many (children) and what
happened," Khemes Ngom told AFP, confirming press reports that 18 to
20 children, aged 3 to 5, died in the fishing district of Thiaroye-sur-Mer.

"People reported symptoms such as convulsions, vomiting and
diarrhea," she said, "but after tests, pediatricians and doctors have
ruled out diseases such as cerebral malaria, typhoid fever,
meningitis and cholera."

Ngom said that samples -- including ones from car batteries -- had
been gathered in Thiaroye-sur-Mer to be sent to health ministry laboratories.

The private weekly L'Observateur reported that the children might
have been poisoned by lead from car batteries left on a public waste
tip, because "people living in poverty fetch them to resell them."

[Although this could be a case of lead poisoning from the lead in the
batteries, it would be nice to know the general nutrition and health
of the children that died. It would also be helpful to know for how
long these children were ill before they died. Are these deaths
limited to just this fishing village or have there been other deaths
in other fishing villiages.

Symptoms of lead poisoning in children mimic other diseases with
complaints associated with stomachache, irritability, decreased
appetite, hyperactivity and sleep problems, lethargy, nervousness and
others. With such non-specific signs it is easy to attribute this to
a host of other childhood aliments. Convulsions, coma and death may
occur from lead poisoning.

This article does not tell us what samples were taken or how long
this condition has been ongoing. If anyone has more definitive
information we would appreciate it if you would share with us. - Mod.TG]
