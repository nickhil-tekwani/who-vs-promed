The EIA [equine infectious anemia]-positive quarter horse from Bexar county has been euthanized and the affected Maverick county quarter Horse has been transferred to a quarantine facility.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported 14 May 2018 the Texas Animal Health Commission [TAHC] has confirmed equine infectious anemia (EIA) in a Maverick county quarter horse and a Bexar county quarter horse.

"The Bexar county horse has been euthanized and the premises will remain under quarantine until requirements for release have been met," the EDCC said. "The Maverick county horse is currently being maintained in a quarantine facility. TAHC staff is working closely with owners and veterinarians to monitor potentially exposed horses and implement biosecurity measures."

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease attacking a horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to a non-infected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies, and more rarely through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA, and most US states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test in order to travel.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Obvious clinical signs of the disease include progressive loss of condition along with muscle weakness and poor stamina. An affected horse also could show fever, depression, and anemia.

["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a non-contagious, infectious disease of horses and other Equidae. It is caused by an RNA virus classified in the _Lentivirus_ genus, family Retroviridae. EIA can present as an acute, subacute, or chronic infection. On occasion, the virus can be a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The most frequently encountered form of the disease is the inapparent, chronically infected carrier. This chronic carrier state is the reason for some of the regulations when equids go to a show, or event, or are shipped for any reason.

"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.

"No specific treatment or safe and effective vaccine are available. Because equids infected with EIA virus present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 meters) from other equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of seropositive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to the virus after ingesting colostrum. In most cases, passive antibody against EIA virus wanes and is no longer detectable in the Coggins test by 6-8 months of age; detectable antibody may persist up to 12 months, however, if ELISA testing is used.

"All equids shipped across state lines in the USA must be tested for EIA with a negative result within 12 months before transport. All equids sold, traded, or donated within a state must have tested negative for EIA no more than 12 months before change in ownership and, preferably, no more than 60-90 days. All equids entering horse auctions or sales markets are required to have a negative test before sale, or the horse must be held in quarantine within the state until the test results are known."

It is indeed a shame there is no vaccination available for this disease.
