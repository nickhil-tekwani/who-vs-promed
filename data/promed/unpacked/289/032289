The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), working with the
CDC, the FDA and other state health departments, is investigating
several foodborne outbreaks in which people report becoming ill after
consuming desserts from Rolf's Patisserie in Lincolnwood, Illinois.

There have been 4 recent outbreaks where one of the dessert items has
come from Rolf's Patisserie. Approximately 100 people have reported
becoming ill after consuming Rolf's desserts at a company event, a
catered party, a restaurant and holiday party.

Rolf's is a wholesale and retail sales bakery. Rolf's Patisserie is
working closely with IDPH, and the bakery is temporarily closed while
these outbreaks are investigated. Rolf's is voluntarily recalling all
products made after 1 Nov 2010. The bakery is contacting retailers
and restaurants to remove and discard these products from their
shelves. Both Rolf's and public health officials are advising people
not to eat these food items and throw them out.

IDPH is working to obtain a distribution list, but individuals or
businesses may have already purchased goods for the holidays, so it
is important to ask where the dessert is from and avoid consuming
desserts from Rolf's made after 1 Nov 2010.

Initial laboratory testing shows one food item to be contaminated
with high levels of _Staphylococcus aureus_. Food can become
contaminated if a person with a staph infection has an uncovered
lesion or sore that comes in contact with food or food processing
equipment. _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteria and toxin can contaminate
foods or equipment. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are fast acting,
sometimes causing illness in as little as 30 minutes but usually in
4-6 hours, with nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and little if any
fever. The patients usually recover within a day.

the USA FDA's Bad Bug Book <http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap3.html>:

In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper
interviews with the victims, and the gathering and analyzing of
epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be
collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively
large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial
evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is
the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where
multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the
staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic
observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of
serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S.
aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation
and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used
successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing
may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the
incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as
food handlers.

A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will
produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is
reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food
poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products;
salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery
products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate
eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that
require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept
at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently
involved in staphylococcal food poisoning.

The true incidence of staphylococcal food poisoning is unknown for a
number of reasons, including poor responses from victims during
interviews with health officials; misdiagnosis of the illness, which
may be symptomatically similar to other types of food poisoning (such
as vomiting caused by _Bacillus cereus_ toxin); inadequate collection
of samples for laboratory analyses; and improper laboratory
examination. Of the bacterial pathogens causing foodborne illnesses
in the USA (127 outbreaks, 7082 cases recorded in 1983), 14
outbreaks, involving 1257 cases, were caused by _S. aureus_. These
outbreaks were followed by 11 outbreaks (1153 cases) in 1984, 14
outbreaks (421 cases) in 1985, 7 outbreaks (250 cases) in 1986, and
one reported outbreak (100 cases) in 1987. - Mod.LL]
