The primary purpose of the American Phytopathological Society
(APS), with approximately 5000 members in over 70 countries, is
to promote the discovery and diffusion of scientific information
on plant diseases and their control in the United States and
world-wide. This purpose includes the dissemination of
scientific information needed to make and implement sound
national and international policies on plant diseases and their
control. This statement has been developed through the actions
of the Council of APS in regard to Karnal bunt, caused by
_Tilletia indica_.
Virtually every smut or bunt disease once important on cereal
grains (wheat, barley, rice, corn, sorghum, oats) is or can be
effectively managed today by 1) seed-treatment chemicals, 2)
resistant varieties, and/or 3) the use of cultural practices such
as change in planting date or lengthening the crop rotation.
Even where seed treatments have been ineffective against
soilborne spores, it has still been possible to manage these
diseases through the use of cultural practices and resistant
varieties. These management options are in addition to the use
of clean, high-quality seed. Thus, the scientific information
available does not support a "zero tolerance" requirement for
spores in seed lots as the standard for smut and bunt diseases of
cereals, including for Karnal bunt of wheat. In the specific
case of Karnal bunt, experience from countries where this disease
has occurred would suggest further that this is a minor disease,
and what little risk does exist can be effectively managed
without the use of quarantines.
Although quarantines may delay introductions of pathogens into
new areas, they are unlikely to absolutely prevent such
introductions and subsequent establishment. This conclusion has
been confirmed repeatedly, most recently by the occurrence of
Karnal bunt in the United States despite quarantines imposed on
wheat from countries where this disease has been known to occur.
Considering the flow of agricultural goods and products of
international commerce, and the ability of Karnal bunt fungus to
travel considerable distances as airborne spores, the
opportunities for movement of these fungi are enormous.
Moreover, in regions where bunts and smuts occur, there is no
evidence or experience to suggest that a smut or bunt fungus can
be eradicated once established in soil. In the specific case of
Karnal bunt in the United States, new soil infestations can be
expected in the future because the causal fungus is both
widespread in Mexico in areas adjacent to wheat-growing areas in
the United States and because it spreads as airborne spores.
The smut and bunt diseases of wheat and other cereals were among
the first plant diseases recognized by the early botantists in
the 18th century, and these diseases played a major role in the
origin of plant pathology (the study of plant diseases) as a
discipline separate from both botany (the study of plants) and
mycology (the study of fungi). Today, specimens of smut and bunt
diseases serve as prime material for teaching students about the
fundamentals of plant pathology. In addition, several of the
cereal smuts have become valuable model systems for fundamental
studies needed to understand fungi and fungal diseases of plants
at the molecular level. However, because of the success in their
control, and in spite of their widespread and still-expanding
distribution, none of the species of strains of smut or bunt
fungi currently known to affect cereals represent an unmanageable
threat to agriculture in the world today. The investments of the
United States and many other nations for most of this century in
research on these disease has resulted in successful disease
control. Accordingly, and appropriately, work on these diseases
has been mostly phased out over the past 20-30 years and the
resources redirected towards development of the knowledge base
and technology needed to control the many plant diseases still
important or threatening to agriculture.
Cereal smuts and bunts, including Karnal bunt, require vigilance
and justify continued research at some appropriate level like any
disease of a food, feed, fiber or other corp. It should also be
recognized that certain smuts or bunts continue to cause damage
to cereals grown in some regions of the work as part of
subsistence agriculture. While different countries may have
different concerns for the potential of smuts and bunts to affect
their cereal crops, nevertheless, the conclusions outlined above
are based on fundamental principles developed from knowledge of
the biology, epidemiology, and ecology of diseases that recognize
no national borders.
Based on this information, the APS recommends that the U.S.
Department of Agriculture:
1. - sponsor an international meeting of scientists to evaluate
the status and strategies for management of smut and bunt
diseases of cereals world-wide, with particular attention to
Karnal bunt,
2. - take a leading role in reevaluation of international
policies on the use of quarantines to prevent the movement of
cereal smut and bunt fungi, and
3. - maintain a research effort at some level on smut and bunt
diseases of cereals, including Karnal bunt.
For its role, APS will work through the International Society for
Plant Pathology to enlist the international community of plant
pathologists to:
1. - assess the current and future threat of cereal smut and bunt
diseases to cereal-based agriculture world-wide,
2. - examine the scientific basis for plant quarantines to limit,
retard, or prevent the international spread of cereal and bunt
fungi, and
3. - examine the scientific basis of plant quarantines for the
21st century.
