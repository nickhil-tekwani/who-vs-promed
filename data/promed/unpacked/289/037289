The Commission of Extremadura has confirmed, through the National Regency Laboratory, a case of serotype 4 of the bluetongue virus [BTV] in the region of Coria (CÃ¡ceres).

This region, as is the case with all of Extremadura, was already within the restriction zone for this serotype, as established in Order APA/1251/2020 of 21 Dec 2022, which establishes specific protection measures related to bluetongue [BT].

The samples were taken on 6 Sep 2022 at the bovine sentinel farm, located in the municipality of Coria, within the framework of the active surveillance provided for in the National Bluetongue Surveillance, Control and Eradication Program.

The animals used as sentinels are young cattle, not vaccinated against bluetongue (unprotected), which are regularly tested in order to facilitate early detection of any circulation of the bluetongue virus in that region. The animals do not show symptoms compatible with the disease, nor is there evidence of symptoms in animals of sensitive species from farms in the environment, explains the Junta de Extremadura in a press release.

In this region of Coria, as in the rest of Extremadura, restriction areas had been proclaimed earlier due to the presence of BTV serotype 4 [BTV4]. Therefore, cattle and sheep farms are being vaccinated against this serotype; hence, no clinical cases of BT have been detected.

After the communication of this outbreak, the situation continues as before; that is, the same movement control and vaccination measures addressing BTV4 will continue being applied, including the reinforcement of passive surveillance and obligatory reporting of any suspicion.

To carry out vaccination against serotype 4, the general directorate of Agriculture and Livestock, through the Animal Health Service, will continue to make the necessary free vaccine doses available to cattle and sheep farmers.

The Ministry of Agriculture recalls that bluetongue is a viral disease transmitted by midges of the _Culicoides_ genus, it affects ruminants of different species, but "in no case does it affect man."

[Extremadura is an autonomous community of Spain, located in the central-western part of the Iberian Peninsula and bordered by Portugal to the west. Parts of both countries are regarded endemically infected by BTV-1 and BTV-4, as can be seen in EC's bluetongue map at https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-07/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map_0.pdf (last updated 28 Jul 2022). The map shows Extremadura coloured orange (BTV-4) while the territory to its south coloured blue (BTV-1 and BTV-4). The current findings in susceptible sentinel bovines reflect the seasonality of the disease, determined by the seasonality of the vector activity. Portugal's adjoining territories are similarly affected: in the centre by BTV-4, and in the south by both by BTV-4 and BTV-1.

Bluetongue (BT) is a WOAH-listed, infectious, vector-borne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants. The BT orbivirus, of which at least 27 serotypes are known, is primarily transmitted by certain species of _Culicoides_ midges. The global distribution of the disease is largely determined by the distribution of competent vectors. Infection with BTV is inapparent in the vast majority of animals but can cause fatal disease in susceptible breeds of sheep. Infection of cattle is usually subclinical, with the exception of BTV-8 infection. When apparent, clinical signs of BT are mainly attributable to an increase in vascular permeability and include fever, hyperaemia and congestion, facial oedema and haemorrhages, erosion of the mucous membranes, coronitis and laminitis, and pleural and pericardial haemorrhages. Cattle are particularly significant in the epidemiology of the disease due to the prolonged viraemia that occurs following infection. - Mod.AS
