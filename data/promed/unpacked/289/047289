Bug probe liner to stay in Firth
--------------------------------
A total of 4 people are being treated in hospital after an outbreak of
suspected norovirus on board a cruise liner. The Marco Polo will
remain tied up at Invergordon on the Cromarty Firth until Wednesday [8
Jul 2009] while GPs (physicians) continue to assess passengers and
crew. NHS [National Health Service] Highland said 380 people had been
assessed after feeling unwell. A 74-year-old man died of an apparent
heart attack. The tour operator said his death was not related to the
virus, but that has not been confirmed. 4 people were initially taken
to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness for treatment. One was allowed to
return to the vessel, but another passenger was subsequently admitted
to hospital. A post-mortem examination will be carried out on the man
who died, who is thought to have been from Norfolk.

In a statement, cruise operators Transocean Tours said his death was
unrelated to the virus outbreak, and that the ship had been inspected
by local health officials.

A passenger on the ship said the situation for those who had not taken
ill was bearable and the crew were trying to keep passengers as well
informed of developments as they could. She said: "Generally speaking
on board everything is calm. The crew is doing their utmost to please
everybody."

NHS Highland said about 200 people were suffering from sickness and
abdominal cramps -- symptoms of the virus, which is also known as the
winter vomiting bug and affects up to one million people in the UK
every year. Local GPs and community nurses have boarded the Marco Polo
to assist the ship's doctor.

It has emerged that passengers on the previous voyage of the Marco
Polo who disembarked on Saturday [4 Jul 2009] were also struck with a
sickness bug. Transocean Tours said this was gastroenteritis and
affected a small number of people. The company said the ship was given
a clean bill of health.

The cruise liner is berthed at Invergordon on the Cromarty Firth. The
Marco Polo is touring the UK and Ireland. It was carrying 769
passengers and 340 crew. It had sailed from Tilbury on Saturday [4 Jul
2009] but has now been detained at Invergordon harbour.

Invergordon councillor Maxine Smith criticised the way the situation
had been handled, claiming that potentially infected passengers were
allowed to wander through the town after the ship docked there. She
said there were reports of some passengers vomiting in the streets.

Earlier, Transocean Tours said the ship had not been placed under
quarantine and that passengers unaffected by the virus were only
allowed ashore after local health authorities had given their
approval. Dr Ken Oates said the man who died had many underlying
health problems.

The company said the ship had remained in Invergordon to allow
additional manpower to join the ship to assist with the situation,
adding that the decision had been made by the ship's owners, Story
Cruise Ltd. A Transocean Tours spokesman said the company's
environmental and health officers had been working closely with the
local authorities and that a full outbreak control plan in line with
UK public health requirements was in place and being followed closely.

Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Radio's Good
Morning Scotland programme it was a "very concerning situation" for
those on board the ship and those in the local community. She said it
was being dealt with by local agencies and that she was being
regularly updated on developments.

[This outbreak of gastroenteritis on board the cruise ship Marco Polo
during a Round-Britain cruise has yet to be confirmed as norovirus
infection by laboratory analysis, but the features are characteristic
of norovirus infection. Outbreaks of norovirus infection on board
cruise ships are not uncommon worldwide, but the death of a passenger
is unusual. The death of this elderly passenger has been attributed to
heart failure, and norovirus infection is not considered to be a
contributory factor.

Invergordon, in North-east Scotland, is the only port in the Highlands
where the largest cruise liners can come alongside, with convenient
transfer of passengers to and from onshore transport. There are no
tidal or navigational restrictions at the deep-water port, which can
accommodate 2 large liners of up to 900 feet (275 metres) and 36 feet
(11 metres) draught simultaneously.
