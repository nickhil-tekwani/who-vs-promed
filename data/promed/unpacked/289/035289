Two recent ProMED-mail postings regarding suspected dengue infections in
Hawaii, USA, draw attention to the difficulties of interpreting serologic
tests for flaviviruses, particularly when the results are inconsistent with
clinical and/or epidemiologic information.
In one report [originating in the local paper a resident of Hawaii
experiencing a non-specific febrile illness was said to have "tested
positive" for dengue, based on EIA results from a commercial laboratory on
the U.S. mainland. Subsequent testing of the patient's sera at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Infectious
Diseases, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (CDC\NCID\DVBID),
determined that the specimens were negative for dengue-specific IgM and IgG.
Another ProMED-mail posting referred to a published report [J Travel Med
1998, 5:44-45 which stated that a German couple had simultaneous onset of
febrile illnesses while visiting Hawaii and on subsequent serologic testing
by IFA were found to have evidence of recent dengue infection. Both
members of this couple had reportedly been vaccinated against yellow fever
and tick-borne encephalitis between 3 months and 10 years prior to their
illnesses.
The CDC\DVBID performed extensive testing of the sera obtained from these
individuals and determined that the results did not support the diagnosis
of acute flavivirus infection.
Pitfalls in serodiagnostic testing that need to be considered include false
positives due to rheumatoid factor (which commonly appears in many acute
viral infections) and non-specific IgM reactivity (seen in about 2% of
dengue tests conducted by CDC in 1986).
>From an epidemiologic perspective, despite the presence of
dengue-competent mosquito vectors in Hawaii, dengue virus transmission has
not been reported since the 1940s. Public health officials believe that
undetected circulation of dengue viruses in Hawaii is extremely unlikely.
[Although Hawaii's infectious disease and travel medicine physicians
definitely do diagnose dengue in Hawaii, all such cases have been found to
be "imported" (i.e. although the disease onset occurred in Hawaii the
person had recently traveled overseas to a dengue-endemic or epidemic area
of the Pacific or Southeast Asia, within the incubation period).
Since the clinical dengue detection "system" in Hawaii seems to be
sufficiently sensitive to detect imported cases, it would presumably detect
indigenously transmitted cases, were they to occur. Moreover, the
environmental/sanitary conditions often typical of areas with sustained
dengue transmission are uncommon in Hawaii.
In summary, as this most recent report of "dengue in Hawaii" clearly
illustrates, serologic test results do not equal diagnoses. The available
data suggest that transmission of dengue in Hawaii, although not
inconceivable, is a very unlikely explanation for the unusual/inconsistent
serologic results reported from the two German travelers and from the third
case patient.
As always, clinical diagnoses should be based on a comprehensive synthesis
of clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic information. This is
particularly true when a diagnosis indicates the need for emergency public
health action, as would be the case for re-establishment of dengue
transmission in Hawaii.
Given this, it would be prudent for clinicians and public health officials
in Hawaii to remain vigilant for reported cases of dengue-like illness and,
at the same time, endeavor to ensure that laboratory test results are
examined in the context of the available epidemiologic and clinical data.

[We are grateful for this measured official response, and particularly for
the information on the follow up lab results. Given the repeated
introduction of dengue into Hawaii by people incubating the virus, we fear
that it is only a matter of time before there is an outbreak there --
unless the widespread use of air conditioning
leads to the 'Tex/Mex effect,' whereby dengue hasn't (so far) become
established north of the Mexican border, despite its occurrence right up to
there.
We would be interested to hear what mosquito control measures are being
taken in Hawaii. - Mod.JW
