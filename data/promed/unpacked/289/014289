----------------------------------------
Official sources said that 4 children succumbed to deadly
encephalitis at BRD Medical College Hospital here and adjoining
district hospitals during past 24 hours, mounting the death toll due
to deadly disease to 447.

As many as 14 new patients of suspected encephalitis or brain fever
have been admitted to BRDMCH and other hospitals on Friday [14 Nov
2008], the sources said, adding that a total of 122 patients of
suspected encephalitis are at present being treated at the medical
college and different district hospitals of the region.

The patients are from Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, Deoria, Mahrajganj, Sant
Kabir Nagar and Siddharthanagar districts.

[The encephalitis outbreak in Gorakhpur continues. In previous posts
(see below), only a small proportion of these cases is considered due
to Japanese encephalitis virus, and the attending physicians
suggested that enterovirus, echovirus, Coxsackie-B virus, Saharanpur
encephalitis, and a killer weed that took 600 lives in 2006 might be
involved. Again, there is no indication that any of these etiological
agents have been laboratory confirmed or ruled out. ProMED would
appreciate receiving any further information on additional cases and,
especially, laboratory results establishing a diagnosis of the
etiology of these cases.
