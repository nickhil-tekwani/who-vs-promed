Following humanitarian operations in the southern Syrian town of Yalda [Rif Dimashq Governorate], the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said it has identified 9 new suspected cases of typhoid and one case of scabies.

UNRWA has been providing vital healthcare to civilians displaced from Yarmouk camp [Damascus], where the lives of Palestinian refugees continue to be threatened by the conflict in the region. A situation update issued by the agency said its medical personnel established a health point in Yalda yesterday [1 Sep 2015], treating 330 patients.

As high summer temperatures and regular interruptions in water and food supplies continue to affect Yarmouk, Yalda, and other areas such as Babila and Beit Saham, communicable illness reportedly remains a source of profound vulnerability for civilians.

According to UNRWA, health services are extremely limited and lack the capacity to respond to major outbreaks and other serious health needs. For this reason, it warned that its medical assistance is vital and must continue on an indefinite basis. It added that its latest humanitarian operations were conducted with the facilitation of the Syrian authorities. Meanwhile, UNRWA is continuing to appeal for donors to increase their support. Only 31 per cent of funds needed for this year's Syria Crisis Appeal have been received, while more than 95 per cent of Palestinian refugees rely on the UN for food, water and healthcare.
