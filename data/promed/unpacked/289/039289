I note that ProMED-mail has been interested in the encephalitis situation
in Nepal. Since the mid 1970's, when it was first observed, encephalitis
has been occurring annually in Nepal, with the majority of cases occurring
in the southern low terai districts of the country. The following appeared
in the Nepal Government Newspaper, "Rising Nepal" published in the capital
city, Kathmandu on 24 October 1997.
"With the onset of the cold season, the outbreak of viral encephalitis this
year has been brought fully under control, according to Bheri Zonal
Hospital. Of a total of 807 viral encephalitis patients brought to the
hospital from the terai districts of the mid- and far western development
regions, 120 have died so far, 676 have been discharged and another 11 are
still undergoing treatment. No new cases of the malady have been coming to
the hospital. Blood tests carried out on patients hospitalized a month ago
showed that 70% were cases of Japanese encephalitis and 30% were malaria
cases. Four hundred of the encephalitis patients hospitalized this year
were provided free medicine with the help of the public. Bheri Zonal
Hospital made available medicine worth Rs. 1,500,000 including Rs. 600,000
provided by His Majesty's Government."

[Thanks to Bob Scott for this informative up-date. Strange that 100% of
encephalitis cases have been diagnosed. In this country and in other
western countries a far lower percentage of encephalitis cases ever have an
etiologic agent associated with them. Herpes, enteroviruses, and other
agents likely are the cause of the undiagnosed illnesses but definitive
diagnosis never equals 100%. I wonder whether some other (inapparent to
me) screening process is being used. - Mod.CHC
