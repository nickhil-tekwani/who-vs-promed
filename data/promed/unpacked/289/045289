In Honduras, there is a dengue outbreak alert. This Tuesday [26 May
2009], a girl of 9 years died of DHF in a hospital in Tegucigalpa.
This is the 2nd after the death of a boy from the same disease.

The authorities have decreed an epidemiological alert, facing concern
about the situation going out of control.

This weekend [23-24 May 2009], 2 more deaths from DHF were confirmed
in the state [Bahia]. In Barreiras (871 km [541 miles] from Salvador),
the 1st death was recorded for the disease. The same thing happened in
Juazeiro (502 km [311 miles] from the capital), with the cause of
death also from DHF, confirmed on Saturday (23 [May 2009]). The 2
deaths were reported, but lacked laboratory confirmation.

According to epidemiological surveillance, in Barreiras this year
[2009], 1925 suspected cases of dengue have been reported, 203 of
which were confirmed as classical dengue fever; another 16 were cases
of dengue with complications, one of DHF and 2 of [dengue] shock
syndrome.

According to the bulletin of "serious [disease] types" disseminated by
the Bahia state Secretariat of Health (SESAB), Bahia has recorded a
total of 1293 [dengue] cases with 526 [of these] confirmed. The deaths
reported for the disease add up to 111, with confirmation of 51 of them.

Tragic cases like these only reinforce the fight that must be made
against the mosquito that transmits dengue [virus]. For this, it is
essential that the population avoid the accumulation of water in
plastic containers or old tires, which should be cleaned frequently.

Although the Argentina Ministry of Health issued assurances that the
dengue epidemic is controlled and that the worst has passed, the
disease continues to advance, with 25 833 confirmed cases, 14 percent
more [cases] than last month [April 2009].

The high temperatures recorded since last week [week of 17 May 2009]
and the movement of tourists recorded over the long weekend [of
Republic Day, 25 May] in Argentina have revived concerns about
extension of the disease, and several specialists insist that work for
prevention must continue in order to prevent new outbreaks, [according
to a report] published by La Nacion newspaper.

Historically, February, March and April are the months with the
greatest number of mosquitoes of all species in the country, including
_Aedes aegypti_, which transmits dengue and yellow fever [viruses].
These insects live in temperatures above 16 C; temperatures this month
[May 2009] exceeded 16 C during most days.

In Chaco, the province most affected by the dengue epidemic, the
number of [dengue virus] infected individuals increased from 10 160 to
10 796 in just one month. Of these, only 2 were "imported," and the
rest were locally acquired. Catamarca, which follows Chaco [in the
number of dengue cases], has gone from 8008 cases to 8703, according
to official data from the Ministry of Health.

Cold weather helps in reducing the dengue epidemic. According to the
provincial Ministry of Health, the dengue epidemic in Tucuman is
undergoing a sustained decline in new [dengue] cases.

"In Tucuman, there is a total recorded of 1742 [dengue] cases,
including those confirmed and suspected from the beginning of the
epidemic in January [2009] to the present [1 Jun 2009]. During the
long weekend, some cases have been reported," the Ministry indicated
in an announcement. They added that as well as a decline in
temperature, the effect [on vector mosquitoes] must not be confused
with definitive epidemic control and prevention [taken] for the next
summer season. "During the winter, one must take advantage [of the
opportunity] to eradicate all the mosquito breeding sites. This is a
proposal of proven efficacy that everyone must do."

The number of dengue fever patients of Cambodia rose to about 1500
until May [2009], 960 more than the same period of last year [2008],
or an increase of about 50 percent, national media said on Monday [25
May 2009].

The 1500 victims were mainly spotted in Phnom Penh, with 343 cases,
Kampong Cham province with 259 cases, and Kandal province with 161
cases, Chinese-language daily newspaper the Commercial News quoted
officials of the Ministry of Health (MoH) as saying.

Moreover, 3 people died of the disease all over the kingdom; 2 of them
died [at the beginning] of the year [2009] and the 3rd in May [2009],
according to MoH.

The MoH has already received assistance from the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) and the World Bank (WB) and plans to buy insecticide and
educational material to enhance public understanding, according to MoH.

The rainy season from May to November is the period of outbreak of
dengue fever nationwide. Usually, children under 15 years old [are]
the most fragile group to be attacked by the illness, and some 71
percent of the cases [are] children.

The government has called on the people to clean their water-saving
tanks frequently, kill mosquito eggs in their tanks with pesticide,
and sleep under anti-mosquito nets.

According to official figures, in 2007, a rampant year for the disease
in the kingdom, 407 children died of dengue out of a total of 39 851
infected cases of minors. And last year [2008], there were 9542 people
infected with the disease [virus] in the kingdom, out of whom 65 died.

It is not yet the peak season for dengue fever, but the number of
people coming down with it has increased in southern and central
regions, says a senior official of the Ministry of Health.

Nguyen Huy Nga, head of the ministry's Preventive Medicine and
Environment Department, said the rainy season has come early this year
[2009] with increased rainfall, accounting for the rise in dengue
fever cases.

In the cyclical rise and fall pattern that the disease follows, 2009
is a year of increase, and this is another factor, Nga said.

The HCM [Ho Chi Minh] City Paediatrics Hospital No. 1 this week has
received between 66 and 84 patients a day, double that of the previous
month [April 2009].

Dr Le Bich Lien, head of the hospital's Dengue Fever Ward, said early
onset of the rainy season has clearly seen the number of cases begin
to go up earlier than in previous years.

Typically, the number of children contracting the disease increases in
June, Lien said.

HCM City has led the country in dengue fever cases so far this year
[2009], with 3600 cases and 4 fatalities reported by the city's
Department of Health.

The number of dengue fever cases nationwide has risen to 16 600 in the
1st 5 months of the year, up 20 per cent against the same period last
year [2008], according to the Preventive Medicine and Environment
Department.

Dengue fever cases are also surging in the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta
provinces of Kien Giang and Soc Trang and the central province of
Khanh Hoa.

"Dengue fever could return strongly this year [2009] if drastic
measures are not taken," Nga reiterated.

Viet Nam health authorities will spend VND 70 billion [USD 3.94
million] on tackling the early outbreak of dengue fever this year
[2009] that has killed 17 people and continues to spread in the
southern provinces.

The Health Ministry's Bureau of Preventive Health and Environment
reported at a conference on dengue fever Monday [25 May 2009] in Can
Tho that a total of 18 100 people nationwide have been infected with
the mosquito-borne disease since January [2009].

11 people had died from dengue during the same period last year
[2008], around 40 percent less than this year [2009], the bureau said.

Bureau head Nguyen Huy Nga said 85 percent of the cases were in
southern provinces and that dengue virus type 1 could worsen the
outbreak.

Tran Ngoc Huu, director of the Ho Chi Minh City Pasteur Institute,
said HCMC still topped the list in the number of patients.

The number of dengue fever patients has increased over the past 2
years, and warmer weather caused by global climate change has also
contributed to the rise, he said.

Nguyen Dac Tho, deputy director of the HCMC Center for Preventive
Health, said dengue fever has spread to 222 of the total 321 wards and
communes in the city.

He said that the disease had struck the city a month earlier than
usual, while a shortage of health workers has continued to be a
problem and hospitals struggle to cope with dengue patients. Dr. Tran
Tan Hien of the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases said the number of
dengue sufferers was stressing hospital services.

A representative at the conference from the Can Tho Children's
Hospital, which offers treatment to dengue fever patients from Mekong
Delta provinces, said they examined more than 80 patients a day in the
1st 5 months of this year [January to May 2009].

Health authorities in south-central Binh Thuan Province on Monday [25
May 2009] also reported a drastic increase of dengue fever patients.
Binh Thuan General Hospital said they were treating 374 inpatients,
both with dengue fever and viral fever, while the children's ward has
only 120 beds.

A resident from the province's Phan Thiet Town said she had to wait in
the corridor with her child, who had a severely high temperature. "I
wish he could be treated; it doesn't matter where we have to stay,"
said another woman whose child was suffering, adding that each bed was
already occupied by 2 or 3 children.

between January and May [2009] to 16 635 cases, compared with 11 447
cases in 2008, the paper said.

Meanwhile, Nguyen Huy Nga, director of the Ministry of Health's
Department of Preventive Health and Environment said 20 southern
provinces and cities recorded 16 021 cases.

The Epidemiological Unit (EU) of the Colombo National Hospital has
advised the general public to get themselves tested for dengue
immediately if they experience fever, Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Pabha
Palihawadena told The Sunday Leader.

Following the recent outbreak of dengue 5 months ago, the number of
deaths has increased to 85, which is a 2-fold increase compared to
2008, according to Dr. Palihawadena. "The dengue menace is alarmingly
on the increase, with more than 6100 patients recorded in the country.
[Some] 12 districts have been recognized as high-risk areas, while
Colombo, Gampaha, Kandy, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Hambantota and
Matale have recorded the largest number of patients. The situation,
therefore, has to be monitored very carefully," Dr. Palihawadena added.

[The 31 May 2009 edition of the Sunday Times of Sri Lanka
<http://www.sundaytimes.lk/090531/News/sundaytimesnews_19.html>
reported that last week (week of 17 May 2009), the Ministry of Health
declared a national red alert in an effort to prevent a dengue
epidemic. Up to 24 May 2009, 85 dengue-related deaths and 6669 cases
of dengue fever have been reported since 1 Jan 2009 compared to the 27
deaths and 6100 cases for the whole of 2008. The district with the
highest number of deaths, 16, was Kandy, and Colombo came 2nd with 9
deaths. Kandy, Colombo, Gampaha, Kegalle, Kurunegala, Kalutara,
Matale, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Hambantota, Ratnapura and Matara have
been identified as the highest-risk districts. Statistics indicate
that 33 percent of dengue patients are housewives, and 22 percent are
children.

Of the 4 types of dengue viruses, types 1 and 2 have been prevalent in
Sri Lanka in the past, and many people have developed an immunity to
both types. However, this year [2009] has seen the arrival of the type
3 virus, which is spreading rapidly because there is low herd immunity
to this type. Public Health Services Director General Dr. Maheepala
Herath said the Type 3 virus was more virulent.

Of children in the Colombo district, 50 percent have been exposed to
Types 1 and 2, Dr. Herath said. Children are extra vulnerable to Type
3, and if they get infected, the fever could be more severe and the
dangers greater.

Public Health Services have identified 68 high-risk areas, he said.
Out of every 100 houses inspected, more than 80 houses have potential
mosquito breeding sites. The mosquito breeding period is highest in
the rainy months from April-September.

Dr. S. Gamage, the Director of Health for Kandy district, said most of
the dengue cases in the district have been reported from the Akurana
area, where water is in short supply and house occupants are forced to
collect water in buckets. The doctor said the Kandy Municipal Council
faces the problem of hundreds of visitors coming to the city every day
and leaving behind a mass of empty king coconut shells, yoghurt and
ice-cream cups and other plastic receptacles, all of which are ideal
containers for stagnant water and breeding of _Aedes_ mosquito
vectors. ProMED thanks Kunihiko Iizuka for sending both articles.

[10] French Polynesia (Tahiti)

The dengue epidemic that affects French Polynesia is expanding in
Tahiti, according to local authorities. Since January [2009], 1000
cases of dengue were reported, including 450 [dengue virus] type 4
cases, requiring a dozen hospitalizations, said the director's office
of Overseas Territory Health. Dengue type 4 had not been identified in
French Polynesia since the 1980s.

The strain of the virus is less virulent, however, said Henri-Pierre
Mallet, head of the Office of Health Monitoring in the management of
Public Health. "Apparently, this strain of virus is magnanimous;
patients have a fever, generally not very high, and myalgia, but it
does not progress far." This makes it difficult to monitor the disease
in the population, as it is often taken for a simple flu or a bad cold
by patients. The 1st affected islands were Bora Bora and Taha'a, but
cases are increasing in Tahiti.

Dengue [virus] is transmitted by mosquito bites, [so] the arrival of
the dry season could limit this epidemic.

In 2001, dengue in its potentially fatal hemorrhagic form killed a
dozen Polynesians.
