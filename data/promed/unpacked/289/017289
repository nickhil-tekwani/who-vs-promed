The state-run news agency (Xinhua) has reported outbreaks of typhoid fever
in Heilongjiang Province of northeastern China. Major epidemics are feared.
The number of cases in Heilongjiang Province was not reported, but 82 cases
were reported in neighboring Jilin Province, where flooding was less
severe. More than 2 million people had been evacuated from Heilongjiang
Province by the last week of August, and many are still sleeping out of
doors. Further problems are feared with the approaching winter.

present in flood-ravaged regions of China. The basis for the diagnosis of
typhoid fever is not clear from this report. If anyone has information
confirming the diagnosis by microbiological analyses, please share it with
