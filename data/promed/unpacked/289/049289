Schools closed after hand, foot & mouth disease outbreak in Thailand
------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------
Several schools in central and northern Thailand have been ordered to
close after the outbreak of hand, foot & mouth disease (HFMD), local
media reported on Friday [23 Nov 2007]. The Public Health Office in
northern Lampang Province Friday [23 Nov 2007] ordered the Prachawit
School to close its kindergarten classes after about 10 kids were
found to have contracted the disease, local news network "The Nation" reported.

On Thursday [22 Nov 2007], the office ordered Assumption School in
Lampang to close its kindergarten classes following the outbreak of
the disease. Also in Lambang, local authorities on Friday [23 Nov
2007] ordered a nursery to close after 16 children there contracted HFMD.

Meanwhile, in central Chon Buri Province, several schools in Sattahib
district were ordered to be on alert following an outbreak of HFMD at
a school. About 10 students of Ban Sattahib School got the disease
and received treatment at 2 hospitals in the district, prompting the
district health office to inform other schools to be on alert.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of
infants and children, most frequently affecting children under 10
years of age and infants. It is a human disease unrelated to the
foot-and-mouth disease affecting ruminants and other animals. HFMD is
characterised by fever and vesicles in the mouth and on distal
extremities. Complications are uncommon in most outbreaks, but rare
neurological damage has been associated with some outbreaks. HFMD is
moderately contagious. Infection is spread from person to person by
direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from
blisters, or the stool of infected persons. A child is most
contagious during the first week of the illness. Individual cases and
outbreaks of HFMD occur worldwide, more frequently in summer and early autumn.

A variety of enteric picornaviruses has been associated with HFMD,
the most frequently observed being Human coxsackievirus A16 and Human
enterovirus 71. The etiologic agent in the current outbreak of HFMD
in Thailand has not been determined as yet; previously a virus
identified as Echovirus type 11 was the cause of a HFMD outbreak in a
hospital nursery in Thailand (Clin Infect Dis. 2005 Nov 1;41(9):
1361-2). As well as the diversity of etiologic agents associated with
HFMD, there is considerable genetic heterogeneity in the case of
specific viruses. For example, molecular epidemiological analyses of
recent Human enterovirus 71 isolates in the Western Pacific Region
has indicated that 2 major genogroups of Human enterovirus 71 have
been circulating in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan.
Recent Human enterovirus 71 isolates in Mainland China constitute a
new distinct genetic cluster, subgenogroup C4.

Information on the identity of the virus currently circulating in
Thailand would be welcomed.
