[1] Nursing home outbreak
Date: Wed 21 Apr 2021
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/health/vaccine-nursing-homes-infections.html


An unvaccinated healthcare worker set off a COVID-19 outbreak at a nursing home in Kentucky where the vast majority of residents had been vaccinated, leading to dozens of infections, including 22 cases among residents and employees who were already fully vaccinated, a new study reported Wednesday [21 Apr 2021].

Most of those who were infected with the coronavirus despite being vaccinated did not develop symptoms or require hospitalization, but one vaccinated individual, who was a resident of the nursing home, died, according to the study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Altogether, 26 facility residents were infected, including 18 who had been vaccinated, and 20 healthcare personnel were infected, including 4 who had been vaccinated. Two unvaccinated residents also died.

The report underscores the importance of vaccinating both nursing home residents and healthcare workers who go in and out of the sites, the authors said. While 90% of the 83 residents at the Kentucky nursing home had been vaccinated, only half of the 116 employees had been vaccinated when the outbreak was identified in March of this year [2021].

The study, released in tandem with one involving Chicago nursing homes, underscored the importance of maintaining measures like use of protective gear, infection control protocols and routine testing, no matter the level of vaccination rates. The rise of virus variants also has increased concerns.

Resistance to vaccines has been steep among nursing home staffs nationwide, and the low acceptance rates of vaccination increase the likelihood of outbreaks in facilities, according to the authors, a team of investigators from the CDC and Kentucky's public health department. "To protect skilled nursing facility residents, it is imperative that healthcare providers, as well as skilled nursing facility residents, be vaccinated," the authors of the Kentucky study wrote.

The outbreak involved a variant of the virus that has multiple mutations in the spike protein, of the kind that make the vaccines less effective. Vaccinated residents and healthcare workers at the Kentucky facility were less likely to be infected than those who had not been vaccinated, and they were far less likely to develop symptoms. The study estimated that the vaccine, identified as Pfizer-BioNTech, showed effectiveness of 66% for residents and 75.9% for employees, and were 86% to 87% effective at protecting against symptomatic disease.

In the Kentucky outbreak, the virus variant is not on the CDC's list of those considered variants of concern or interest. But, the study authors note, the variant does have several mutations of importance: D614G, which demonstrates evidence of increased transmissibility; E484K in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, which is also seen in B.1.351, the variant first recognized in South Africa, and P.1. of Brazil; and W152L, which might reduce effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies.

In Chicago, meanwhile, routine screening of nursing home residents and staff members identified 627 coronavirus infections in 78 skilled nursing facilities in the city in February [2021], but only 22 were found in individuals who were already fully vaccinated. Two-thirds of the cases in the vaccinated individuals were asymptomatic, the report found, but 2 residents were hospitalized, and one died.

The authors of the Chicago study said their findings demonstrate that nursing homes should continue to follow recommended infection control practices, such as isolation and quarantine, use of personal protective equipment and doing routine testing, regardless of vaccination status.

They also emphasized the importance of "maintaining high vaccination coverage among residents and staff members" in order to "reduce opportunities for transmission within facilities and exposure among persons who might not have achieved protective immunity after vaccination."

[It's a little shocking that only half of the 116 employees had been vaccinated when the outbreak was identified in March 2021. It should be mandatory for anyone working in direct contact with such a vulnerable population to be vaccinated and wear masks. Even with the residents of the nursing home being vaccinated, all precautions should be taken to avoid infection of this aged and frail population. - Mod.LK]

Details are emerging of a novel variant spreading in Uganda. While the world had been dominated by B lineage variants that emerged in Spring 2020, and their subsequent mutations through 2020 and into 2021, here is an A lineage variant that is showing evidence of accumulating changes in the same areas of the spike protein as B lineages that are causing concern (e.g., the variants first recognized in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil).

"Introductory paragraph: SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Uganda provides an opportunity to provide a focused description of the virus evolution in a small landlocked East African country. Here we show a recent shift in the local epidemic with a newly emerging lineage A.23 evolving into A.23.1, which is now dominating the Uganda cases and has spread to 26 other countries. Although the precise changes in A.23.1 as it has adapted are different from the changes in the variants of concern (VOC), the evolution shows convergence on a similar set of proteins. The A.23.1 spike protein coding region has accumulated changes that resemble many of the changes seen in VOC, including a change at position 613, a change in the furin cleavage site that extends the basic amino acid motif, and multiple changes in the immunogenic N-terminal domain. In addition, the A.23.1lineage encodes changes in non-spike proteins that other VOC show (nsp6, ORF8 and ORF9). The clinical impact of the A.23.1 variant is not yet clear; however, it is essential to continue careful monitoring of this variant, as well as rapid assessment of the consequences of the spike protein changes for vaccine efficacy."

"Discussion: We report the emergence and spread of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant of the A lineage (A.23.1) with multiple protein changes throughout the viral genome. A similar phenomenon recently occurred with the B.1.1.7 lineage, detected first in the southeast of England (5) and now globally, and with the B.1.351 lineage in South Africa (6), and P.1 lineage in Brazil (30), suggesting that local evolution (perhaps to avoid the initial population immune responses) and spread may be a common feature of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, lineage A.23.1 shares many features found in the lineage B VOC, including alteration of key spike protein regions, especially ACE2 binding region which is exposed and immunogenic, the furin cleavage site and the 613/614 change that may increase spike multimer formation. The VOC and A.23.1 strains also encode changes in a similar region of the nsp6 protein, which may be important for altering cellular autophagy pathways that promote replication. Changes or disruption of ORF7, ORF8 and ORF9 are also present in the VOC and A.23.1. The ORF8 changes or deletion probably indicates this protein is unnecessary for human replication; similar deletions accompanied SARS-CoV-2 adaption to humans (31,32).

"We suspect that emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages may be adjusting to infection and replication in humans, and it is notable that the VOCs and lineage A.23.1 share some common features in their evolution. The spike changes are best understood due to the massive global effort to define the receptor and develop vaccines against the infection. The analysis reported in Figure 4 reveals common functions of SARS-CoV-2 that have been altered in all 4 variants, especially nsp6 and ORF8 and ORF9. The functional consequences of the additional non-spike changes warrant additional studies, and the current analysis may focus efforts of the proteins that are commonly changed in the variant lineages. Finally, the susceptibility of A.23.1 to vaccine immune responses is of great importance to determine as vaccines become available in this part of Africa." -Mod.LK]

[B] India (Bengal)
Date: Thu 22 Apr 2021 20:22 IST

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/triple-mutant-bengal-strain-a-new-worry-in-second-wave/articleshow/82188085.cms


The COVID-19 virus that is doing the rounds in Bengal is increasingly being found to be an indigenous triple-mutation (B.1.618), only the 2nd one identified from India after the double mutant type (B.1.617) reported last month [March 2021].

The "Bengal strain," as a scientist has dubbed it, might be more infective, and -- something that experts find particularly worrying -- may be capable of escaping a person's immune surveillance, even if that person was earlier exposed to a virus without this mutation, and even if vaccinated. There has, however, been no research yet to either corroborate or dismiss the fears.

"The proportion of B.1.618 has been growing significantly in recent months in Bengal," said Vinod Scaria, who researches genome mutations at the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) on Twitter, adding, "along with B.1.617 it forms a major lineage in West Bengal".

The IGIB is part of the Indian SARS-Cov-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG), which was set up to monitor and study whether Indians were getting foreign variants through travellers. It was during these studies that the double mutant variant (containing the E484Q and L452R mutations) was identified, mainly from Maharashtra samples.

The sequencing of the viral genomes collected from eastern India is carried out by the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG), Kalyani, around 50 km [31 mi] from Kolkata. The institute houses one of 10 Indian labs working across the country on sequencing genomes from coronavirus patients.

It was the NIBMG that first sequenced the strain [first seen in Bengal] from a patient on 25 Oct 2020. By January this year [2021], it was found to have proliferated in fairly large numbers.

Data submitted from India to GISAID, a global science initiative and primary source established in 2008 that provides open-access to genomic data of influenza viruses, show B.1.618 is the third-most common variant sequenced in the last 60 days across the country, causing nearly 12% of the cases. The double-mutated B.1.617, at 28%, is the most common among sequences, followed by B.1.1.7 (the variant [first identified in the] UK).

What's worrying to scientists is that the triple-mutated variant carries the E484K mutation, a characteristic of the variants [first detected in South Africa and Brazil]. "E484K is known to be an immune escape variant, which means that previously raised antibodies against a virus without this mutation may be less effective in inhibiting the virus from infecting and causing disease in humans. This includes antibodies raised from vaccines," said NIBMG associate professor Sreedhar Chinnaswamy.

In other words, you may not be safe from this variant if you had previously been infected by another strain of the virus, or even if you have been vaccinated.

"The Bengal strain (B.1.618)," explained Chinnaswamy, "has 4 signature mutations that are distinct from the so-called 'double mutant' circulating in some parts of India in recent months," adding, "It contains the now fixed D614G mutation, that can be called 'the 1st variant' to be identified from the virus that supposedly originated from Wuhan, China. It also has the E484K mutation."

A member of the team involved in the sequencing of the variant at the Kalyani-based institute, Chinnaswamy said the new variant has "deletions" in the spike protein. "These deletions are not in the region of the spike protein that contacts the human ACE2 receptor, and we don't know what significance they may have in the viral infection cycle," he said.

Members of this Bengal lineage or variant have also been found in the USA, Singapore, Switzerland and Finland. The variant was first found in a sample outside India on 22 Apr 2020.

A majority of the cases in Maharashtra and Gujarat have been found to contain the double (E484Q and L452R) mutant variant, whereas Delhi and Punjab cases are mostly of the [variant first detected in the UK]. No such pattern has yet been detected in south India.

"This is yet another variant," said immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly from CSIR Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata. "Interestingly, a lot of variants are coming up with similar mutations -- E484K, also present in P.1 [first detected in] Brazil, and 1.351 [first detected in] South Africa -- which is an immune escape variant. Perhaps these help the virus being more successful in infections and thus multiple variants are converging to similar mutations."

[C] United States: variant evolution

Abstract
Since the 1st case of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide and within a year has caused 2.29 million deaths globally. With dramatically increasing infection numbers, and the arrival of new variants with increased infectivity, tracking the evolution of its genome is crucial for effectively controlling the pandemic and informing vaccine platform development. Our study explores evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a representative cohort of sequences covering the entire genome in the United States, through all of 2020 and early 2021. Strikingly, we detected many accumulating single nucleotide variations (SNVs) encoding amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a pattern indicative of RNA editing enzymes as major mutators of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We report 3 major variants through October 2020. These revealed 14 key mutations that were found in various combinations among 14 distinct predominant signatures. These signatures likely represent evolutionary lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA and reveal clues to its evolution, such as a mutational burst in the summer of 2020 likely leading to a homegrown new variant, and a trend towards higher mutational load among viral isolates, but with occasional mutation loss. The last quartile of 2020 revealed a concerning accumulation of mostly novel low frequency replacement mutations in the spike protein, and a hypermutable glutamine residue near the putative furin cleavage site. Finally, the end of the year data revealed the presence of known variants of concern, including B.1.1.7, which has acquired additional spike mutations. Overall, our results suggest that predominant viral sequences are dynamically evolving over time, with periods of mutational bursts and unabated mutation accumulation. This high level of existing variation, even at low frequencies and especially in the spike-encoding region may become problematic when superspreader events, akin to serial Founder Events in evolution, drive these rare mutations to prominence.

Author summary
The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused the death of more than 2.29 million people and continues to be a severe threat internationally. Although simple measures such as social distancing, periodic lockdowns and hygiene protocols were immediately put into force, the infection rates were only temporarily minimized. When infection rates exploded again, new variants of the virus began to emerge. Our study focuses on a representative set of sequences from the United States throughout 2020 and early 2021. We show that the driving force behind the variants of public health concern is widespread infection and superspreader events. In particular, we show accumulation of mutations over time with little loss from genetic drift, including in the spike region, which could be problematic for vaccines and therapies. This lurking accumulated genetic variation may be a superspreader event from becoming more common and lead to variants that can escape the immune protection provided by the existing vaccines.

[Superspreader events are the predominant means of virus dissemination, and it seems also the main evolutionary driver. The only way to prevent more variants from occurring is for individuals to avoid crowds, especially at indoor events, get vaccinated, and wear masks. - Mod.LK

[3] India: case update
Date: Fri 23 Apr 2021 00:04 EDT

India recorded the world's highest daily tally of 314 835 COVID-19 infections on Thursday [22 Apr 2021] as a 2nd wave of the pandemic raised new fears about the ability of crumbling health services to cope. Health officials across northern and western India, including the capital New Delhi, said they were in crisis, with most hospitals full and running out of oxygen.

Some doctors advised patients to stay at home, while a crematorium in the eastern city of Muzaffarpur said it was being overwhelmed with bodies, and grieving families had to wait their turn. A crematorium east of Delhi built funeral pyres in its parking lot.

"Right now there are no beds, no oxygen. Everything else is secondary," said Shahid Jameel, a virologist and director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University. "The infrastructure is crumbling."

Six hospitals in New Delhi had run out of oxygen, according to a tally shared by the city government, and the city's deputy chief minister said neighbouring states were holding back supplies for their own needs.
"It might become difficult for hospitals here to save lives," Manish Sisodia said in a televised address.

Another 2104 people died in the space of a day, taking India's cumulative toll to 184 657, according to the health ministry data. The previous record rise in cases was in the United States, which had 297 430 new cases on one day in January [2021], though its infection rate has since fallen sharply. Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said the city needed about 5000 more intensive care beds.

Similar surges of infections, notably in South America, are threatening to overwhelm other health services. China said it was willing to help India, although it was not immediately clear what this might consist of.

Only a tiny fraction of the Indian population has received a vaccination. Authorities have announced vaccines will be available to anyone over 18 from 1 May 2021, but experts say there will not be enough for the 600 million people who will become eligible.

Health experts say India let its guard down during the winter, when daily cases were about 10 000 and seemed to be under control, and lifted restrictions to allow big gatherings.

[The surge in India continues without abating. The country needs to make a major effort to vaccinate the population as soon as possible to put an end to the increasing number of cases on a daily basis. This is a humanitarian crisis, as well as an economic one.

The unofficial US COVID-19 toll reached 31 862 987 cases and 569 404 deaths, up 69 272 and 929, respectively, from this time a day ago. This also needs to be brought down. See real-time coronavirus case tracker at https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/85354. - Mod.LK]
