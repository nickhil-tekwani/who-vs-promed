Suspected human rabies exposures surge in Palm Beach County
-----------------------------------------------------------
Keep an eye out for angry raccoons, hostile dogs and dizzy bats. These are the culprits largely behind a multiplying number of suspected rabies exposures among people in Palm Beach County. The number of people vaccinated in the county for possible rabies so far this year has more than doubled from the same time a year ago, state records show.

That's 47 people in the first 4 months of 2012 compared to 19 during the same period last year. The number dwarfs those in neighboring counties, which report fewer than 10 so far. Broward County has 2 suspected cases so far. The 47 so far this year compares to 80 in Palm Beach County for all of 2011, according to the state Health Department.

Rabies is a fatal viral disease that affects the central nervous system, causing aggressive or passive behavior and paralysis before death.

Health officials are not alarmed by the surge in possible human cases, said Tim O'Connor, spokesman for the Palm Beach County Health Department. Although inexplicable, it's normal for the number to fluctuate, he said.

"It's not that there are more rabies [cases], it's more animals biting people," said O'Connor, adding that there's no way of knowing if the suspected human exposures would have developed into rabies.

In February, the Health Department issued a rabies alert after a Wellington family picked up a stray dog that later turned out to be rabid.

They found "Lucky," a 2-year-old terrier-mix, along Florida's Turnpike, Walesky said. But several days later, the dog's luck ran out and animal-control officers got a call from a vet: Lucky was sick and it looked like rabies. It was euthanized and tested positive for rabies. The 2 adults and 3 children that had taken Lucky home were given a series of [post exposure prophylaxis] rabies shots, and that included a 5-year-old girl the rabid terrier had scratched.

In March, a raccoon found in Palm Beach County tested positive for rabies, but no one was exposed, O'Connor said.

Health officials urge people to look out for animals exhibiting signs of sickness and aggressive behavior. Animal-control officers stress the need for pet owners to report animal bites and to make sure they keep pets'rabies vaccinations up to date, as required by law.

They remind that owners must supervise their pets when outside so they don't come into contact with wild animals.

Second canine rabies case confirmed in Carlsbad
-----------------------------------------------
New Mexico health officials say 11 people are receiving [post exposure prophylaxis] vaccinations to prevent them from developing rabies after being exposed to a dog that had rabies.

The Department of Health announced it confirmed rabies in the 8-year-old dog. The animal developed signs of the viral disease and died 2 days later. This is the 2nd dog in the Carlsbad area to contract rabies this year. The 1st case was in January.

Health officials point to an outbreak of rabid skunks, some of which have come in contact with pets.

They say a total of 26 people from Eddy County have received vaccinations since the beginning of the year due to exposures to rabid animals and bites from stray dogs and wild animals.

Bethlehem: After fox bites, 2 men get rabies shots
--------------------------------------------------
A fox that bit a man visiting Bethlehem on Wednesday has tested positive for rabies, the city Health Bureau said Friday. That man and a 2nd man bitten by a fox the same day are receiving rabies shots, health officials said.

The 1st man was bitten on Stanford Road, between Eaton Avenue and Shelbourne Drive, in the Lehigh County portion of the city. The other bite happened not far away, and it was possible the same fox was involved, officials said.

On 8 May 2012, a woman in east Allentown reported a fox bit her ankle and hand as she walked her dog in the morning. That fox also tested positive for rabies, and the woman was started on a series of rabies shots.

The Pennsylvania Bureau of Laboratories in Exton, Chester County, tested the Bethlehem fox and determined it was rabid.

Bethlehem Mayor John Callahan's office encouraged anyone who sees a potentially rabid animal to call police. The office also reminded residents not to leave pets outside unattended, and not to leave food outside that might attract rabid animals.

Rabies can make a wild animal unusually aggressive or unusually tame.

In the Allentown case, the woman who was bitten tied her dog's leash around the reddish fox and held it down until authorities showed up at the Hidden Valley apartment complex near Tacoma Court to pick it up.

The fox was killed to prepare it for the rabies test, authorities said.

[Rabies is a preventable disease in most cases. We build a barrier of protection between us and rabid wildlife by vaccinating our pets. As responsible pet owners we must keep our pets vaccinated against this fatal disease.

In the last news story, I wondered how the fox bit her on the ankle and the hand, but when reading further if she tied the fox up with the dog’s leash, then it is easy to understand how she may have been bitten on the hand.

In some of these places we hope the community is organizing drives to get pets vaccinated. None of these articles mentioned any vaccination clinics or even pointed people to the veterinarian to get the animals protected against rabies.
