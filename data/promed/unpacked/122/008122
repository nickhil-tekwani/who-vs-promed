Ebola virus disease, West Africa (Situation as of 2 May 2014)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Guinea
------
As of 18:00 on 1 May 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 226 clinical cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 149 deaths. Of 210 patients tested for ebolavirus infection, 127 cases have been laboratory confirmed by PCR, including 81 deaths. In addition, 44 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 55 cases (34 deaths) are classified as suspected cases.

25 health care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (11 confirmed). The median age of all clinical cases is 35 years (interquartile range 25-47 years). The female : male ratio remains unchanged at 1.2 : 1. 7 patients are in isolation facilities in Guinea; Conakry (4 patients, 2 confirmed) and Guekedou (3 patients, all confirmed).

The geographical distribution of clinical cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak is:
Conakry (53 cases, including 24 deaths),
Guekedou (140/99),
Macenta (22/16),
Kissidougou (6/5),
Dabola (4/4) and
Djingaraye (1/1).

The cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (72/49); Macenta (13/10); Kissidougou (1/1); and Dabola (1/1). The date of isolation of the most recent confirmed cases is 30 Apr 2014 in Conakry and Guekedou.

Contact tracing activities continue in Conakry and Guekedou. Experts in epidemiology and social mobilization will be deployed to strengthen contact tracing teams in Guekedou. All the contacts from the other 4 outbreak locations have completed their 21 day medical surveillance period and have been discharged from follow up.

The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities and contact tracing activities. The recent introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases.

As the incubation period for EVD can be up to 3 weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.

Liberia
-------
The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has completed the process of revising clinical cases of EVD based on their final laboratory results. All cases which tested PCR positive or ebolavirus IgM positive have been reclassified as "confirmed acute" cases. PCR negative but ebolavirus IgG positive cases are considered "confirmed convalescent" cases.

Following the reclassification of suspected cases, as of 2 May 2014 the total number of clinical EVD cases reported in Liberia is 13 (6 confirmed, 2 probable and 5 suspected cases), including 11 deaths. There were 2 confirmed cases in HCWs, both of whom died. There have been no new clinical cases in Liberia since 6 Apr 2014.

The above criteria will be used to classify future cases of EVD in Liberia, should they occur. In addition, in the situation where neither PCR nor serological testing is carried out and/or the results of repeated testing remain equivocal, future clinical cases and deaths will classified as either probable or suspected based on the presence of a clinically compatible illness and evidence of epidemiological linkage to known confirmed case(s).

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event.

Why Ebola isn't just Africa's problem
-------------------------------------
A Canadian man returning from Liberia recently alarmed health officials with fears that he might have the Ebola virus. Although in good health when he traveled, the man was admitted to the intensive-care unit in Saskatchewan with classic symptoms of the disease.

That health scare, and others in recent weeks, were a wake-up call to those who saw the outbreaks as an "African problem." They remind us that people -- and their infections -- are not bound by borders. To those who claim we can't afford foreign aid, I respond that we can't afford to think of health threats as "foreign" and "domestic."

Ebola is a deadly viral infection that many people 1st learned about through novels like "The Hot Zone" and the film "Contagion," which featured the specter of a deadly uncontrollable outbreak wreaking global havoc.

As a physician from Nigeria now researching infectious diseases at the University of Michigan, USA, I'm not surprised by the Canadian scare -- which turned out to be a false alarm. If anything, I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner.

Ebola is spread when people come in direct contact with blood or secretions from an infected person, or when they are exposed to contaminated objects, such as needles. This means patients should be treated in isolation. Ebola victims suffer skin rash, fever and internal bleeding. The World Health Organization reports that Ebola outbreaks have a fatality rate of up to 90 percent.

Today, we live in a connected world ripe for an Ebola pandemic. The infected may appear healthy for up to 3 weeks while transmitting it to unsuspecting people. In this age of high-speed travel, that person could tour the world 3 times over -- all while unknowingly spreading the disease.

We've seen it before. In 2002, the deadly flu-like illness known as SARS broke out in China. Within a year, it killed nearly 800 people, including at least 8 in the United States. The U.S. fared even worse during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009. Of the nearly half a million deaths, nearly 12 500 were American. The death toll in the West African Ebola outbreak has risen to 142, and experts say it's a uniquely challenging outbreak.

We do not have effective drugs or a vaccine to fight Ebola. There is simply not much incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in medical solutions when there is little chance of a financial return. Where there is little private sector input, foreign aid can help. Unfortunately, many in the global north believe that foreign aid is not a good investment. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey showed that 61 percent of Americans thought that too much is being spent on foreign aid (incidentally, most people significantly over-estimate how much aid is given). But there is nothing "foreign" about foreign aid. When it comes to infectious diseases, aid can be about self-protection, not altruism. Take smallpox. Once a global threat, smallpox was eradicated by "foreign aid," which supported the development of the 1st universally successful vaccine.

With the same resolve, we can put an end to malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and even Ebola. By investing in research for early diagnosis, treatment and vaccines for "African" diseases such as Ebola, we can make the type of progress that we have made with heart disease, diabetes and cancer. After all, we are more connected than we realize.
