Outbreak of Classical Swine Fever in the Vladimir Oblast
--------------------------------------------------------
In the course of testing of pathological material taken from a pig
found dead in a backyard farm "OAO Kovrovski lesokombinat" in Melehovo
village (Kovrov Rayon, Vladimir Oblast), positive results for
classical swine fever [CSF] were obtained by the All-Russian Research
Institute of Veterinary Virology and Microbiology (GNU VNIIVViM). The
pig population was 86 pigs; after the disease was diagnosed 74 pigs
died. Measures aimed at eradication of the foci of infection are
taken; the epizootological investigation is carried out.

[Russia reported to the OIE, on 15 Feb 2010, a recurring epizootic of
CSF, initially identified in wild boar in 2 "hunting units" and one
"state wildlife reserve" in the Smolenskaya oblast (province). The
outbreak had started on 23 Jan 2010. (See also Mod.PC's commentary in
archived 20100217.0557). Until 21 Feb 2011, a total of 15 outbreaks
have been reported, involving both domestic and wild swine. The most
recent outbreak was reported on 21 Feb 2011, concerning confirmed
cases in a game farm for wild boar in the Smolenskaya oblast.

All reports, and an interactive map showing the outbreaks (with
distinctive marking for domestic and wild swine) are available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8951.

According to OIE's WAHID interface data "Detailed country (ies)
disease incidence," the following oblasts (and number of outbreaks)
were reportedly CSF-infected during 2010: Ivanovskaya (1),
Kostyromskaya (1), Saratovskaya (2), Volgogradskaya (4), Voronezhskaya
(4). This, likely, relates to the disease in domestic pigs. Hence, the
current outbreak is the 1st one in the Vladimir oblast.

Russia applies CSF vaccination in domestic pigs; the number of
vaccinated animals, during 2010, was 42 210 740. The measure applied
in wild boars is, reportedly, "monitoring." - Mod.AS]
