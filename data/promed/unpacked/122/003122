Finland reports possible bird flu in seagulls
---------------------
Finland's Agriculture Ministry said on Friday it had found a possible
outbreak of bird flu in seagulls in the northern town of Oulu, but probably
not the highly pathogenic strain that has caused deaths in Asia.
A ministry official said laboratory tests had identified the virus among
"sick and dead seagulls" found in a park in Oulu, though it was not clear
how many of them were carrying the disease or how serious a strain of flu
it was.
"Our view a the moment is that if it is bird flu, it is low pathogenic
avian influenza, not the high pathogenic which has been found in Asia,"
senior ministry official Riitta Heinonen told Reuters. Final test results
will be ready in 3 weeks.
"First we will make certain which type of virus it is and then we will
check other wild birds in the area," she said. "There are no poultry farms
nearby."
Low-pathogenic bird flu is not uncommon and can be found in as many as 30
percent of wild birds, experts say.
But monitoring is increasing as fears grow of a global outbreak, especially
since the avian virus has spread from Asia into Siberia in eastern Russia
and Kazakhstan.
Some experts warn it could spread to Europe via migratory birds as they
move to warmer areas for winter after nesting in Siberia. The World Health
Organisation has urged governments to stock up with antiviral drugs such as
Tamiflu.
Finland shares a 1300-km (800-mile) eastern border with Russia and borders
on Sweden, Norway and the Baltic to the west.
Bird flu has killed 62 people in Asia since 2003 and forced the slaughter
of millions of fowl. The European Union, of which Finland is a member, said
earlier this week it believed there was only a remote or low chance of it
striking the EU.
Veterinary experts from the EU said on Thursday bird flu in Central Asia
was "not a direct threat for Europe and there is no need for general
emergency actions".
Philip Tod, spokesman for consumer health and protection at the European
Commission in Brussels, said Finnish vets expected the seagulls' case to
prove to be a low pathogenic strain of influenza.
The Finnish ministry said it had been improving disease protection for
poultry facilities "systematically over several years". The import of live
birds and poultry products from areas stricken by bird flu is banned.

the European Union declared policy of enhanced surveillance in wild birds,
as well as in domestic fowl. More information on this outbreak would be
appreciated as it becomes available. Mods.AS/MPP]
