In North Carolina, poultry workers are quitting in large numbers after an unknown chemical was introduced at their plant.

At a facility processing 540 000 chickens a day, workers allege they're being exposed to a toxic chemical feeling like it's "invaded your brain."

Workers at the Mountaire Farms poultry plant in rural Robeson County, North Carolina, said about 4 months ago, something changed. One day things were running as expected, and the next there was a sharp, suffocating kind of odor one worker said felt like it "invaded your brain."

"It stings your eyes and throat; it's like a burning in your nasal cavity," said Sharon, an immigrant who has worked at Mountaire's Lumber Bridge plant for more than a decade and asked not to be identified by her real name because she fears retaliation from her employer. "Whatever it is, it gives us headaches and it makes us sneeze. It causes a lot of mucus and it makes it feel like your throat is cracking. It's something in the water with the chickens because if the mist gets in your eyes, it stings like acid."

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 requires employers to provide a workplace free from hazards which can cause death or serious physical harm to employees. While poultry plants are inherently dangerous workplaces and the repetitive motions of the job can take a serious toll on workers' bodies, the onus is entirely on processors to properly manage the risks associated with chemical use.

To chill and process poultry, slaughtering and processing facilities like Mountaire Farms store thousands of pounds of hazardous chemicals for use during the cleaning and preparation of carcasses. After a bird is slaughtered and its feathers and internal organs are removed, the carcass is washed, inspected, and chilled. In the United States, chickens are often washed with chlorine and other disinfectants during processing to reduce pathogens like salmonella and campylobacter, which frequently colonize their intestinal tracts and can cause foodborne illness in humans. Peracetic acid is also a common "processing aid" in poultry plants, used to kill or inhibit the growth of pathogens.

This "washing procedure" on the processing line involves applying chemicals via spray or wash, or as part of the water-chilling process lowering carcass temperature. The procedure was banned by the European Union in 1997 and halted virtually all imports of U.S. poultry to EU countries thereafter, but it is still common here and U.S. regulators have specifically deemed chlorine safe for use.

Records from the North Carolina Department of Labor (NC DOL) describe Mountaire Farms' Lumber Bridge plant as the largest facility processing large chickens in the world, slaughtering approximately 540 000 chickens per day. In 2009, a fatal ammonia gas leak at the plant -- where Sharon works -- killed 1 worker and seriously injured 3 others. In response, state regulators cited the company with 20 workplace violations, including 1 for failing to properly fit workers with cleaned, disinfected respirators. Six years later, in 2015, the company was implicated in a salmonella outbreak in 2 states, after 1 of its distributors traced the pathogen's source to 2 truckloads of raw chicken parts it received from Mountaire. The distributor, AdvancePierre Foods, eventually recalled 1.7 million pounds [0.8 million kg] of chicken.

In early September [2021], OxFam America ranked North Carolina worst in the nation for wage policies, worker protections, and rights to organize. But there is a growing, worker-led movement in the state and it's attempting to push NC DOL to address workplace safety violations in a real way. On 28 Sep 2021 over 150 people joined the 1st-ever North Carolina Worker Safety Town Hall, where a labor attorney provided political education about the function of NC DOL. Workers from various industries also shared testimonies about workplace safety issues and advocated for better enforcement priorities.

Even though Mountaire workers say they are being exposed to an unidentified chemical in what they call "overwhelming doses" over long shifts, they told The Counter that the company has still not told them what the chemical is, the potential hazards it poses to their health -- and, most important -- how to protect themselves during exposure.

The Counter approached Mountaire Farms on 5 separate occasions with requests to identify the chemical workers began to smell earlier this summer, as well as to confirm that the plant adheres to safety protocols, among other questions. The company did not respond.

Rosa, another longtime Lumber Bridge worker who asked this news service not to use her real name for fear of retaliation, said employees at the plant also get "total silence" from Mountaire Farms and from their direct managers and supervisors -- even though multiple workers have complained about the effects of the chemical. Rosa said she can still remember the first time she came to work and noticed a difference.

"I walked on the line and my eyes watered and it felt like something was getting in my brain," she said. "You feel it everywhere, impregnating your head. We weren't sure where it was coming from, but from then on we had headaches and watery eyes. You feel like you want to throw up and you feel dizzy. From the time you get to the line until you leave work, you feel sick -- and then sometimes you feel sick when you're at home."

Rosa said she suspects the chemical is ammonia. Sharon said she believes it's chlorine. Ilana Dubester, the founder and executive director of non-profit advocacy organization El Vínculo Hispano, a resource center for the local Latino community, said she has heard it's peracetic acid. Dubester's organization interviewed several workers about the unknown chemical with the goal of helping them file a complaint. But if the issue is related to ammonia, chlorine, or peracetic acid -- all can be used in daily operations.

Dr. Howard Hu, a specialist in occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, is an expert on the impact of toxic chemical exposure to human health. Even without knowing which specific chemical is in use, Hu said it's clear to him the symptoms workers describe suggest they are being exposed to something toxic -- or at least toxic at the levels they're encountering on the line.

"It's critical that the identity of the chemical and the levels of exposure are known. That information should be available to them. In fact, the OSHA Act includes a provision called 'the right to know,' which basically says the employer needs to keep the so-called material safety data sheet on file for every chemical that is used in the plant, and that information needs to be available on request," Hu said.

Immigrant Mountaire workers said they do not have health insurance and they have been dealing with the effects of exposure by taking over-the-counter medications and drinking herbal teas.

NC DOL said to ensure chemical safety in the workplace, information about the identities and hazards of the chemicals must be available and understandable to workers. Workplaces in the state must also adhere to federal OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS). This criteria for classification requires -- among other things -- that employers who use hazardous chemicals in their processes provide labels including a harmonized signal word like "danger" or "warning," a pictogram and hazard statement, and that they train workers on understanding the label elements and safety data sheets.

Sharon said no one at her facility has ever talked to her about what chemicals are in use or what their risks are -- and also claims she has never been told where to access such information in Spanish.

According to NC DOL, if workers are being exposed to chemicals making them sick, they should 1st make their supervisor or management aware of the problem so the employer can "take appropriate action to correct." If the employer refuses or does not make the needed corrections, or the employee feels issues still remain, NC DOL said the employee can make a complaint with its Occupational Safety and Health Division (OSH) "with the alleged hazards noted."

But before a worker can address a violation of their workplace rights, they have to 1st be aware of what those rights actually are. Therein lies another critical information gap: Dubester told The Counter none of the workers El Vínculo Hispano spoke to were aware of OSH. She also said neither Mountaire's supervisors and managers nor the staffing agencies they contract with directed workers to OSH or even told them of its existence -- though multiple workers reported the effects of their exposure to management. "These are serious symptoms. One man at the plant had to go to the hospital after developing a lung infection" [said Dubster].

After Dubester's organization informed workers of their rights and of the function of OSH as a state workplace safety and health regulatory agency, 1 worker decided to move forward with an official complaint. The North Carolina Justice Center, a research and advocacy organization, filed the complaint on the worker's behalf on 19 Aug 2021.

The responsibility to reduce workers' exposure to toxic chemicals falls squarely on Mountaire, Hu said. In an ideal world, Mountaire would avoid toxic chemicals whenever possible, create barriers to exposure, and install ventilation that would reduce air level concentrations of whatever the chemical is. Like most processing facilities, Mountaire's Lumber Bridge plant has no windows.

[This is a horribly sad and disturbing account of this processing plant and its workers.

As stated in the article, there are some chemicals used at a processing plant. After all, some of us use bleach to clean things or do laundry with, so some chemicals at a food processing plant may be expected. However, I would suspect these processing lines need fans and ventilation and it seems this ventilation system is perhaps inadequate, maybe non-existent for the current arrangement of this processing plant.

Known chemicals used at chicken processing plants include ammonia, chlorine, and peracetic acid.

Clinical signs of ammonia poisoning:

**Inhalation of ammonia may cause nasopharyngeal and tracheal burns, bronchiolar and alveolar edema, and airway destruction resulting in respiratory distress or failure. Ammonia's odor threshold is sufficiently low to acutely provide adequate warning of its presence (odor threshold = 5 ppm; OSHA PEL = 50 ppm). However, ammonia causes olfactory fatigue or adaptation, making its presence difficult to detect when exposure is prolonged. Anhydrous ammonia is lighter than air and will therefore rise (will not settle in low-lying areas); however, vapors from liquefied gas are initially heavier than air and may spread along the ground.

**Skin/Eye Contact - the extent of injury produced by exposure to ammonia depends on the duration of the exposure and the concentration of the gas or liquid. Even low airborne concentrations (100 ppm) of ammonia may produce rapid eye and nose irritation. Higher concentrations may cause severe eye injury. Contact with concentrated ammonia solutions, such as some industrial cleaners (25%), may cause serious corrosive injury, including skin burns, permanent eye damage, or blindness. The full extent of damage to the eyes may not be clear until up to 1 week after the injury is sustained. Contact with liquefied ammonia can cause frostbite injury.

**Ingestion - ingestion of ammonium hydroxide, while uncommon, results in corrosive damage to the mouth, throat, and stomach. Ingestion of ammonia does not normally result in systemic poisoning."

Clinical signs of chlorine poisoning:

• Respiratory - being water soluble, is primarily absorbed by the upper airway. Exposure to low concentrations (1-10 ppm) may cause eye and nasal irritation, sore throat and cough.

• Inhalation of higher concentrations (> 15 ppm) can very rapidly lead to respiratory distress. This can occur almost immediately with initial symptoms of stridor, followed shortly by wheezing, rales, hemoptysis, and subsequent pulmonary edema. Clinical signs of pulmonary edema will present 2-4 hours following a moderate exposure and 30-60 minutes following a severe exposure. Immediate onset of laryngospasm with respiratory arrest can occur.

• Cardiovascular - initial tachycardia and hypertension followed by hypotension may occur.

• Gastrointestinal - ingestion of chlorine can cause significant esophageal and stomach injury. Odynophagia (pain when swallowing), drooling and refusal of food suggest a more significant injury. Substernal chest pain, abdominal pain and rigidity suggest profound injury and potential perforation of the esophagus and/or stomach.

• Dermal - chlorine causes skin irritation and with sufficient concentration can cause, burning pain, inflammation, and blisters. Liquefied chlorine can cause frostbite injury.

• Ocular - low vapor concentrations can cause burning, redness, conjunctivitis, and tearing. Higher concentrations may result in corneal burns."

Clinical signs of peracetic acid poisoning:

"Also known as peroxyacetic acid (PAA), peracetic acid is best known for its ability to sanitize surfaces and objects. It "is characterized by a very rapid action against all microorganisms."

Peracetic acid is considered environmentally friendly due to its decomposition products, including acetic acid, oxygen, and water. However, it also is highly corrosive, and it can severely irritate the eyes, skin, and the respiratory system.

Peracetic acid in low concentrations can irritate skin and eyes, as well as cause throat and breathing difficulties. However, in concentrated form, it can cause serious eye and skin damage.
(Extracted from https://bit.ly/3E2LcrN)

"Liquid and mist are corrosive and can cause burns, direct contact could cause irreversible damage to eyes including blindness and/or irreversible destruction of skin tissue. Vapor/mist will irritate the nose, throat and lungs, but will usually subside when exposure ceases. The severity of the effects depends on the concentration and dose.

This product is irritating to the respiratory system and can cause pulmonary inflammation and edema, especially if it is inhaled in the aerosol form. In case of accidental ingestion, necrosis may result from mucous membrane burns (mouth, esophagus and stomach). Oxygen rapid release may cause stomach swelling and hemorrhaging, which may produce major, or even fatal, injury to organs if a large amount has been ingested. Corneal lesions and irreversible damage if contact with the eyes occurs.

This product can be corrosive to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Consideration should be given to careful endoscopy as stomach or esophageal burns, perforations or strictures may occur. Careful gastric lavage with an endotracheal tube in place should be considered. Observations may be warranted. Treatment is controlled removal of exposure followed by symptomatic and supportive care."

Reading through this information, I am concerned for the workers, and potentially for the food we eat coming from this processing plant. A serious investigation of what is going on needs to happen. ProMED welcomes any further information regarding the potential specific toxic chemical(s) involved in this outbreak. - Mod.TG]
