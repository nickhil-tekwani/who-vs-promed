The National Institute for Infectious Diseases (NIID) has released the results of a new analysis of domestic infections based on the genetic information of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2], suggesting that the infection may have gone unnoticed even as the epidemic was coming to a halt after March [2020] and that the virus with the common genetic characteristics may have spread across the country since late June [2020].

By [16 Jul 2020], the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) collected samples from a total of 3700 people in Japan, including those confirmed to be infected, to determine how similar the new coronaviruses are to each other. Because the genes of the new coronaviruses gradually mutate when infecting people, the institute compared the genomes (total genetic information) of the viruses obtained from different infected people to determine how similar the viruses are to each other.

According to the analysis released on [5 Jun 2020], a virus with an estimated 3 months' worth of mutated genes was found in mid-June [2020] compared to the "European strain" virus that is believed to have led to the outbreak since March [2020]. Later, a virus with the same characteristics was found in samples from hundreds of people across the country.

Samples obtained so far have not identified any virus with this characteristic that could link the virus to the European strain. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) said it is possible that asymptomatic people may have been unaware of the infection and quietly passed it on to others. As economic activity resumed, the epidemic could not be contained in Tokyo alone but spread throughout the country after late June," the institute's analysis said.

General COVID-19 situation summary in the Americas
--------------------------------------------------
Since the 1st confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Region of the Americas [21 Jan 2020] and until [2 Aug 2020], a cumulative total of 9 484 066 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 359 376 deaths, have been reported.

Between [2 Jul 2020] and [2 Aug 2020], there were 4 185 187 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 107 474 additional deaths, reported in the Region of the Americas. This represents a 77% relative increase in cases and a 42% relative increase in deaths. The largest relative increases in cases and deaths occurred in the subregions of Central America (130% increase in cases and 142% increase in deaths), the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean Islands (98% increase in cases and 48% increase in deaths), and South America (82% increase in cases and 67% increase in deaths).

The highest proportions of new cases were reported in the Bahamas (476%), Costa Rica (385%), the United States Virgin Islands (376%), and Saint Pierre and Miquelon (300%), while the highest proportions of new deaths were reported in Costa Rica (863%), Venezuela (213%), and Colombia (198%). /2

In all geographic subdivisions within the Region, the increasing trend continues, both in the number of cases and number of deaths (Figure 1 - Distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, by epidemiological week (EW) and subdivision of the Americas. EW 1 to EW 31 of 2020 [1 Jan-1 Aug 2020].

COVID-19 situation among the indigenous peoples in select countries
----------------------
The following is an update on the COVID-19 situation among indigenous peoples in countries for which information is available.

In Bolivia, since the 1st confirmed cases 4 of COVID-19 in the country and as of [27 Jul 2020] /5, there have been 1546 confirmed cases reported in the indigenous population (Table 1 - Distribution of positive cases of COVID-19 by original rural indigenous territories and protected areas. Bolivia, [10 Mar 2020 to 27 Jul 2020]), including 4 deaths (2.6%).

The Guaraní indigenous people account for the majority of reported cases (77%), which with a population of 58 990 /8, would reach a crude incidence rate of 13.0 cases per 10 000 population.

In Brazil, since the 1st confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country /9 and as of [25 Jul 2020], there have been 24 609 cases of COVID-19 reported among indigenous peoples in the Indigenous Health Care Subsystem (SasiSUS, per the Portuguese acronym), of which 14 064 (58%) were confirmed, 9433 (37%) were discarded, 226 (1%) were excluded, and 886 (4%) remain under investigation. The 34 Special Districts of Indigenous Health (DSEI, per the Portuguese acronym) all reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. Of the total confirmed cases, 259 (1.8%) died of COVID-19.

The North and Northeast regions continue to report incidence rates over 1000 cases per 100 000 population, occurring in 17 out of 19 DSEI in the North Region and 3 out of 6 DSEI in the Northeast Region. In the Central-West, South, and Southeast regions, there has been a significant increase in cases compared to the figures provided in the [15 Jul 2020] PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Alert on COVID-19 in indigenous peoples /10.

The highest mortality rates per 100 000 population have been reported in the DSEI in the North and Central-West regions, as shown in Table 2 - Distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths among indigenous peoples assisted by SasiSUS, by DSEI, up to epidemiological week (EW) 30 of 2020. Brazil.

In Canada, since the 1st confirmed case of COVID-1911 in the country and as of [31 Jul 2020], there have been 404 confirmed cases, including 6 deaths, reported among indigenous peoples. Cases have been distributed amongst the provinces of Alberta (152 cases), Saskatchewan (90 cases), Ontario (63 cases), British Columbia (64 cases), and Quebec (35 cases). /12

In Colombia, since the 1st confirmed case of COVID-19 /13 in the country and as of [30 Jul 2020], there have been 4266 confirmed cases, including 151 deaths and 2435 recovered, reported among indigenous peoples, representing 1.49% of the national cases, with a crude incidence rate of 223.9 cases per 100 000 indigenous people.

Among the indigenous peoples of Colombia (for which information is available), the indigenous nations with incidence rates greater than 1000 cases per 100 000 population, in decreasing order, are the Tikuna (2420.2 cases per 100 000 population), Muisca (1384.2 cases per 100 000 population), Andoque (1341.5 cases per 100 000 population), and Mokana (1032.4 per 100 000 population); the Andoque peoples have a population of less than 1000 (Table 3 - Distribution of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and crude incidence rates among indigenous peoples by indigenous nation. Colombia, [6 Mar 2020 to 30 Jul 2020]).

In Ecuador, since the 1st confirmed case of COVID-1914 and as of [20 Jul 2020], there have been 1453 confirmed cases, including 27 deaths (1.9%), reported among indigenous peoples of the Ecuadorian Amazon.

Similar to that observed in other countries in the Americas, the indigenous peoples that currently have a total population of less than 5000 persons have the highest incidence rates. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, the Waorani and Secoya peoples have the highest incidence rates (Table 4 - Distribution of COVID-19 cases and crude incidence rates among indigenous peoples of the Ecuadorian Amazon. Ecuador, [28 Feb 2020 to 20 Jul 2020]).

In Mexico, since the 1st confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country /16 and as of [26 Jul 2020], there have been 5413 confirmed cases, including 766 deaths (14.2%), reported among persons that recognizes themselves as indigenous. Of these cases, 61% were reported in the following federal entities: Yucatan (949 cases), Oaxaca (526 cases), Mexico (456 cases), San Luis Potosí (419 cases), Mexico City (392 cases), Hidalgo (285 cases), and Tabasco (285 cases). Overall, 62% of the deaths have been reported in the following federal entities: Yucatán (125 deaths), Oaxaca (98 deaths), México (81 deaths), Puebla (59 deaths), Mexico City (57 deaths), and Quintana Roo (56 deaths).

With respect to the characteristics of the cases, 58% were male and the median age was 48 years, while among the deaths, the median age was 63 years and 65% were male. /17

In Peru, since the 1st confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country /18 and as of [28 Jul 2020], there have been 10 773 confirmed cases among Amazonian indigenous peoples, including 56 confirmed deaths and 35 deaths are under investigation.

In the Loreto Region, as of [29 Jul 2020], there have been 4452 confirmed cases, including 23 deaths, reported among the Amazonian indigenous peoples.

In the Peruvian Amazon, which includes indigenous peoples with populations of less than 5000, the indigenous nations of Resigaro, Orejón (Maijuna), Yagua, and Bora are notable in that they have reported incidence rates of more than 1000 cases per 100 000 population (Table 5 - Distribution of COVID-19 cases and crude incidence rates among indigenous peoples in the Loreto Region. Peru, [5 Mar 2020 to 29 Jul 2020).

In the United States of America, since the 1st confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country /19 and as of [1 Aug 2020], there have been 32 525 confirmed cases reported across 12 areas of the Indian Health Service (IHS). 2 IHS areas account for 57% of the confirmed cases: Navajo (10 559 cases) and Phoenix (7872 cases). /20

In Venezuela, since the 1st confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country /21, and as of [2 Aug 2020], there have been 179 confirmed cases, including 3 deaths, reported among indigenous peoples. Of these cases, 68.5% were reported in the state of Bolívar (123 cases) while the remaining cases were reported in the states of Zulia (43 cases, 2 deaths), Amazonas (12 cases), and Delta Amacuro (1 fatal case). The indigenous ethnic group that accounts for the majority of cases and deaths is Pemón, followed by Wayú.

[A fairly consistent theme throughout the Americas is the high population-based incident of morbidity and mortality due to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 in the indigenous populations. Much of these populations live in relatively remote areas with difficult access to limited health services and live in fairly crowded groupings where social distancing is challenging to say the least. Poverty is a common denominator and income generation is dependent upon close contact mostly in markets selling wares. Much has been written on this topic, especially by NGOs that work with these populations.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 6 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The WHO Regional Office for the Americas has issued a warning against the use of chlorine products as treatment for COVID-19. WHO recommends that people avoid consuming products containing chlorine dioxide or related substances (sodium hypochlorite, bleach, etc.) and that all marketing of such products for therapeutic purposes be reported to the authorities.

- The South African COVID-19 response is being bolstered by a surge team of health experts from WHO. The surge team will be jointly led by Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa and Dr Michael Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme. 43 experts from various fields will be deployed to support the COVID-19 outbreak response management.

- The WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia has urged countries in the region to maintain essential healthcare and accelerate the resumption of services that have been disrupted, by the pandemic, as an integral part of the COVID-19 response. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, repurposing of health workers, cancellation of elective care, closure of outpatient services, insufficient personal protective equipment, and changes in treatment policy have significantly impacted the delivery of essential services.

- Today's 'Subject in Focus' provides an overview of discussions on the Global Multidisciplinary Discussion on SARS-CoV-2 Modes of Transmission.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 53.7% of the global newly reported cases and 62.8% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 9.9 million cases and most likely will pass the 10 million mark of cases reported to WHO tomorrow. Brazil reported 37.0% of cases (51 603), followed by the USA 35.6% (49 629), Colombia 5.1% (7129), Argentina 4.9% (6792), Peru 4.9% (6790), Mexico 4.4% (6148), and Chile 1.3% (1761).

- The European region reported 9.7% of the global newly reported cases and 6.6% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 20.9% (5267) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Spain 11.7% (2953), Israel 6.8% (1719), France 6.4% (1615), Ukraine 5.2% (1318), Romania 5.2% (1309), Turkey 4.7% (1178), Kazakhstan 4.2% (1060), Germany 4.2% (1045), the UK 3.5% (891), and Uzbekistan 3.0% (755). While the Russian proportion of regional reported cases is steadily decreasing, the absolute number of reported cases has been fairly stable, due to increased cases reported by other countries in the region including Spain, Germany, and France, and a number of the Eastern European countries.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.1% of the global newly reported cases and 7.0% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 21.5 % (2834) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 20.5% (2697), Saudi Arabia 5.5% (1389), Morocco 9.7% (1283), Oman 8.5% (1127), Pakistan 5.5% (727), Kuwait 4.9% (651), UAE 3.9% (508), Bahrain 2.9% (382), Lebanon 2.7% (355), and Palestinian Authority 2.7% (353). Cases are increasing in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 5.4% of the global newly reported cases and 7.7% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 61.5% (8559) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 9.1% (1263), Kenya 4.8% (671), Algeria 4.0% (551), Ethiopia 3.3% (461), Nigeria 3.3% (457), Zambia 3.2% (442), and Madagascar 2.4 % (327). While South Africa is the dominant country in the region, it has halved its daily case count in the past few days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.5% of the global newly reported cases and 0.43% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 52.7% (3387) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 17.6% (1134), Singapore 14.1% (908), Australia 11.1% (715), China 1.9% (122), Viet Nam 0.70% (45), and South Korea 0.67% (43). Japan and Australia continue to increase in transmission, as has Singapore.

- The South East Asia region reported 23.6% of the global newly reported cases and 15.5% of global deaths. India reported 91.8% (56 282) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 4.3% (2654), and Indonesia 3.0% (1815). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries that have resurgences of cases associated with lifting of restrictions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (5 Aug 2020), the global case count rose by 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with the highest global daily case count today [6 Aug 2020] above 62 000. The global case count has now passed the 19 million mark having increased by over 1 million since 1 Aug 2020.

In the past 24 hours, India reported 62 170 cases followed by the USA (58 611) and Brazil (54 801). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (51.8%). There were 6536 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Russia, and the Philippines, all known global hotspots and the same 10 countries as yesterday (5 Aug 2020). The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3480 to 62 170. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Bolivia, Iraq, Bangladesh, Iran, Chile, Indonesia, Spain, Ecuador, Israel, and France and their range of reported new cases is 1604 to 3062.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a decrease of 1.4%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 3.0%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or is this a reporting artifact? Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases, albeit I wonder if this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggests a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases and deaths (see section [3][E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate is 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html.) The most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
