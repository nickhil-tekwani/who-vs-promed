Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 11 Jul 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Saudi Arabia has announced an additional laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in the country.

The patient is a 66-year-old man from Asir region with an underlying health condition. He is currently in critical but stable condition.

In addition, a Qatari patient earlier confirmed with MERS-CoV infection, who was being treated in the United Kingdom, died on [28 Jun 2013].

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 81 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 45 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travelers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) in order to be prepared for a change in the situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, will provide expert technical advice to the WHO Director-General in accordance to the IHR (2005). The 1st meeting of the Committee took place on [9 Jul 2013] and a further meeting is scheduled for next week [week of 15 Jul 2013].

[The above WHO report reconciles the global case count of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including the recent report of a new case from the Saudi Ministry of Health (see previous ProMED-mail posting, MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (41): Saudi Arabia, WHO 20130710.1815512) and a newswire report on the death of the 2nd identified case of MERS-CoV infection in a Qatari national who was transferred to the UK for treatment (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (37): Saudi Arabia, UK, new fatalities 20130703.1803607 and Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (03): UK HPA, WHO, Qatar 20120923.1305982). As of today (11 Jul 2013), there have been a total of 81 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 45 deaths.

Emirati man diagnosed with Sars-like virus
------------------------------------------
MOH said that WHO confirmed that the virus is not a concern for public health at the moment

An 82-year-old UAE national has been diagnosed with novel Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in one of the hospitals in Abu Dhabi. The patient is male with multiple myeloma and is currently admitted in the ICU.

The Health Authority in Abu Dhabi (HAAD) has confirmed that it is coordinating with the Ministry of Health and other authorities in the country and has taken the necessary measures as per the international standards and recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO).

The Ministry of Health stated that the WHO 1st issued an international alert in September 2012. Up to date the WHO confirmed a total of 80 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV worldwide. This case represents the 1st diagnosed case of the disease within UAE.

MOH added that WHO confirmed that the virus is not a concern for public health at the moment, and that the current situation does not require a travel ban to any country in the world, nor screenings at different ports, nor any restrictions on trade.

The ministry reassures everyone that detected cases globally continue to be very low compared to other types of flu. The Ministry confirms that the situation does not call for concern and that it is monitoring the situation closely to ensure the health and safety of everyone.

[There have been 2 prior cases of MERS-CoV associated with infection in the United Arab Emirates. Both cases were diagnosed outside of the UAE. One case was a tourist who returned to France and was diagnosed in France (see ProMED-mail prior post Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean (20): France ex UAE, WHO, Saudi Arabia 20130508.1700034). The other case was a case transferred for medical care in Germany after a prior hospitalization in Abu Dhabi (see prior ProMED-mail post Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean (13): Germany ex UAE 20130326.1603038).

This newly diagnosed patient fits the profile of individuals with pre-existing conditions. Unfortunately the source of infection for these cases remains unidentified, so prevention of the "index case" (non-person-to-person acquired) remains a difficult task. - Mod.MPP]
