The recent reports of possible drug-related meningitis in India
highlight the possibility of introduction of bacteria at various
stages in drug manufacture, storage and administration, including a
brief mention of contamination of syringes and needles. A recent
episode in Sri Lanka demonstrated the risk of iatrogenic fungal
infection of the meninges and emphasised the importance of safe
warehousing of basic equipment.

In 2005, an outbreak of _Aspergillus fumigatus_ meningitis resulted in
the deaths of 3 of 6 obstetric patients following spinal anaesthesia
at 2 hospitals in Colombo, Sri Lanka (1-4). _Aspergillus_ meningitis
was also implicated in 5/27 patients with sporadic iatrogenic
meningitis in 2 Indian referral hospitals over a prolonged period (5),
and fungal contamination of drugs has previously been reported by
ProMED-mail [Fungal meningitis, contaminated drug - USA (03) 20021212.6046; Fungal meningitis, contaminated drug - USA: alert (02) 20021117.5831 Fungal meningitis, contaminated drug - USA: alert 20021002.5444].

The Colombo outbreak was linked to contamination of poorly stored
syringes, needles and other equipment donated from many sources after
the tsunami. The precise point at which fungal contamination happened
was not identified, but the equipment had been distributed to both the
hospitals involved. Once the source was identified and remaining
stocks destroyed, there were no further cases.

The dangers of poor quality control of material donated from multiple
sources in disaster settings and of incorrect storage should always be
remembered.
