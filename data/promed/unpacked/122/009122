Outbreak of _E. coli_ Infections Linked to Clover Sprouts
-----------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O103 infections linked to clover sprouts. As of 17 Mar 2020, 39 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O103 have been reported from 6 states.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 6 Jan 2020 to 2 Mar 2020. Ill people range in age from 1 to 79 years, with a median age of 28. 53 percent of ill people are female. Two people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

State / Ill People
-----------------
Florida / 1
Illinois / 6
Iowa / 3
Missouri / 1
Texas / 1
Utah / 27
------------
Total / 39

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 3 to 4 weeks.

Investigation of the Outbreak
--------------------------
Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory evidence indicate that clover sprouts are the source of this outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures they had in the week before their illness started. 16 (59%) of 27 people interviewed reported eating sprouts. This percentage is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people in which 8% reported eating sprouts in the week before they were interviewed. 14 (58%) of 24 people interviewed reported eating sprouts at a Jimmy John's restaurant.

Jimmy John's LLC reported that all of their restaurants stopped serving clover sprouts on 24 Feb 2020. Clover sprouts should no longer be available at Jimmy John's restaurants.

FDA identified the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O103 in samples of Chicago Indoor Garden products that contain sprouts. On 16 Mar 2020, Chicago Indoor Garden recalled all products containing red clover sprouts.

FDA's traceback investigation has shown that a common seed lot was used to grow the sprouts recalled by Chicago Indoor Garden and the sprouts that were served at Jimmy John's locations where people sickened in the current outbreak reported eating. The same seed lot was also used to grow sprouts linked to an outbreak of the same strain of _E. coli_ O103 infections in 2019.

This investigation is ongoing to determine where implicated sprouts and seeds have been distributed, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[A number of significant pathogens, including _Salmonella_, _Listeria_, and enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, have been linked to transmission from ingestion of a variety of different kinds of sprouts in the USA and elsewhere.

The following is a relatively recent review on outbreaks caused by sprouts.

Abstract
--------
After a series of outbreaks associated with sprouts in the mid-1990s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidelines in 1999 for sprouts producers to reduce the risk of contamination. The recommendations included treating seeds with an antimicrobial agent such as calcium hypochlorite solution and testing spent irrigation water for pathogens. From 1998 through 2010, 33 outbreaks from seed and bean sprouts were documented in the USA, affecting 1330 reported persons. 28 outbreaks were caused by _Salmonella_, 4 by Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_, and one by _Listeria_. In 15 of the 18 outbreaks with information available, growers had not followed key FDA guidelines. In 3 outbreaks, however, the implicated sprouts were produced by firms that appeared to have implemented key FDA guidelines. Although seed chlorination, if consistently applied, reduces pathogen burden on sprouts, it does not eliminate the risk of human infection. Further seed and sprout disinfection technologies, some recently developed, will be needed to enhance sprouts safety and reduce human disease. Improved seed production practices could also decrease pathogen burden, but, because seeds are a globally distributed commodity, will require international cooperation." - Mod.LL
