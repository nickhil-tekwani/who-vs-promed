Cambodia declares main bird flu areas free of the disease
----------------------------------------------------
Cambodia has declared the 3 main areas hit earlier this year by outbreaks
of the deadly bird flu virus are free of the disease.
The Agriculture Ministry says 2 areas on the outskirts of the capital,
Phnom Penh, and a region in southern Takeo province, which borders Viet
Nam, are now free of the virus.
The agriculture minister, Chan Sarun, says all kinds of birds will be
allowed back into those areas.
Bird flu swept through 10 countries in Asia earlier in 2004, killing 16
people in Viet Nam and 8 in Thailand.
7 Cambodians were tested for the disease but all were cleared.

[Following its initial report of 24 Jan 2004, reporting the beginning of
the H5N1 avian influenza epizootic on 11 Jan 2004, Cambodia has sent to the
OIE (so far) one follow-up report: 19 Mar 2004.
In FAO's recent review of Cambodia's avian influenza situation (see
20040618.1631), the need for an active surveillance in commercial poultry
was indicated. It will be useful to be informed whether Cambodia's reported
declaration of freedom from avian influenza in the affected areas is based
upon such surveillance, and to obtain its details. - Mod. AS]
