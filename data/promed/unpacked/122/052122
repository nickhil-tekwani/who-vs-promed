With 6 more children dying, encephalitis is now suspected to have
claimed 25 young lives in Bihar, an official said Wednesday [14 Sep
2011]. The 6 children died in the last 2 days at Anugrah Narain
Medical College and Hospital (ANMCH) in Gaya, about 100 km [62 mi]
from [Patna], said the district health official. 19 children had died
earlier. The children reported high fever, followed by bouts of
unconsciousness and convulsions.

To date, more than 75 children with suspected encephalitis admitted,
to the hospital, said its superintendent, Sitaram Prasad. "Most of the
children were from rural areas of Gaya and neighbouring districts.
More than 2 dozen children are still battling for life," he said.

Measures were being taken to check the spread of the disease, said
Health Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey.

Suspected encephalitis hit Gaya in 2009, 2007, and 2005 and killed
dozens of children, said a district administration official.

Fear of suspected encephalitis is haunting the Patna Medical College
and Hospital (PMCH) with 45 samples of brain fever cases having tested
positive in the last 1.5 months. 3 people reportedly died due to the
disease.

The state health department is running short of Japanese encephalitis
[JE] kits to test [for] the infection. "In view of seriousness of the
issue, ANMCH and PMCH have sent an SOS to the National Institute of
Virology, Pune, to send the kits soon," an official of the health
department told IANS.

2 months ago, 51 children died in Muzaffarpur district but the state
government is yet to confirm these as encephalitis deaths. Last month
[August 2011], union Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi
Azad informed the Rajya Sabha [Council of States] that clinical and
epidemiological data suggested that it was an outbreak of acute
encephalitis syndrome, resulting in 150 cases and 55 deaths, mostly
among children. In a written reply, the minister said these cases were
reported from early June to mid-July [2011] from Muzaffarpur and its
bordering areas.

[The one additional death cited in the report in [1] above has
occurred in the past 24 hours (see ProMED-mail archive no 20110913.2793). Presumably this case is also due to JE virus
infection, as yesterday's (13 Sep 2011) report indicated that the 24
deaths were due to infection by that virus.

There are no indications given about the measures to be taken to halt
the spread of the disease. Is a JE virus vaccination campaign planned?
Again, the etiology of the acute encephalitis syndrome cases in the
Muzaffarpur district mentioned above is not specified.

Gaya is the 2nd largest city in Bihar state and the capital of the
district. A HealthMap Interactive map showing the location of Gaya can
be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/1emt.

With respect to the information in report [2] above, JE cases are
widely scattered across the Indian states. It would be of interest to
know if vaccination campaigns were carried out in the states most
affected. - Mod.TY]
