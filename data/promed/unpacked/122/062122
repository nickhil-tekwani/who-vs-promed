More cases of the cane fungal disease smut are expected to be found in
north Queensland by the new year [2008].

A Proserpine grower found an infected stool on his property earlier this
week while applying herbicides from a high clearance tractor. The BSES
[Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations] confirmed the disease and destroyed
the infected plant. Inspections of nearby properties failed to find any
other instances of smut.

But Peter Sutherland from the BSES says more cases are inevitable. "We'd
expect, by the nature of that infection and the disease, that it'll pop up
between now and February [2008] again, so cane's actively growing at the
moment, and we still have quite a bit of Q157 [smut susceptible variety] in
the area," he said. "So I expect as other operations are carried out from
these high clearance tractors that growers will actually spot it."

The inevitable has been confirmed, with the detection of smut in the
Maryborough area showing that the productivity-stunting sugarcane disease
is continuing to spread.

But producer group Canegrowers says the area is already ahead of the game
with a plan of attack well under way. Canegrowers' acting chief executive,
Ron Mullins, says responsible growers have started a program of replacing
susceptible varieties with resistant varieties, a vital step in minimising
the economic impact of the disease. "The Maryborough sugarcane industry had
been bracing itself for this moment for some time, so when suspect smut
whips were found on a property in the area last week, they stepped up work
on the intensive management strategies needed to minimise the impact of
this potentially devastating disease," Mr Mullins said.

Smut is a debilitating fungal disease which, in its worst form, can
dramatically reduce productivity and ultimately kill sugarcane plants.
Spread by infected spores, the disease can be carried on contaminated
machinery and even clothing and skin. But, according to Canegrowers, the
biggest hurdle to combating the windborne disease is breeding and planting
resistant varieties, a process which will take many years.

The disease was 1st discovered on the eastern seaboard in the Bundaberg
Isis region mid last year [2006], followed closely by a 2nd outbreak, which
was identified in the Mackay area. Its discovery in the Ingham area late
last year was further confirmation that the disease was here to stay.

"The response plans drawn up locally have been under way for some 12 months
now," Mr Mullins said. "They seek to manage disease levels and reduce
economic impacts. The only truly effective measure against the impact of
smut is to replace susceptible varieties with those with high levels of
resistance to the fungal strain." The downside is that resistant varieties
are also characterised by reduced productivity, but Mr Mullins is confident
that with time and resources this can be overcome.

In response to the increase in sugarcane smut disease in the Herbert River
region, Qld, the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations (BSES) Limited will
host a public meeting to discuss varieties of sugarcane resistant to smut.

Senior extension officer of BSES' principal research and development, Greg
Shannon, said the recent dry condition of the soil is one of the factors
contributing to the increase in sugarcane smut. He said at least 17 of the
26 Herbert productivity zones have at least one farm with smut. Mr Shannon
said, "We are identifying 1-2 farms per day showing the classic smut whip
symptoms. Approximately 600 hectares are affected by sugarcane smut in the
Herbert. BSES is undertaking surveillance in the Stone River, Lannercost,
and Macknade areas as well as in sugarcane varieties Q157, Q158, and Q174A."

Mr Shannon said that at the meeting, "Dr Nils Berding, principal research
scientist, will discuss the BSES plant breeding program for smut resistant
cane which began in 1999. Dr Rob Magarey, also a BSES pincipal research
scientist, will outline the new Smut Epidemiology study for the Herbert
which commenced in October [2007]."

[Sugarcane smut is caused by the fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_
(previously _Ustilago scitaminea_). It is highly infectious and can be
spread by wind or carried on clothing and machinery. Symptoms are a black
whip-like structure emerging from the central core of meristematic tissues.
It contains spores covered with a thin membrane which ruptures easily to
release the spores.

The best control method is to use resistant cultivars available for
different cane growing regions. Careful removal of infected plants after
covering the whip may help prevent secondary spread of the disease. Smut
spores survive for long periods in soil or plant debris. Thus, the disease
is also managed by burning of infected fields after harvest and the use of
healthy seedcane setts from disease-free nurseries for replanting. Soaking
of setts in a solution of fungicide or short hot-water treatment may also
help to control smut.

Sugarcane smut appears to be present in every sugarcane-growing country
worldwide. Australia was the last country considered to be free of this
disease until smut was found in 1998 in Western Australia, a minor cane
growing area. In June 2006, it was found in Queensland where it has spread
to all the main Australian sugar growing regions within the last 18 months,
despite efforts to contain the disease. The industry had been preparing for
a smut incursion for years, screening varieties for smut resistance, and
this has placed growers in a fairly good position to minimise losses. Smut
management plans have been implemented, for example the movement of
sugarcane and sugarcane machinery is now restricted in Queensland by a
Plant Protection Act. Smut monitoring (by spore traps and susceptible
indicator plots) and development of high-yielding resistant cultivars
continues. A programme of replacing susceptible with smut resistant
varieties is in progress. Replacement is mandatory when replanting, but
ratoon crops of already planted susceptible varieties may still be
harvested. It will, therefore, take several years before a complete
transition to resistant varieties will be achieved.
