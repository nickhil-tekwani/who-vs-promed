Three more cases of cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV), commonly known as Alabama rot, have been confirmed in the United Kingdom. The new cases of the mystery canine disease have been confirmed in Atherton (Greater Manchester), and Redhill and Woldingham (Surrey), by Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists. In total, the UK has seen 184 confirmed cases across 38 counties since 2012, with 52 cases in 2018 and 9 in 2019 so far.

Symptoms of CRGV include skin lesions -- typically appearing as ulcers or erosions on the distal limbs, ventrum or oral cavity/muzzle -- that commonly appear less than a week before clinical signs attributable to acute kidney injury, which often proves fatal.

During the past 6 years, more CRGV cases have been seen between November and May than between June and October, suggesting possible winter/spring seasonality. Many cases have been reported after dogs were walked in cold/muddy areas, though no firm link has been established despite intense, multidisciplinary research.

[Cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV) is a rare disease affecting dogs, with a recent apparent increase in prevalence since 2012 in the UK. This disease is characterized by a vasculopathy affecting small vessels of the kidney and skin, leading to thrombotic microangiopathy. The underlying etiology remains unknown although clinicopathological and histological findings resemble features of certain forms of thrombotic microangiopathy in people, for which plasma exchange (PEX) is considered an important component of therapy.

A recent study (ref 1) described the use of PEX as adjunctive treatment in dogs diagnosed with CRGV. A retrospective review of dogs diagnosed with CRGV between 2014 and 2016 treated with PEX was performed, clinical records reviewed and data relating to signalment, diagnostic tests and management strategies were summarized.

Results of 6 CRGV cases, which underwent PEX as part of their therapy, were described in detail. All underwent at least one PEX cycle; one dog had a single cycle PEX, 3 dogs 2 cycles PEX, and 2 dogs had one cycle PEX and one cycle of prolonged intermittent renal replacement treatment. Complications seen during PEX therapy included hypothermia (n = 4), tachycardia (n = 2), hypotension (n = 2), and hypocalcemia (n = 6). Two dogs survived to discharge, the remaining 4 dogs were euthanized. The positive outcome in 2 dogs treated with PEX despite the reported high mortality rate once acute kidney injury with oliguria/anuria occurs does not confirm success of this treatment. The authors concluded that additional studies are urgently needed to identify the underlying etiology of CRGV before more targeted therapies can be developed and that further evaluation of the role of PEX in this specific disease are warranted.
