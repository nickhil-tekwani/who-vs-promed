With the confirmation of the 17th rabies case in Carteret County, North
Carolina, since March, county residents are urged to take the epidemic
seriously.
North Carolina has been experiencing a rabies epidemic that had, until now,
only knocked on this county's doorsteps, hitting neighboring Onslow and
Craven counties.
But in March the first case was reported in a domestic cat in western
Carteret County outside Newport.
Now Carteret ranks fourth in the state for the number of confirmed cases
this year, according to the most recent state statistics. The top county in
the number of reports is Gaston, followed by Iredell and Columbus counties.
The State Lab of Public Health confirmed a fox found fighting with a dog
over the weekend in the Newport area was rabid. A resident on Nine-Foot
Road killed the fox after he found it with his dog, Jim Earp, County Animal
Control director said. The resident wasn't exposed to the animal, but the
dog did not have its current vaccinations.
Choices were to quarantine the dog for 6 months or to euthanize the animal.
Mr. Earp said he understood the animal would be euthanized. But what
bothered him even more than the 17th case was the owner had two other dogs
unvaccinated against rabies and the owner said he didn't know there was a
rabies epidemic in the county. Both the lack of vaccinations and the
ignorance of the problem are reoccurring themes.
Although vaccinations are required by state law, people still fail to take
that step, despite rabies clinics and local veterinarians only charge to
administer the shot, not for an office visit, making the shots affordable.
The first incident of rabies exposure was less than 1 mile from the most
recent case and less than 2 miles from 5 other cases, according to Mr.
Earp. Of the 17 cases, 14 were in raccoons, 1 was a bobcat, 1 a fox and 1 a
domestic cat. The cases have mostly been concentrated in the Newport area
and western Carteret County.
Mr. Earp encouraged pet owners that by having their animals vaccinated they
create a barrier between humans and wild animals. In one case, a woman fed
wild raccoons, only to get bitten. And one man who was bitten was keeping
raccoons in a cage as pets.
Rabies has been absent as a major health threat to land-based animals in
the state since the epidemic in the 1950s, according to Dr. Lee Hunter,
state veterinarian. But it has entered the state in 3 separate epidemics
and has spread, with the number of cases of rabies diagnosed by the State
Lab of Public Health increasing dramatically, nearly doubling each year
since 1990. The disease has been absent for 40 years because of the public
health programs launched to control the disease during the 1950s.
"The main reservoir of rabies 40 years ago was the population of owned and
stray dogs and cats," Dr. Hunter said in a 1996 article in the N.C. Medical
Journal. To control the spread, the state legislature made it mandatory for
all dogs to be vaccinated against rabies.
And because rabies vaccinations did not reach the population of stray dogs,
these animals were unlikely to get shots, so they formed a potential
reservoir for the disease. To interrupt the spread to other dogs, local
animal control departments started a program to reduce the population of
stray animals. Vaccinations and animal control appeared to work. In 1954,
174 animals in the state were diagnosed as rabid. But in 1960, only 11 were.
Controlling the disease in the pet population reduced the spillover into
the wild animal population, according to Dr. Hunter. But the disease is
threatening again. This time, however, it's coming from the wild animal
population, according to Dr. Hunter. Another problem is letting animals run
at large, which is against the county's animal control law, and feeding and
harboring feral cats.
In both cases, the animal is at risk of exposure. And in the case of wild
cats, no one claims ownership, but as soon as animal control tries to set
up traps to catch the animals, residents release the traps, thwarting all
animal control efforts.
"These epidemics are part of a larger regional problem affecting the
Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest United States," he said. And in this
area, the outbreak is primarily from raccoons. That's why animal control
has stressed vaccinating pets forms a barrier between animals and humans.
The 3 epidemics of wild animal rabies are the Southeastern Raccoon Rabies
Epidemic, originated in Florida in the 1950s and spread north, moving into
southeastern and south-central North Carolina over a 2-year period,
including Gaston, Harnett and Brunswick counties; the Mid-Atlantic Raccoon
Epidemic originated in Virginia after wild raccoons from the Southeast were
moved into West Virginia and Virginia in the late 1970s; and an epidemic in
skunks in Canada spread through the midwestern states into Tennessee and
now affects Watauga and Alleghany counties in the North Carolina mountains.
Rabies is a viral disease that may be transmitted to humans. Healthy
animals and humans can get rabies when bitten, licked or scratched by a
sick animal. The saliva of the infected animal spreads the rabies virus.
The virus travels through nerves and affects the brain and can cause death
if not treated quickly and properly. It can be prevented if treatment is
started soon after exposure.
The cost for treatment in humans after exposure is costly, at about $800 to
$1200, and can get higher if hospitalization or physician's bills are
factored in.
If a pet is bitten or scratched by another animal, domestic or wild, animal
control or the County Health Department should be contact immediately.
If the pet has a current rabies vaccination, a booster must be done within
72 hours of the incident. If the attacking animal is captured, the brain
will be tested for rabies.
If the pet is not vaccinated, and the attacking animal tests positive for
rabies, the pet may be disposed of as required by law.
If the pet is vaccinated but has not received the booster within 72 hours
of the incident, unless the attacking animal tests negative, the pet will
be quarantined for six months or disposed of by animal control. All
vaccinated dogs or cats that bite a person will be under observation for 10
days.
The pet owner is responsible for the cost of the quarantine and this must
be done at a vet's clinic.
Always report any animal bite, no matter how small, to the County Animal
Control Office. Anyone with questions can contact the health department or
their family physician.
