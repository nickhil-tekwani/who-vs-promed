Epidemiological comments
On [Fri 28 Apr 2017], the Central Veterinary Laboratory at Algete (National Reference Laboratory for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies accredited under UNE-EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005) received a brainstem sample suspected to be BSE-positive from the regional accredited animal health laboratory of Cantabria (official regional laboratory) after a positive result was obtained through the Bio-Rad TeSeE SAP rapid test. The National Reference Laboratory undertook the confirmatory tests authorized according to Regulation (EU) No. 1148/2014. The selected assays associated were Western blot (Prionics) and ELISA (TeSeE SAP Bio-Rad). Following positive results to both assays, the National Reference Laboratory performed assays to discriminate the BSE strains by immunoblotting with results for atypical BSE type L on [Fri 5 May 2017]. The sample was taken within the national TSE surveillance program (sampling of dead or non-slaughtered animals for human consumption over 48 months old). The animal was a crossbred (conjunto mestizo) female born on [25 February 2002].

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, traceability, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, selective killing and disposal, disinfection, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: official destruction of animal products

Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Laboratory, Algete (National laboratory)/
