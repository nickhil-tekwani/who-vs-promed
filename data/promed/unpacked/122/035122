[The report above includes a dendrogram showing the identity between China's and Russia's recent serotype A FMD strains. Subscribers are referred to 2 other recent, relevant WRLFMD genotyping reports addressing Chinese and Russian strains, namely Ref GDMM-CHA-2013-S, available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLMEG-2013-00004%20A%20PR%20China%202013-2.pdf, and ref Zabaikalsky/RUS/2013, available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLMEG-2013-00005%20A%20Russia%202013.pdf.

All 3 reports and the dendrograms included clearly demonstrate the very close relationship between the Chinese serotype A virus strain collected during March 2013 from cattle and pigs in north China, and the Russian strain, collected on 1 Mar 2013 from cattle in Molodezhny, Priargunsky district, Zabaikalsky kray, close to the Chinese border. FMDV serotype A has been reported also from another bordering country, Kazakhstan; genotyping is not (yet) available.

During 2013, China has reported 4 single outbreaks of FMDV serotype A from 4 different, distant parts of the country. This apparent sporadic incidence was referred to in the commentary to ProMED-mail posting 20130423.1665300 which concluded in asking, "Are we wrong to assume that infection, in an apparently unvaccinated, susceptible cattle population, of a highly infectious virus such as FMD, is not limited to the 4 reported outbreaks?"

This question is fortified by WRLFMD's genotyping reports. China has demonstrated significantly improved transparency in relation to the emerging H7N9 epidemic. Hopefully, similar improvement will involve FMD surveillance and reporting. - Mod.AS
