Acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome in East Timor
-----------------------------------------------
As of Wed 26 Jan 2005, WHO has received reports of 67 hospitalized
cases and 8 deaths of acute hemorrhagic syndrome in Dili, Liquica and
Maliana, with clinical features compatible with dengue hemorrhagic
fever. The Ministry of Health has organized vector control activities
to prevent breeding of mosquitoes, distributed mosquito nets in
high-risk areas and issued health education messages through the mass
media and to community groups to raise awareness of dengue infection.
Active surveillance in the affected areas is being carried out.
WHO has developed and distributed guidance on clinical treatment and
management of the disease. WHO is also supporting 2 senior staff from
the WHO Collaborating Center for Case Management of Dengue/Dengue
Hemorrhagic Fever, Thailand, Queen Sirikit National Institute of
Child Health, Bangkok, to strengthen the clinical care system for
dengue case management, to initiate training of health care personnel
for clinical case management and to provide guidance in dengue fever
management in patients. WHO is deploying further experts in clinical
management to support the Ministry of Health and to strengthen field
assessments.

[Dengue is hyperendemic in East Timor, and all 4 serotypes of dengue
virus are in circulation. In 1997, there was a large outbreak of
dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), affecting children predominantly.
Since then, there have been sporadic cases each year. A larger than
usual number of cases of dengue fever and DHF occurred in 2000, when
large numbers of non-immune adults were present as part of UN
Agencies, NGO's and a military peace-keeping force. The military
contingent reported 228 cases of serologically confirmed dengue
between late September 1999 and early February 2000, with peak
incidence in late January. Subsequently, various control measures
were implemented, mostly focused on reduction of the vectors, _Aedes
aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. An educational campaign was
initiated via schools to educate the public on the reduction of
larval habitats around the home. It may be that the current outbreak
coincides with an increase in the number of non-immune adults. -
