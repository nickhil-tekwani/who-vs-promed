[This immediate notification complements the information published in ProMED-mail posting 20170709.5161834. Unfortunately, rabies is endemic in the majority of Southeast Asian countries, where nearly all human rabies infections are transmitted via rabid dog bites.

"More than 95 percent of human cases of rabies are due to bites from infected dogs. Controlling and eradicating rabies, therefore, means combating it at its animal source. Mass vaccination of dogs is the method of choice, because it is the only real way to interrupt the disease's infectious cycle between animals and humans.

Some countries have already managed to eradicate the disease by applying strict prophylactic measures. But it remains endemic in other countries, mainly affecting wild host species.

In countries where rabies is endemic, measures are in place to control and reduce the risk of infection in vulnerable populations (wildlife, stray and domestic animals) and create a barrier between the animal source and humans.

To achieve this, there need to be mass dog vaccination campaigns combined with public information campaigns and the improvement of access to human medical care (anti-rabies vaccines and sera)" http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/rabies-portal/prevention-and-control/. - Mod.CRD
