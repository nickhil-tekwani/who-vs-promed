Bulacan pig industry to recover from culling
--------------------------------------------
Bulacan Governor Joselito Mendoza has offered optimism that the dying
pig industry in the Philippine province will recover when the culling
of the Ebola-Reston-infected pigs is completed.

The Ebola-Reston scare sparked trouble in the local pig industry,
bringing down the sales of pork by a massive 50 percent.

The governor, however, said that he is expecting the hog industry in
the province to recover as soon as the Bureau of Animal Industry
(BAI) finishes the culling of the Ebola-Reston-infected pigs in Pandi
town this week.

Meanwhile, the team conducting depopulation of hogs in Bulacan is
back on track and is likely to meet the Friday [6 Mar 2009] deadline
as almost 5000 or 73 percent of the 6500 pigs from an infected farm
in Pandi town have been culled.

Agriculture Secretary Arthur Yap told reporters that culling team
members have recovered ground in the process after encountering
several delays in the 1st few days.

The pigs were ordered slaughtered after foreign health experts found
that some of the animals were found positive for the Ebola-Reston
virus, a non-lethal virus that infected not only pigs in a Pandi farm
but also by a number of farm workers in Central Luzon.
