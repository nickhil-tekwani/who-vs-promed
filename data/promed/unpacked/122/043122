Respiratory tract infections in nursing homes in the Netherlands
In the Netherlands five nursing homes (NH) and one institute for the
mentally handicapped (IMH) from various parts of the country reported this
week clusters of respiratory illness occurring in the previous four weeks
to their respective municipal health departments (GGD's). In the
Netherlands late November is the traditional start of the season for
respiratory illness. Residents of NH and IMH are vaccinated against
influenza every year in early November, but not generally vaccinated
against pneumococcal disease.
Since April this year there is a new law in force in the country that
arranges that institutions where vulnerable people liver together notify
clusters of infectious diseases to the local health department. As a result
the usual clusters that were also occurring previously are now coming to
the attention of the press. Alarmed by the deaths that are occurring in
combination with a lack of proper diagnosis frightening headlines appear
("unknown disease hits nursing home" "seven people died in epidemic of
unknown cause"). A short report.
Home A (GGD WestHolland).
NH with four units of 30 inhabitants each. One unit with respiratory
problems in the last month, including staff. Problems arose during
influenza vaccination campaign. As a result not all people received
influenza vaccination yet. Clinical picture mild respiratory illness
(common cold). At the time when most people were sick no diagnostic tests
were done. In the last month seven people died of whom five might be
related to respiratory disease. In one patient _S. pneumoniae_ is
confirmed. Patients are recovering, no new cases of pneumonia. Swabs (taken
late in the course of disease) showed today weak positive PCR some for RSV
and some for Influenza A.
In a second unit the "common cold" is now introduced. Circulation and
mortality of _S. pneumoniae_ not excluded.
Early antibiotic treatment of every respiratory case with fever, cohorting,
hygienic precautions and vaccination are advised. Since these measurements
were installed no new patients died.
Home B (GGD Stedendriehoek).
One unit 30 residents, 17 became ill of whom three died. Patients did not
give up sputum. Influenza vaccination was scheduled for last week but was
postponed as many people were having mild upper respiratory tract
infections (URTI). Serology confirmed today rise in titer against
influenzavirus A in 4 out of five cases. Results of bacterial and viral
growth are pending. No signs of spread to other institutes, no signs of _S.
pneumoniae_, no vaccination advised.
Home C (GGD Arnhem).
Large institute with over 200 beds. In two units respiratory complaints,
unit A 18/36 URTI, unit B 12/36 URTI. No deaths so far. Microbiology
pending, patients are recovering.
Home D (GGD OostelijkZuid Limburg).
Small NH 36 beds, 8 people acute gastrointestinal complaints with vomiting
and diarrhoea and three with respiratory symptoms of which one died.
Culture _S. pneumoniae_ positive.
Home E (GGD ZuidHollandse Eilanden).
Large IMH. In one unit several staff suffered from lower respiratory tract
infection. One died, _S. pneumoniae_ isolated. Cluster is under
investigation, diagnostics pending.
Home F. (GGD Delfland).
Residential home for the elderly (not a nursing home). Five LRTI in
residents, five URTI in staff. Cluster is under investigation.
Conclusion:
Usual seasonal clusters of viral infections in institutes with at least one
possibly two real superimposed problems. Investigations and intervention as
usual.
