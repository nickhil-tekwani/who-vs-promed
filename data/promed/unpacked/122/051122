New Aedes species found in Nicaragua
--------------------------------------------
The Department of Health of Nicaragua announced that it has detected in the
north of the country larvae of the mosquito _Aedes albopictus_, also known
as "Asian Tiger" and potential transmitter of 23 dangerous diseases.
"It is the first time we have detected larvae of this mosquito here",
declared the director of the National Centre of Diagnosis and Reference of
the Department of Health. Juan Jose Amador, the director of Epidemiology of
the Department of Health, stated that the larvae of the mosquito were
discovered in the Potosi municipality in the province of Chinandega, on the
frontier with Honduras. Amador said that the discovery was made in a sample
of 12 000 mosquito larvae captured throughout the whole country by the
program of entomological surveillance. He added that the numbers of larvae
are low because they have not managed to pass the larval stage for climatic
reasons. He also reported that the mosquito, which transmits diseases like
yellow fever, encephalitis, dengue, and West Nile Virus, comes from Asia
and has already been detected in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and El Salvador.

[_Aedes albopictus_ has previously been reported from several countries in
South America including Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and
Panama, and it is therefore probably widespread from Mexico at least south
to Panama. These countries have experienced repeated outbreaks of dengue
fever over the past years, and the introduction of a new and more efficient
vector has probably been a contributing factor. - Mod.EP]
