A 2-year-old filly at Parx Racing has tested positive for the equine herpesvirus, resulting in a quarantine of the stable area.

Horses are allowed to ship into Parx to race, according to Sam Elliott, director of racing, but they will not be able to leave the grounds during the quarantine. The quarantine is expected to last 4 weeks, according to Elliott.

The sick filly, Top of the Stretch, is trained by Blane Servis and owned by Tuozzo Racing. She made 5 starts at Presque Isle Downs between 25 May and 27 Aug 2015 for trainer Nick Caruso. Top of the Stretch was sent to Servis about 2 weeks ago and finished 10th and last in a Parx allowance race on 26 Sep 2015.

She became sick several days after the race and was sent to the Mid-Atlantic Equine Medical Center in Ringoes, N.J. On Friday [2 Oct 2015] night, test results confirmed she had the equine herpesvirus. The Mid-Atlantic Equine Medical Center has state-of-the-art isolation facilities for cases such as this, said Elliott.

The equine herpesvirus can cause respiratory and neurological problems in horses. On occasion, it can prove fatal. It also is contagious.

"She went to the track for the 1st day since her race, and the rider came back and said she didn't feel right behind," Servis said. "It progressed pretty quickly, so we sent her to the clinic. She wasn't that sick, but she was losing her control behind and acting strange."

Servis is stabled in Barn 29 at Parx. Other trainers in the barn include Marya Montoya and Eli Betancourt. The horses stabled in Barn 29 have been told they will not be able to train or race while the quarantine is in effect.

The quarantine puts the Breeders' Cup plans of Favorite Tale in jeopardy. Trainer Lupe Preciado wants to run Favorite Tale in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, but for now, he must remain at Parx. Even if the state were to give Preciado permission to leave, it is unclear where he could stable and train in Kentucky. Favorite Tale earned a fees-paid berth to the BC Sprint by winning the Smile Sprint at Gulfstream Park, a Win and You're In Race for the Breeders' Cup.

Servis and Elliott said while Top of the Stretch tested positive for the herpesvirus, she has a low level of the disease.

"She tested positive for herpes but at a very low level," Servis said. "They tell me she is less likely to be contagious."

This is the 3rd time in recent years Parx has had an equine herpesvirus quarantine. Horses at Parx tested positive for the disease in February 2014 and November 2013, with both incidents leading to quarantines.

The quarantine resulted in 37 scratches on Saturday [3 Oct 2015] at Parx, including BC Filly and Mare Sprint hopeful Stonetastic, New York-based Room for Me, Barbara Fritchie Handicap winner Lady Sabelia, and 8-time stakes winner Galiana, all of whom were entered in the USD 150 000 Roamin Rachel Stakes. Only 2 horses remained in that field.

The Maryland Jockey Club is not allowing horses recently stabled at either Parx or Presque Isle Downs to ship in.

The Presque Isle meet is scheduled to conclude on 6 Oct 2015.

Martin Panza, the senior vice president of racing at the New York Racing Association, said on Saturday [3 Oct 2015] that horses recently at Parx will not be allowed to ship into NYRA tracks.

[This disease has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease (and this article does not let us know whether this was an option available to the owner), and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions. This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately. This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

"Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease, EHM, has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may last longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM-positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

It should be noted that to date, 9 EHVs have been identified worldwide. Three of these -- EHV-1, EHV-3, and EHV- 4 -- pose the most serious health risks for domesticated horses and can have significant economic impacts.

EHV-1: can cause 4 manifestations of disease in horses, including a neurological form, respiratory disease, abortion, and neonatal death. EHM is most often due to mutant or neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1, so called because of a particular mutation in the genome.

EHV-3: causes a venereal disease called equine coital exanthema that affects the external genitalia.

EHV-4: causes a nonfatal upper respiratory tract disease in foals and is uncommonly associated with abortion and rarely with neurologic disease.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus."
