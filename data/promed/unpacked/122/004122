--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease and leads to a smallpox-like disease in humans. The current epidemic in European countries requires informed responses. We investigated the ability to self-diagnose a potential infection, and determinants of vaccination and self-isolation intention after diagnosis among 394 MSM [men who have sex with men] in the Netherlands. We found that about half were able to self-diagnose monkeypox, that 70% had a high intention to get vaccinated and 44% to self-isolate after monkeypox diagnosis. Determinants went beyond mere risk behaviour criteria.

Conclusions
-----------
To conclude, based on our findings public health policy makers and services should in addition to focusing on vaccinations in their communication, aim to increase MSM's intentions to self-isolate and their ability to accurately self-diagnose. Efforts should also be stepped up to target MSM at the highest risk, especially those with little concern about monkeypox and those with a high level of education. Even though obtained in a Dutch context, we believe our findings may also be relevant for other countries with similar conditions.

[4] Multiple specimens for diagnosis

ref: Veintimilla C, Catalán P, Alonso R, et al. The relevance of multiple clinical specimens in the diagnosis of monkeypox virus, Spain, June 2022. Euro Surveill. 2022; 27(33)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Current evidence suggests that monkeypox virus (MPXV) is acquired by inoculation of the virus into mucosal surfaces or skin through close physical contact. Most cases have been reported among men who have sex with men, raising the possibility of a rapid increase of cases in the context of close physical contact during sexual activity.

Skin swabs from vesicles, ulcers, or crusted lesions are the standard specimens used for the detection of MPXV. However, there is a lack of information about the role that other different specimens may have in MPXV diagnosis. To guide sampling strategies, we evaluated the distribution of MPXV among different clinical specimens of patients with suspected MPXV infection.

Discussion
----------
In this study, we evaluated 140 different clinical specimens from 37 patients with suspected MPXV infection. Skin lesions showed the highest positivity rate and viral load. Interestingly, the majority of our plasma samples tested positive for MPXV, indicating that the patients were viraemic at the time of samples collection. The observed Cq values indicate low viral load, suggesting that these patients may have been positive before the appearance of skin lesions. Therefore, we could propose that performing the detection of MPXV in plasma specimens from close contacts without skin lesions might allow early diagnosis and control of the transmission chain; nevertheless this should be further investigated.

We found no statistically significant association between time since symptom onset and plasma Cq values. This could be due to the subjective identification of the beginning on systemic symptoms referred by the patients and to the time point of testing. In a previous report, blood samples were tested in 2 patients on different days and also showed high Cq values. To our knowledge, there is a lack of evidence about the detection of MPXV DNA in blood samples and its epidemiological and clinical significance.

The oropharyngeal and anal swabs were also frequently positive for MPXV with Cq, similar to those in skin lesions. Although some of our patients had vesicular lesions in oropharyngeal and anal areas, most positive samples did not come from patients with visible lesions in those areas at the time of testing (27/34 oropharyngeal and 22/32 anal samples). Therefore, these additional specimens could be relevant, depending on the symptoms and the potential risks during the close physical contact (oral or anal intercourse), in reaching an early MPXV diagnosis in patients without skin lesions. Recent reports demonstrated positive MPXV PCR detection with Cq values < 30 in some other sample types such as seminal fluid, faeces, and nasopharynx which could be involved in transmission of the disease. Other authors also describe nasopharyngeal swab and blood specimens as useful for diagnosis. They further indicate that anal or rectal swabs should be considered for individuals presenting with anal pain or proctitis. In our study, patient (#4) who did not present skin lesions was diagnosed from additional specimens, hence taking several samples may be important in cases with exposure history.

Conclusions
-----------
Our results contribute to understanding MPXV transmission and the importance of testing specimens from multiple sites in situations with relevant exposure history and e.g. missing skin lesions, which may improve diagnostic sensitivity and reduce false-negative test results.

[5] Clinical management criteria

ref: Webb E, Rigby I, Michelen M, et al. Availability, scope and quality of monkeypox clinical management guidelines globally: a systematic review. BMJ Glob Health. 2022; 7(8): e009838
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Monkeypox (MPX) is an important human _Orthopoxvirus_ infection. There has been an increase in MPX cases and outbreaks in endemic and non-endemic regions in recent decades. We appraised the availability, scope, quality and inclusivity of clinical management guidelines for MPX globally.

Methods
For this systematic review, we searched six databases from inception until 14 October 2021, augmented by a grey literature search until 17 May 2022. MPX guidelines providing treatment and supportive care recommendations were included, with no exclusions for language. There are 2 reviewers who assessed the guidelines. Quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool.

Results
Of 2026 records screened, 14 guidelines were included. Overall, most guidelines were of low-quality with a median score of 2 out of 7 (range: 1-7), lacked detail, and covered a narrow range of topics. Most guidelines focused on adults, 5 (36%) provided some advice for children, 3 (21%) for pregnant women, and 3 (21%) for people living with HIV. Treatment guidance was mostly limited to advice on antivirals; 7 guidelines advised cidofovir (4 specified for severe MPX only); 29% (4/14) tecovirimat, and 7% (1/14) brincidofovir. Only one guideline provided recommendations on supportive care and treatment of complications. All guidelines recommended vaccination as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). There are 3 guidelines thatadvised on vaccinia immune globulin as PEP for severe cases in people with immunosuppression.

Conclusion
Our results highlight a lack of evidence based clinical management guidelines for MPX globally. There is a clear and urgent need for research into treatment and prophylaxis including for different risk populations. The current outbreak provides an opportunity to accelerate this research through coordinated high-quality studies. New evidence should be incorporated into globally accessible guidelines, to benefit patient and epidemic outcomes. A 'living guideline' framework is recommended.

[6] Renaming monkeypox virus clades: WHO
Date: Fri 12 Aug 2022
Source: WHO News release [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/news/item/12-08-2022-monkeypox--experts-give-virus-variants-new-names


Consensus was reached to now refer to the former Congo Basin (Central African) clade as clade one (I) and the former West African clade as clade 2 (II). Additionally, it was agreed that clade II consists of 2 subclades.

The proper naming structure will be represented by a Roman numeral for the clade and a lower-case alphanumeric character for the subclades. Thus, the new naming convention comprises clade I, clade IIa, and clade IIb, with the latter referring primarily to the group of variants largely circulating in the 2022 global outbreak. The naming of lineages will be as proposed by scientists as the outbreak evolves. Experts will be reconvened as needed.

The new names for the clades should go into effect immediately while work continues on the disease and virus names.
