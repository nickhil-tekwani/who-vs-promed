Almost 3 years after the 1st set of patients were diagnosed with Totally Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (TDR-TB) in Iran, researchers at the P D Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Centre here said today [7 Jan 2012] they have detected India's 1st set of TDR-TB patients, 12 over the past 2 months.

In a paper published in the international journal Clinical Infection Diseases, Zarir Udwadia and his team have described how they detected the 1st 4 TDR-TB patients [Udwadia ZF, Amale RA, Ajbani KK, Rodrigues C. Totally Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in India. Clin Infect Dis. 1st published online 21 Dec 2011 doi:10.1093/cid/cir889].

"Prior to TDR, XDR or extensively drug-resistant TB was the furthest stage patients had been diagnosed with in India. After drug susceptibility testing was performed on 4 TB patients present at the hospital, it was seen that all 4 patients were resistant to both 1st line as well as 2nd line treatment," said Udwadia, adding that there was no treatment for them.

According to Udwadia, the drug-resistant nature of the TB-causing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ increases with mutations of the strain often catalysed by incorrect and erratic administration of 2nd-line drugs. "An audit of the patients' prescriptions showed that 3 of the 1st 4 patients received unsupervised 2nd-line drugs often in incorrect dosages by private practitioners in an attempt to treat their multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). By the time they were referred to us, they had moved from the MDR stage and the XDR stage to TDR-TB," he said.

Following the reports of deaths of some patients from Totally Drug Resistant Tuberculosis, (TDR TB), which is far more dangerous than Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) and Extreme Drug Resistant (XDR) forms, in Mumbai, experts say that improper treatment regimens followed by private practitioners and non-compliance to the whole course of proper treatment make tuberculosis patients vulnerable to this deadly infection.

According to the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), which is a government-run institute specializing in treating tuberculosis, there were no cases of TDR in the State [Karnataka]. A total number of 450 MDR cases were treated since 2005, of which only 219 patients could complete the treatment. The institute had also detected 2 patients with XDR in the years 2010-11.

Speaking to Express [Express News Service], Dr Shashidhar Buggi, Director, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), said: "Had these patients not completed the treatment, it could have infected several others. The MDR treatment is long and costly. However, at RGICD, we are providing free treatment to such patients with the help of the state government." He also maintained that for MDR patients, thoracic surgery is important, but there is a shortage of surgeons in our country.

Dr VM Katoch, Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said that private practitioners do not follow the proper course of treatment. Sometimes, patients visit multiple doctors, which leads to non-compliance of the treatment.

Over the past 48 hours, news has broken in India of the existence of at least 12 patients infected with tuberculosis that has become resistant to all the drugs used against the disease. Physicians in Mumbai are calling the strain TDR, for Totally Drug-Resistant. In other words, it is untreatable as far as they know.

News of some of the cases was published on 21 Dec 2011 in an ahead-of-print letter to the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. That letter describes the discovery and treatment of 4 cases of TDR-TB since last October [2011]. On Saturday [7 Jan 2012], the Times of India disclosed that there are actually 12 known cases just in one hospital, the P. D. Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Centre; in the article, Hinduja's Dr. Amita Athawale states: "The cases we clinically isolate are just the tip of the iceberg." And, as a follow up, the Hindustan Times reported yesterday [8 Jan 2012] that most hospitals in the city -- by extension, most Indian cities -- don't have the facilities to identify the TDR strain, making it more likely that unrecognized cases can go on to infect others.

TB is already one of the world's worst killers, up there with malaria and HIV/AIDS, accounting for 9.4 million cases and 1.7 million deaths in 2009, according to the WHO. At the best of times, TB treatment is difficult, requiring at least 6 months of pill combinations that have unpleasant side effects and must be taken long after the patient begins to feel well.

Because of the mismatch between treatment and symptoms, people often don't take their full course of drugs, and from that and some other factors, we get multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant MDR and XDR TB.

MDR is resistant to the 1st-choice drugs, requiring that patients instead be treated with a larger cocktail of "2nd-line" agents, which are less effective, have more side effects, and take much longer to effect a cure, sometimes 2 years or more. XDR is resistant to the 3 1st-line drugs and several of the 9 or so drugs usually recognized as being 2nd choice.

As of last spring [2011] according to the WHO, there were about 440 000 cases of MDR-TB per year, accounting for 150 000 deaths, and 25 000 cases of XDR. At the time, the WHO predicted there would be 2 million MDR or XDR cases in the word by 2012. That was before TDR-TB.

The 1st cases, as it turns out, were not these Indian ones but an equally under-reported cluster of 15 patients in Iran in 2009. They were embedded in a larger outbreak of 146 cases of MDR-TB, and what most worried the physicians who saw them was that the drug resistance was occurring in immigrants and cross-border migrants as well as Iranians: Half of the patients were Iranian and the rest Afghan, Azerbaijani and Iraqi. The Iranian team raised the possibility at the time that rates of TDR were higher than they knew, especially in border areas where there would be little diagnostic capacity or even basic medical care.

The Indian cases disclosed before Christmas demonstrate what happens when TB patients don't get good medical care. The letter to CID describes the course of 4 of the 12 patients; all 4 saw 2 to 4 doctors during their illnesses, and at least 3 got multiple, partial courses of the wrong antibiotics. The authors say this is not unusual.

"The vast majority of these unfortunate patients seek care from private physicians in a desperate attempt to find a cure for their tuberculosis. This sector of private-sector physicians in India is among the largest in the world, and these physicians are unregulated both in terms of prescribing practice and qualifications. A study that we conducted in Mumbai showed that only 5 of 106 private practitioners practicing in a crowded area called Dharavi could prescribe a correct prescription for a hypothetical patient with MDR tuberculosis. The majority of prescriptions were inappropriate and would only have served to further amplify resistance, converting MDR tuberculosis to XDR tuberculosis and TDR tuberculosis."

As their comment suggests, the other TB challenge is diagnosis, especially of resistant strains, and here again the news is not good. The WHO said last spring [2011] that only 2/3rds of countries with resistant TB epidemics have the lab capacity to detect the resistant strains. As a result, only one MDR patient out of every 10 even gets into treatment, and when they do, cure rates range from 82 percent down to 25 percent. That's for MDR. None of the TDR patients have been recorded cured, and at least one of the known Indian patients has died.

Meanwhile, health authorities estimate that one patient with active TB can infect up to 15 others, and thus resistant TB spreads: XDR-TB was 1st identified just in 2006, and it has since been found in 69 countries around the world.

[Multidrug-resistant TB or MDR-TB refers to tuberculosis that is caused by a strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ resistant to 2 of the most effective drugs used to treat TB, isoniazid (INH) and rifampin. Extensively drug-resistant TB or XDR-TB refers to a subgroup of MDR-TB strains that are additionally resistant to any of the fluoroquinolone class of drugs (e.g., levofloxacin. moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin) and any of the 3 injectable drugs used to treat tuberculosis (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin).

In 2003, 2 middle-class, HIV-negative Italian women died of tuberculosis that was caused by strains resistant to every anti-tuberculosis drug (Migliori GB et al. 1st tuberculosis cases in Italy resistant to all tested drugs. Eurosurveillance Weekly Release 12: 5, 2007). The authors of the report attributed the development of drug resistance in these patients to medical mismanagement and inappropriate use of anti-tuberculosis therapy. WHO referred to these cases as extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis or XXDR-TB, which was defined as TB due to strains resistant to all 1st and 2nd line anti-TB drugs (http://euro.who.int/tuberculosis/publications/20071204_5 and http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/CBA086E0-D64C-43A4-B9A5-D21C57B35E8D.asp).

In 2009, 15 "Totally Drug Resistant" or TDR isolates (10.3 percent) of 146 MDR-TB strains were reported from Iran (Velayati, AA, Masjedi MR, Farnia P, et al. Emergence of new forms of totally drug-resistant tuberculosis bacilli: Super extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis or totally drug-resistant strains in Iran. Chest 2009; 136: 420-425). These TDR strains were resistant to all 1st- and 2nd-line drugs tested and thus seemingly similar to XXDR-TB strains.

In December 2011, the 1st 4 of the 12 patients from Mumbai, India were reported with what was labeled TDR tuberculosis [Udwadia ZF, Amale RA, Ajbani KK, Rodrigues C. Totally Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in India. Clin Infect Dis. 1st published online 21 Dec 2011 doi:10.1093/cid/cir889, available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/11/24/cid.cir889.full.pdf%20html?sid]. The drug susceptibility testing was performed at the Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai's busiest referral laboratory and a Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) accredited laboratory for Mumbai. The isolates from each of the 4 patients in this report were resistant to all 1st-line (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin) and some 2nd-line (ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, para-aminosalicylic acid, and ethionamide) drugs tested; thus, this TDR designation is again seemingly similar to XXDR-TB strains and does not include what are called 3rd-line anti-TB drugs, such as the macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin), clofazimine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid, imipenem, high-dose isoniazid, and several new investigational drugs (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706826_6).

The latest WHO global resistance report estimated 110-132 cases of MDR tuberculosis from India in 2006, which accounts for 20 percent of the world's MDR tuberculosis load (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/11/24/cid.cir889.full.pdf%20html?sid). Indian patients with MDR tuberculosis currently are not covered by India's RNTCP, with most MDR patients seeking care from private physicians. According to Udwadia et al (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/11/24/cid.cir889.full.pdf%20html?sid ), an audit of the Indian patients' prescriptions revealed that 3 patients had received erratic, unsupervised 2nd-line drugs, added individually and often in incorrect doses, from multiple private practitioners, which undoubtedly contributed to the emergence of drug resistance.

Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is a port city on the western coast of India and is its richest and most populous city, with a total metropolitan area population of approximately 20.5 million (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai). It is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra, which is bordered by the state of Karnataka to the south.
