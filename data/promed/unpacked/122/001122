The moderator raises a very pertinent question here, for large fruit bats
(flying foxes) typically feed in trees (on nectar, blossom, fruit,
foliage). However, in extensive fieldwork on pteropids in Queensland in the
1980s, I often came across indisputable evidence of these bats landing on
the ground to scavenge fallen fruit during lean times, when other food was
particularly scarce (this might also explain their exposure to
toxoplasmosis and cerebral angiostrongyliasis). However, _Indigofera
spicata_ is a leguminous creeper of more open pastures, and most unlikely
to be eaten even inadvertently by fruit bats.
A more likely possibility is exposure to _Solanum_ toxins, some of which
are teratogenic. The floor of the summer colonies ("camps") of these
animals in some seasons was thickly carpeted with small, tomato-like seeds,
which one year I grew out and had identified as _Solanum hispidens_. To my
knowledge, the toxicity of this species has never been examined, but its
fruit certainly can be a major food source for pteropids at most times of
year, especially winter, when there is not much else available, and the
females are in early gestation.
