A Newton, New Hampshire person has tested positive for eastern equine
encephalitis [virus infection], state health officials said Monday
[20 Aug 2007].
It is the 1st human case of the mosquito-borne illness this year
[2007]. There were no human cases in 2006, but 7 cases were reported
in 2005; 2 of those victims died.
The identity of the person infected has not been released, but
officials said the man is expected to recover. The 1st sign of the
virus this year [2007] was detected in a mosquito pool in Newton, and
the virus was later found in a [mosquito] pool in Brentwood.

[The eastern and gulf coasts of the USA are endemic for eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, so a case in an area where previous
cases have occurred is not surprising. This report does not indicate
in which mosquito species EEE virus was detected. If human-biting
"bridge" species (those that feed in EEE virus endemic swamps and
travel out) are abundant, more cases might occur until the onset of
killing frosts in autumn halts virus transmission. People in this
area should avoid mosquito bites. Horses should be vaccinated.
