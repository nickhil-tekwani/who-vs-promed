At 04:00 on [31 Mar 2020], 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 36 new confirmed cases, of which 35 were imported cases and 1 was a local case (1 in Guangdong); 7 new deaths were reported (6 in Hubei and 1 in Shanghai); and 26 new suspected cases, all of which were imported.

On the same day, 186 cases newly recovered and were discharged, 1418 close contacts were released from medical observation, and 62 cases were removed from the severe category.

There are 691 confirmed cases (including 20 severe cases) and 169 imported suspected cases. A total of 806 cases were confirmed, 115 cases recovered and were discharged, and 0 cases [among the imported cases] have died.

As of 24:00 on [31 Mar 2020], according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 2004 confirmed cases (including 466 severe cases) and 172 suspected cases. There have been a total of 81 554 confirmed cases, 76 238 recovered and discharged cases, and 3312 deaths. A total of 707 913 close contacts have been traced and 20 314 close contacts still under medical observation.

In Hubei there was 1 confirmed case (1 in Wuhan, imported), 173 newly recovered and discharged cases (173 in Wuhan), 6 new deaths (5 in Wuhan), and 1283 confirmed cases (1279 cases in Wuhan). Of these 435 cases were severe cases (432 cases in Wuhan). A total of 63 326 discharged patients have recovered (46 175 in Wuhan), and there have been totals of 3193 deaths (2553 in Wuhan), and 67 802 confirmed cases (5057 in Wuhan). There were 0 new suspected cases (0 in Wuhan) and 0 existing suspected cases (0 in Wuhan).

31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 130 new cases of asymptomatic infection; 2 cases were confirmed on the same day and 302 cases were released on the same day. 1367 asymptomatic cases are still under medical observation, which is 174 less than the previous day.

A total of 1077 confirmed cases were reported from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan: 714 cases in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (128 cases discharged, 4 deaths), 41 cases in Macau Special Administrative Region (10 cases discharged), and 322 cases in Taiwan (39 cases discharged, 5 deaths).

[This is the 8th consecutive day with no newly confirmed cases with local transmission reported from Wuhan or Hubei province in its entirety in the past 24 hours. There was 1 imported case confirmed in Wuhan in the past 24 hours. There are no newly suspected cases in Wuhan or Hubei. Of 36 cases reported to have been confirmed in the past 24 hours all but 1, from Guangdong, are imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 81 554 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 36 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (29 Mar 2020) report was prepared. There were an additional 26 suspected cases reported, all imported. In addition, 7 deaths were reported, 6 from Hubei (5 from Wuhan) and 1 from Shanghai. 32 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which continues to increase the number of newly confirmed cases on a daily basis. And Macau reported 2 additional newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing its total to 41.

A total of 35 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Locations of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 806. There are an additional 169 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

New information in this daily report is the inclusion of statistics on asymptomatic infections. In recent days there have been media calls for the information. While this report doesn't provide the total of asymptomatic infections identified in the country since the beginning of testing for the SARS-CoV-2, some additional information was available in a media report in section [1B] below. As best as I can decipher from the report above, there were 130 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1367, and there were an additional 174 infections noted in the prior 24 hours.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and will end it in Wuhan on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[1B] China: asymptomatic infections
Date: Tue 31 Mar 2020

https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-03-31/china-reveals-it-has-1500-asymptomatic-coronavirus-cases-on-record-101536836.html


There were 1541 asymptomatic coronavirus cases under medical observation on the Chinese mainland as of Monday [30 Mar 2020], including 205 imported cases, China's top health body said (link in Chinese) on Tuesday [31 Mar 2020].

The data disclosure followed public calls for transparency about the size of the asymptomatic carrier population, which has become one of the biggest risks to China's battle against the pandemic, as fears have grown that they may be spreading the virus unknowingly. Previously, the Chinese government did not publicly release a count of these infections.

Starting Wednesday [1 Apr 2020], the National Health Commission will include data about asymptomatic infections in its daily epidemic reports, an official with the commission said (link in Chinese) at a press briefing.

On Monday [30 Mar 2020], Premier Li Keqiang again called for efforts to control asymptomatic cases in order to preserve China's hard-fought gains in controlling the virus, as it has managed to keep a lid on the growth of symptomatic infections.

In China, people who have no clinical symptoms of COVID-19 but test positive for the new coronavirus are generally quarantined in isolation centers for further testing. They are treated and reclassified as confirmed cases if they develop symptoms during quarantine.

[The Chinese National Health Committee included data on asymptomatic infections 1 day earlier -- in today's report (see section [1A] above). The media report above mentions a total of 1541 asymptomatic infections under observation at present, albeit the report is a bit confusing as to actual numbers. The role of asymptomatic infections in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 has not as yet been well defined, but clearly the Chinese take this as a serious threat by quarantining those positive individuals in an isolation center. Information on the proportion of asymptomatic infections that go on to have symptomatic disease is of definite interest to understand this virus better and perhaps the infectivity period prior to the onset of identifiable symptoms. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 101 cases and 3 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (30-31 Mar 2020) when there were 125 newly confirmed cases. A total of 9887 cases including 165 deaths were reported today, up from 9786 cases and 162 deaths yesterday [30 Mar 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count had been at or below 100 newly confirmed cases per day for 10 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 67.7% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 13.2% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 18.2% of the total newly confirmed cases while Seoul represented 21.8% of the newly confirmed case reports and in Gyeonggi 20.9%. Quarantined imported cases represented 6.4% of the newly confirmed cases.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. There are now 224 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). As in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 105 792 cases, including 12 428 deaths, up from 101 739 cases and 11 591 deaths reported on 29 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 30 and 31 Mar 2020 was 4053 newly confirmed cases, compared with 4050 newly confirmed cases between 29 and 30 Mar 2020 stable from yesterday's observations. As I said yesterday (30 Mar 2020) it is early, but perhaps this is the start of a positive trend. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (43 208), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (14 074), and Veneto (9155), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 49.9% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, representing a slight increase from the previous 24 hours when they represented 47.7% of nationally reported cases. Another active province is Piedmont with a total of 9301 cases and represents 14.5% of newly reported cases, twice the proportion than yesterday (30 Mar 2020). There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 20 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 19 days since the countrywide lockdown. Of note is since a peak on 26 Mar 2020, Lombardy has decreased the daily newly confirmed cases by 58.8%, and Emilia-Romagna by 32.1%. A very positive trend...

Iran's death toll from coronavirus has reached 2898, with 141 deaths in the past 24 hours, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV on Tuesday [31 Mar 2020], adding that the total number of infections has jumped to 44 606. "In the past 24 hours, there have been 3111 new cases of infected people. Unfortunately, 3703 of the infected people are in a critical condition," Jahanpur said.

At a meeting broadcast live, Rouhani called on Iranians to avoid public places. The government has banned inter-city travel and warned of a potential surge in coronavirus cases because many Iranians defied calls to cancel travel plans for the Persian New Year holidays that began on [20 Mar 2020]. But it has so far stopped short of imposing a lockdown on Iranian cities.

Iran has also banned gatherings during "Sizdah Bedar" on [1 Apr 2020], a nature festival during which Iranians traditionally have picnics outdoors.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 188 530 including 3889 deaths, an increase from 164 253 cases and 3165 deaths. New York state, with 75 983 (40.3%) cumulative case reports and 8658 (35.7%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. Daily reported case counts are accelerating in New Jersey (2060 newly confirmed cases 8.5%), Louisiana (1212 newly confirmed cases 5.0%), California (1091 newly confirmed cases 4.5%), Michigan (1117 newly confirmed cases 4.6%), and Florida (1037 newly confirmed cases 4.3%) to a lesser but increasing amount, Georgia, Massachusetts, Washington, Illinois, and Pennsylvania.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness. The curve of interest, by date of onset of disease, is based on 25.3% of the number of cases plotted on the epidemic curve using date of confirmation of disease.

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain has been rapidly accelerating. As of today (31 Mar 2020), totals of 94 417 cases and 8189 deaths have been reported, up from 85 195 cases and 7340 deaths confirmed in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is 177.0. It is now 2nd in Europe, behind Italy, and 3rd globally behind the USA and Italy, in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease and one clearly sees the trend for increasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 94 417 cases, 49 243 (52.2%) were hospitalized and 5607 (5.9%) were admitted to the ICU. The crude reported case fatality rate was 8.7% with more deaths occurring than reported ICU admissions.

La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]
