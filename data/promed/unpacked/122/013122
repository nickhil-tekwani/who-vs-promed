Bathing pools at the Ulu Bendul Recreational Park will be closed to the public until 26 Sep 2021 for clean-up work, after 3 individuals who visited the area fell ill. All 3, who have since been warded at the Tuanku Ja'afar Hospital, came down with fever, vomiting and diarrhoea after visiting the popular park. Two are believed to have leptospirosis, while the 3rd may have a rotavirus infection.

Kuala Pilah District Council chief Mohd Faizal Abdul Manap said the closure would also allow the authorities to carry out maintenance work in the area from Friday (24 Sep 2021). "We decided to close following advice from the state health authorities. We regret the inconvenience," he said on Thursday (23 Sep 2021).

Earlier, state health director Datin Dr. Harlina Abdul Rashid said the authorities were still probing the cases. "Based on the symptoms, we suspect 2 individuals have come down with leptospirosis, or rat urine disease, and another with rotavirus. Prior to falling ill, all 3 had all visited the recreational park," she said. Dr. Harlina said health authorities have also carried out a risk assessment and taken samples from the park.

"In the meantime, we hope the people will always maintain a high degree of hygiene and wash their hands with clean water. Avoid using or drinking water from the river and do not get into the water if you have a wound," she said. Dr. Harlina also advised those who had visited the park recently and were showing similar symptoms to get treatment at the nearest health facility. "We would also like to remind the people to always adhere to COVID-19 prevention standard operating procedures, avoid crowded places, maintain social distancing and have your masks on when in public places," she added.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates. There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. The microorganism can be found in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated by urine from chronically infected animals.

Leptospirosis affects humans and a variety of animals that include dogs, cattle, pigs, and rodents. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Leptospires enter the body through open sores or wounds in the skin, or through mucous membranes following exposure to contaminated water. Outbreaks frequently follow large rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals (https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/exposure/index.html).

Leptospirosis is also an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used if available.

Ulu Bendul Recreation Park (https://bit.ly/3kHXn6K), the site of the current leptospirosis outbreak, is located 16 km (9.9 mi) east of Seremban (the capital of the Malaysian state of Negeri Sembilan, on the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia, just south of Kuala Lumpur, the federal capital of Malaysia). Fresh water from mountain streams flows into the human-made lake in Ulu Bendul Recreation Park; there are cabins for mountain climbers, tracks for hikers and jungle paths for visitors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Pilah_(town)).

In 2014, ProMED reported an outbreak of leptospirosis among visitors to a waterfall in a nearby recreational park at Jeram Toi, about 40 km (25 mi) northeast of Seremban (ProMED post Leptospirosis - Malaysia: (NS) national park 20141014.2862048).
