New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Beatrice Hill, Northern Territory
Date of start of the outbreak: 5 Feb 2015
Outbreak status: resolved (9 May 2015)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 24 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Healthy sentinel herd with weekly blood samples collected for virus isolation and serology. No clinical disease detected. Seropositive only.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 16.67 / 0 / 0 / 0
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: No disease has been detected. These findings occurred in the known bluetongue zone in northern Australia. Thirty years of regular structured surveillance have determined the extent of Australia's bluetongue zone and vectors (http://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/programs/disease-surveillance/national-arbovirus-monitoring-program/). Serotypes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 16, 20, 21 and 23 have previously been isolated in cattle in Northern Australia. It is believed that infected vectors are periodically blown to Australia on monsoonal winds. The detection of this new serotype is recognition of the effectiveness of the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) program. Identification of these isolates as bluetongue virus serotype 12 was established based on virus neutralisation assays and capillary sequencing of Seg-2 (VP2) and Seg-6 (VP5). Sequence analysis indicated all samples as belonging to Malaysia A genotype.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied; no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (OIE's Reference Laboratory)

[This is the 1st time that BTV-12 has been reported in Australia. Please note that the comments made in the epidemiological section of the report provide the full details of this new serotype.

The National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) monitors the distribution of economically important arboviruses (i.e., insect-borne viruses) of livestock and their vectors in Australia.
