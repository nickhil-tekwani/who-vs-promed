BLUETONGUE IN THE NETHERLANDS: Follow-up report No. 2
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on 18 Sep 2006 from Dr Peter W. de Leeuw, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and
Fisheries, The Hague:
End of previous report period: 28 Aug 2006 (see Disease Information,
19 [35], 628, dated 31 Aug 2006).
End of this report period: 11 Sep 2006.
Identification of agent: bluetongue virus serotype 8.
Date of start of the event: 14 Aug 2006.
At an assembly centre in Leeuwarden, in the north of the country, 2
cows have been found to be positive for bluetongue (serology and
PCR). Infection of these 2 animals cannot be related to animals
coming from the current 20-km restriction zone. The animals originate
from 2 different places, one from Best in the south of the country
and one from Nieuwendijk in the west. Investigations are currently
being carried out in Best and Nieuwendijk to check whether the farms
of origin are infected. Investigations are also being carried out
around Leeuwarden to verify whether the surroundings of the assembly
centre are infected.
In either case, a new restriction zone will have to be established
covering most of the north of the Netherlands. Anticipating the
results of these investigations, the whole territory of the
Netherlands has been declared a restriction zone for bluetongue
disease from 8 Sep 2006, and all the measures of Directive 2000/75/EC
and Decision 2005/393/EC have come into force.
