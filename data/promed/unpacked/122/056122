Re: Second confirmed MenB _Neisseria meningitidis_ [infection], human, New Brunswick
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"This message is to provide additional information regarding the Rutgers student with meningococcal meningitis. The laboratory tests that were done indicate that _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup (type) B (MenB) caused the infection. Rutgers Student Health continues to coordinate the response for this infection with local, regional, state health officials and the CDC.

"Vaccination is the best protection against meningococcal disease. However, the vaccine routinely given to protect against meningococcal disease protects against 4 serogroups A, C, W, and Y. This vaccine does not provide protection against MenB disease.

"There are currently 2 licensed vaccines that protect against MenB, Bexsero and Trumenba. These safe and effective vaccines may be given to anyone 16 to 23 years old to provide short-term protection against most strains of MenB disease; 16 to 18 years are the preferred ages for vaccination. As a precaution, you should contact your healthcare provider or Rutgers Student Health to discuss whether you may be at increased risk for MenB and your options for vaccination against MenB.

"More information about serogroup B meningococcal vaccination can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/mening/faqs-hcp-adolescent-vaccine.html#serogroup.

"Members of the University community who experience symptoms or have health concerns may visit their health care provider. Students may visit Rutgers Student Health (848-932-7402) Monday through Thursday from 8:30am to 4:30pm. and Friday from 10am to 4:30pm, at Hurtado Health Center, Busch Livingston Health Center and Cook Douglass Health Center (http://rhsmedical.rutgers.edu/locations/hours-of-operation/). For medical advice when the health centers are not open, students can call the Advice Nurse Line: 1-800-890-5882. Faculty and staff at Rutgers University-New Brunswick who have additional questions or concerns can contact the Occupational Health Department at 848-932-8254. In case of an emergency, call 911. It is extremely important that anyone with symptoms of meningococcal disease (e.g., rash, headache, stiff neck, fever) get evaluated as soon as possible. While meningococcal disease is treatable with antibiotics, treatment must be started quickly.

"In addition, to help prevent the spread of the disease, Rutgers Student Health is encouraging members of the University community to pay increased attention to personal hygiene practices such as good handwashing, covering coughs, and avoiding the sharing of drinks and eating utensils with others.

"Rutgers University is closely monitoring the situation in conjunction with state, regional and local public health officials and will continue to provide updates as necessary."

A 2nd Rutgers student was hospitalized with bacterial meningitis on Fri 29 Apr [2016], after a student was 1st diagnosed with a case on 18 Mar [2016]. Officials are trying to determine if the cases are linked.

The patient, whose name was not disclosed, is recovering after receiving treatment, Lasky [Assistant Vice Chancellor for Health and Wellness] said. People who have been in contact with the student have been notified, and will be prescribed antibiotic medication as a preventative measure.

"The bacteria that causes meningococcal disease are not as contagious as the common cold or the flu, and they are not spread by casual contact or by simply breathing the air where a person with the disease has been," Lasky said. The bacteria strain infecting the second student has not been determined yet, she said. The hospital has requested testing on the new case to identify it, which will also help in establishing any potential link between the cases.

The disease infects the lining of the human brain and spinal cord. It can also infect the bloodstream, Lasky said. Physical symptoms include fever, soreness and rash. While the disease can be treated with antibiotics, rapid care is important. "Rutgers Student Health is encouraging members of the University community to pay increased attention to personal hygienic practices such as good hand washing, covering coughs and avoiding sharing drinks or utensils with others," Lasky said.

UPDATE [Thu] 5 Apr 2016: University spokesperson E.J. Miranda said in an email that the 2nd student lived off campus. The 1st patient has fully recovered and left the hospital, but no further information can be provided.

Lasky said in an update that _Neisseria meningitidis_ type B infected the 2nd patient.

"Rutgers Student Health continues to coordinate the response for this infection with local, regional health officials and the (Centers for Disease Control)," she said. Most vaccines protect against meningitis types A, C, W and Y, but not B. Students should contact Rutgers Student Health or their physicians about Bexsero or Trumenba, both of which can protect against type B for a short period of time, she said. The vaccines are for those aged 16 to 23, with those between 16 and 18 being the primary group they are designed for.

Students can learn more on the CDC website.

The health centers are open five days a week, beginning at 8:30 am Monday-Thursday, and 10:00 am on Fridays, and closing at 4:30 pm every day. The Advice Nurse Line also exists for when the facilities are closed: students can call the line at 1-800-890-582. Students experiencing medical distress should call 911. Students experiencing meningitis symptoms should see a physician as quickly as possible to limit the impact it can have.

This is a developing story. Updates will be posted as we receive them.

[ProMED-mail thanks Ethan Iverson for his submission.

From the information reported above, 2 Rutgers University students were hospitalized with bacterial meningitis due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B a little over 1 month apart, the 1st on 18 Mar 2016 and the second 29 Apr 2016. Genotyping will need to be done to establish if the strains isolated from these 2 patients are closely related. Outbreaks of meningococcal disease usually are caused by closely related strains. If strains are unrelated by genotyping, the 2 cases most likely do not represent an outbreak.

The CDC has defined the situation that would call for just chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of a case and the situation that would additionally call for immunization of the population at risk (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a3.htm). A single case would only call for chemoprophylaxis of close contacts, but mass vaccination might play a role protecting the population at risk during an outbreak. Mass vaccination campaigns are expensive, require a massive public health effort, and can create unwarranted concern among the public. The decision to implement a mass vaccination campaign to prevent meningococcal disease depends on whether the occurrence of more than 1 case represents an outbreak or an unusual clustering of endemic disease.

If the only association between patients is attending the same school or university, the population at risk is all persons attending the school or university. Rutgers has an enrollment of 67 000 students (48 000 undergraduates and 19,000 postgraduates) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University). However, Rutgers has several campuses (Newark, Camden and New Brunswick), with 31 593 undergraduates and 8841 graduate students at the New Brunswick campus.

The CDC recommends (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a3.htm): "If 3 or more cases have occurred in either an organization-- or a community-based outbreak during 3 or less months (starting at the time of the 1st confirmed or probable case), a primary attack rate should be calculated." (Attack rate per 100 000 = [(number of primary confirmed or probable cases during a 3-month period) / (number of population at risk)] x 100 000.) "Vaccination of the population at risk should be considered if the attack rate is over 10 cases/100 000 persons."

Even though only 2 cases have so far been reported, assuming the 2 patients at Rutgers are primary cases and the population at risk is 40 000, the attack rate is below 10 per 100 000. If the population at risk could be narrowed or more cases are reported, the decision to mass vaccinate could change. At present the University seems to be offering chemoprophylaxis to close contacts and vaccination with serogroup B vaccines on an individual basis. - Mod.ML
