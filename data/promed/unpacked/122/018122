Dengue hemorrhagic fever after living donor renal transplantation
-----------------------------------------------
[The following is the summary of a Case Report which may be of interest to
ProMED-mail subscribers. This case report was published in "Nephrology
Dialysis Transplantation" by Felicia Li-Sher Tan, Dale L. S. K. Loh and K.
Prabhakaran of the Department of Pediatric Surgery, National University of
Hospital, Singapore. It describes an unusual route of transmission of
dengue hemorrhagic fever. ProMED-mail is indebted to Prof. Lam Sai Kit of
the Asian Pacific Society of Medical Virologists for drawing attention to
this report - Mod.CP]
The transmission of infection from donor to recipient in solid organ
transplantation can result in loss of the allograft and, in severe cases,
death of the recipient. The occurrence of dengue virus infection in an
immunocompromised renal transplant patient can have many detrimental
effects, the most life-threatening of these is development of dengue shock
syndrome. We present a case of possible transmission of dengue infection
from donor to recipient after living donor renal transplantation, resulting
in a fulminant course of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).
A 23-year-old male with end-stage renal failure due to lupus nephritis
underwent a living donor renal transplantation. The donor was his mother,
who was healthy except for a past history of dengue fever 6 months
previously. Early post-operative recovery was uncomplicated, with immediate
graft function and serum creatinine of 67 mmol/l on post-operative day 2.
His immunosuppressive medication consisted of mycophenolate mofetil,
tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. On the 5th post-operative day, he spiked
a temperature of 39 C. He was asymptomatic and physical examination did not
reveal a source of infection.
In view of a previous history of dengue infection in the donor, blood was
analyzed for dengue virus using real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). This was positive for dengue virus serotype 1. Over the next
week, he continued to spike high temperatures with a fall in platelet count
and a deterioration of his general clinical condition. On the 12th
post-operative day, he developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, gross
hematuria and tachycardia. Investigations revealed that his hemoglobin had
dropped to 4.6 g/dl, leucocyte count was 0.86109/l, platelet count was
71109/l, serum lactate dehydrogenase was 1322 U/l (normal: 300-700 U/l) and
albumin was 14 g/l (normal: 38-49 g/l). His mycophenolate mofetil dose was
discontinued and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor was commenced for
his profound leucopenia. He required multiple packed cell and platelet
transfusions. Chest X-ray revealed a right-sided pleural effusion. On the
15th post-operative day, he complained of left side pain and abdominal
distension. One liter of blood was drained from his Tenckoff catheter.
Computed tomography of his abdomen revealed a large retroperitoneal
hematoma arising from the bed of the transplanted kidney. Emergency
laparotomy was undertaken for surgical hemostasis and evacuation of the
hematoma. Intra-operatively, 1.5 l of blood was drained from the
retroperitoneal space. A generalized ooze was seen from the tissue bed of
the allograft, and this was treated with packing. There was a perforation
seen in the peritoneum, which allowed communication between the
retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal spaces. The transplanted kidney
appeared healthy. A repeat dengue RT-PCR was negative. Post-operative
recovery was uneventful, with resolution of fever and recovery of
thrombocytopenia within the next week. Hemorrhagic tendencies ceased
spontaneously with resolution of hemetemesis and hematuria. His graft
function remained excellent. [A Figure not reproduced here depicts the
course and progression of his illness.]
The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying DHF remains controversial.
There is strong evidence to suggest an increased risk of DHF with secondary
dengue virus infection. The presence of pre-existing anti-dengue antibodies
increases viremia titres by a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent
enhancement of infection (ADE). Having lived in a dengue-endemic region,
the patient may have been infected previously but was asymptomatic or had
subclinical infection. A large proportion of the adult population in
Singapore have been exposed to dengue as reflected by a high prevalence of
dengue seropositivity (45 percent). Transplantation of the dengue-infected
allograft can cause secondary infection and development of DHF. It is not
known whether donor organs remain infected after apparent resolution of
viremia. Alternatively, secondary transmission could have been via the
usual route, the bite of a mosquito. However, there was no active
transmission of dengue in our area during this period, making
hospital-acquired infection less likely. Clinical presentation and course
of the illness in this immunosuppressed patient is similar to that in the
immunocompetent, except for a longer period of illness. Our patient
experienced a prolonged course of illness (19 days) as well as prolonged
duration of thrombocytopenia (12 days). The mean duration of illness is 2-7
days and duration of thrombocytopenia 3.6 days (ï¿½1.6 days). The critical
stage in DHF is usually around the time of defervescence, with circulatory
failure of hemorrhagic manifestations occurring about 24 h before to 24 h
after the temperature falls to normal or below. This was the case for our
patient with shock and hemoperitoneum occurring on the same day as
defervescence of fever. DHF occurring early post-operatively poses a
potential danger to the transplant patient. Bleeding diathesis resulting
from thrombocytopenia, dysfunctional surviving platelets and increased
fibrinolysis result in persistent hemorrhage especially from cut tissue
surfaces. In our patient, profuse, persistent bleeding from the tissue bed
of the transplanted kidney led to circulatory collapse and a need for
surgical drainage of hematoma and hemostasis. In addition, he also had
other hemorrhagic manifestations with gastrointestinal bleeding and
hematuria. Hypovolemia poses a risk of damage to the allograft.
Hypoalbuminemia secondary to leakage of plasma aggravates the problem of
poor wound healing in the immunosuppressed transplant recipient.
No specific therapy or vaccine exists for DHF. Management is supportive,
with correction of hypovolemia and coagulation abnormalities. This case
illustrates the severity of DHF after renal transplantation of an infected
allograft. In dengue-endemic regions, clinicians should have a high index
of suspicion for DHF in patients with viral hemorrhagic fevers. Screening
donors of organs and blood products may be beneficial, although
sensitivity, feasibility and cost benefits of screening need to be assessed.
