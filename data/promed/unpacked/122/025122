Thailand's livestock authorities have pledged to investigate the death of a pet pig after a laboratory test at a university revealed it had died of African swine fever [ASF], the 1st such report in the country [see comment].

Thailand has insisted for years that its swine herds were unaffected by ASF, which in recent years has swept across Europe and Asia and killed [many] millions of pigs, especially in China, even as its Southeast Asian neighbors report outbreaks.

A miniature pet pig in Bangkok was found dead of the disease after being brought in by its owner for a laboratory test conducted in early December [2021] at Kasetsart University, said Nattavut Ratanavanichrojn, associate dean of the university's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Kasetsart Nakhon Pathom province, west of Bangkok.

"African swine fever was found in Thailand because we found it," Nattavut told Reuters on Friday [7 Jan 2022] night, adding that the university had sent the results of the pig's autopsy to Thailand's Livestock Development Department last month [December 2021].

He added that the owner had 2 other miniature pigs in the same house that also died later. The university's finding follows growing speculation that an outbreak of ASF is already decimating Thai swine herds, with hog prices rising due to lower supplies this year.

[On 25 Dec 2021, Taiwan reported the detection of the ASF virus in a consignment of pork products (sausages) imported from Thailand (ProMED post 20211225.8700482). In May 2021, Viet Nam reported the detection of ASF virus in a batch of hogs imported from Thailand. The media report, informing about the event, included the following statement: "Thailand has officially never reported outbreaks of African swine fever, thus officially being an oasis of disease-free zone in South East Asia. All surrounding countries have officially reported outbreaks: Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia have. The country holds a strong trade position in Asia and does export both pigs and pig meat."

According to the information from the associate dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kasetsart University, an autopsy of the miniature pet pig was performed. Information about the gross pathology and histopathological findings and about lab techniques by which ASF was identified is requested.

An interactive map presenting ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs in Asia, including all of Thailand's surrounding countries, is available at https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/African-Swine-Fever/ASF-China/?dossier=35415&widgetid=0. To view outbreaks along Thailand's borders, in particular with Laos and Myanmar, it is suggested to zoom in. - Mod.AS
