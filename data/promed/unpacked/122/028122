Taiwan: Measles imported ex Philippines
---------------------------------------
The Center for Disease Control [Department of Health, Taiwan] has confirmed
this year's first case of measles in early March 2002. The case occurred in
an 11-month-old daughter of a Filipino woman. The baby had not received the
recommended vaccination against measles at 9 months and had accompanied her
mother to the Philippines to visit relatives. On the basis of the measles
incubation period it was estimated that the disease was contracted whilst
in the Philippines.
According to Center for Disease Control statistics, from last year the
number of imported cases of measles has been increasing. In 2001, out of 9
confirmed cases of measles, 5 were imported from mainland China, 2 of which
were adults and 3 of which were infants. One infant had not yet reached the
recommended age for measles vaccination and the other 2 had not received
vaccination according to the recommended schedule.
In recent years marrying foreign brides or brides from mainland China has
become more commonplace [in Taiwan]. As the rates of immunization coverage
in South East Asia are comparatively lower, mothers from such areas often
do not have immunity against measles. As a result, their infants do not
have the benefit of protection from maternal antibodies and therefore are
more susceptible to infection before they reach the recommended vaccination
age of 9 months.
