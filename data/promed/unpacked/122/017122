Researchers work to combat dangerous aflatoxins
-----------------------------------------------
At the recent annual meeting of the American Phytopathological Society in
New Orleans, LA, plant pathologists discussed the latest advancements in
controlling the fungi that produce aflatoxins (toxic chemicals that are
known to cause cancer in animals). A promising development reported was
the identification of genetic resistance to aflatoxin production in a
number of major crops. According to Donald White, plant pathologist,
University of Illinois-Urbana, "Commercially usable resistant varieties are
being developed and will be available to producers sometime in the future.
But he added that genetic resistance greatly reduces, but does not
completely eliminate, production of aflatoxin. He suggested that
resistance will be most useful when combined with other techniques that
lower fungal infection and aflatoxin production.
Themis Michailides, a plant pathologist at the University of
California-Davis said that progress has been made in reducing contamination
of crops with aflatoxins. He indicated that biotechnology, genetic
resistance, and the use of how simple crop management practices like
irrigation to avoid drought stress, early harvesting and careful handling
can significantly reduce aflatoxin content in crops.
The fungus _Aspergillus flavus_ is the major producer of aflatoxin in
infected crops. Because of their toxicity, aflatoxins are recognized as
serious food safety hazards by most countries of the world and more than 50
countries have established or proposed regulations for controlling them in
food and feed. In the U.S., corn, cottonseed, peanuts, and other crops are
routinely tested and those containing more than 20 parts per million of
aflatoxins cannot be used in human food or fed to dairy cows. It is
estimated that U.S. producers lose about $100 million annually to aflatoxin
contamination of crops. Peter Cotty, plant pathologist, USDA-ARS said that
by reducing aflatoxin contamination, the incidence of a potent carcinogen
in food and in the environment is consequently decreased.
