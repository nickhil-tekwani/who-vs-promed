On 17 Aug [2021], the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to Midwestern Pet Foods, Inc. following plant inspections. Furthermore, the letter stated that brands of pet food manufactured by Midwestern were possibly linked to more than 130 pet deaths and over 220 pet illnesses due to consumption.

Steven M. Solomon, M.P.H., D.V.M., director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, stated, "We are issuing this corporate-wide warning letter because inspections of Midwestern Pet Foods, Inc.'s manufacturing plants revealed evidence of violations, which were shared across multiple plants and were associated with the illness or death of hundreds of pets who had eaten the company's dry dog food."

According to the report, Sportmix dog foods manufactured by Midwestern Pet Foods in Evansville, Indiana, contain high levels of aflatoxin. Moreover, aflatoxin is a by-product of a corn mold, _Aspergillus flavus_, which at high levels can kill pets.

The FDA considers pet food "adulterated" if it contains more than 20 parts per billion (ppb) of aflatoxin. Shockingly, the FDA found the corn-based dog food sold by Midwestern had levels of aflatoxin as high as 558 ppb.

In addition to serious health concerns, animals exposed to high levels of aflatoxin can develop fatal aflatoxin poisoning. As per the FDA, pets who suffer from aflatoxin poisoning typically exhibit signs such as sluggishness, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice, and unexplained bruising or bleeding. Aflatoxin can also cause blood clotting in some instances, and liver damage and death in the long run.

Furthermore, Midwestern made a voluntary recall after several samples tested positive for _Salmonella_. Brands include CanineX, Earthborn Holistic, Venture, Unrefined, Sportmix Wholesomes, Pro Pac, Pro Pac Ultimates, Sportstrail, Sportmix, and Meridian.

Despite this correction, the FDA still found Midwestern's food safety program lacked critical elements. According to the report, the food safety program appeared to be ineffective in preventing _Salmonella_. Furthermore, the FDA reported that none of the recalled items should be available for purchase to the public.

Midwestern Pet Foods has been requested to send the FDA a written response. FDA requires a company to respond within 15 days with specific steps describing its plans to resolve any violations observed. The company will face legal actions if it fails to respond or correct its violation(s).

What to do if your pet consumed Midwestern Pet Foods

Dispose of any recalled pet food products announced by Midwestern Pet Foods, Inc. from your home. Contact your veterinarian, regardless of signs. It's possible some pets may not exhibit any signs at all.

The FDA encourages pet owners to report suspected illness through the Safety Reporting Portal or to call your state's FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinators.

[Signs of aflatoxicosis in dogs include the following:
- bloody vomiting or diarrhea
- general lethargy
- loss of appetite
- increased water consumption and urination
- jaundice or yellowing of the whites of the eyes or gums or inside of the ears, especially in cats

In severe cases, aflatoxin can cause death.

Although aflatoxin has been associated with cancer in people, it does not cause cancer in dogs. Dogs do not live long enough to develop any kind of cancer associated with aflatoxin.

Dogs are sensitive to low-level, long-term intake. Although the clinical signs listed above are correct, it is important to realize there are other causes of the same signs. It is important to have your pet evaluated by a veterinarian if there are signs of illness.

If you have purchased any of the food mentioned by name and expiration date, please remove and discard the food. Do not feed your pets this food. Please take your pet to a veterinarian for a complete check-up, including necessary blood work. - Mod.TG
