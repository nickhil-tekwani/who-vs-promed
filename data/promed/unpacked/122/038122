Tests confirm crow deaths at Dusit Zoo linked to virus
------------------------------------------------------
Mahidol University is examining a further 10 samples from city crows after
early test results linked the deaths of 2 birds at Dusit Zoo to avian
influenza. "We want to ascertain whether other crows have been exposed to
the virus," natural resources and environment minister Praphat
Panyachartrak said yesterday. Mr Praphat said samples would be collected
from different areas of the zoo to determine whether the virus had spread
among the crow population. Crows were also frequent visitors to the nearby
Chitrlada Palace and Government House.
The government was also seeking to ascertain whether the virus found in
crows was the same as the H5N1 strain in chickens. The early lab tests
detected the H5 strain in crows, but did not reveal whether the N1 strain
was also present. The N1 strain is more virulent, mutates rapidly, and
could leap to humans.
The death of the 2 crows had already prompted officials to test exotic
birds kept at Dusit Zoo. Also yesterday, the first tests were conducted on
city birds, including pigeons and sparrows at Sanam Luang, where vets and
national park officials found 20 dead birds. Other targeted areas in the
city included Silom Road, Lumpini Park, and the grounds around Wat Suthat
temple.

Laos culls 40 000 chickens to stop spread of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------------
Laos has culled more than 40 000 chickens at farms around the capital,
Vientiane, in an effort to prevent the spread of bird flu, an official said
Wednesday. The mass slaughter began 27 Jan 2004, after samples from dead
poultry tested positive for the virus, said Phachone Bounma, spokesman for
the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry's livestock department.
Bird flu has killed 19 people in Viet Nam and Thailand and devastated
poultry farms across Asia. People infected with the disease have been found
to have had close contact with sick birds. "There are bird flu outbreaks in
Vientiane, but the situation is not severe like in neighboring countries
because the poultry industry in Laos is small," Phachone said. Laos has
reported no suspected human cases of bird flu, "but we are actively taking
precautions to monitor the situation," he added.
Most of the country's chickens, ducks and geese are raised in villages and
on small farms, and only about 3 million are kept at nearly 40 small
industrial farms around Vientiane, Phachone said. He said bird flu
outbreaks have been confirmed at 18 of the farms and "we will continue to
destroy chickens if more are found to have the virus," he said.
Laos, an impoverished and landlocked country of about 6 million people,
does not export poultry and breeds chickens mainly for domestic consumption.
