The Ministry of Health is reporting an outbreak of hand foot and mouth disease [HFMD] in the Turks and Caicos Islands affecting some schools and children.

The SUN understands that up to 20 cases have already been reported to the Ministry of Health, Agriculture and Human Services. It is not clear how many schools are affected, but a source reported that it could be up to 6, and at least one of them is a government school. The TCI Hospitals, when contacted, confirmed that they have been dealing with HFMD patients but declined to divulge the numbers, telling us instead to obtain such records from the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health said: "A few suspected cases have recently been reported from health care facilities in Providenciales."

The Ministry of Health, Agriculture and Human Services (MOHAHS) issued a press statement on the disease informing the public that it is in the process of collecting specimens to dispatch to the Caribbean Public Health Agency to confirm that the ailment is in fact HFMD. The ministry further noted that it has embarked on an enhanced surveillance and education campaign to ensure that suspected cases are identified as quickly as possible and schools and daycare facilities are educated on proper implementation of prevention and hygiene measures. HFMD is a contagious viral illness that primarily affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. It is transmitted by direct contact with nasal secretions, (droplets produced by coughing or sneezing), saliva, fluid from blisters and stool of infected individuals. HFMD is most prevalent in childcare settings due to frequent contact with soiled diapers and children putting their hands in their mouths.

HFMD occasionally occurs in adolescents and adults. Symptoms include some or all of the following: painful sores in the mouth, rashes on the hands and feet, which may be associated with blisters, fever, headache, feeling generally unwell or irritable, runny nose, and/or sore throat. It is mostly a mild and self-limiting illness lasting for a few days. However, there are more severe, albeit uncommon, forms of the disease which are associated with neurological complications as a result of meningitis (associated with fever, headache, and neck stiffness) and encephalitis (resulting in paralysis).

People can sometimes be contagious for days or weeks after the symptoms have ended. There is no specific treatment for hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Symptom control, such as the use of paracetamol (Panadol or Tylenol) for fever and pain relief, is often all that is necessary. In some cases, HFMD can cause a sore mouth and throat, which makes it difficult to swallow. It is, therefore, important to maintain adequate fluid intake to avoid dehydration that could result in hospitalization. Symptoms usually resolve within 10 days. Persons with suspected HFMD should abstain from school and report to a healthcare provider to obtain guidance, including when to return to work, school or daycare. The MOHAHS will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as appropriate, the Ministry of Health said.

Medical practitioners advise that if your child's fever remains elevated despite appropriate fever-reducing drugs, or if he or she develops any signs or symptoms of dehydration (dry skin and mucous membranes, weight loss, persistent irritability, lethargy, or decreased urine output), you should seek immediate medical attention. When concerned or in doubt, contact your child's health care provider.

The method of control is to:
* Limit person-to-person contact such as hugging, kissing or sharing utensils.
* Promote good hygiene practices such as hand washing with soap and water; covering nose and mouth when sneezing.
* Appropriate infection control practices are recommended to prevent the spread of hand, foot and mouth disease. These include immediately separating suspected cases of HFMD from the general school population and sending them home and frequent disinfection of schools in order to prevent the spread of this disease. It is recommended that schools should clean all areas and items that are more likely to have frequent hand contact (for example, taps, toys, keyboards, door handles, or desks) at least twice a day and also clean these areas immediately when visibly handled by ill persons. It is also recommended to wash items with soap and water and then to disinfect them with a 5 percent bleach solution (which is commonly sold commercially) diluted one part bleach to 10 parts water.

The Ministry of Health, Agriculture and Human Services (MOHAHS) of the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) wishes to inform the public that there have been media reports of an ongoing outbreak of HFMD in Singapore and Japan and recent reports of cases in neighboring Caribbean countries. The Turks and Caicos Islands is the latest country that has experienced an outbreak of the disease. Jamaica's schools are said to have been grappling with the ailment, forcing that country's ministry of health to close down a number of school and initiate an extensive sanitizing exercise. Parents with children attending schools in the TCI have reported getting information from schools regarding the disease and how to diminish the chances of their children contracting it.

Hand foot and mouth disease is a common childhood illness caused by different enteroviruses such as a Coxsackie virus. It is said that the illness most often occurs between March and June and between September and December, but it can occur at any time. It is most frequently seen in young children, infants and toddlers. Hand foot and mouth disease is characterised by fever and a blister-like rash affecting the palms of the hands and soles of the feet along with blisters inside the mouth. Research shows that children usually become infected with the virus from other children through hugging, kissing or contact with stool. It typically occurs in small epidemics in nursery schools or kindergartens.

It is not the same as other diseases that have similar names: foot-and-mouth disease (sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease) or mad cow disease. These diseases almost always occur in animals. The virus spreads easily through coughing and sneezing. It can also spread through infected stool, such as when you change a diaper or when a young child gets stool on his or her hands and then touches objects that other children put in their mouths. Often the disease breaks out within a community. It usually takes 3 to 6 days for a person to get symptoms of hand-foot-and-mouth disease after being exposed to the virus. This is called the incubation period.
