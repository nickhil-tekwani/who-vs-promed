Traces of West Nile Virus Found in Breast Milk
----------------------------
Traces of West Nile virus have been found in the breast milk of a mother
who contracted the disease, probably from blood transfusions, health
officials said yesterday. But so far her baby is healthy, despite being
breast-fed while the mother was ill.
The case does not mean that current recommendations in favor of
breast-feeding should change, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Women should still be encouraged to breast-feed because it
is so beneficial to infants, the C.D.C. said. But the centers also issued a
statement saying women with documented West Nile infections might want to
consult their doctors about breast-feeding.
But their doctors may not know what to advise. Dr. Lyle Petersen, a West
Nile expert at the disease centers, said it was not known whether breast
milk could transmit the virus to babies.
The mother in the new case, a 40-year-old from southeastern Michigan, gave
birth on 2 Sep 2002 and had one transfusion that day and another on 3 Sep
2002. She ran a fever while in the hospital but was sent home on 4 Sep 2002
and continued to suffer from fever, headaches, malaise and nausea. She was
readmitted to the hospital 13 days later and was found to be infected with
West Nile.
Tests showed that the transfusion on 3 Sep 2002 carried the virus and that
another patient who had received blood from the same donor also became ill.
The woman's breast milk was found to contain genetic material from West
Nile, but that finding does not prove that whole live viruses were present.
Genetic material from West Nile has never been found in breast milk before,
the disease centers said.
The baby is being tested for infection, and samples of the milk are being
tested to find out whether the virus can be grown from them. That would
indicate that live virus was present in the milk.
It is a good sign that the baby has remained healthy, Dr. Petersen said.
But he added that the incubation period of 2 to 14 days was not over and
that in theory the baby could still become sick if the virus was
transmitted in the milk. The mother nursed until 19 Sep 2002, when the West
Nile diagnosis was made.
"We would expect the virus in breast milk to be present for only a very
short period of time," Dr. Petersen said, adding that he would expect the
risk to become negligible very quickly as the virus disappeared from the milk.
It is not known whether the virus can cause illness if it enters the body
through the mouth and digestive tract, as opposed to entering the
bloodstream through a mosquito bite, transfusion or organ transplant.
Dr. Petersen said that two other viruses in the same family as West Nile
had been transmitted to people from drinking milk from cows or goats.
Neither of those viruses has been found in North America. One is from India
and the other from eastern Europe and parts of Asia [tick-borne
encephalitis is cauased by a flavivirus in this region that can be
transmitted through drinking milk from infected animals. - Mod.MPP]. There
is no information about whether those viruses pass into human breast milk.
Dr. Petersen said there were just two viral infections in which women are
told not to breast-feed, H.I.V. and a very rare illness, human T-cell
leukemia virus type 1. With other viral illnesses like colds and flu, he
said, women are generally told to continue nursing because the illnesses
are not severe enough to justify stopping.
"The benefits of breast-feeding are so great, we wouldn't want women to
stop," he said.
Although mosquitoes are by far the most important source of infection, Dr.
Petersen said, the illness in 2 transfusion recipients was further evidence
that the virus could spread through blood and blood products. Transmission
via blood is thought to have occurred in 3 other transfusion recipients.
Officials theorize that 4 people, including one who died, contracted the
disease from organ transplants.
There is no screening test to detect West Nile in the blood supply. Dr.
Jesse Goodman of the Food and Drug Administration said his agency was
"urgently working with manufacturers and others with potential blood
screening tests to try to facilitate their availability."
The disease centers said that as of Thursday the reported West Nile cases
this year totaled 2,206, with 108 deaths.
The agency also said the epidemic appeared to have peaked in the Southern
states last month and in the last 2 weeks in Northern states. The tropical
storm that struck Louisiana this week may be beneficial, Dr. Petersen said,
because the mosquitoes that carry West Nile multiply better in small
puddles of water than in floods.

[We posted the CDC release 27 Sep 2002 (West Nile virus, transfusion
transmission - USA (03) 20020927.5415) which mentioned the identification
of West Nile virus (WNV) genetic material in breast milk, but did not
comment further on this finding. As the newswires are filled with this,
and the potential to evoke more scare and perhaps premature cessation of
breast feeding secondary to unreasonable fear, we've decided to post this
news article with its additional comments to put this finding into
perspective. At present there are no indications for women to stop breast
feed because of WNV activity in their area and concerns about transmission
to their infant. The benefits of breast feeding far outweigh the current
known risk of transmission of WNV through breast milk. Clearly this is an
area for study as there are some flaviviruses that are transmitted through
ingestion of infected milk products, but to date there hasn't been evidence
of significant transmission.
