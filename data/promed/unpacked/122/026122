Turkey's 1st wide-scale summit on measures to combat avian influenza is to
be held on Friday [20 Jan 2006] in Ankara. Health minister Akdag stressed
that the necessary short term measures were being taken but that the summit
would look at medium and long term plans.
Apart from having the governors of all of Turkey's 81 provinces, the summit
will also be attended by health minister Recep Akdag, the agriculture
minister, the forestry and environment minister, and the interior minister.
The governors from the provinces of Van and Igdir, where most of the human
cases of avian flu have occurred, will give briefings on the latest
measures being conducted and Edmond McLoughney of the United Nations will
also address the meeting.
All aspects of avian influenza, including human cases and bird migration
routes, will be discussed. To date, at least 5 people have died after
contracting the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus, with another 16 people
having been infected. 13 of Turkey's 81 provinces have confirmed outbreaks
of avian flu, with a further 28 reporting suspected outbreaks.

Turkish govt sets out aid for poultry producers
-----------------------------------------------
ANKARA, Jan 20 (Reuters): The Turkish government unveiled a USD 40 million
aid package on Friday for poultry firms hit by bird flu, including
compensation for culled chickens and postponement of tax and debt payments.
The deadly bird flu disease, which has killed 4 people in Turkey so far,
has hit the USD 3 billion sector hard. Sales have fallen dramatically in
the domestic market and a number of countries have imposed import bans on
Turkish poultry products. "Tax and social security obligations for the
poultry sector will be postponed for six months, free from interest
charges," deputy prime minister Abdullatif Sener told a news conference.
The total cost of the aid package was 53.2 million lira (USD 39.8 million),
the minister said. However, industry representatives said the measures did
not go far enough. Turkey has slaughtered more than 1.1 million poultry
since the outbreak emerged 2 weeks ago. Up to a third of the country is
suspected of havingbird flu among poultry and Turks have reported 21 human
cases, including the 4 deaths.
The government is allocating 15.4 million lira from the budget in
compensation for 14 million egg-producing chickens that are going to be
culled, said Sener. Due dates of loans provided by the state bank Ziraat
and agriculture cooperatives to poultry firms will be postponed for one
year, he added. Representatives of the poultry industry were disappointed.
"We cannot see a concrete contribution to the sector ... It is hard to
speak of radical measures," said the head of poultry producers association,
Kemal Akman. Another said that the government had not met half of their
requests, and asked for chickens for consumption as well as egg-producing
chickens to be included in the package.
Bird flu is known to have killed at least 80 people since late 2003.
Victims contract the virus from close contact with infected birds, but
there are fears it could mutate into a form that passes easily from person
to person, sparking a pandemic in which millions could die. Experts say
there is no risk from eating properly cooked poultry or eggs.

Donor countries have pledged 1.9 billion USD to battle and contain the H5N1
bird flu virus -- far surpassing the requests of the World Bank.
The pledge comes from an international meeting in Beijing, China to secure
funds for fighting the spread of avian influenza, which experts fear could
turn into a human pandemic form.
"The success of the Beijing meeting is a great step forward and has shown
that the international community has understood how crucial it is to
control avian influenza at [the] source in birds," says Bernard Vallat,
director general of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in
Paris, France.
The majority of the pledged money -- of which 500 million USD has been
offered by the World Bank and other organisations -- would go toward
measures against avian flu in Asia, which has seen the most human cases of
the disease. The World Bank had estimated that fighting avian flu in
developing countries would cost about 1.4 billion USD and require 700
million to 1 billion USD from nations willing to provide funds towards this
cause.
This financial assistance is vital, Vallat stresses. "One country not able
to carry out early detection and rapid response to animal disease outbreaks
can represent a threat to all the others," he told New Scientist.
Scientists fear that the H5N1, which has claimed the lives of nearly 80
people worldwide, could mutate to a more contagious form. To date, however,
no cases of human-to-human transmission have been confirmed. Most of the
victims of the virus have had close contact with infected birds.
A recent outbreak of avian flu in Turkey has intensified concerned health
officials, who are also waiting to find out if samples from a suspected
human case in northern Iraq test positive for the disease.

[Indeed the decisions and the commitments obtained in this meeting, if
fulfilled and provided the promised financial support becomes available
soon, will enable the relevant international organisations (FAO, OIE, WHO)
to assist and coordinate the essential activities in the affected and
potentially exposed countries. The immediate target is tackling HPAI in
poultry, to reduce the heavy economic losses to and minimise or eliminate
the threat of a pandemic.
Efficient surveillance in avians will prevent a repetition of the
unfortunate recent experience, when -- in several countries -- humans
served as sentinels for animals, instead of the other way round.
Prevention and control -- poultry vaccination included, where appropriate
-- are the other 2 cornerstones of the envisaged global action. - Mod.AS]
