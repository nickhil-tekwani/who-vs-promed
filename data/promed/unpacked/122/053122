Among all toxins able to produce a toxic encephalopthy, mycotoxins appear a distinct possibility for several reasons. I teach vet students about mycotoxins in animal feed, and key points I emphasize in my lectures are:

- The central nervous system is among the key organs often involved in mycotoxicosis.
- The disease symptoms are often novel and unlike known intoxications.
- There are no secondary cases, thus excluding transmissible disease agents.

Disease is usually acquired by consumption of food containing mycotoxins.

The "incubation period" will depend on the type of toxin and can be prolonged. I hypothesized that some food which has been distributed for disaster relief may have spoiled under the adverse conditions in the affected region (or due to poor preparation practices for food items unfamiliar among the affected population). This may explain the limited age range of ill persons, which is a striking feature of the outbreak.

[ProMED thanks Andre Burnens for his comment.

If the outbreak was caused by a mycotoxin, it would fit with the epidemiology of the outbreak as we know it. This could also explain why it has appeared in smaller or larger outbreaks over the years since it was 1st described in 1962. ProMED will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP
