BACTERIA OUTBREAK SICKENS UP TO 165 CALIFORNIANS
23 Sep 1998
The story says that since the first case was reported on 15 Sep 1998,
four people have received hospital treatment for particularly severe
symptoms and a total of close to 165 people have come down with
shigella-like illness.
WILLITS, Calif. -- Carol Mordhorst, California's Mendocino County
public health administrator, was cited as saying that shigella
bacteria were responsible for sickening as many as 165 Californians
in an outbreak linked to restaurant dining, adding, "Someplace along
the line someone that had this bacteria went to the restroom, didn't
use proper handwashing, and in turn contaminated something. It's gone
on from there."
Victims usually recover after a couple of days.
Officials initially traced the infections to five separate
restaurants in Willits, about 125 miles north of San Francisco, but
they now believe it originated at one eatery which they have declined
to identify.
[Which means the damage is spread among all the town's eateries,
which will lose customers until this is cleared up - Mod.JW]
