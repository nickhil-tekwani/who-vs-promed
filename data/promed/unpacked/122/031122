West Indies: West Nile Virus in Trinidad
-----------------------------------------
I wish to draw the attention of ProMED-mail to the following information on
circulation of West Nile virus (WNV) in another Caribbean country, namely
Trinidad, the southernmost of the Caribbean islands. The Caribbean
Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) has reported detection of seropositivity in
horses (2/60, 3 percent) and birds (2/40, 2 percent) of birds.

[This information has been extracted from the web-site of CAREC (the
Caribbean Epidemiology Centre). The introductory paragraph to a CAREC
report entitled "Virus surveillance in the Caribbean - Decmber, 2004" is
reproduced below. The full report can be accessed at:

"In late summer 1999 an outbreak of West Nile (WN) encephalitis was
documented for the 1st time in New York and since then West Nile virus
(WNV) has been spreading in the United States (US), Canada, Central America
and the Caribbean basin. Today WNV infection is recognized as the largest
arboviral meningoencephalitis epidemic ever recorded in the US and Canada.
The 1st human WN encephalitis case in the Caribbean was reported at the end
of 2001 in Cayman Islands. Subsequently, in January 2002, WNV activity was
observed in migratory and resident birds in Jamaica, Dominican Republic and
Puerto Rico. These reports marked the earliest evidence of WNV introduction
into the Caribbean. WNV activity has also been documented from a serosurvey
in which 360 serum samples were collected in healthy horses in Guadeloupe
between June 2002 and January 2003. The overall prevalence of IgG
antibodies to WNV increased from 2.8 percent in June 2002 to 50 percent in
January 2003, which represents a clear seroconversion in horses within a
6-month period.
In October 2003, WNV was identified in horses in Belize. The 2nd human WN
encephalitis case was reported in the Bahamas in July 2003. The most recent
identification of WNV in the Caribbean was in Trinidad, where in a
serosurvey of 60 horses and 40 birds conducted in October, 2004, WNV
antibodies were identified in 2 horses (3 percent) and 2 birds (5 percent).
WNV is a member of the family _Flaviviridae_ (genus _Flavivirus_).
Serologically, it is a member of the Japanese Encephalitis serocomplex,
which also includes St. Louis, Japanese, Kunjin, and Murray Valley
Encephalitis viruses. Human and equine outbreaks of WN have been recorded
in Africa, Southern Europe, Asia and North America and Canada.
WNV is typically transmitted between birds and mosquitoes. Mammals can
become infected if bitten by an infected mosquito, especially the _Culex_
species, but individuals in most species of mammals do not become ill from
the virus infection. Mammals are considered to be "dead-end hosts" because
the virus does not generally multiply in their blood to levels high enough
to be infective. Thus mosquitoes that bite an infected person or horse
cannot pick up the virus from them and spread it further. 4 novel routes of
WNV transmission from humans to humans are well-documented: blood
transfusion, organ transplantation, transplacental and breast-feeding."
The Moderator thanks Dr. Douglas for drawing attention to this information.
