[The current weekly update of the ASF situation in China includes, in addition to the above excerpts, additional ASF-related information from China and FAO's recommendations regarding countries of the region, national considerations, interregional collaboration and solidarity, and a summary of FAO's actions so far. It also includes a table, presenting a list of affected cities in each infected province since 3 Aug 2018, and a map presenting their locations.

During the current week, ending 21 Dec 2018, 6 new outbreaks, in 6 provinces, have been reported, compared with 4 new outbreaks/provinces in the previous week (ending 14 Dec 2018). According to Figure 1, "Number of ASF reported villages by region by onset month" (information source: Veterinary Bureau, MoARA, China), the epidemic peaked in October. This is yet to be verified.

The new ASF outbreak in Guangdong (20181219.6216012), a province hitherto not known to be infected, has been reported to the OIE in http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=29007.

Following the spread of ASF to Zhuhai city in Guangdong, Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety, under the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), decided to step up inspection and quarantine of pigs and pork entering Hong Kong. Customs will also step up prosecution against illegal import of pork products.

So far, 4 of the 154 farms supplying pigs and pork to Hong Kong -- 2 from Hunan province, one from Hubei and another from Jiangxi -- have been affected by ASF and have suspended export of pork products. The FEHD said there are 3 farms in Zhuhai supplying pork to Hong Kong, but they are not in the affected district.

According to HK Pork Traders' General Association of Hong Kong, around 4000 pigs are imported from the mainland every day, which makes up to 90% of all supply to the SAR, among which 80% came from Guangdong. At present, the number of pigs supplied to the city remained normal and the suspension of 4 mainland farms did not much affect the SAR. The information from SAR/HK is sourced from the media website http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=203501; thanks to ProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka for its submission. - Mod.AS
