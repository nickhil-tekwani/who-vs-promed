Officials have found another case of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, BSE) in south-central France, the Agriculture Ministry said
Monday.
The animal, discovered in the Haute-Vienne region, was the 12th afflicted
cow reported in France this year. In 1999, French authorities discovered 31
cases of BSE.
Officials slaughtered the milk cow, born in 1992, and its herd of 112, as a
precaution, the ministry statement said.
New cases of the disease are expected to break out in France until 2002, 5
years after authorities took rigorous measures to prevent more outbreaks.
BSE has an average incubation period of 5 years.
The Agriculture Ministry said earlier this month it will begin tests of
ailing and dead cattle to determine how widespread the disease has become.
The screening is due to start in late April or early May.
France has provoked a spat within the European Union (EU) by keeping in
place its ban on beef from Britain, where the brain-wasting disease first
started an international scare in 1996. The EU declared British beef safe
for import last August.
The German parliament recently lifted a 4-year-old ban on the meat, and
France is now the only European country that continues to defy the EU by
maintaining its ban.
