Outbreak update - Cholera in Somalia, 18 Oct 2018
---------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Somalia has announced 23 new cases of cholera including 1 death for week 40 (w/e 7 Oct 2018) of 2018. Since week 28, there has been a significant downward trend in the number of new cholera cases reported weekly. The cumulative total is 6464 cases and 43 associated deaths (case-fatality rate 0.7%) since the beginning of the current outbreak in December 2017. Of 278 stool samples collected since the beginning of this year [2018] and tested in the National Public Health Laboratory in Mogadishu, 85 tested positive for _Vibrio cholera_, serotype O1 Ogawa.

The cholera outbreak started in December 2017 in Beletweyne along the river Shabelle and has spread to Jowhar, Kismayo, Afgoye Merka and Banadir. For the past 2 weeks, cholera cases have been localized only in Banadir region. In week 40, active transmission of AWD/cholera was reported in 9 districts in Banadir region (Daynile, HamarJabja, Darkenly, Hawlwadag, Hodan, Madina, Waberi, Heliwaa and Wardigley districts). Banadir region has the highest concentration of IDPs who reside in camps or poor living conditions with limited safe water and sanitation. 30% of the reported cases in week 40 are under 5 years of age, and 78% of cases were women.

The oral cholera vaccination campaigns implemented in 11 high risk districts of the central region in 2017 has greatly contributed to the reduction in the number of new AWD/cholera cases compared to the same time in 2017. All cases reported during week 40 had not received a vaccination before.

WHO continues to provide leadership and support for activities with the Ministry of Health (MoH) to respond to this cholera outbreak, including case management, surveillance and laboratory investigations and water sanitation, hygiene (WASH) and risk communication.

This week, on-the-job training for health care workers was conducted in cholera treatment centers in Kismayo, Farjano, Banadir and Marka. WHO supports the disease surveillance system which has collected data from 415 health facilities across the country through the Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN). This surveillance system contributes to early detection of epidemic-prone diseases including cholera and prompt response to outbreaks by using an electronic platform. A total of 1500 hygiene kits have been distributed in villages in Kismayo and hygiene promotion for cholera prevention and community awareness campaigns were conducted in Farjano, Allanley, Gulwade and Shaqalaha in Kismayo district.

[2] Cholera - Niger
Date: Mon 15 Oct 2018

https://reliefweb.int/report/niger/niger-cholera-epidemic-outbreak-emergency-plan-action-epoa-dref-n-mdrne022-operation


Niger: Cholera Epidemic outbreak Emergency Plan of Action
---------------------------------------------------------
Through this Operations Update, a no-cost one month timeframe extension is being sought, with a new end date of 11 Dec 2018. This has been necessitated due to the cholera epidemic rapidly spreading to new geographical areas of the country, beyond the Red Cross intervention area of Maradi region. Newly affected regions include Tahoua, Dosso and Zinder where the case load continues to increase, while the number of cases has dropped in the region of Maradi. The Ministry of Health is consequently requesting the Niger Red Cross Society to deploy more volunteers to the new affected areas, particularly in Madaoua, Galmi, Birni and N'Konni in the Tahoua region and Dan-Issa in the Madarounfa health district. This operation will be able to efficiently cover new areas without budgetary implications due to savings made that will be used to train and deploy volunteers in the newly affected areas.

Description of the disaster
---------------------------
Starting in the night of 4-5 Jul 2018, 3 patients originating from the JIBIYA health Centre in neighboring Nigeria were admitted to N'Yelwa Health Centre in the Madarounfa Health District of Niger with acute watery diarrhea and vomiting. Since then the number of cholera cases in Niger has rapidly increased, with large numbers of new cases, deaths occurring, and new districts being affected. According to the Directorate of Surveillance and Epidemics Response at the Niger Ministry of Health (MoH), as of [1 Oct 2018], the MoH registered 3692 cases with at least 68 deaths, with a lethality rate of 1.8%.

Madarounfa District in Maradi Region remains the most affected with 72% of the cumulative cases reported. 83% of affected people are aged 5 and above and females constitute 56.2% of reported cases (WHO, 1 Oct 2018). The areas of Dan Issa, Gabi, Harounawa, Madeini, Maraka and N'Yelwa are the most affected. There is a high risk for further spreading of the outbreak. The latest WASH assessment carried out by UNICEF and WHO estimates that only 37% of the population in Maradi Region has access to basic sources of potable water, 75% of the population are said to practice open defecation, with only 10% having access to basic sanitation (WHO, 7 Sep 2018). The precarious sanitation conditions in most of the affected health districts and the movement of population across borders with Nigeria, where cholera was reported several months ago, are among the major contributors to the outbreak. The ongoing heavy rainfall and flooding in the area have affected more than 38 000 people and is exacerbating the risk of contamination (ACAPS, 24 Aug 2018). Currently, there is ongoing heavy rainfall, causing occasional floods in several places. The continuing outbreak control measures on the ground have not been able to halt the spread of the disease.

This outbreak was initially contained in Madarounfa department but has now spread to the heavily populated city of Maradi, the capital of Maradi Region. To date, the epidemic has reached 12 Health Districts including Madarounfa, Maradi Commune, Guidan Roumdji, Dakoro, Agui√© (in the region of Maradi), Gaya (in the region of Dosso), Damagaran Takaya and Mirriah (in the region of Zinder), Birni N'Konni, Malbaza, Keita and Madaoua (in the region of Tahoua).

The MoH's report indicated that the cholera outbreak started on [2 Jul 2018] in Makada village situated in the JIBIYA health geographical area, in the neighboring Nigerian state of Katsina. This has led to people crossing the border to Niger in search of better treatment. Most of the Nigerian states bordering Niger including Katsina, Sokoto, Zamfara, Kano, Yobe and Borno have been experiencing a Cholera epidemic for several months. Therefore, the Diffa region of the country which is still free from cholera is at high risk due to its geographical position with the Borno state. According to the MoH report, as of [1 Oct 2018], out of 3692 affected cases, 483 (at least 18.5%) originated from Nigeria.

[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Yobe State)
Date: Thu 4 Oct 2018
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/cholera-dozens-cases-reported-yobe-state-nigeria-24230/


The Yobe State Ministry of Health in Nigeria reported on [Mon 1 Oct 2018] that 36 additional cholera cases have been reported from 4 local government areas (LGAs): Gujba, Gulani, Damaturu, and Fune. No new fatalities were reported. This represents a 10% decrease in the number of cases reported the previous day [Sun 30 Sep 2018].

The total number of suspected cholera cases reported in Yobe state is 1319, with 61 associated deaths (CFR 4.8%). In the state, up to 420 cases have been reported in Gulani LGA, 367 cases in Gujba LGA, and 317 cases in Damaturu LGA.

Cholera is a disease spread by drinking water or eating food contaminated with cholera bacteria. Severe cholera is characterized by large amounts of watery diarrhea, often described as "rice-water stool" because it can have a pale, milky appearance. It can also be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. If untreated, the loss of fluid can be deadly. But simple treatment, including replacing lost body fluids, can lower the risk of death to less than 1%.

[6] Cholera - Zimbabwe
Date: Mon 15 Oct 2018
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/zimbabwe-cholera-outbreak-showing-downward-trend-9000-cases-reported-48006/


The Zimbabwe cholera outbreak that began over a month ago continues to grow with 9116 cases, including 54 deaths as of [Fri 12 Oct 2018]. Fortunately, the weekly case incidence has been on a downward trend in recent weeks.

Of the reported cases, 228 are confirmed by culture. Harare (8824 cases) and Chitungwiza (109 cases) cities in Harare Province have reported the majority of the cases accounting for 98% of the cumulative cases reported across the country.

The 1st phase of a reactive mass oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign targeting 422 722 people in the most affected suburbs of Harare (Glen View, Budiriro, Glen Norah, and Mbare) commenced on [3 Oct 2018]. At the end of phase I on [11 Oct 2018], a total of 403 167 people (administrative coverage: 95.4%) were vaccinated across all 4 suburbs. Administrative coverage according to suburbs are as follow: Mbare (118%), Glen Norah (110%), Glenview (91%), and Budiriro (75%). A 2nd phase of the vaccination campaign is expected to commence on [15 Oct 2018] targeting 170 000 people in Epworth and Seke districts and a 3rd phase on [17 Oct 2018] targeting 200 000 people Chitungwiza district.

With the launch of the mass reactive vaccination campaign, it is anticipated that the outbreak will be brought under control. However, authorities will need to step up efforts to ensure that high vaccination coverage is attained. While the OCV campaign may provide short-term remedy for controlling the outbreak, the risk factors are still present.

[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017, pp 113-136:

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).
