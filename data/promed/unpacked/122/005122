Cats Can Catch and Spread Bird Flu, Study Says
--------------------------------------------------
"That cats could so easily be infected and could transmit the infection to
other cats means that in areas where poultry are infected with H5N1 virus,
cats could act as vectors," said Thijs Kuiken, a veterinary pathologist in
the department of virology at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Holland.
"Cats could transmit the virus from one poultry farm to another, or could
transmit the virus to people," said Kuiken, an author of the study
described in tomorrow's issue of the journal Science.
The avian influenza A virus was responsible for massive poultry slaughters
in 8 Asian countries in 2003 and 2004. 37 cases of direct bird-to-human
transmission, 26 of them fatal, were officially reported. Anecdotal reports
of fatal infections in cats also emerged during the outbreak.
Kuiken and his colleagues investigated whether the virus could make cats
sick when the pathogen was introduced into their airways or when the cats
ate infected chickens.
The researchers introduced the H5N1 virus into the airways of 3 cats. 3
other cats were fed an infected chick. Finally, 2 cats were exposed to the
virus by being placed in the same cage as the 1st 3 cats.
The cats soon showed signs of disease: raised body temperature, decreased
activity, and labored breathing. All developed severe lung disease. One cat
died after 6 days of infection.
"Were we surprised? Yes!" Kuiken said. "Although we had expected to see
some pathologic change in the lungs -- because of the anecdotal reports of
cats dying from H5N1 virus infection in Thailand -- we didn't expect them
to be so severe and present in all animals."
"Often an infectious agent that causes mortality in the field has a much
less severe effect when the infection is performed in the laboratory,"
Kuiken added. "With H5N1 virus, the experimental infection also resulted in
severe lesions."
Previously there were no reports of disease in cats from infection with an
influenza A virus. Kuiken says the evidence of transmission from cat to cat
is a particularly important finding.
"With all of the human cases of H5N1 virus infection, the virus was
transmitted from bird to human (bird to mammal), not from human to human
(mammal to mammal)," Kuiken said. "Our study shows that H5N1 virus
transmission from cat to cat (mammal to mammal) is possible."
The ability of the virus to infect cats suggests that cats could enable the
pathogen to adapt to mammals. If the virus could replicate more easily in
cats, it also might replicate more easily in humans, increasing the risk of
a human influenza pandemic.
"That this H5N1 virus caused pneumonia and death in cats suggests that the
virus has increased its ability to cause disease in this species -- not
that the species is less resistant," Kuiken said.
Some scientists downplay the threat of the new findings.
"To be a significant new threat, the infection would have to keep the cat
well enough to travel and spread and yet sick enough to maintain high doses
of virus so that transmission is achieved," said Ian Jones, a professor at
the School of Animal and Microbial Sciences at the University of Reading in
England.
"This experimental situation shows this can occur. But it is a long way
from the natural situation where a sick animal may hide away or die," he
added. "So the real increase in risk may actually be quite small."
Michael Lai, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the
University of Southern California in Los Angeles, says the report should
not scare people.
"It's true that the more animals the virus can infect, the more likely the
virus can spread to humans," Lai said. "However, the possibilities that a
cat serves as an additional reservoir for avian flu and that it may allow
human and avian flu viruses to recombine are quite remote."
If the transmission occurred easily, Lai said, we should have seen
widespread flu infection in cats in the avian flu epidemic areas in the
past few years. This did not happen.
The study authors also tested the effect of another type of influenza
virus, H3N2, which most commonly causes flu in humans. Cats exposed in the
same way to this virus did not develop disease.

[The text of the paper "Avian H5N1 Influenza in Cats" by Thijs Kuiken, Guus
Rimmelzwaan, Debby van Riel, Geert van Amerongen, Marianne Baars, Ron
Fouchier and Albert Osterhaus, is available at
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/rapidpdf/1102287v1.pdf>.
They conclude: "The implications of the findings are first that, during
H5N1 virus outbreaks, domestic cats are at risk of disease or death from
H5N1 virus infection, either due to feeding on infected poultry or wild
birds, or due to contact with infected cats. Second, the role of cats in
the spread of H5N1 virus between poultry farms, and from poultry to humans,
needs to be re-assessed. Third, cats may form an opportunity for this avian
virus to adapt to mammals, thereby increasing the risk of a human influenza
pandemic".
The paper provides convincing experimental confirmation for the Thai
observations in Felidae and the findings of the Faculty of Veterinary
Sciences at Thailand's Kasetsart University, reported in the postings
