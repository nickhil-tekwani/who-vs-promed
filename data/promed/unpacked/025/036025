2003/087 Results of the 2002/2003 survey on potato spindle tuber
pospiviroid in France: eradication has been achieved
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO of France recently informed the EPPO Secretariat of the results of
the 2002/2003 survey on potato spindle tuber pospiviroid (EPPO A2
quarantine pest). A few findings were made in 2001 (see EPPO RS 2002/145).
Surveys were done in the areas where PSTVd had previously been found. All
potato material from these areas, either grown under glasshouse or in the
field, was tested. All potato lots (387 potato lots corresponding to more
than 8000 tests) gave negative results. In addition, surveys were done to
verify the absence of PSTVd from the French seed production system.
Therefore tests were also done on potato material from the national
collection (located at Hanvec, Bretagne), from collections of 3 regional
seed production centres, and also on 10 per cent of seed potato lots (B1 to
B4 seed potato lots produced in 2002). In total, more than 4500 tests were
performed and all results were negative.
The declared status of potato spindle tuber pospiviroid in France is:
absent, eradicated.

[Eradication of PSTVd is good news. However, I would have appreciated
details on the method(s) used to detect PSTVd. Perhaps our French
colleagues can provide that information. - Mod.DH]
