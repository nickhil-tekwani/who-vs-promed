Statement from Hilary Benn in response to HSE (Health and Safety Executive)
initial report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the start of this outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD], the
Government's 2 priorities have been to contain its spread and to discover
how it may have started.
Having quickly put restrictions in place last Friday [3 Aug 2007], the
chief veterinary officer (CVO) and her team have been working to identify
any further cases and to adjust restrictions in response to the facts. In
addition, epidemiological investigations continue. There are now 2
confirmed cases, and the process of inspecting and testing animals within
the Protection Zones is continuing.
With the exception of the 2nd case, confirmed this morning [7 Aug 2007], no
other cases have so far been identified. We are determined to control and
eradicate this disease as soon as possible. I would ask the farming
community, as it has done throughout, to maintain vigilance, and report any
concerns whatsoever to Animal Health.
Following the confirmation on 4 Aug 2007 that the strain of virus found in
the 1st case was not recently circulating in animals, but was held at both
the Institute for Animal Health [IAH] and Merial Animal Health Ltd -- both
on the Pirbright site -- I asked the HSE to investigate. I have now
received their 'Initial report of potential breaches to bio-security at the
Pirbright site 2007'.
The report indicates that there was a negligible combined likelihood of an
airborne release of virus from either site. The likelihood of a direct
waterborne link between the infected farm and the shared site is also
negligible. But further investigation is being carried out into the
drainage on the Pirbright site. Release by human movement -- which the
report describes as a real possibility -- will now be investigated further
as a matter of urgency. This will involve further interviews with personnel
at the site. I have asked for a further report on these investigations as
soon as possible.
I note that there is no reason to prevent IAH from operating and I await
the results of the further investigations at Merial.
Following the confirmation of the 2nd case within the larger main
Protection Zone, and the ongoing investigations, the CVO, Debby Reynolds,
has recommended to me that footpaths be now closed in this zone. I have
agreed that this should happen with immediate effect.
Finally, I would like to thank the HSE team and others for their work, the
staff of Animal Health, DEFRA, and others for their swift and sterling
efforts to control this outbreak, and
the farming community for their continued support and forbearance at this
difficult time.

Obviously, the essential diagnostic activities in the Institute for Animal
Health (IAH) facility have not been discontinued throughout the
investigation, enabling immediate handling and testing of suspected
samples. It may be deduced from the statement of Hilary Benn, the
Environment secretary, that as from now, other activities (such as
research) at the IAH are resumed, while the Merial activities are still on
hold.

Humans are to blame for carrying the FMD virus from laboratories in
Pirbright, investigators into the outbreak in Surrey believe.
The initial, inconclusive report from the Health and Safety Executive [HSE]
says there is a "strong probability" that the origin was either the
government-funded Institute of Animal Health [IAH] laboratory or the
commercial Merial facility, which share the same site. Both were working on
the strain involved in the farm outbreak, although Merial was producing it
in large quantities while the IAH was using tiny amounts for research.
"There are various routes for accidental or deliberate transfer of material
from the site," the report says. "We have investigated site management
systems and records and spoken to a number of employees. As a result we are
pursuing lines of inquiry." It adds: "Release by human movement must ... be
considered a real possibility."
HSE investigators need another week's work to analyse the exact virus types
used by each organisation. Both organisations insisted they had found no
evidence of a breach in biosecurity. Researchers said there was no evidence
of working practices or incidents such as lab spillages, which could have
caused a release of the strain.
Environment secretary, Hilary Benn, admitted the government had to look at
the possibility the outbreak was the result of sabotage. Asked if
deliberate human contamination was the cause, he said after the publication
of the report: "The truth is, we don't know. We're very anxious."
The report came amid continuing concern about the potential spread of the
virus, after a 2nd outbreak was confirmed within the protection zone --
prompting Gordon Brown to return to Downing Street from Chequers to chair
meetings of the Cobra [Cabinet Office] emergency committee. After the
publication of the report, Mr Brown said: "The work goes on to isolate, to
contain, control, and eradicate the disease."
Last night's [7 Aug 2007] report rules out airborne transmission of the
virus and suggests that the risk of waterborne transmission alone is
negligible. But it does not rule out the possibility that flooding may have
played a role. If surface water on the Pirbright site became contaminated,
someone moving from there to surrounding land could have carried the virus
on their footwear.
DEFRA said last night [7 Aug 2007] it would investigate unconfirmed reports
that a worker at one of the Pirbright labs has an allotment near the farm
where the outbreak was 1st detected on Friday [3 Aug 2007].
Merial has halted production at the site voluntarily, but is producing 300
000 doses of FMD vaccine for the government. Experts say this poses no risk
because the vaccine does not involve the use of a live virus [see commentary].
Martin Shirley, director of the Institute for Animal Health, said: "The
institute is obviously concerned about the lack of unambiguous evidence at
this stage of what has happened and will continue to review our own
biosecurity systems as new data becomes available ... We continue to be
concerned about the effect on the farming community in the UK and you can
be assured our staff are working hard to provide evidence for these inquiries."
Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, said it was
considering legal action for compensation if a commercial company is found
to be responsible. "It is important to understand that farmers who have
lost livestock at the moment are only being compensated for the value of
that stock, there's no [compensation for] consequential loss," he said. "If
this turns out to be a commercial company, that has been and can be shown
to have been careless in any way, my members are already very loudly
saying, 'We've lost money, our businesses are no longer able to function,
we've got animals, extra feed costs, problems with capacity being squeezed
on farms'. There are many, many costs that have been incurred by farmers
through no fault of their own."
Peter Ainsworth, shadow environment secretary, said the HSE's report was
"bland and inconclusive." He added: "It is no surprise but nonetheless
shocking that the report identifies a major biosecurity failure at a
government laboratory and a laboratory licensed by Defra as the 2 most
likely sources of the outbreak."
Microbiology expert Hugh Pennington said: "My impression is that they
haven't found any technical fault and flooding is a potential, but only
negligible. What you are left with is human movement."

[However, the Merial plant is allowed to carry on the production of the 300
000 doses of FMD vaccine, ordered by the UK government. From the published
information, it is clear that no live virus is to be involved in the
manufacture process of this vaccine; it will be formulated from the
concentrated inactivated antigen (CIA) of the virus strain O1 BFS, which is
one of the antigens selected to be held in the European antigen bank
according to Commission Decision 2001/181/EC of 22 Feb 2001. Such antigens
have to pass the required quality tests (which include safety tests to
demonstrate the absence of live virus particles), and are kept -- in a
strategic reserve -- at ultra-low temperature. According to the EC Decision
mentioned above, "the strains shall be kept in quantities sufficient to
carry out an emergency vaccination taking into account the estimated risks
the different subtypes present to the Community livestock and in any case
not less than 2 million doses of each subtype. Each dose of vaccine
reconstituted from the above antigen should have an observed potency of 6
PD50 in cattle, when tested according to the European Pharmacopoeia.
According to Dutch press, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture has ordered a
batch of 260 000 doses of the same vaccine to be formulated and become
readily available for emergency vaccination, if necessary. - Mod.AS]
