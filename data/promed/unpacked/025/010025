[Re: >Cases of a rare disease spread by rat urine and which has caused four
deaths [in Singapore in the five years up to 1997, are on the rise.
It is called Leptospirosis and preliminary Health Ministry figures show
that for the first eight months of this year, there were 14 cases.
There was an average of about nine cases a year between 1993 and 1997,
which had a total of 44 cases. >
This news item sourced from The Straits Times Interactive on 7 Dec
1998 is essentially accurate. That is, laboratory-confirmed human
cases are uncommon (the government hospital lab here uses the
serological test Sensitized Erythrocyte Lysis Test). Not more than 10
cases were diagnosed each year, and 30-40% of them were in
construction workers.
There is little epidemiological information available at present as
the disease is not reportable. (I am sure recent enquiries on the
disease will produce more information in the coming months.)
Leptospirosis usually presents as a clinically mild disease -- a PUO
(or FUO) [pyrexia of unknown origin/fever of unknown origin -
Mod.JW We have screened some of the clinically diagnosed (but not
laboratory confirmed) cases in the past for Hantaan and Seoul
viruses, [the causative agents of haemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS), but results were negative. (Seoul virus occurs in
Singapore rodents -- by virus isolation).
