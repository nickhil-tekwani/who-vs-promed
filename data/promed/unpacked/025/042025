Violence in al-Mayadin district, Deir ez-Zor, reportedly destroys cold room and vaccines
Statement by Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa
--------------------------------------
"UNICEF has received reports that ongoing violence in Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria has destroyed a UNICEF-supported vaccine cold room in al-Mayadin district, with at least 140 000 doses of vaccines lost, including some planned for use in tackling vaccine-preventable childhood diseases in the area. UNICEF is currently verifying this alarming report.

"The reported attack is likely to hamper efforts to protect children from a range of life-threatening diseases including measles and polio. Al-Mayadin is the centre of an outbreak of vaccine-derived polio which has so far paralyzed 48 children since March 2017.

"Children living in the Governorate of Deir ez-Zor are extremely vulnerable to the spread of disease and illness.

"Attacks on health facilities are a grave violation of international humanitarian law. Children continue to be the 1st victims of attacks on civilian infrastructure, which have become shockingly commonplace in Syria.

"The continued violence has devastated health infrastructure and severely disrupted routine immunization services and vaccination campaigns, particularly in Deir ez-Zor and Ar-Raqqa. Prior to the crisis, Syria was polio-free, with an immunization rate over 80 per cent. National vaccination coverage is now just over 40 per cent [1].

"Violence continues to be a daily reality for children in several locations around Syria. September [2017] was reportedly the deadliest month for civilians this year, with attacks on residential areas every day, causing hundreds of conflict-related deaths and injuries.

"UNICEF calls once again on all parties to the conflict to comply fully with international humanitarian law and respect the protection and welfare of children. Boys and girls throughout Syria have suffered beyond belief and for too long already."

...More than 100 000 doses of measles vaccines and 35 000 doses of polio vaccines were stored in these facilities, alongside equipment, syringes, and stocks for all vaccine-preventable childhood diseases.

"WHO has made strenuous efforts in cooperation with health authorities to deliver vaccines to protect the children living in these areas from disease," said Elizabeth Hoff, WHO Representative in the Syrian Arab Republic. "We unequivocally condemn these actions. Vaccines are not a legitimate target of war."

"Until a new cold room is built and the required cold chain equipment -- including solar fridges, cold boxes and vaccine carriers -- are delivered, this will delay the implementation of routine immunization for vulnerable children in the area," Hoff added.

[The total number of confirmed cases of cVDPV2 in Syria has reached 48 so far. Of these 48 cases, 40 cases were recorded in Mayadeen district only.

The national response plan to the cVDPV2 outbreak includes 2 immunization rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqah governorates. The 1st and 2nd rounds in Deir ez-Zor have been completed. Children missed in the 2nd Deir ez-Zor round will receive vaccination in the local health centers. - Mod.NS]

[The attacks involving the public health infrastructure resulting in destruction of vaccines is a sorry statement on what is going on in Syria and, unfortunately, in a number of other countries, targeting programs that improve the health of the population. As the last sentence in the report in part [2] points out, this will definitely delay implementation of vaccination efforts in the district, as storage of the vaccines has been compromised. As a reminder, vaccine potency is very much dependent upon maintenance of temperatures that will not destroy the antigens in the vaccines. Cold rooms have been built to permit storage of supplies of vaccines to be used in vaccination activities. Destruction of these cold rooms leads to inability for long or medium term storage of these vaccines.
