A yellow fever outbreak that was reported early last month [March 2020] in Gurage Zone of Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region [SNNPR] has been contained since 29 Mar 2020, according to Ministry of Health.

According to the ministry, 4 deaths have been reported.

In its notification today [Tue 28 Apr 2020], the ministry stated that some 86 yellow fever cases were reported at Enemoreena Enor District, Gurage Zone, at the beginning of March [2020].

"The outbreak started with an index case on 3 Mar 2020, and the last case was reported on 29 Mar [2020] in the same year," it said.

Thus, active case search was conducted in kebeles [the smallest administrative units of Ethiopia] of the district, and 1275 households and 2 schools were visited as part of the response effort.

Subsequently, 27 178 individuals received yellow fever vaccine, and the outbreak was contained as of 29 Mar 2020; zero cases had been reported until now, it pointed out.

Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted mainly by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.

[The number of confirmed yellow fever (YF) cases has increased from 3 to 4 since the last report. Yellow fever (YF) cases have occurred in several localities. The rainy season is just beginning, so occurrence of additional cases can be expected given the low proportion of the population that has been vaccinated.

This situation illustrates the need to maintain yellow fever routine vaccination coverage at 80% or above to prevent outbreaks as happened in Angola. This is not easy to do since YF cases are sporadic, and cases are often separated after a lapse of several years. The cost of maintaining ample coverage is less than the emergency expenses of dealing with an outbreak. The planned vaccination campaign has been implemented promptly with 27 178 individuals vaccinated. Fortunately, surveillance has been effective and no new cases have been reported since 29 Mar 2020. - Mod.TY
