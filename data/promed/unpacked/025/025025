The mystery fever raging in Sanguem has been confirmed as chikungunya
[virus infection], signalling an outbreak of the disease. Blood
samples of afflicted patients examined by the microbiology department
of the Goa Medical College (GMC) returned positive for chikungunya
[virus infection]. However, no satisfactory explanation was
forthcoming from the directorate of health services (DHS) about the
samples which were negative.

"The laboratory tests have confirmed an outbreak of chikungunya
[virus] as 15 of 30 blood samples tested positive for the disease,"
Dr Dipak Kabadi, deputy director, national vector-borne diseases
control program, told The Times of India on Friday [24 Jul 2009].
The outbreak of a "mystery fever" in parts of Sanguem had been 1st
reported by The Times of India on Tuesday [21 Jul 2009].

Asked about the samples which tested negative, Dr Kabadi failed to
give a convincing reply. "Some samples may have not tested positive
owing to the varying degrees of the presence of antibodies in the
patients, while others may have been suffering from ordinary viral
flu. Nevertheless, the fact that as many as 15 out of 30 samples
tested positive is enough to indicate a chikungunya [virus]
outbreak," Dr Kabadi said.

Explaining further Dr Kabadi said, "It's a self-limiting type of
illness. The symptoms (high fever, swelling of and pain in joints and
body rash) subside after patients are put on paracetamol
[acetaminophen] coupled with hot water fomentation on affected body
parts. People should take care to get rid of mosquito breeding sites
in the area."

Interestingly, the blood sample of private medical practitioner Dr
Avdhut Prabhudesai, showing symptoms of flu, has turned negative for
chikungunya [virus infection].

Meanwhile, 3 more patients suspected to be suffering from chikungunya
[virus infection] were admitted at the Cacora primary health centre
on Friday [24 Jul 2009], taking the total number of patients being
treated at the Cacora PHC to 6.

The serological survey and the cleanliness drive undertaken by the
directorate of health services (DHS) continued on Friday [24 Jul
2009], sources informed.

[It is good to see that the previously reported outbreak of an
undiagnosed febrile disease in Goa (see ProMED archive no.
20090722.2594) has now been identified as chikungunya virus
infections. The outbreak is spreading in the area, and one hopes that
the mosquito vector control measures mentioned above and in archive
no. 20090722.2594 are effective in slowing its spread.
