The outbreak of bluetongue continued to spread, and is now extending to 78 departments, including 4 in Yonne, 15 in Nièvre and 6 in Saône-et-Loire with 237 outbreaks reported in total since September 2016, said the Ministry of Agriculture, on Friday (8 Apr 2016).

To date, this is a total of 237 outbreaks of bluetongue that have been detected in the center of France, including 85 in the Puy-de-Dôme, 45 in the Allier, 15 in the Nièvre, 13 in the Loire, 12 in the Creuse, 7 in the Cher and Cantal, 6 in Saône-et-Loire, Indre 5, Aveyron and Haute-Loire, 4 in Burgundy and the Rhone, 3 in Dordogne and Haute-Vienne, 2 in Lozere in Charente-Maritime in Corrèze, and 1 case in Loiret, in Isère, in the Lot, in Gironde, in Ariege and Haute-Savoie, in Doubs, in Haute-Saone and Haute-Marne, reported in an updated statement on the Ministry website.

The virus affects 78 departments and a large area covering much of France, whose epicenter is located in the Puy-de-Dôme and Allier. The so-called regulated area, where livestock movements are limited, has also been expanded and now includes all departments south of a line from the Loire-Atlantique in the southern half of the Ardennes, encompassing the island of France.

The restricted area is made up of a protection zone of 100 km [about 62 mile] radius around the affected farm, it is surrounded by a 50 km [about 31 mile]-wide surveillance zone. Within the restricted area, infected flocks are surrounded by a perimeter of prohibition 20 km [about 12 mile] radius.

In the Nièvre, the 1st case of bluetongue was detected in cattle in Anthien in October 2015.

[A French follow-up report No. 30 on BTV-8 [bluetongue virus serotype 8] has been submitted on Fri 8 Apr 2016, and is available -- with an interactive map -- at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=20024.

The above media report from a provincial source deserves to be conceived with measured reservation in relation to the application of the term "spread" in relation to added "outbreaks" during the winter ("non-vector") months. As indicated in an assessment included in ProMED-mail's previous posting (20160312.4088596), when positive RT-PCR tests are related to animals showing no clinical signs, they may reflect viral circulation which had occurred within the last 6 months. Such results may, in most cases which have been reported during the non-vector season in France, not reflect recent virus or vector activity but rather a recording of spread which had taken place during 2015.

In fact, out of the 237 BTV-8 "outbreaks" reported since September 2015 in France, only 13 "outbreaks" related to clinical cases, 12 of which were during 2015, with a single mortality (in a sheep) reported. One cow died (in January 2016). The details of the said clinical cases, derived from WAHID's archive, are as follows (in parentheses, cases/susceptible):

Sheep 23 Sep 2015 (1/9)
Cattle 24 Sep 2015 (1/183)
Cattle 24 Sep 2015 (1/157)
Cattle 24 Sep 2015 (1/51)
Cattle 28 Sep 2015 (2/193)
Cattle 28 Sep 2015 (1/87)
Cattle 28 Sep 2015 (1/234)
Sheep 1 Oct 2015 (1; no susceptible, destroyed, slaughtered -- not available)
Cattle 1 Oct 2015 (1/119)
Cattle 1 Oct 2015 (1/191)
Cattle 28 Oct 2015 (1/70)
Cattle 14 Dec 2015 (1/40)
Cattle 19 Jan 2016 (1/583; died). Location: Nièvre

Thanks to Sabine Zentis for bringing this document to our attention.

"The French Authorities are carrying out a level of surveillance over the winter months to inform 3 objectives: to determine the geographic distribution of BTV-8 and hence the size of the restriction zones; to demonstrate seasonally free zones whereby trade can continue for unvaccinated animals under bilateral agreements with accepting Member States; to estimate the prevalence in cattle according to their immune status and age. As a result, several affected holdings have been identified in new regions where cattle have tested positive by PCR. The test used may detect historical infection, and is not necessarily indicative of current virus circulation, but may be indicative of animal movement in recent weeks. Generally, it is still early in the year for vector activity and hence virus circulation for bluetongue in Northern Europe and we consider this year to be no different. Nevertheless, restriction zones have been increased accordingly to ensure safe trade.

The French risk assessment agency, ANSES, has conducted a thorough risk assessment into the origin of disease and likely virus circulation, which suggested that the likely source was a continual low level of circulation since the previous epizootic in 2007-2008, where lack of clinical signs meant passive surveillance alone would not have detected disease. In 2015 this low level of virus circulation was present in a relatively localised area with an epicentre located between Allier and Puy de Dome regions and decreasing with distance. Culicoides midges were active until mid-December across this region and the winter surveillance will be analysed over the coming weeks to inform further opinions (https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/SANT2015SA0226.pdf).

Vaccination continues, concentrating on animals in pedigree breeding programmes and animals destined for export or moving out of the restricted zone, and this limited level of vaccination, compared to the total livestock population in these areas, means the wind-borne spread of infected vectors when the new season occurs is inevitable, with the most likely countries at risk being those near the borders with the restriction zones, such as Spain, Italy and Switzerland."

And the DEFRA team concluded:

"The UK has no bilateral agreement with France to accept unvaccinated animals from a BTV-seasonally free area. The winter surveillance in France has shown there is a wider area than originally thought, where a low level of infection may be present. Whilst this presents as a low impact disease in affected cattle, but this may not be the case next year when higher infection pressure (more vectors, higher biting rates and higher virus loads) leads to more cases. It is still difficult to predict when virus will start to circulate again, but previous data from the 2007/2008 epizootic suggests July was when disease re-emerged and started to spread, as the average daily temperature will be high enough for significant numbers of midge vectors to transmit disease in Northern Europe. We will continue to report monitor the current situation in France and report any further updates from their Authorities."

The following OIE summary (updated 8 Apr 2016) from WAHID's archive covers the French data since the start of the event in September 2015:
