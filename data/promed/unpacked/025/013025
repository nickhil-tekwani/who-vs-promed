Deadly delicacy: turning to poison
----------------------------------
A wild mushroom, savored each autumn in Tokohu and in northern
regions, is suspected of causing the deaths of at least 17 people
this year [2004] from a rare brain disorder, authorities say. The
government is warning everyone not to consume the delicacy.
On 2 Nov 2004, a man in his 80s, living in Yamagata Prefecture,
became the 14th person to die of the mysterious brain disorder, after
similar cases began being reported in September 2004. As of Friday
[19 Nov 2004], 59 cases of the illness had been reported across 9
prefectures, especially in Akita and Niigata. 3 more people have
died, bringing the total to 17. The cause remains a mystery. But,
victims had one thing in common: most had fallen ill after eating
wild sugihiratake mushrooms.
The sugihiratake grows in early autumn on old tree stumps or on
fallen cedar trees. It is white and reaches 2 to 6 cm in diameter.
While it grows in mountainous regions, the fungi is especially
popular in the north's Tohoku region.
On 17 Sep 2004, a 66-year-old Akita Prefecture man went to his doctor
complaining that his legs had started to feel numb. The man was
hospitalized, and his condition soon worsened. A day later, he began
to have severe cramps, and, eventually, he became unconscious. He
died 20 Sep 2004. The man's family said he had eaten sugihiratake
about a week or 2 earlier. "He always ate those mushrooms, so we
can't believe they were the cause," a family member said.
The link with the mushroom was 1st suspected in Niigata Prefecture.
Cases of the acute brain disorder are rarely, if ever, reported in
the prefecture. Symptoms include losing consciousness and
convulsions, and the condition was 1st blamed on a virus or bacteria.
This autumn, there have already been 21 reports of the illness in the
prefecture. Doctors 1st thought it was caused by an infectious
disease, but none of the patients reported coming into contact with
anyone with similar illnesses. However, most had eaten the wild
mushroom recently. The health ministry has never received any reports
of sugihiratake poisonings before this year [2004].
Earlier this month [November 2004], a team of researchers from
Niigata University reported that at least 2 similar cases have
occurred: one 7 years ago and one last year [2003]. In 1997, a
62-year-old woman died in the Tohoku region 14 days after eating
sugihiratake. She was hospitalized 8 days after eating it, having
fallen ill with cramps and losing consciousness. The woman had been
undergoing dialysis treatments for 5 years. The 2nd case was a
66-year-old woman who fell ill last year [2003], but recovered. She
began to feel sick again this year. She, too, had undergone dialysis,
for 10 years.
Niigata University researchers believe that, in the case 7 years ago,
the victim's symptoms were almost identical to those reported this
year [2004]. "We think her illness was caused by eating
sugihiratake," said Fumitake Gejo, a professor at Niigata University.
Some blame this year's [2004] abnormal weather: a long, hot summer
and an unusually high number of typhoons. "It's possible that
microbes in the soil mutated with the change in the weather and
caused the mushroom to produce toxic substances," said Eiji
Nagasawa, a senior researcher at the Japan Kinoko Research Center
Foundation in Tottori Prefecture. "Some toxic substances in the
mushrooms may have suddenly increased," says Kohei Furuya, director
of the Mushroom Research Institute in Gunma Prefecture.
Since the mushroom is not easily cultivated, people gather them in
the wild. The white sugihiratake is easily spotted.
Authorities report that about 1200 kilograms of the wild mushroom
were consumed in Niigata and Akita prefectures last year [2003]. Most
of the 59 cases of illness reported this year were also from the 2
prefectures: 24 from Akita Prefecture and 21 from Niigata Prefecture.
Among the 17 who died, 6 each were reported from Akita and Niigata
prefectures.
Researchers say people with kidney problems are more at risk. Of the
59 cases, 51 people had kidney trouble, according to the health
ministry. Weakened kidneys cannot expel the mushroom's toxic
substances, causing an accumulation of toxins that could reach the
brain, researchers say. But, no one knows for sure, and the evidence
is contradictory. One doctor in Akita Prefecture asked 54 kidney
patients on dialysis whether they had eaten sugihiratake. 36 said
yes, but only 3 developed the brain disorder.
The health ministry is trying to quickly determine whether the
mystery illness is caused by a virus, a bacterium, a toxic substance,
or something else entirely. The ministry and prefectural governments
are taking detailed surveys to determine where the mushrooms were
found, who gathered them, how they were prepared, and in what
combinations with other foods. They are also tracking everything else
the patients ate for the 2 weeks before the onset of the disorder,
and they are checking whether well water was used, and, what
medications the patients may have been taking.
The National Institute of Infectious Diseases says no suspicious
viruses or bacteria have been reported so far. Since family members
of victims have not fallen ill, the health ministry doubts it is
contagious.
Meanwhile, the National Institute of Health Sciences is looking into
the possibility of poisoning.
