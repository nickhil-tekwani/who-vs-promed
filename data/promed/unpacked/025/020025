[The following is a report by the animal health surveillance network
(RAIZO) of the Ministere de l'Agriculture, des Pecheries et de
l'Alimentation du Quebec].

Only 2 cases of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) had been reported in
Quebec in the past 35 years until the fall of 2008, when the province
experienced an outbreak of the disease. The 1st case was reported by
Sonia Chenier, doctor of veterinary medicine and animal pathologist
with the Laboratoire d'epidemiologie animale du Quebec (the state
animal epidemiology laboratory), which is associated with the
Ministere de l'Agriculture, des Pecheries et de l'Alimentation (MAPAQ).

As of 31 Dec 2008, the annual count of equine cases of EEE in Quebec
was 16 confirmed cases and 3 presumed cases. Cases were reported in
the 4 Quebec regions of Estrie, Centre-du-Quebec, Lanaudiere, and
Monteregie. All but one of the horses died or had to be euthanized as
a result of the infection.

It has been mandatory in Quebec since 2003 to report cases of human
EEE. None were reported.

The situation was analyzed by MAPAQ's animal health surveillance
network (RAIZO), which rapidly relayed the information to veterinary
practitioners, Quebec horse industry stakeholders, and public health
authorities. The 2008 report that is currently being drafted will
provide a clearer idea of the threat posed by EEE for equine and human
health in North America.

RAIZO, whose activities are overseen by MAPAQ, is mandated to protect
Quebec's herds and public health. It consists of a number of sentinel
networks that correspond to the various animal industry sectors. The
equine network works mainly on collecting, analyzing, and distributing
the information required in order to protect equine and public health.
Thanks to the veterinary practitioners who make up this equine
network, it was possible to quickly detect the EEE outbreak in Quebec
last fall [autumn 2008].

In early September 2008, Dr. Chenier issued an advisory about
suspected EEE in 2 horses from the same stable presenting with
neurological and pathological lesions compatible with the disease. On
25 Sep 2008, laboratory tests confirmed the diagnosis. The information
was immediately transmitted by RAIZO.

Emus
----
In the weeks that followed, other horses were diagnosed and found to
be EEE positive along with a flock of severely affected emus. None of
the EEE-positive horses had been vaccinated in the previous 12 months.

Birds are the reservoir for the EEE virus, and their movement may have
contributed to extending the range of the infection to include Quebec.
Note that cases were recorded in the northeastern United States,
notably in New York, Maine, and New Hampshire (see map). Another
possible explanation for this unusual outbreak of EEE is the presence
of infected mosquitoes borne by hurricane-induced air currents on the
East Coast and mosquito reproduction due to the damp 2008 summer in
Quebec.

In Canada, EEE is a disease that must be reported immediately by the
diagnostic laboratories to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Until
now, in Canada and the northeastern United States, the incidence of
the disease has been sporadic at most. It is hard to predict what
eastern equine encephalitis has in store for us in the future.
However, given that the disease has mosquito vectors and that the
birds that are reservoirs are found in Quebec, precautions are called
for. The most important recommended courses of action in preventing a
fresh outbreak in 2009 are the vaccination of horses and measures to
protect horses and humans from mosquito bites.

[Although there are not usually many cases of EEE in either humans or
horses, the disease is severe in both species, and it is well worth
noting its occurrence. This surveillance report from Quebec provides a
useful perspective on last year's (2008) 16 confirmed and 3 suspect
cases in Quebec. Other reports from Ontario illustrate the great
yearly variation in incidence, which shows 21 cases being reported
from 1992 to 2004, with 11 of these cases occurring in 2003. Although
there may be many explanations, including "don't seek, don't find,"
there were no cases reported from 1938-1992 in Ontario. See
<http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_equv.htm>.

In the United States, ProMED-mail's various reports indicate that
approximately 30 cases have occurred so far this year [2009], 23 of
these being in Florida, which tends to have the earliest cases of the
season and often total 200 before the end of the seasonal cycle in the
fall. It is unfortunate because, as Mod.TG has pointed out many times,
this is a preventable disease. It would be very interesting to know
(and probably a bit difficult to find out) whether vaccination rates
have fallen off with the current economic conditions, whether
governments have been hampered in the mosquito control programs, and
just simply whether more favorable climatic conditions conducive to
disease occurrence are present this year (2009), or whether we are
actually at an expected level but have gotten a flurry of media
reports from the southeast at this time. - Mod.PC]
