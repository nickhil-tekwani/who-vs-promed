The Secretariat of Health (SESA) of the State of Parana confiscated all lots of a manufactured sausage distributed in the Alto Piquiri area, in the north west of the state, due to the suspicion of the presence of the bacterium that causes botulism. In total, 2 people have died, 2 are symptomatic, and 10 others are suspected cases of the disease.

According to Health Region XII, which covers the region of Umuarama, about 400 kg [about 900 lb] of [the sausages] have been withdrawn from the trade in Alto Piquiri and nearby areas. "We are visiting house to house to talk to people and get the product to be destroyed," said the director of regional health, Arecidio Cassiano.

In one of the confirmed cases of the disease, a man remained 20 days in the hospital, 19 of them in the intensive care unit (ICU). "Another victim ate the uncooked sausage and died, while his wife and son fried it and didn't become ill," said Cassiano, "which reinforces the suspicion that the food was contaminated." Many people, without knowing, cooked or fried sausage, thereby killing the bacteria [actually, inactivating the toxin - Mod.LL] before eating the food."

The company which manufactures the sausage has already halted the production of the product. "We are prepared to compensate any individual who suffered any prejudice, until the analysis of the product are complete", confirmed the lawyer in a television interview.

The recommendation of Health Region XII is that those who still have in their homes Piquiri Salami in nylon wrapping, manufactured by the meat and cold cut industry and commerce Richter Ltda, do not consume and return the sausages to the place where they were purchased.

On the morning of 23 Feb 2012, the Regional Health Bureau had confirmed the contamination of sausages by the bacteria, but later the SESA denied it by saying that the contaminations is suspected and that the investigation is ongoing.

[Although the neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure can be mimicked by other diseases, a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. While the botulinum spores can survive in boiling water, the botulinum toxin is heat-labile. Heating food to a typical cooking temperature of 80 deg C (176 deg F) for 10 minutes before consumption can greatly reduce the risk of illness.

Botulism (http://www.epi.hss.state.ak.us/pubs/botulism/bot_03.htm), or sausage poisoning as it was originally termed, was first seriously studied following an outbreak in Wildbad, Germany in 1793. The outbreak involved 13 people, 6 of whom died, and was associated with consumption of a locally produced blood sausage. Following this outbreak, the number of reported cases of sausage poisoning rapidly increased, prompting a study of the disease by local health officer Justinius Kerner (1829). He described 230 cases, most of which were attributed to the consumption of sausage. The illness became known as "botulism" after "botulus", the Latin word for sausage. - Mod.LL
