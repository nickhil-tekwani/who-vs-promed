A 7-year-old boy and his 3-year-old sister died from bird flu [avian H5N1 influenza virus infection] at Kampong Cham Provincial Referral Hospital on Friday [7 Feb 2014], Hong Palla, team leader of the rapid response unit at Kratie Provincial Health Department, said Tuesday [11 Feb 2014]. The 2 young siblings from Snuol district's Sre Cha commune contracted the H5N1 virus on Sat 1 Feb 2014 and were taken by their parents for treatment at Kampong Cham provincial hospital 5 days later.

"Before the children were sick they had touched and eaten poultry," Mr Palla said, explaining that the siblings' parents had found a dead bird in the village and cooked it for dinner. [The 3-year-old girl] died at about 1 a.m. on [7 Feb 2014] and her older brother died at 6 p.m. on the same day, Mr Palla said. At the time of the children's deaths almost all of the birds in the village had also died of an illness, he said.

Kratie provincial hospital cooperated with Kampong Cham provincial hospital to check if the children had avian influenza, Mr Palla said. "Test results show that the boy victim really had H5N1 but the girl victim died before she could be tested." However, he said it was concluded that the girl had also died from avian influenza because the pair had shown similar symptoms at the same time, after eating the chicken. On Saturday [8 Feb 2014], an official from the Provincial Health Department "came to the victim's village to educate locals about the H5N1 virus...[telling them] not to eat or touch a sick bird," Mr Palla said.

A 5-year-old boy from Kampong Thom province's Santuk district, who was confirmed positive for H5N1 on [1 Feb 2014], was named the 1st case of avian influenza this year [2014] by the Ministry of Health last week, after 2013 saw the worst outbreak of the virus the country has ever seen, with 12 fatalities.

Vicky Houfrie, communications officer at the World Health Organization in Phnom Penh, confirmed that there had been new fatalities from H5N1 but said, "We are waiting for the press release from the Ministry of Health before we can comment."

[So far the only avian influenza viruses to cause severe respiratory disease in the human population are the H7N9 virus which has been prevalent only in the Chinese population during the period 2013/14, and the H5N1 virus that appeared in 2003 and has spread to 15 countries during the period 2003-2014. Up to the end of 2013 avian H5N1 influenza virus has been responsible for 648 cases and 384 deaths in 15 countries since 2003 (see
