Management of Possible Exposure to CJD Through Medical Procedures
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health in the United Kingdom is seeking views on this
consultation paper produced by the CJD Incidents Panel (1). This expert
advisory group was set up in August 2000 by the chief medical officer to
advise on issues relating to the possible transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD) and variant CJD [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in
ProMED-mail from person to person through healthcare.
Such CJD 'incidents' can arise when a patient found to have CJD has
previously had surgery, or donated blood, organs, or tissues. There is
considerable scientific uncertainty about the transmission risk in such
circumstances. In sporadic CJD, abnormal prion protein and experimental
infectivity have been demonstrated in brain, spinal cord, and parts of the
eye. Rare episodes of transmission have been documented through
neurosurgical procedures and in recipients of human pituitary-derived
gonadotrophins and growth hormone.
Person-to-person transmission of vCJD has not been documented. The
distribution of abnormal prion protein in the body in vCJD, however, is
wider than in sporadic CJD. This leads to the unquantifiable, but
theoretically possible, risk that vCJD may be transmissible through
surgical procedures, especially those involving lymphoreticular tissues as
well as tissues of the central nervous system, and through donations of
blood, organs, and tissues. Normal decontamination and sterilisation
procedures do not destroy abnormal prion protein.
The proposals put forward by the CJD Incidents Panel to support health
authorities and trusts in managing CJD incidents acknowledge the
uncertainties and ethical dilemmas posed by the limited scientific
knowledge of these risks and their possible consequences.
Four main actions are proposed.
(1) Provide advice on when instruments or blood products should be removed
from use.
(2) Establish a confidential database of all possibly exposed people who
would not be routinely informed about their possible exposure. This
database, which would be maintained by the Public Health Laboratory Service
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC), would be used to increase
the knowledge of the risk of transmission.
(3) Inform a small group of possibly exposed people where the panel
considers there is sufficient risk to warrant public health action
(advising people not to donate blood or organs and special precautions
should surgery be needed).
(4) Publicise the database to enable people to find out if they have been
possibly exposed, or to choose to remove their names without learning
whether they may have had an exposure.
The consultation paper is available electronically at
<http://www.doh.gov.uk/cjd/consultation>.
The views of a wide range of healthcare professionals, patient support
groups, and other interested people are sought to address a series of
questions highlighted within the document. Responses can be returned
electronically or by post.
