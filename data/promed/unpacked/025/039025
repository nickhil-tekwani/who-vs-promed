A team directed by Dr. Frederick Blattner, University of Wisconsin,
Madison, has been able to sequence and map 4,288 genes among 4.6 million
base pairs of the _E. coli_ genome.
Report of this DNA gene map will appear in today's edition of the journal
_Science_.
Blattner and associates hope now to be able to determine genetic
differences among genetic varieties of _E. coli_, including O157:H7.
