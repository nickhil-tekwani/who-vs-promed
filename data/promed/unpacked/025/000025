Bad water claims 6 lives
------------------------
6 villagers have died in Monze after drinking contaminated water from a
stream while 12 others have been admitted to Bweengwa rural health center.
Bweengwa member of Parliament Japhet Moonde confirmed in an interview on
Mon 5 Apr 2004 that the villagers who had complained of diarrhea and
vomiting died over the previous 2 days.
Health officials were yet to establish the exact nature of the poisonous
substance which contaminated the water, but preliminary investigations
showed that poor sanitary environment could have been a major factor.
Mr Moonde said of the 6, 2 died at home and 4 [died] at the health center
after complaining of stomach pains, diarrhea, and vomiting -- and that the
illnesses were thought to be "caused by suspected contaminated water from a
stream."
Mr Moonde also said health authorities were in the area and had ruled out
cholera, but suspected poor sanitary environment as having caused the
deaths. He described the condition of the hospitalized patients as stable
and also appealed for more disinfectants and drugs to curb deaths.

[More information is needed to narrow down the possible etiologies of this
episode. The last sentence of the posting suggests the possibility of an
infectious etiology, although a poisoning cannot be ruled out at this
point. - Mod.LL]
