DATCP [WI] quarantines Dane County deer farm and Richland County elk farm due to positive CWD results
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection has quarantined a deer farm in Dane County and an elk farm in Richland County due to chronic wasting disease (CWD). This is a result of the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, IA confirming on [31 May 2018] that samples from a 15 year old whitetail doe and a 2 year old elk cow were positive for CWD.

The 10 acre Dane County deer farm has 6 whitetail deer that have been registered with DATCP since 2003. The farm has been double-fenced since 2009. Since 2010, the farm has had 20 deer sampled for CWD.

Since March [2018], the 20 acre Richland County elk farm has had 11 elk and there have been no elk purchases or sales on the farm in the past 5 years. Since 2007, the farm has had 25 elk sampled for CWD.

[As can be seen from the long list of CWD reports out of Wisconsin this cervid disease is well known in the state. This report of cases in Dane & Richland counties joins those other 2018 reports for Oneida, Lincoln, and Eau Claire counties. Dane & Richland are in southern Wisconsin; Eau Claire is in the west; and Oneida & Lincoln in the north. See: http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/states/wisconsin.gif - Mod.MHJ
