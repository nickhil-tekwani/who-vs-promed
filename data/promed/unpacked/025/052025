Camels may not be the primary source of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) infections in humans, a new Dubai-based study has revealed. At least 95 per cent of adult camels (above 3 years of age) are immune to MERS-CoV and are unlikely to spread the disease to humans, the yet-to-be-published study of 1000 camels has found [see comment].

The recently concluded study did find isolated cases of the virus in camels less than 6 months old, however, though it still remains a mystery as to where the camel-calves got the virus from. It was found that 80 per cent of the camels less than a year old had also developed resistance to the virus. Results from this study point to the need for further investigations on camel-to-human infections.

"Immunity to the infection has developed over many years when the camels may have had contact with the MERS virus," explained Prof Ulli Wernery, scientific director of Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (CVRL) that undertook the study on the directives of His Highness Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice-president and prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai.

Dubai began testing 1000 camels in June 2014 to conduct a scientific study about the link between the dromedaries and MERS virus. There are more than 250 000 camels in the UAE. The study included about 1000 camels of different ages and from different localities in Dubai.

2 nasal swabs were collected as well as blood samples for checking MERS antibodies. Milk from lactating camels was also screened.

According to Prof Ulli, there are remote chances of humans falling sick of the virus from camel transmission. "Transmission from camels to humans does happen but the danger is very low ... most of the current spread of disease is happening in hospital settings," he said. "The virus was found only in the nose (nasal discharge) and not in the lungs or trachea of the calves," he said. "The positivity in the nasal discharge of these calves also disappears within 7 days, the viral RNA in 35 days, by then they will have developed antibodies," said Prof Ulli. "It is like the camels vaccinating themselves."

The study is expected to be published in the journal _Emerging Infectious Diseases_ soon. "Even if the young camels are found to be carrying the virus, it is unlikely that it (virus) will be transferred to humans because, at this stage, calves are handled less by humans ... most of the time they are running along with their mothers and they are not sick."

The study also debunks a statement issued by a Saudi health minister on Tuesday [24 Feb 2015; see 20150302.3200502] saying that about 90 per cent of camels in the Gulf region are carriers of Mers-CoV. Abdullah Asiri, undersecretary for preventative health at the Saudi health ministry was quoted as saying that there was an urgent need for a vaccine since such a huge number of camels were infected.

"This statement is not correct," said Prof Ulli [see comment]. "There is no need for a vaccine at this stage since we know now that there is a remote chance that the virus is being spread from camels to humans. We need to investigate further the source of the virus and then get rid of it," said Prof Ulli, who is planning another study in this regard.

Prof Ulli said, however, there was a possibility that the camel breeding season could be one reason behind the recent spike in cases. "In winter and spring when camels are born we most probably see more cases," he said. "But we still do not know where the camels get the virus from."

re: ProMED-mail. MERS-CoV (27): Saudi Arabia, animal reservoir, camel

Over 90 per cent of dromedaries have antibodies to MERS and are NOT virus carriers.

[The press report from the Khaleej Times (item 1) and the response from Prof Wernery (item 2) provide the reply to ProMED-mail's query in the relevant posting 20150302.3200502: "Are seropositive camels regarded as 'carriers'?" In fact, the results of the serosurvey described indicate that "adult camels (above 3 years) are immune to MERS-CoV and are unlikely to spread the disease to humans". The possible role of younger dromedary camels (or its absence) has yet to be definitely established.

Further investigations into the animal source of human infections with MERS-CoV in the Arab peninsula and neighbouring countries, such as Jordan, are required. This should include bats; so far, the evidence of bat involvement is based upon molecular findings in a single specimen (see 20140720.2623848).

In a recent letter to EID (ref 1), co-authored by researchers from the University of Bonn Medical Centre, Germany, the University of Cordoba, Spain and the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, Dubai, UAE, it was suggested that equids be included among the potential MERS-CoV reservoir animals to be investigated. The authors did not find evidence for equid infections but demonstrated in vitro the susceptibility of primary horse cells, showing production of viral RNA and also of infectious virus progeny "which is a prerequisite for transmission". They refer to earlier findings, according to which MERS-CoV replication levels in horse cells were found comparable to those in bat cells.
