Bird flu spreads in northern Nigeria's main
-------------------------------------------
The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading among poultry farms
around northern Nigeria`s largest city, a senior veterinary official
said Sun [18 Mar 2007].
"The avian influenza virus is still spreading among poultry farms and
it has so far affected 33 farms in 7 districts," Shehu Bawa, head of
Kano State`s Committee on Avian Flu, told AFP.
More than 80 000 birds have been culled in Kano, Bawa added.
Further measures taken to check the outbreak include controls on
movement of poultry and people, disinfecting farm workers and
visitors, fencing off farms, and a ban on borrowing of farm
implements from them.
Nigeria, the continent`s most populous nation with some 140 million
people, early this year reported west Africa`s 1st human bird flu death.
A 22-year-old woman died in Lagos on 17 Jan 2007 weeks after plucking
and disemboweling a chicken.
Bird flu was 1st detected on a farm in Jaji town outside the northern
city of Kano in February last year [2006] from where it spread to
other parts of Nigeria.
Kano, northern Nigeria`s most populous city, was worst affected by
the flu outbreak which ravaged 97 farms in the city resulting in the
death or culling of at least 300 000 birds, officials said.

Vaccination programme controls bird flu effectively: FAO official
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)'s Laurence J Gleeson
was in Viet Nam last week to investigate the bird flu situation and spoke to
Viet Nam News about vaccination efforts.
Q. Why are you here, and what have been the results of your working
visits with Vietnamese officials?
A. The main reason for my coming this time has been to discuss the
vaccination programme.
The FAO has been involved with the Department of Animal Health for at
least 2 years in discussing vaccination strategy.
We are trying to move away from the concept of blanket vaccinations
twice a year and hope to bring a new programme into effect next year.
I have discussed some recommendations with technical people at the
Department of Animal Health and Deputy Minister of Agriculture and
Rural Development Bui Ba Bong.
Q. What recommendations have you made to the Vietnamese Government?
A. First, we must try to ensure a maximum level of protection of the
national flock during the winter months. A vaccination programme has to be
conducted nationally in October and November so there's good immunity
in the national flock during Tet when a lot of chickens are moved around.
Second, we hope to make vaccination of all poultry in the commercial
sector compulsory.
They must be vaccinated twice a year. Poultry for meat production
should be vaccinated at day one in the hatchery and again when they
are 3- or 4-weeks-old.
We must also have a special vaccination campaign for ducks and insist
that the duck population be vaccinated twice a year. FAO recommends that
vaccinations for ducks among small farmers should be free-of-charge
and supported by the Government, at least initially.
Vaccination of chickens in the commercial sector should be paid for
by the owners. The number of vaccinations should be reduced to once a year in
the backyard sector and concentrated in October and November. In
places where Government or local authorities think there may be more risk, they
can vaccinate an additional time during the year.
The Government needs a long-term plan to manage the vaccination
programme and needs to have a stronger information network in place about when
the disease is occurring so that responses can take place quickly.
Q. We've heard that a recent test from the Australian Animal Health
Laboratory revealed some minor mutations of the bird flu virus in Viet
Nam. What do you think about this?
A. I don't know the technical details so I can't comment on the
significance of it except to say that if there's a technically
consistent change in a number of viruses, then it would indicate some
slight genetic selection of the virus. We expect that where there is
a localised circulation of the virus, such as among ducks in the
south, there will be some genetic selection of the virus in that
environment. What is more serious is a significant change.
Q. Have there been any bird flu virus mutations in other countries?
A. Some people have made a comment that vaccination is more likely to
cause mutation. I would simply say no because there's no evidence.
Q. We did have some news material, such as a story entitled Egypt
Fears Bird Flu Mutation reported by Jenny Cuffe on the BBC on 14 Mar
2007, in which Dr Michael Osterholm, Director of the Centre for
Disease Control in the US [Dr. Michael Osterholm is Director of the
Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy of the University
of Minnesota in the USA - Mod.MPP] , pointed to the poor record of
poultry vaccinations in China and Viet Nam.
A. FAO disagrees that there has been a poor record of poultry
vaccinations in Viet Nam. Vaccination was used because the situation
was serious here.
We supported the Government and believe the use of vaccines has made
significant contributions to the control of the disease and the
reduction of public health risk in this country.
Q. He went on to say that vaccines may do more harm than good by
keeping birds from dying but allowing them to continue transmitting the virus.
A. Well, that's what vaccine is supposed to do. One reason for
vaccinating birds is to reduce virus circulation and the risk to
people but another
reason is to protect the production of birds which people rely on for
income. You can't have a poultry industry and can't control bird flu
if you don't control the virus.
The FAO is not pressing any country to launch a vaccination campaign.
We just provide technical support to ensure the vaccination
programmes are carried out effectively.
Q. Some have commented that the bird flu situation in Viet Nam is
less serious than in the last couple of years. What do you think?
A. The situation is probably not so serious in that most outbreaks
have occurred in ducks which were not vaccinated. We haven't had a situation in
which the disease was reported in vaccinated birds, which would be
very serious, and it has not crossed over to chickens to any large extent.
Q. What does the country need to do to eradicate the virus?
A. It's not endemic in any population but it could pop up at any time
because it can be re-introduced. To completely eliminate the virus
from the Mekong River Delta will be very challenging. Viet Nam over
the next 4 or 5 years should have a practical programme that
recognises when the disease is not present, the virus may still be
present and in circulation. If you relax control, the disease can come back.
Concentrate on eliminating the disease. Later, when there is no more
H5N1 virus circulating in the region, then start talking about
eradication of the virus.

1000 chickens killed in new Myanmar bird flu outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------
Myanmar has slaughtered more than 1000 chickens after discovering
another outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in Yangon, a
livestock department official said Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].
The discovery of avian influenza on a chicken farm in the north of
Myanmar's biggest city is the 5th such outbreak this year, leaving
officials worried about the rapid spread of the virus.
"More than 1000 chickens were killed from Saturday [17 Mar 2007] to
Monday [19 Mar 2007], and we suspect the H5N1 virus is spreading," a
senior official of the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department said.
"The farm has about 20 000 chickens... it's a big farm," the official
told AFP on the condition of anonymity as he did not have official
permission to speak to the media.
The outbreak occurred in Hmawbi township, about 20 miles (35 km)
north of the centre of Yangon. Myanmar previously confirmed 4
outbreaks of the H5N1 virus this month in suburbs of the city.
Authorities have not revealed the total number of birds killed since
this year's 1st outbreak.
A total of 168 people worldwide have died of bird flu since 2003,
mostly in Asia, World Health Organisation figures show. No human
cases have been found in Myanmar, but health ministry officials said
they were monitoring those who may have been exposed.
"About 960 people who had contact with fowls, as well as their family
members around the outbreak areas, are still under surveillance,"
Kyaw Nyit Sein, deputy director general of health ministry, told AFP
on Tuesday.
"There is no positive case yet among them."
Myanmar had declared itself bird-flu free in September [2006] after
months without any new cases of the disease following an outbreak
around the central city of Mandalay in March 2006.
The UN's agricultural agency has praised Myanmar's normally secretive
government for being "quick and effective" in its response to new
outbreaks, and is providing 1.4 million dollars in assistance to help
fight the disease.

[4] Japan, Hodgson's hawk eagle

H5N1 kills rare eagle near Japan bird flu sites
-----------------------------------------------------
The H5N1 bird flu virus killed a rare species of eagle, captured
within 75 km (47 miles) of sites of 3 Japanese outbreaks of the virus
among poultry earlier this year, the environment ministry said on
Monday [19 Mar 2007].
Further tests are under way to see whether it is a highly pathogenic
strain of the H5N1 virus as well as genetic tests to determine its
roots, but the discovery has increased chances that the virus has
been carried to Japan by wild life [see comment].
_Spizaetus nipalensis orientalis_, often called Hodgson's hawk eagle,
is an endangered species in Japan. It does not migrate, and eats
small birds and animals. [Picture at
<http://www.princeton.edu/~vivekt/images/changeable-hawk-eagle.jpg>].
The ministry said the adult female bird was found sick but uninjured
on 4 Jan 2007 in Sagara village, Kumamoto prefecture, on Japan's
southernmost main island of Kyushu.
Japan later in the month confirmed its 1st outbreak of the H5N1 virus
since 2004 in neighbouring Miyazaki prefecture, the country's biggest
poultry-producing region.
Two other outbreaks have since hit Miyazaki and another occurred in
the western prefecture of Okayama.
While tests on whether the eagle suffered from lead poisoning proved
negative, a test for bird flu was positive followed by a later test
in which the H5N1 virus was isolated, the ministry said.
The ministry said it plans to resume surveillance of wild birds
around the site where the bird was captured.
The results of earlier tests for bird flu on samples of ducks and
other wild birds taken in areas immediately surrounding the 4
outbreaks had all been negative.

[According to Japan's official "immediate notification" to the OIE on
13 Jan 2007 regarding the confirmed reoccurrence of HPAI H5 (later
designated H5N1), after almost 3 years of absence, the event started
on 10 Jan 2007. See
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4522>.
In view of the fact that the incubation period of HPAI is regarded to
be 1 to 7 days, and that some time might have elapsed between the
initial infection and the appearance of clinically suspected cases
followed by sampling and testing, detection of an infected wild bird
on 4 Jan 2007 is not necessarily an indication of its role as the
pathogen introducer/infector but possibly as a sentinel of infection
in domestic fowl or another wild bird. As reported, this species
"does not migrate, and eats small birds and animals"; this might be a
supplementary evidence that the route of H5N1's (re)introduction to
Japan is still to be unveiled. - Mod. AS].

Thai livestock development Chief Pirom Srichan reported the 4th bird
flu outbreak in north-eastern province of Mukdahan.
The past 3 outbreaks occurred in Phitsanulok in the lower North, Ang
Thong in the Central Plains, and Nong Khai in the Northeast.
The fresh bird flu outbreak was discovered 2 weeks ago in domestic
chickens raised on a farm in Mukdahan, Thai news network The Nation reported.
Provincial livestock officials had culled the entire flock to prevent
any possible spread of the virus.
The World Health Organization reports that the virus has infected at
least 277 people in 12 countries since 2003 killing at least 168.
