Maricopa County continues to break records for the number of West Nile virus cases and deaths recorded this year [2021]. As of [Fri 17 Dec 2021], 1300 cases had been recorded in the county, along with 90 deaths.

That's compared to 3 cases and only one death in 2020, according to Maricopa County Department of Public Health records.

Since around a month ago, on [19 Nov 2021], the county has seen an additional 247 recorded cases of West Nile virus and 78 additional deaths, according to health department data.

With a particularly wet summer this year that followed an extraordinarily dry summer in 2020, conditions were perfect this year for West Nile virus to spread in Maricopa County.

Warmer-than-usual temperatures that extended through November and into early December kept the mosquito season going in the Valley when colder weather might have stopped it.

West Nile virus was 1st detected in Arizona in 2003, according to the Arizona Department of Public Health. People contract the disease when an infected mosquito bites them. West Nile is not transmitted through [direct] human-to-human contact.

Around 80% of people bitten by infected mosquitos never develop symptoms or even know they've infected. Slightly fewer than 20% might develop a flu-like illness, said Maricopa County Health Department Epizoologist, Melissa Kretschmer. Slightly fewer than 1% might develop a more severe illness that affects their brain and spinal cord.

Previous annual West Nile virus human case counts, according to Maricopa County Department of Public Health records:

2011: 50 cases and 2 deaths
2012: 98 cases and 4 deaths
2013: 52 cases 6 deaths
2014: 93 cases and 12 deaths
2015: 62 cases and 2 deaths
2016: 63 cases and 5 deaths
2017: 93 cases and 6 deaths
2018: 24 cases and 6vdeaths
2019: 155 cases and 17 deaths
2020: 3 cases and one death

[Arizona continues to experience an unusually high number of human West Nile virus (WNV) human infections this year (2021), with Maricopa County the main focus of infection.

On 17 Nov 2021, the US CDC reported that Arizona had a total of 1049 cases (724 neurological and 325 non-neurological) and a ProMED-mail post of that date reported 1233 cases in Arizona. Since then, the CDC 14 Dec 2021 total has now reached 1426 cases (973 non-neuroinvasive, 453 neuroinvasive) with 96 deaths (https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/preliminarymapsdata2021/disease-cases-state-2021.html), higher totals than those given in the above report. The above report indicates that unusually warm weather has extended the usual WNV transmission season.

There is a vaccine for equine animals but not for humans. The only preventive measure for people is to avoid mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
