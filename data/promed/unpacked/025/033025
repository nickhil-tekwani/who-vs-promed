Current evaluation of risks to humans from avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
following recent reports
-----------------------------------------------
In the last 2 weeks, avian influenza appears to have re-emerged in poultry
in several countries in Asia. These outbreaks could either be new outbreaks
of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) virus, or, a continuation of
the outbreaks 1st reported earlier in 2004. These events, in addition to 2
new research reports -- about the virus becoming increasingly pathogenic
and becoming more widespread in birds in the region -- fuel the World
Health Organization's concern about the threat the virus poses to human health.
WHO has been concerned about this virus, influenza A(H5N1) virus, because
of its threat to humans, both in farm settings in Asia, and, its greater,
potentially global risk. Several countries in Asia have witnessed this
virus crossing the species barrier -- moving from infected chickens or
ducks directly into humans -- in 3 documented outbreaks since 1997. These
direct human infections have produced severe, and sometimes fatal,
outcomes. Moreover, the virus has the potential to acquire the ability to
spread easily from human to human, and, thus, trigger a global influenza
pandemic.
Now, 2 research reports have added to our understanding of this virus. 1st,
members of China's Ministry of Agriculture, and colleagues, reported, in a
paper published last week [1st week of July 2004] in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, that the virus appears to be widespread in
domestic ducks in southern China. Further, the scientists found that the
virus is causing increasingly severe disease. However, these trials were
done in mice and may not have a direct implication for humans.
During the 2nd week of July 2004, the journal Nature published a report
[see following report - Mod.CP] which indicates domestic and wild birds in
the region may have contributed to the increasing spread of the virus, and,
suggests that the virus is gaining a stronger foothold in the region. These
observations suggest that control of the virus may be even more difficult
than thought in the spring of 2004.
Effective risk management tools exist to control outbreaks of influenza
A(H5N1) virus infection, when they are detected in poultry operations.
China, for example, was quick to employ these tools during the 1st week of
July 2004, when an outbreak was discovered in Anhui province. These
risk-management measures include the culling of infected and exposed birds,
stringent biosecurity measures, and vaccination. While this approach can
still take months, or, even years to contain the virus completely, these
methods have been effective in the past.
However, tools to assess the risk to human health are less well developed.
While recent reports indicate the virus has been present consistently in
the environment for the last several years, it has still not acquired the
ability to infect humans easily. Why? Is there something about this virus
which resists this development? Given the recent reports, WHO urges, and
offers assistance, that such risk-assessment activities -- including
surveillance in animals and humans, and strain analysis -- be undertaken as
soon as possible.
More knowledge of the virus could be acquired if WHO had full access to all
virus isolates, and clinical specimens, from recent outbreaks. All H5N1
viruses are not the same, and how they differ could provide important
insights. For example, the work reported in Nature suggests that the
Indonesian avian influenza virus, while belonging to the genotype of
viruses seen in Viet Nam and Thailand, is also distinct. What, if any,
impact does this difference have? With this information, public health
planners would know that they are confronting the same virus in all of the
recent outbreaks in Asia. This is another set of the many questions that
need to be answered imperatively.
Pandemic preparedness activities started by WHO in the wake of the
outbreaks reported earlier in 2004 continue. Less than two weeks ago [end
of June 2004], WHO hosted a meeting in Kuala Lumpur with experts from 13
countries and areas of the Asia-Pacific region. Among other activities, the
meeting participants were provided with a WHO preparedness self-assessment
tool. WHO is collaborating with scientists, and the pharmaceutical
community, on a global surveillance system to monitor changes in the
virus's susceptibility to known antivirals. Finally, pandemic vaccine
development continues. 2 vaccine manufacturers, both based in the United
States, have produced a supply of trial vaccine which will be tested for
safety and efficacy in humans.
In summary, recent developments suggest that:
* the virus is more widespread than previously thought and found in wild
birds, and, therefore, it may be more difficult to eliminate.
* virus isolates and specimens from all recent outbreaks need to be shared
with the WHO laboratory network to monitor the circulating viruses and to
assess the adequacy of the current pandemic vaccine strain.
* as control measures are strengthened, national governments are encouraged
to provide human influenza vaccinations to culling workers.
* all people, especially culling workers, exposed to infected birds need to
be provided with antivirals.
* human trials of experimental influenza pandemic vaccines should be
accelerated.
* while early identification of avian influenza cases in humans is
difficult, stepped up surveillance for the early detection of the disease
in humans is essential.
The risk of emergence of a new human pandemic virus will remain as long as
the avian influenza virus exists in the environment. WHO's concern, and
activities, continue at a high level following recent reports. Because the
H5N1 threat is unlikely to be resolved in the short term, WHO is working
with other international agencies, including the Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO), and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), to
monitor events.

Genesis of the H5N1 virus associated with human illness in East Asia

influenza virus in eastern Asia

Abstract: "A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, caused disease
outbreaks in poultry in China and 7 other east Asian countries between late
2003 and early 2004; the same virus was fatal to humans in Thailand and
Viet Nam. Here, we demonstrate a series of genetic reassortment events
traceable to the precursor of the H5N1 viruses that caused the initial
human outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997, and, subsequent avian outbreaks in
2001 and 2002. These events gave rise to a dominant H5N1 genotype (Z) in
chickens and ducks that was responsible for the regional outbreak in 2003 -
2004. Our findings indicate that domestic ducks in southern China had a
central role in the generation and maintenance of this virus, and, also,
that wild birds may have contributed to the increasingly wide spread of the
virus in Asia. Our results suggest that H5N1 viruses with pandemic
potential have become endemic in the region and are not easily eradicable.
These developments pose a threat to public and veterinary health in the
region, and, potentially, the world, and suggest that long-term control
measures are required."
