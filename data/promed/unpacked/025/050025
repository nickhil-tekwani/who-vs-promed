[3] USA (California): 2nd death

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/monkeypox-second-person-in-the-u-s-dies-after-contracting-disease/


Health authorities are now investigating what role monkeypox may have played in the death of a person diagnosed with the virus, officials in California said Thursday [8 Sep 2022]. This is the 2nd known person to die in the United States after contracting the virus during the current outbreak. The announcement comes less than a month after officials in Texas confirmed they were investigating a potential death from the virus.

"We will be doing an autopsy. So it does take time for those results to come back. So it may be as soon as a few days, or it may take a few weeks," Los Angeles County's Dr. Rita Singhal told reporters on Thursday [8 Sep 2022]. The autopsy is scheduled to begin on Friday [9 Sep 2022], a county spokesperson later confirmed to CBS News.

[4] Brazil: disseminated infection in immunosuppressed man

Citation: Rodrigues Menezes Y, Braga de Miranda A. Severely disseminated clinical presentation of monkeypox virus infection in an immunocompromised patient: first death report in Brazil. Rev Soc Bras Med Trop. 2022.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Since May 2022, the number of monkeypox virus infections has sharply increased in countries where the disease has not been previously endemic. At present, most reports refer to low-severity cases. Herein, we present a severe case of the disease with disseminated skin lesions that progressed to death in an immunosuppressed patient in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

Introduction
------------
Herein, we report the case of a patient in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, with a confirmed monkeypox virus infection with a severely disseminated clinical presentation, which differs from the description of existing cases in the current outbreak worldwide. To date, this case report represents the 1st death caused by this disease outside of Africa during the current outbreak.

Case report
-----------
A 41-year-old male, born in Pará de Minas, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and living in Belo Horizonte, noticed the onset of papulovesicular lesions with central umbilication on 7 Jul 2022. In addition, he reported painful bilateral lymphadenopathy in the inguinal region. On 9 Jul 2022, the patient developed diarrhea, weakness, and malaise. The patient did not have a fever, flu prodrome, or other symptoms. The number of lesions in the integument increased rapidly, and on 14 Jul 2022, the patient was referred to the Hospital Eduardo de Menezes, a specialized hospital for the treatment of infectious contagious diseases in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

The 1st skin lesions appeared on the forehead and rapidly progressed to the rest of the body, including the chest, abdomen, back, upper and lower limbs, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, genitalia, perineum, anorectal region, tongue, and oropharynx. The patient had no history of traveling abroad or to other Brazilian states; however, he reported unprotected sexual contact on 30 Jun 2022, with a male who had traveled to the countryside of the state of Minas Gerais a few days earlier.

The patient was an MSM, carrier of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), diagnosed in 2005, and had been undergoing regular treatment since 2021. His viral load was undetectable and the CD4 lymphocyte count was 53 on 31 May 2022. Previously, in November 2021, his viral load was undetectable and the CD4 lymphocyte count was 74.

He reported his last chemotherapy cycle on 5 Jul 2022, for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with metastases to the spine, skull, and liver. The 1st chemotherapy cycle was initiated in February 2022. Laboratory review at hospital admission showed anemia (hemoglobin = 8.1 g/dL) and a global leukocyte count of 500 cells/mm³ (35 neutrophils/mm³), without other abnormalities. Chest radiography revealed no pathological findings.

The liquid contained in the cutaneous vesicles was collected on 15 Jul 2022 for RT-PCR, which was positive for monkeypox virus. Molecular diagnosis was performed at the Fundação Ezequiel Dias (FUNED) in Belo Horizonte. The number of lesions progressively increased from the onset of the 1st lesion until 25 Jul 2022, making it a period of approximately 2.5 weeks (Figures 1-4 [see source URL for all figures]). The many lesions in the oral cavity caused pharyngitis, limiting oral intake (Figure 5). Therefore, the patient required a nasoenteric tube for feeding.

Concomitantly, with the appearance of skin lesions on 23 Jul 2022, the patient progressively developed dyspnea, requiring supplemental oxygen via a nasal catheter, suggesting a possible pulmonary complication of the virus. Meropenem and vancomycin were prescribed empirically on the same day. On 26 Jul 2022, the patient underwent a chest radiograph showing bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform a chest computerized tomography (CT) scan because of the absence of equipment at the hospital.

On 24 Jul 2022, the onset of significant edema was observed on the penis and glans, causing an anatomical deformation of the region and urinary flow obstruction, requiring cystostomy on 25 Jul 2022.

On 27 Jul 2022, the patient suddenly developed significant respiratory deterioration, acute kidney injury, and multiple organ dysfunctions. Therefore, he was referred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he died on 28 Jul 2022. There was no bacterial growth in several blood cultures and the patient was under a broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.

Discussion
----------
Skin lesions usually start near inoculation sites, which may explain the fact that the clinical presentation of skin lesions is mostly localized near the genitalia and anus in the current outbreak (1,2 [see source URL for all references]). However, our patient presented with disseminated lesions throughout the body and reported an onset of the 1st lesion in the forehead region. The lesions were all in the same clinical stage throughout the course of the disease, which was also observed by Perez et al (3). Although the clinical course of the disease is well established in the medical literature, lasting from 2 to 4 weeks, there is no mention of the period between the onset of the 1st and last skin lesions. The progressively increasing number of new lesions presented by the patient lasted approximately 2.5 weeks, when most of them were in the crusted stage.

The patient was hospitalized for 14 days. The primary reasons for hospitalization were pain management, particularly severe anorectal pain, pharyngitis that limited oral intake, and infection control. Subsequently, the patient developed urinary flow obstruction, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and multiple organ dysfunctions.

The multiple organ dysfunctions presented suggest that the most likely cause of death was sepsis, although there was no bacterial growth in several blood cultures and the patient was under broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. The severely disseminated clinical presentation of the disease predisposed the patient to many conditions that made him susceptible to sepsis. Other causes of death can be hypothesized, including a visceral involvement of the disease. Considering the uniqueness of this case and the possible visceral involvement, the lack of a full autopsy and an accurate imaging examination can be considered major limitations of this report.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A healthy 37-year-old woman presented with a 4-day history of painless but pruritic genital rash and a 2-day history of fever and myalgias. She had condomless intercourse 2 weeks earlier with a new male partner. Physical examination revealed several umbilicated pustules limited to the genital area (Figure [see source URL]). Polymerase chain reaction assays of the swabs obtained were positive for monkeypox virus. Although classic cases of monkeypox included a febrile prodrome followed by generalized rash, the current outbreak has been characterized mainly by painless anogenital lesions, often without a prodrome. Most reported cases are being observed in men who have sex with men, but this case raises awareness that women are also at risk, and gynecologists must be alert to correctly identify the genital lesions and promptly implement isolation measures. Moreover, the localized genital lesions increase speculation about sexual transmission being primarily involved in the current outbreak.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
The current monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreak in non-endemic countries is raising concern about the pandemic potential of novel orthopoxviruses. Little is known regarding MPXV immunity in the context of MPXV infection or vaccination with vaccinia-based vaccines (VACV). As with vaccinia, T cells are likely to provide an important contribution to overall immunity to MPXV. Here we leveraged the epitope information available in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) on VACV to predict potential MPXV targets recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. We found a high degree of conservation between VACV epitopes and MPXV, and defined T cell immunodominant targets. These analyses enabled the design of peptide pools able to experimentally detect VACV-specific T cell responses and MPXV cross-reactive T cells in a cohort of vaccinated individuals. Our findings will facilitate the monitoring of cellular immunity following MPXV infection and vaccination.

[8] STIs in monkeypox patients

Surveillance data from 8 US jurisdictions found a high prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among people with monkeypox, a research team based at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported today [8 Sep 2022].

The HIV and STI findings came from an analysis of 1969 monkeypox cases diagnosed between 17 May and 22 Jul 2022 at 8 HIV surveillance jurisdictions. The team published their findings today [8 Sep 2022] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7136a1.htm).

Of the group, 38% were infected with HIV and 41% had experienced an STI in the previous year. Also, 18% had both. Hospitalizations for monkeypox were more common in people with HIV. People with HIV were more likely to report rectal pain and other rectal symptoms, which researchers said might relate to differences in site of exposure, increased susceptibility, or other factors, the group wrote.

The findings underscore the importance of leveraging systems for delivering HIV and STI care and prioritizing people with the 2 conditions for monkeypox vaccination. They also emphasized that those who haven't received routine HIV or STI care or those with milder symptoms might be less likely to have their monkeypox infections diagnosed. "It is important that healthcare providers who do not specialize in HIV or sexual health become familiar with the clinical guidance for monkeypox diagnosis and treatment," they wrote.

[9] Virus in anal and urethral swabs

Citation: Mileto D, Giacomelli A, Cutrera M, et al. Isolation of viable monkeypox virus from anal and urethral swabs, Italy, May to July 2022. Euro Surveill. 2022; 27(36): pii=2200675.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To provide more evidence on whether viral transmission can occur by sexual contact, we analysed anal and urethral swabs from 33 confirmed human monkeypox [MPX] cases and investigated whether viable virus was present. We found not only that the majority of both anal and urethral swabs collected within 7 days from symptoms onset tested positive for MPX virus by PCR (18 PCR positive among 22 anal swabs and 15 PCR positive among 18 urethral swabs), but also that viable MPXV was present in most of the latter (13 culture-positive among 18 PCR-positive anal swabs and 11 culture-positive among 15 PCR-positive urethral swabs).

As expected, there appeared to be higher median Cq values for both anal and urethral swabs collected after the 1st week from symptom onset compared with within this week. It is noteworthy that only 6 cases had a perianal lesion located less than 2 cm from the anal rim and only 3 cases presented a glans lesion, thus making unlikely the potential pre-analytic contamination of our samples from surrounding lesions. It is also worth mentioning that 2 variola-vaccinated cases (who never developed rash) had respective urethral swabs with detectable MPXV DNA. For one of these cases, viable virus was recovered from the swab. This suggests that transmission from asymptomatic subjects is conceivable.

To best of our knowledge this is the 1st identification of viable MPXV in anal and urethral swabs. We consider unlikely the possibility of contamination during sexual contact that could have led to false-positive results, given that the presumed times of last MPXV potential exposure in the concerned cases were 10 and 7 days before the swab collection. The results can be considered in terms of the hypothesis of a sexual transmission potential of MPXV. Nevertheless, it is still unknown when the viral shedding starts in the anus and urethra after an infection, as well as the exact duration of viral shedding in such parts of the body; in our experience, an increase of Cq was observed from week 1 to week 3 post-symptom apparition in both anal and urethral samples, which appears to indicate a decline of the viral agent presence during the first 21 days from symptoms onset. As more data are necessary to affirm the timing of viral clearance, the authors support the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health institutions' recommendation of condom use for several weeks after monkeypox recovery.
