_Mycoplasma synoviae_ causes synovitis in domestic chickens and ducks. This
organism is exceptionally difficult to grow, requiring reduced DPN in a
typical mycoplasma medium containing serum, peptones and yeast extract.
Possibly a similar organism is involved in the owl disease.

[This indeed seems like a good question, so we inquired of Dr. Evans, whose
response is below. Perhaps someone would be willing to help Dr. Evans in
this project? Mod. TG

I am a poultry veterinarian and originally thought this was a typical _M.
synoviae_ problem, but very in-depth histologic examination showed no real
evidence of inflammatory joint disease with the exception of local chronic
inflammation where nodules impinged on tissues.
However, our public health lab which is well versed in _Mycoplasma_ spp.
isolation failed to isolate any _Mycoplasma_. I am trying to twist someone's
arm to do a PCR or such for free, so far no luck. I was hoping this posting
might bring put me in touch with some sympathetic diagnostician willing to
test for free.
It might be on interest that in May of last year we diagnosed _M. synoviae_
in a California Gull (_Larus californicus_) with bilateral inflammatory
joint disease using the above methods. The bird had been hanging around a
local backyard poultry operation with history of this disease.

[The California gull is about 53.3 cm (21 inches) long with a wingspan of
137.2 cm (54 inches). Adults have a dark gray mantle, white head (heavily
streaked with brown during the winter), dark eye, yellow bill with red and
black spots, and gray-green or greenish-yellow legs - Mod.TG
