Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Loughrea, Galway
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Jan 2017
Outbreak status: resolved on 18 Jan 2017
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 3 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: 1 case animal, 2 cohorts alive (there were 218 cohorts electronically, all of which are dead). The 2 alive cohorts were slaughtered and disposed of yesterday (23 Jan 2017) and were rapid tested last night. The case animal gave birth to 12 progeny all of which are dead.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: On [14 Jan 2017], the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) was advised of a positive result to a rapid screening test (Idexx HerdChek BSE/Scrapie Antigen Test Kit using the Ultra-Short protocol) carried out by an accredited private laboratory approved by the competent authority. The suspect animal was sampled by DAFM staff at a knackery as part of the on-going official sampling of all fallen (died on farm) animals of 48 months and older. The sample material and the brain were subsequently forwarded to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) where samples from different brain areas were subject to confirmatory testing using an OIE-approved confirmatory Western blot method, a 2-blot protocol for the classification of BSE isolates. All the samples had an identical molecular pattern indicating atypical L Type BSE. In accordance with NRL protocols, samples from the animal were then sent for histopathology and immunohistochemistry on the medulla of the brain. These are further OIE confirmatory testing methods for BSE. Results of these tests are due this week. Final confirmatory test results were received from the NRL on [18 Jan 2017] confirming the case to be atypical L type BSE. The animal was an Aberdeen Angus female, born on [5 Mar 1998]. The animal was born in a herd in County Cork and it moved early in its life to the herd in Galway where it remained for the rest of its life. The farmer reported that the animal had appeared stiff for 2 weeks prior to death. On [11 Jan 2017] the animal was recumbent but it recovered and it became recumbent again on the morning of [13 Jan 2017]. The decision was taken to euthanize the animal then. The animal remained eating and drinking at all times.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; vaccinated permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures
