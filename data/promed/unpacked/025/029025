[In the spirit of not getting ahead of the data, it is important to remember
that there has been no confirmation of H5N1 yet; only the H5 virus is
confirmed in this report. However, there is high mortality and an H5 subtype
that is now identified. Therefore, further information would be appreciated
and is eagerly anticipated. - Mod.PC]
