In a recent issue of ProMED-mail the pertussis epidemic in Australia was
mentioned. Further the [moderator inquired about collaboration between
Australian and Dutch scientists, since there is some evidence that
antigenic shifts may have played a role in causing a pertussis epidemic in
Holland (1,2). There is indeed an ongoing collaboration between Dr
McIntyre (National Centre for Immunization Research and Surveillance of
Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Sydney) and myself. Dr. McIntyre has agreed
to send us a collection of Australian strains, and we will determine
whether recent isolates differ in the type of pertactin they produce
compared to the vaccine strains, an observation we have made in Holland. I
don't think that the observed shifts in pertactin per se can explain the
epidemics. However, these shifts may be the "tip of the iceberg", and
reflect larger (antigenic) differences between circulating strains and
vaccine strains.

Actually, 4 vaccine manufacturers have included pertactin in their
acellular vaccines: Biocine-Chiron has recombinant PT+FHA+Pertactcin [PRN,
Smith Kline has PT+FHA+PRN, Lederle has PT+FHA+PRN+Fimbria 2, and Pasteur
Merieux Connaught-Canada has PT+FHA+PRN+FIM 2+Fim 3. Both PMC-France and
PMC-USA produce PT+FHA vaccine.
