Hong Kong health officials report investigating a suspected ciguatoxin poisoning cases affecting 2 people. The report involves 2 females, aged 34 and 66, who developed symptoms of ciguatoxin poisoning including abdominal pain and diarrhea about 6 to 7 hours after consuming a marine fish for dinner at home on 5 Apr 2021. The latter patient also developed perioral numbness and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital the next day [6 Apr 2021]. She was admitted for further management. Both patients are in a stable condition. Initial inquiries revealed that the fish consumed was bought from a fish stall in Yeung Uk Road Market, Tsuen Wan, on 4 Apr 2021.

Ciguatera fish poisoning is not uncommon in tropical areas. It is mainly associated with the consumption of big coral reef fish which have accumulated the toxin in the body, particularly in internal organs, through eating small fish that consumed toxic algae in coral reef seas. A larger fish is therefore more likely to carry higher amounts of the toxin. However, it is not easy to tell from the appearance of the fish whether it contains the toxin.

People affected may have symptoms of numbness of the mouth and limbs, vomiting, diarrhea, alternating sensations of coldness and hotness, and pain in the joints and muscles. "Most people affected by ciguatoxin will recover without long-term health effects, but if excessive toxins are consumed, the circulatory and nervous systems can be affected. The toxin cannot be destroyed by cooking," the spokesman said.

[A 2017 open access review of ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) has been published in Marine Drugs (Friedman MA, Fernandez M, Backer LC, et al. An updated review of ciguatera fish poisoning: clinical, epidemiological, environmental, and public health management. Mar Drugs. 2017; 15: 72. http://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/15/3/72/htm).

The description of the acute illness with the references included (complete references can be found at the URL above) has been extracted below:

"CFP is characterized by gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular symptoms. In addition, after the initial or acute illness, neuropsychological symptoms may be reported. Clinical features can vary depending on elapsed time since eating the toxic meal, and whether the geographic source of the implicated ﬁsh was the Caribbean Sea, Paciﬁc, or Indian Ocean (17,36,52-58). Gastrointestinal symptoms and signs usually begin within 6-12 hours of ﬁsh consumption and resolve spontaneously within 1-4 days. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The neurologic symptoms usually present within the first 2 days of illness. They often become prominent after the gastrointestinal symptoms (particularly in CFP events from Caribbean ﬁsh), although they may present concurrently with gastrointestinal symptoms (K Schrank, written communication, April 2016) (59). The neurologic symptoms vary among patients and include paresthesias (that is, numbness or tingling) in the hands and feet or oral region, metallic taste, sensation of loose teeth, generalized pruritus (itching), myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), headache, and dizziness. A distinctive neurologic symptom is cold allodynia, sometimes referred to as 'hot-cold reversal,' an alteration of temperature perception in which touching cold surfaces produces a burning sensation or a dysesthesia (that is, unpleasant, abnormal sensation) (60). One study revealed that intra-cutaneous injection of CTX in humans elicited this sensation (61). Cold allodynia is considered pathognomonic of CFP, although not all patients report experiencing it and it can be seen with other human seafood poisoning syndromes (such as neurotoxic shellﬁsh poisoning). Less commonly, severe central nervous system symptoms, such as coma or hallucinations, have been reported (54,62,63). Neuropsychological symptoms, which often become apparent in the days or weeks after the initial or acute illness, include subjectively reported cognitive complaints such as confusion, reduced memory, and difficulty concentrating (64-67), depression or irritability (64,65,68), and anxiety (65). Fatigue or malaise have been reported and may be debilitating (6,62,69,70). Cardiac symptoms and signs may manifest, generally in the early stage of the illness. When present, they usually occur in combination with gastrointestinal and/or neurologic signs and symptoms (71,72). Cardiac signs often include hypotension and bradycardia which may necessitate emergency medical care."
