A new aggressive daytime-biting mosquito capable of transmitting debilitating and possibly deadly viruses has been found in the Los Angeles region [California], officials announced Wednesday [15 Oct 2014]. Known as yellow fever mosquitoes, the insects were found 7 and 8 Oct [2014] in Commerce and Pico Rivera [Los Angeles County], respectively, according to the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District.

The _Aedes aegypti_ species, which has black and white stripes and grows to about 1/4 inch [5 mm] in size, can transmit dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever -- viruses that can cause painful symptoms including headaches and high fever, officials said.

"While these debilitating viruses, so far, aren't locally transmitted in Los Angeles County, the mosquitoes that can transmit them are now here," Susanne Kluh, the district's director of scientific-technical services, said in a statement. "Infected travelers can bring these viruses to Los Angeles County."

The mosquito is the 3rd species of the _Aedes_ genus found in Los Angeles County in the past 3 years, said district spokesman Levy Sun.

In September 2011, officials found Asian tiger mosquitoes [_Aedes albopictus_], which come from Southeast Asia, in South El Monte and El Monte. The mosquito population has since grown and spread into 10 neighboring communities, officials said.

Then this summer [2014], authorities found Australian backyard mosquitoes [_Aedes notoscriptus_] in Montebello and Monterey Park.

The yellow fever mosquito -- which was 1st found in California, including in the Central Valley, in 2013 -- is an aggressive daytime biter that thrives in urban environments, preferring small, man-made containers to lay eggs.

"We're aggressively attacking the populations wherever we find them," said Jason Farned, spokesman for the San Gabriel Valley Vector Control District.

Determining how the _Aedes_ species were introduced to California has been difficult, but officials say imported tires and plants are typically to blame. They can also travel via planes, ships and other vehicles.

Officials urged residents to report any daytime-biting mosquitoes with black and white stripes.

[Los Angeles County represents a new site for presence of _A. aegypti_. It has been found in the Central Valley of California last year (2013). _Aedes notoscriptus_ from Australia was found in southern California (Los Angeles County) in September this year (2014). One hopes that the eradication efforts to eliminate _A. notoscriptus_ and _A. aegypti_ have been successful. In addition to being a pest species, _A. notoscriptus_ is both a heartworm and a virus vector in Australia. Should either _A. aegypti_ or _A. notoscriptus_ become established, it raises the risk of ongoing, local transmission of several viruses, including dengue and chikungunya. Interestingly, there have been 34 cases of chikungunya virus infection imported into California as of 14 Oct this year (2014). If the populations of these mosquitoes become abundant, the risk of ongoing transmission of chikungunya and dengue viruses following their importation will increase significantly.
