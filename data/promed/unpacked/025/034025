Import of Chinese bird flu vaccine slammed in Indonesia
--------------------------------------------------
Indonesia's Agriculture Ministry faced criticism Fri 6 Feb 2004 for
allowing an unaccredited and allegedly ineffective bird flu vaccine
imported from China to enter the country.
The Kompas daily quoted virologist Marten Malole as saying the imported
vaccine for chickens could potentially worsen Indonesia's avian flu epidemic.
"The vaccine producer in China has never received accreditation from the
OIE," he said, referring to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE). "We are so worried about that, because it could trigger a new
epidemic with another subtype (of virus)."

[The OIE does not render accreditation to vaccine producers. Most nations
have a range of official acts that regulate the sale and use of veterinary
biologicals, including vaccines. Almost all of these acts stipulate
'minimum requirements' for quality, safety, and efficacy of veterinary
biologicals (mostly vaccines), to be tested at independent laboratories,
usually under State supervision. These acts and tests may differ from one
country to another, and they involve costs and restrictions for producers,
users, and testers. Useful guidelines for the production and testing of
veterinary vaccines can be found in OIE's Manual of Standards, Diagnostic
Tests and Vaccines, which is available at OIE's internet web-site. Chapter
2.1.14. of the Manual addresses Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI);
it can be seen at:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00035.htm>.
Vaccine producers are expected to be able to present to their customers
detailed protocols on their products; such protocols should always include
details on the tests each batch has undergone, especially for sterility,
safety, and potency (efficacy). - Mod.AS]

Indonesian government approved vaccine import from China
-------------------------------------------------
According to an animal health official in the Department of Agriculture,
the Indonesian government authorized the importation of 30 million avian
influenza poultry vaccine doses from China. Several newspapers have cited
on Thursday a source in Biofarma [a vaccine and sera manufacturer, Bandung,
Indonesia] who admitted the company had already imported 3.5 million
vaccine doses produced in China.
The government is scheduled to import 184 million vaccine doses from
various sources worldwide. In early January 2004, they permitted the
imports of vaccine only from OIE-designated [see comment above] vaccine
manufacturers in Europe, including [companies in] Holland, France, and
Germany. While the need in Indonesia is 120 million doses per month, the
local production capacity in Indonesia is currently 47 million doses per
month. During the coming 6-month period -- until 31 Jul 2004 -- the
Indonesian government will import 184 million vaccine doses from China and
the rest of the world.

The Japanese government has decided to import 3.2 million doses of avian
flu vaccines from Mexico and stockpile them. They will pay 27 million yen
(USD 26 000).
[The Mexican vaccine is reportedly an inactivated, oil-emulsion H5N2
vaccine. - Mod.AS]

[Out of the 10 Asian countries currently declared infected with HPAI, only
2 officially include vaccination within their control measures: China
("vaccination within a 5-km radius of the outbreaks and suspected outbreaks
on a compulsory basis") and Indonesia ("vaccination", no further
details). China's annual reports to the OIE indicate that HPAI
vaccinations have been applied there since 2002.
According to information included in posting 20040125.0298, an A H5N2)
virus strain which was causing (mild) illness among poultry in Taiwan was
found to be closely genetically related to a vaccine strain "that is widely
used for poultry in Hong Kong and China". Further details and verification
of these data will be helpful.
Details on the vaccine used in China -- with special reference to the virus
strains used and to the safety and potency testing procedures applied --
will be useful. - Mod.AS]
