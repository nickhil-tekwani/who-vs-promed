Sporadic prevalence of _Escherichia coli_ PT 32
-----------------------------------------------
Ontario's top medical watchdog issued an alert Friday about a rare strain
of _Escherichia coli_ that has made 11 people in the province ill and has
left some in hospital. Officials are still investigating why people from
Ottawa to Windsor have been infected by a type of _E. coli_ O157:H7
bacterium since June. In the meantime, Ontario's chief medical officer of
health, Colin D'Cunha, is warning people to wash their hands thoroughly and
to take normal precautions against bacteria in the kitchen.
The bacteria, known as _E. coli_ O157:H7 phage type 32, causes bloody
diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. These symptoms are not [necessarily -
mod.SH severe, but between 2 per cent and 7 per cent of infections result
in a disease of the kidneys and circulatory system. The same _E. coli_
bacteria sickened 70 people in Michigan and Virginia in the summer of 1997.
Half were put in hospital, but none died. In that incident, all the victims
had eaten alfalfa sprouts from the same source.
A Health Ministry spokesman said he could not discuss individual cases in
Ontario, but said that many of them [had returned home from hospital and
none had died. They range in age from 6 to 71 years, and live in Ottawa,
Kingston, Simcoe County, Toronto, York Region, London-Middlesex, and
Windsor. Dr D'Cunha has also issued bulletins to the province's doctors and
hospitals asking for help with _E. coli_ monitoring.

[This is an alert for vigilance and a request for assistance with
foodborne-disease monitoring. A common source of these infections has
apparently not been identified to date. - Mod.ES
