Screwworm case confirmed--ranchers, hunters urged to check animals
NEWS RELEASE For Immediate Release 11/27/98

Texas Animal Health Commission
Terry Beals, DVM, Executive Director

Screwworm Case Confirmed...Ranchers, Hunters Urged to Check Animals
It took only one tiny fly larvae this fall to shake up West Texas and put
ranchers around the state on high alert, watching for flesh-eating
screwworm, a pest that has been officially eradicated from the U.S. and
Mexico. Still uncertain when or where this pest entered the country, state
and federal livestock health officials are urging ranchers and hunters to
check animals for maggots that may have burrowed into sores or wounds.
According to the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's
livestock health regulatory agency, one of nine suspicious maggots
submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames,
Iowa, was confirmed to be a screwworm larvae. The rancher, near Rocksprings
in Edwards County, collected the maggots in late October from an Angora
goat that had suffered a shearing wound.
Ranchers, hunters, or anyone handling livestock or wildlife would check
animals and pets closely and call us immediately if there are any maggots
or larvae in wounds," said Dr. Terry Beals, TAHC executive director and
state veterinarian. "A TAHC or USDA field specialist will go to the ranch
or hunting lease to pick up the larvae for laboratory submission and gather
information for the investigation."
"If we find another screwworm larvae in the state, the USDA's Emergency
Services will make sterile screwworm fly drops over the affected area,"
said Dr. Beals. He explained that sterile screwworms would mate but produce
no offspring, thus eradicating the pest. This procedure has been used since
the mid-1970s in the successful screwworm eradication programs in the U.S.
and Mexico.
We are collecting preliminary information about airport facilities in the
area, storage space and costs, in case another larvae is found. Within 24
hours, the USDA could have sterile screw-worms shipped from the plant in
Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, Mexico, the world's only sterile screwworm
production facility," he said.
Field staff from the TAHC and USDA have distributed nearly 2,400 screwworm
submission kits to veterinarians, county agents, livestock markets, and
feed stores. The kits consist of a cardboard tube containing a test tube
filled with a holding solution and small plastic bags for maggot
collection. Dr. Beals said maggots can also be placed in alcohol in a glass
jar, medicine bottle or film canister for safekeeping until a TAHC or USDA
staff member arrives. Animals infested with the larvae should be held in a
pen or barn, so they may be inspected.
"Please call the TAHC or USDA immediately if maggots or larvae are
detected," said Dr. Beals. "We must act quickly if another screwworm larvae
is found to prevent further spread." The TAHC Lampasas office may be
reached at 1-800-658-6642, the TAHC Beeville office at 1-800-658-6570, or
the Austin TAHC headquarters may be called at 1-800-550-824 2.
