Brown rot in water samples
--------------------------
As part of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's
ongoing testing survey for potato brown rot disease, the Department
has recently detected brown rot in water samples taken at 2 potato
merchants' premises. The brown rot annual water survey involves the
taking of samples of wastewater at merchants' premises and this has
resulted in 2 positive findings recently being reported.

All samples taken from potato stocks on the premises involved have
been tested and proved negative. This would indicate that infected
material had passed through the premises in the recent past. The
premises themselves have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected as
required by the Department and upgrading of their water treatment
systems is being put in place.

The management of the disease is governed by EU legislation, which is
being strictly followed by the Department in this case. The
Department is working closely with the potato industry to ensure that
all appropriate action is being taken to control the situation.

Investigations are still ongoing but to date there is nothing to
indicate any connection between these findings and last years' [2007]
brown rot outbreak or other previous findings.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 and is widely distributed in warm
temperate areas. Symptoms include internal staining and rotting of
tubers, wilting and death of plants and may result in substantial
yield losses. However, there may also be latent infections. The
pathogen can survive in potato tubers during storage posing a high
risk for introduction of the pathogen to new areas. Tomato and other
solanaceous crops are also susceptible.

The pathogen is spread by mechanical means (including insects),
contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed
potatoes), soil, and water. Some weeds and unharvested potato plants
may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Disease management is difficult relying mostly on exclusion from new
areas. Some cultural methods and limited genetic resistance may be
used. Brown rot of potato was reported for the 1st time in Ireland in
2007 (for this report and more information on the disease see
ProMED-mail post no. 20071022.3438).

_R. solanacearum_ has been classified into various races and biovars
affecting more than 200 plant species including major crops. Races 2
and 3 have been placed on the quarantine lists of the European Plant
Protection Organisation (EPPO).
