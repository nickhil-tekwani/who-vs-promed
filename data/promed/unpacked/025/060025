A virus that can cause disease in largemouth bass has now been identified in otherwise apparently healthy northern snakeheads taken from 2 Potomac River tributaries in Virginia, the US Geological Survey announced today [13 Aug 2013].

This is the 1st time that the pathogen, known as largemouth bass virus, has been reported in northern snakeheads. The virus has been found in bass, sunfish, and other fish species, but largemouth bass are the only species known to develop disease from it.

While the significance of this finding is not yet known, the study's lead author, USGS research biologist Luke Iwanowicz, said it raises the possibility that snakeheads could be reservoirs of this virus and capable of transmitting it to bass populations in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The habitat of the 2 species overlaps, which may favor transmission of the virus.

Little is known about pathogens in northern snakeheads that inhabit US waters. This study, done in cooperation with the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, is a preliminary survey of introduced pathogens from northern snakeheads living in Virginia waters.

Snakeheads are an invasive, predatory fish species found in the Maryland and Virginia parts of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, in Florida, North Carolina, and New England. Efforts to eradicate or control the spread of this invasive fish have been unsuccessful so far, and scientists predict that the northern snakehead is likely to increase its present range.

"The long-term and population-level effects of largemouth bass virus on bass inhabiting these rivers are unknown," said Iwanowicz.

The disease makes some largemouth bass unable to submerge, causing them to float on the surface of the water. There are no other obvious signs directly resulting from this virus.

Large-scale fish kills have occurred in some infected largemouth bass populations, while others appear to be healthy. It is not known how the virus is transmitted or how disease is activated. Genetic and other differences in the virus; environmental stress from pollution, high water temperatures, and co-infections; in addition to host-related factors contribute to the outcome for infected largemouth bass.

The origin of largemouth bass virus is uncertain. The 1st report of it in the US was in 1991 in Florida. It has since been reported throughout the eastern, southern, and midwestern US. In 2001, most Virginia waters tested with no or very low infection rates, but by August 2011, the virus was found in all 16 bodies of water tested statewide and major rivers except the tidal James River.

Largemouth bass virus is a Ranavirus, a group of viruses that are known to cause lethal diseases in amphibians and are associated with significant population declines.

[Largemouth bass virus (family Iridoviridae) is a pathogen that has become widely distributed throughout the southeastern and midwestern United States, and is known to contribute to high morbidity and mortality in wild largemouth bass (_Micropterus salmoides_; see picture at http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/Fish/Largemouth%20Bass/M_salmodies.jpg).

The virus has been associated with large-scale largemouth bass fish kills, particularly at warmer water temperatures. Adult largemouth bass are particularly susceptible. Fish become infected either through the water or by consuming infected prey. Infected fish lose equilibrium and tend to float near the surface.

Snakeheads (Perciformes: Channidae) are native to Africa and Asia. They have become invasive species in many parts of the world, causing ecological damage because they are top-level predators. Northern snakeheads (_Channa argus_; see picture at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Snakehead_-_Channa_argus_2.jpg) became permanently established in the Potomac River in 2004. - Mod.PMB
