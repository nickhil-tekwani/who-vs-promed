The European Surveillance Scheme for Travel Associated Legionnaires'
Disease, established in 1987 and coordinated by the Public Health
Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in London,
reports on cases of travel associated legionnaires' disease to member
states and suspected countries of infection. The scheme has the following
data on cases reported as traveling to India: 1990: 1, 1995: 3, 1996: 5,
1997: 2 cases. All cases were males, aged 44 - 65, 7 confirmed (diagnosis
by culture or serology four fold rise in antibody titre), 3 presumptive
(diagnosis by serology single high antibody titre and detection of urinary
antigen). No deaths have been reported.
One cluster (two or more cases with onset in the same six months, who
stayed at the same place of accommodation) was reported in April 1995 (2
cases) for the Town of Varanasi, and two separate links (two or more cases
who stayed at the same place of accommodation but with onset of symptoms
more than six months apart) have been recorded each involving 2 cases, in
Dehli 1995 and Udaipur 1996.
With regards to the case reported to ProMED-mail, we have had one case in
1995, with travel to hotels in both Jhodpur and Udaipur. We would
appreciate further information on the nationality of the reported case, and
where possible, the hotel names in order to check them against the EWGLI
database.
