One million doses of expired vaccine found
---------------------------------------
Veterinary doctors in Jizan have discovered a million doses of vaccine
against Rift Valley Fever (RVF) that expired a year ago [2003], according
to the Arabic daily Okaz.
These sources said that the vaccines had been stored in a warehouse of the
agricultural ministry branch of the region since last year [2003]. The
branch sent a report of the situation to the ministry but has received no
response so far. The veterinary doctors have stopped supplying these
vaccinations to cattle owners.
RVF -- which usually affects livestock -- can strike human beings, leading
to the victims suffering swollen brains and burst arteries. In 2000, RVF
appeared for the 1st time outside Africa, with an outbreak in Saudi Arabia
and Yemen. A total of 124 people, out of 884 infected, died in that
epidemic in Jizan, which took months to subdue. In early September [2004],
the agriculture ministry announced that RVF had broken out again in Jizan,
though [only] a few cases of livestock deaths have occurred since.
Sources said that the recent announcement of 5 heads of cattle coming down
with the dreaded disease, in Abu Areesh and Al-Arida, was based on a false
report given by the agricultural branch of Jizan. The sources said that RVF
had not hit the farms of the region.
RVF is transmitted from animals to humans by mosquito bite, or, by exposure
to infected animal tissues. At least 30 species of mosquitoes are capable
of carrying it from cattle or sheep to humans.

[Conflicts between national agriculture and health authorities are not
uncommon; it seems that Saudi Arabia is not an exception.
It could have been easier to assess the significance of the news about the
expired RVF vaccine if information about the vaccination policy, and the
number of annual vaccinations per species (sheep, goats, cattle), had been
available. Unfortunately, this is not the case: Saudi Arabia's annual
reports to the OIE for the years which followed the RVF outbreak there
(September 2000 - March 2001), are available for 2000 through 2002, but,
they do not include any data about RVF vaccinations (though such
information is always expected). Thus far, no Saudi animal disease annual
report for 2003 is available.
The status of RVF in Saudi Arabia remains as "suspected." - Mod.AS]
