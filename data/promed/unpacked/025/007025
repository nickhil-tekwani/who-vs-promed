Kentucky Confirms 3rd Equine WNV Case for 2016
----------------------------------------------
West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes.

The Kentucky State Veterinarian's office has announced that a horse from Bourbon County has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). This is the 3rd equine WNV case confirmed in the commonwealth this year [2016].

In a statement Kentucky Equine Programs manager E.S. "Rusty" Ford said both cases were confirmed 22 Sep 2016.

The 3-year-old Standardbred mare with no WNV vaccination history began showing signs of disease on 18 Sep 2016, including acute lethargy, general weakness and ataxia (incoordination), and mild muscle fasciculation (twitching) in neck and chest area. She was hospitalized on 20 Sep 2016, where she continues to receive supportive care. Ford said she is reported to be in stable condition as of 22 Sep 2016.

Arizona -- On 21 Sep 2016 the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) said a horse in Cochise County tested positive for WNV, the 1st case in Arizona for 2016.

"The affected horse is a 4-year old Quarter Horse gelding with no history of vaccination for WNV," the EDCC said. "The horse exhibited advancing medical signs and was euthanized."

West Virginia -- A 6-year-old Quarter Horse mare from Mineral County was diagnosed with WNV after showing severe, acute neurologic signs, but is still alive, the EDCC said. Her vaccination status is unknown.

West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flu-like signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[West Nile virus is transmitted through mosquitoes. It is preventable by a vaccine, usually given in combination with the vaccine against eastern equine encephalitis virus, which is also transmitted by mosquitoes.
