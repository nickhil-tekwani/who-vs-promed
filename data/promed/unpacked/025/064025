Because of the increasing trend of Japanese encephalitis cases in the country, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health issued a warning about the disease on 27 Jun [2014].

The Ministry asked people to practice environmental hygiene to eliminate breeding of mosquitoes [which carry the virus]. Cattle rearing farms should be removed far from houses. People should use mosquito nets and not let children play near cattle farms. When a child has a high fever, they should be taken to a medical clinic for timely treatment.

The Ministry said vaccination against Japanese encephalitis [virus infections] is one of the effective preventative measures.

Tran Dac Phu, head of the Department of Preventive Medicine, said that Japanese encephalitis is a disease [virus] spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms usually take 5-15 days to develop and include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and difficulty moving. Encephalitis occurs mainly in young children under 15 years old.

At present, the Ministry is urging local health authorities to administer vaccination against Japanese encephalitis for children.

As the disease develops complicatedly, Health Minister Nguyen Thi Kim Tien made an unscheduled visit to the Central Children Hospital in Hanoi. Do Thien Hai, deputy chief of the hospital's Infectious Disease Ward, said that since the beginning of the year, the hospital admitted 130 cases of Japanese encephalitis [virus infection]; 6 of them had to put on breathing machines.

In 2013, Japanese encephalitis cases accounted for 8 per cent of total encephalitis cases; this year [2014] the proportion is up to 30 per cent.

Accordingly, Health Minister Nguyen Thi Kim Tien urged the Hospital to coordinate with the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology and the ministry's Department of Medical Examination and Treatment to provide training courses on prevention.

These facilities have to take samples from districts for testing to verify the cause of increasing cases of Japanese encephalitis.

Viet Nam is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV]. As indicated in a GIDEON summary of the disease posted on 18 Jun 2010 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20100618.2051), Japanese encephalitis was 1st reported in Viet Nam in 1960. Most cases of Japanese encephalitis in Viet Nam occur in the south during the rainy and early dry season; and in the north during late summer and autumn. Nationally, 73 per cent of the population lives in areas of risk. The country maintains a routine vaccination program for Japanese encephalitis, but apparently some children are not covered. Perhaps these recent cases mentioned above will result in intensification of the vaccination program, as the transmission season is occurring currently in the south and will be increasing in the north of the country in coming weeks. - Mod.TY
