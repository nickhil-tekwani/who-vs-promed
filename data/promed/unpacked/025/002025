Nearly 2 weeks after a 38-week pregnant woman was diagnosed with a _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS) issued a warning Thursday, 15 Mar 2012, advising the public not to eat any cheese products produced by El Ranchero del Sur of South River, NJ.

The woman was diagnosed with the potentially fatal infection on 2 Mar 2012 at a New Brunswick hospital.

The Middlesex County Health Department performed an investigation on her infection and samples of cheese products were analyzed by the NJDHSS Public Health Environmental and Agricultural labs, who confirmed the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in a sample of Los Corrales Queso Fresco Fresh Cheese and Banana Leaf code dated 03/16/12. El Ranchero del Sur agreed to a voluntary recall its products and to close its production plant while the investigation is in progress.

According to the NJDHSS health alert, El Ranchero del Sur cheese products can be found primarily in Mexican and Latin American grocery stores, restaurants, and other Hispanic food establishments under the name brands El Ranchero, Los Corrales, and Carnes Don Beto with the plant number 34-0013669 marked on the label. All products are 14 ounces in weight except for the Queso Hebra Oaxaca String Cheese ball in 10 pound packages.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is a bacterium that is normally found in the environment and has been found in animals, birds and vegetation. It can be found in raw foods and in processed foods that get contaminated after processing. Some of the most common foods that are associated with listeriosis are raw milk, soft cheeses, vegetables, and many ready to eat meats like hot dogs, deli meats and pates. Those at greatest risk of serious listeriosis include pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and adults with weakened immune systems.

Most healthy persons show no symptoms of this disease. Initial symptoms of food-borne listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, fatigue and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Primarily in high risk groups but occasionally in healthy adults, the infection can spread to the blood and central nervous system where it can cause sepsis and meningitis.

Due to a naturally depressed immune system, pregnant women are about 20 times more likely than other healthy adults to contract this disease. Though many women may only experience mild flu-like symptoms, infections during pregnancy can have devastating consequences to the fetus which include stillbirth or miscarriage, premature delivery and serious infections in the newborn.

[The following is an excellent primer from the USA FDA that overviews the relationship of pregnancy and infection with _Listeria monocytogenes_
http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~pregnant/whillist.html:

"What is _Listeria monocytogenes_?
It's a harmful bacterium that can be found in refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods (meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy (unpasteurized milk and milk products or foods made with unpasteurized milk)) and in soil. Animals can carry this bacterium without appearing ill, and thus, it can be found in foods made from animals. _L. monocytogenes_ is unusual because it can grow at refrigerator temperatures where most other foodborne bacteria do not. When eaten, it may cause listeriosis, an illness to which pregnant women and their unborn children are very susceptible.

"How could I get listeriosis?"
By eating ready-to-eat meats, poultry, seafood, and dairy products that are contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_. You can also get listeriosis by eating contaminated foods processed or packaged in unsanitary conditions or by eating vegetables that are contaminated from the soil or from manure used as fertilizer.

"How could listeriosis affect me?"
The symptoms can take a few days or even weeks to appear and may include fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea or upset stomach, headache, stiff neck, confusion, and loss of balance. In more serious cases, listeriosis could also lead to the mother's death. Most of the time, pregnant women who are infected with listeriosis don't feel sick. However, they can pass the infection to their unborn babies without even knowing it. That's why prevention of listeriosis is very important. In any case, if you experience any of the above symptoms, see your doctor or health-care provider immediately. Pregnant women are about 20 times more likely to get listeriosis than other healthy adults, and an estimated 1/3rd of all Listeria cases occur in pregnant women.

"How could listeriosis affect my baby?"
During the 1st trimester of pregnancy, listeriosis may cause miscarriage. As the pregnancy progresses to the 3rd trimester, the mother is more at risk. Listeriosis can also lead to premature labor, the delivery of a low-birth-weight infant, or infant death. Fetuses who suffer a late infection may develop a wide range of health problems, including mental retardation, paralysis, seizures, blindness, or impairments of the brain, heart or kidney. In newborns, _L. monocytogenes_ can cause blood infections and meningitis.

"Listeriosis and Pregnant Hispanic Women"
Studies show that pregnant Hispanic women may have a higher incidence of listeriosis than pregnant non-Hispanic women. This is most likely because they might make and eat homemade soft cheese and other traditional foods made from unpasteurized milk. "Queso fresco" -- a traditional homemade cheese, prepared from unpasteurized milk and widely consumed by Hispanics -- has led to miscarriages, death of newborns, and premature delivery caused by _L. monocytogenes_. To prevent the risk of listeriosis, Hispanic pregnant women should not eat homemade soft cheeses and other traditional foods made from unpasteurized milk. Like all other pregnant women, they should follow the food safety precautions outlined below.

"How can I prevent listeriosis?"
The good news is that listeriosis can be prevented! Here's how:
- Your refrigerator should register at 40 F (4 C) or below and the freezer at 0 F (-18 C). Place a refrigerator thermometer in the refrigerator, and check the temperature periodically. During the automatic defrost cycle, the temperature may register slightly higher than 40 F. This is okay.
- Refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared food, and leftovers within 2 hours of eating or preparation. Follow the 2-Hour Rule: Discard food that has been left out at room temperature for longer than 2 hours. When temperatures are above 90 F (32 C), discard food after one hour.
- Use ready-to-eat, perishable foods, such as dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and produce, as soon as possible.

***Don't eat:
- Hot dogs and luncheon meats unless they're reheated until steaming hot.
- Soft cheeses like Feta, Brie, and Camembert, "blue-veined cheeses," or "queso blanco," "queso fresco," or Panela unless they're made with pasteurized milk; Make sure the label says, "made with pasteurized milk"
- refrigerated pates or meat spreads
- refrigerated smoked seafood -- unless it's in a cooked dish, such as a casserole (Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod, tuna, or mackerel is most often labeled as "nova-style," "lox," "kippered," "smoked," or "jerky." These types of fish are found in the refrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and delicatessens.)
- Raw (unpasteurized) milk or foods that contain unpasteurized milk

It's okay to eat:
- Canned or shelf-stable (able to be stored unrefrigerated on the shelf) pates and meat spreads.
- Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood.
- Pasteurized milk or foods that contain pasteurized milk." - Mod.LL]
