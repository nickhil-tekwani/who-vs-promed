Parasite discovered
----------------------
Officers from the Shanghai Entry and Exit Quarantine and Inspection
Bureau said on 19 Feb 2003 that they found _Radopholus similis_ a
plant parasite, from a batch of flowers imported from the
Netherlands-based Hilverda Co. The Bureau has suspended import of
flowers and seedlings in species of the Calathea Zebra plant
(_Calathea zebrina_) and pineapple from the Dutch company, while
allowing imports of tulips. Officers also reminded local residents
travelling abroad not to bring vegetable or flowers back to the city,
as they may carry pests and pose a risk to local plants and crops.

[Although parasitic nematodes affecting ornamental flowers and
pineapple are not in the purview of ProMED-Plant, this report is of
significance because _Radopholus similis_, a major pathogen of banana
and citrus in the tropics, was found on these plants, which had been
imported into China from the Netherlands. _Radopholus similis_[ Rs]
(burrowing nematode or banana-root nematode) is found worldwide in
tropical and sub-tropical regions wherever banana is found. It is
probably the most important nematode pest on fruit crops (especially
citrus and banana) in the tropics. It also infests citrus, and in
Hawaii it attacks sugarcane. Pathogenic races of the pathogen are
known. The banana race infests banana but not citrus, and the citrus
race infests both banana and citrus.
The interception illustrated here is a good example of the need for
constant vigilance on the part of quarantine officials to prevent the
spread of harmful agricultural pests into production areas that are
free of the pest.
