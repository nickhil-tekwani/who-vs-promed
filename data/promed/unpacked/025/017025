******[ProMED-mail would not be online today if it had not been for the
invaluable
help we received from SatelLife in our formative years. We recently left
SatelLife
for the International Society for Infectious Diseases, but are concerned to
hear about the recent challenge to SatelLife & their HealthNet operations
described below. We urge concerned readers to contact Holly Ladd with
offers of help in their fight for survival - Mod.JW]******

Dear Colleagues:
SatelLife - HealthNet is in a fight for its life and its identity. A
California HMO that goes by the name of HealthNet has decided to invest $20
million to develop their internet business. And we, along with a lot of
other small organizations, are in their way. We decided to stand firm and
defend our use of the name HealthNet to define our electronic network of
health workers around the globe. We believe that we can win this fight on
the merits, and that we must win this fight.
We need help. People need to know about this case and need to express
their opinions to the HMO and to others who seek to dominate the Internet
for commercial purposes and the expense of humanitarian work. We also need
financial help to sustain the legal case and keep our programs operating at
the same time. Please feel free to contact me if you have questions about
this case or about our work.
Sincerely,
Holly Ladd
Executive Director
SatelLife (www.healthnet.org)

Group fight for Internet name - HMO takes on tiny health network By Karen
Hsu, Globe Correspondent, 11/26/99
The fight pits a tiny nonprofit Watertown agency that helps doctors working
in the Third World against the mighty muscle of a California HMO.
They are battling over an Internet address - healthnet.org - that the
agency calls a lifeline to doctors in rural places overseas, and the HMO
says it needs to serve its 2.2 million members. The HMO, Health Net in
California, already has two Web sites using similar names, healthnet.com
and healthnet.net. Now it wants to claim healthnet.org as well.
Trouble is, that name is owned by SatelLife, founded in 1985 by Nobel Prize
winner and cardiologist Dr. Bernard Lown of Newton. It uses a low-cost
e-mail network to connect health care workers in rural clinics and
hospitals around the globe. Last week, SatelLife filed an action in federal
court in Boston to preserve its Internet name, healthnet.org, two days
before the company overseeing Internet name rights would have frozen
SatelLife's healthnet.org moniker.
Holly Ladd, executive director of SatelLife, said it has operated the
information network under the name HealthNet for at least a decade, and the
health care providers it serves in the developing world consider it their
''lifeline.'' About 38,000 pieces of e-mail pass through its support
operations in 164 countries every day.
"It has taken us a decade to build our reputation as an unbiased source of
health information. It's not something we can walk away from and think
there is no impact," Ladd said. As for the Health Net HMO, its members can
use the Web site to access benefits information, search for doctors
available through the network, and receive general health information.
Problems arise with similar Web site names because the Internet breaks down
geographic boundaries, noted Dan Niccum, vice president of public affairs
at Health Net. "A California consumer can look up on the Internet for
health benefits and could end up with a site on information for Third World
countries," Niccum said.
Niccum suggests that SatelLife switch to healthnetwork.org, but Ladd said
such a name switch would be costly.
If SatelLife had done a trademark search when it first started using the
name HealthNet for its e-mail network, Niccum said, the nonprofit would
have found that the name had already been registered as a trademark by the
HMO in 1981. Niccum said the California HMO has undertaken dozens of
efforts to get the many other entities using ''healthnet'' in their names
or e-mail addresses to change their name, and in almost all cases, the
companies have changed the name. "The motives and work by SatelLife are
admirable, but unfortunately they are violating our trademark in using
healthnet in their domain name," Niccum said.
In September, federal judge Douglas P. Woodlock in Boston ruled that toy
maker Hasbro Inc.'s ownership of the trademark ''Clue'' for its board game
does not automatically entitle it to take away tiny Colorado-based Clue
Computing's Internet address ''clue.com,'' and that competing use of the
domain name does not dilute Hasbro's trademark. In the decision, Woodlock
wrote, ''Holders of a famous mark are not automatically entitled to use
that mark as their domain name; trademark law does not support such a
monopoly.''
Jonathan Zittrain, a lecturer in cyberlaw at Harvard and executive director
of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said he thinks the
California HMO has a weak case. But the real problem, he said, is that
some such disputes still have to be decided by the court, and that is the
last thing a small nonprofit needs.
Jessica Litman, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who
specializes in trademark and Internet law, agreed that Health Net is
unlikely to win.
''Trademark law has never given trademark owners exclusive right to use
the word on the Internet,'' said Litman.

NB: SatelLife, through our lawyers asked for a meeting with Health Net in
October. They refused to meet with us. The only compromise that they
offered was that we give them our domain name and that then they would see
if there was something that they could do for us. SatelLife has been eager
to find a resolution short of litigation. Health Net has been unwilling
to participate in a search for a resolution.
NB2: healthnetwork.org is already owned by another non-profit. HL
