Vibrio vulnificus - Korea (South Cholla): alert 20000530.0865
Date: Tue 22 May 2001

The Health and Welfare Ministry yesterday issued a warning against
[infection with _Vibrio vulnificus_, a deadly disease which causes severe
skin decay. Ministry officials said that they issued the warning as the
bacterium was discovered in sea water collected along the coastal regions
of South Jeolla Province on Saturday [19 May.
_Vibrio vulnificus_ infections generally occur between June and October
among residents in coastal areas. When infected, patients show symptoms of
high fever, stomach aches, vomiting, and diarrhea. Within 36 hours, they
begin developing spots and blisters that lead to skin decay. Infection is
fatal in 40 to 50 per cent of cases.
Those who suffer from diabetes, alcoholism, or chronic illnesses of the
liver, stomach, and kidney problems are in the highest risk group, the
ministry said. To prevent infection, officials warned people of the risks
of eating seafood that is not fully cooked. They also advised against
activities such as swimming and cleaning fish while nursing an open wound.
