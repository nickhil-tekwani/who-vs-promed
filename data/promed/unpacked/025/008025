3 women contract dengue, says health secretary
----------------------------------------------
3 women living in the Cajeme and Etchojoa communities, who work at their
households, have been infected with the dengue virus in their own homes.
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes were found in the backyards of the homes of
these women. This vector is responsible for human-to-human transmission of
the dengue virus. One of the 3 women, who lives in Ciudad Obregon,
developed the hemorrhagic form of the disease after being stricken by the
infection for a 2nd time. Fortunately, she recovered. The 2 other women
also recovered uneventfully and only developed the so-called classic
symptoms, such as intense bone pain, eye pain, headache and joint pain,
sudden onset of fever, malaise, and a mild rash.
In addition to these 3 women, there are now 7 confirmed dengue cases in
Sonora this year [2005], 3 of them having had the hemorrhagic form of the
disease. Out of these 3 last cases, 2 recovered uneventfully, but one
person from the Cobachi community, La Colorada city council, died from the
disease.
Dengue, which is a disease that originated in Africa, appeared in Mexico in
1981. Since then, many people have acquired the infection, and there are
more and more complications for the population. However, as Health
Secretary Raymundo Lopez stated, it is not the mosquito itself that is the
causative agent of the epidemics, but the reluctance of the people of
Sonora to maintain clean backyards.
In the central, coastal and southern Sonora regions, the Health Secretariat
performed entomological studies, which have reported the presence of both
larvae and adult forms of _Aedes aegypti_.
Enforcement of rubbish elimination campaign:
There are also another 2 new dengue cases. The Health Secretariat declared
an alert for the Villa Bonita and Libertad communities, where the affected
women live. The 2 cases of hemorrhagic and classic dengue were detected in
the Villa Bonita and Libertad communities, and the health Secretariat
decreed an alert for these 2 places.
Mr Valente Parra-Dominguez, chief of Sanitary Authority No. 4, stated that,
as a result of the alert, no other positive case has been detected. One
woman affected in Villa Bonita is 35 years old, and the one from Libertad
is 58 years old. An urgent meeting with Mr. Felix Holguin, President of the
City Council, took place, and it was proposed to send a truck to the Health
Center in order to enforce rubbish elimination. Such actions have already
been taking place both in Libertad and in Villa Bonita, and they will
continue. He also stated that abate spraying and fumigation will be
performed in the communities where dengue has been detected, as well as in
places where there are suspected cases. Out of 37 suspected cases analyzed
until now, 3 cases have reported positive, the 1st one in Tobarito
precinct, an 11-year-old child. For the past 10 days, the results of tests
performed for 10 suspected cases revealed that 8 of them were negative for
dengue. Mr. Parra-Dominguez emphasized that the inspections to enforce
keeping clean backyards in every household will be continued.

[With warmer weather approaching the northern hemisphere, mosquitoborne
dengue infections are increasingly reported in endemic areas, such as
Sonora, Mexico. The campaign of eliminating the breeding grounds of the
arthropod vector _St. aegypti_ [formerly known as _Ae. aegypti_] by the
local authorities is both timely and effective. Other measures, such as
avoiding mosquito bites by wearing protective clothing and/or using insect
repellents during the cool hours of the day, such as the hours between dusk
and dawn when the mosquitoes are most active, should be taken. Public
education programs to increase public awareness should be imposed in Sonora
before and during the dengue season by local officials and schools. - Mod.RY]

[2] Somalia (Mogadishu): suspected

Suspected dengue fever outbreak hits Somalia
--------------------------------------------
A suspected outbreak of dengue fever has hit the Somali capital of
Mogadishu, medical workers said on Wednesday. Abdi Ibrahim Jiya, a doctor
in Mogadishu, said he believes the disease is dengue, but that doctors have
been unable to confirm that because the lawless capital lacks the necessary
laboratory equipment. He said the infection has been circulating in
Mogadishu for 3 months.
Dr Nageye Ahmed, a Canada-based pediatrician who is visiting relatives,
also said he believes the disease is dengue, and that it appears widespread
in Mogadishu. Symptoms include high fever, joint pain, headache and vomiting.
4 people have died of the fever, according to their relatives and doctors.
Dengue is rarely fatal when properly treated. Dengue is a mosquitoborne
infection that is found in tropical and subtropical regions around the
world, mainly in urban and semi-urban areas. A potentially lethal
complication, dengue haemorrhagic fever, kills about 2.5 per cent of those
infected, but fatality rates can exceed 20 percent if victims do not
receive proper treatment, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
There are 4 distinct, but closely related, viruses that cause dengue.
Recovery from infection by one provides lifelong immunity against that
variant, but provides only partial and transient protection against
subsequent infection by the other 3, according to WHO.

[A report of a suspected dengue fever outbreak in a country that has been
suffering from continuous civil war and poverty for more than a decade and
still pretty much in a lawless state beyond imagination, sounds to be
largely understated. Both Dr Abdi Ibrahim Jiya and Dr Nageye Ahmed have
witnessed and suspected that an outbreak of dengue fever has been rampant
in the capital for a minimum of 3 months. Obviously there is a severe
shortage of diagnostic facilities and absence of basic public health
infrastructure. It seems rather hopeless and impractical to deal with the
outbreak without prior solution of the political and the social dilemma.
The problem is indeed not simple at all. Any insightful and realistic
information would be appreciated. - Mod.RY]

Imported dengue fever case confirmed
------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed an imported case of Dengue
fever involving a 31 year old man, bringing this year's total to 5 -- all
imported. The patient travelled to Indonesia from March 12 to 27 and
developed fever, shivering, muscle pain and bone pain on March 27. He was
admitted to a private hospital on March 28 and was discharged on April 4.
His family members have not developed any symptoms.
To avoid mosquito bites:
* Put all used cans and bottles into dustbins with covers;
* Change water for plants at least once a week, leaving no water in the
saucers underneath flower pots;
* Cover tightly all water containers, wells and water storage tanks; and
* Keep all drains free from blockage.
Travellers should take the following preventive measures:
* Wear long-sleeved tops and trousers;
* Use insect repellent over the exposed parts of the body; and
* Use mosquito screens or nets when rooms are not air-conditioned.
Anyone feeling unwell after returning from their trip should consult a
doctor as soon as possible and provide details of their travel to the doctor.
The latest information on dengue fever in other places can be found under
"Outbreak News" on the department's Hong Kong Travellers' Health Service
website.
Travel agents, tour guides and travellers can visit the website for news
and advice on preventive measures.
