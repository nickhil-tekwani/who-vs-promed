Referring to the article published in Al youm al-sab'ah [http://www1.youm7.com/News.asp?NewsID=726475&SecID=97&IssueID=0]:
We clarify that we vaccinated till now around 600 000 animals in 20 governorates, plus around 60 000 (booster doses) of locally manufactured FMDV SAT-2 vaccine. In parallel, we vaccinated with locally manufactured FMDV A and O serotypes [vaccines], and with locally manufactured RVF killed vaccine. Regarding the '3 day sickness' [Bovine ephemeral fever] vaccine: this is an optional [not compulsory] vaccination; locally produced.

All these vaccines are not given in the same time to the same animals; they are divided to different doses.

[We are most grateful to Dr Sohair Abd El Kader for her firsthand, authoritative information in response to our request for information in posting 20120714.1201987; an exemplary transparency.

It has now become apparent, to our understanding, that the newspaper 'Al youm al-sab'ah', in its referred newswire of 8 Jul 2012, addressed number of vaccine doses (1.7 million, SAT-2, O, A) rather than number of vaccinated animals (600 000, of which 60 000 have been re-vaccinated).

For convenience, ProMED-mail's said RFI is hereby copied:
"It will be interesting to note if the information on the inclusion of FMDV SAT-1 in the vaccine, as reflected from the above newswire, is accurate; if other FMD serotypes known to be present in Egypt (O and A) are included as well; and if the RVF vaccine (inactivated?) and BEF (Bovine ephemeral fever = 3-day sickness) vaccines are administered simultaneously/mixed in the same injections. It will be also interesting to note if FMD vaccinations cover small ruminants as well. - Mod.AS
