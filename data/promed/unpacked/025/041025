With only an average of a half-inch of rain total for July and August,
Quang Tri province is suffering what officials say is the worst drought in
90 years and has reported 10,200 dengue cases, most of them in the last
three months.
"It is very bad since we have to deal with two epidemics -- hunger and
dengue," Nguyen Ba Thang, 49, deputy chief of one commune in Vinh Lam, said
from a makeshift bed in the town meeting hall, which has been turned into a
dengue clinic.
Although it has eased in recent days, the outbreak of dengue has sucked out
even more of town's life. It reached epidemic proportions earlier this
month, with 121 cases reported in a nine-day stretch. So far, there have
been no fatalities.
