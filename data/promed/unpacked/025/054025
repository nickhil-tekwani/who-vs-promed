CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states to investigate 3 overlapping, multistate outbreaks of human salmonellosis linked to exposure to turtles or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat). The 1st is an outbreak of human _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Sandiego infections, the 2nd is an outbreak of human _S._ Pomona infections, and the 3rd is an outbreak of human _S._ Poona infections. These are rare types of salmonellae. The _S._ Sandiego and _S._ Pomona outbreaks have similar geographic distributions, with cases occurring in the Northeast and Southwest. The _S._ Poona outbreak has a slightly different geographic distribution, with cases occurring in the Midwest and Southwest. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of these outbreaks. In PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA "fingerprints" of salmonellae are obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.

Contact with reptiles (such as turtles, snakes, and lizards) and amphibians (such as frogs and toads) can be a source of human salmonellosis. Small turtles, with a shell length of less than 4 inches, are a well-known source, especially among young children. Because of this risk, the FDA has banned the sale and distribution of these turtles since 1975. Amphibians and reptiles can carry salmonellae and still appear healthy and clean. The bacilli are shed in their droppings and can easily contaminate their bodies and anything in areas where these animals live. Reptiles and amphibians that live in tanks or aquariums can contaminate the water with germs, which can spread to people.

_S._ Sandiego outbreak investigation
----------------------------
As of 26 Mar 2012, a total of 45 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Sandiego have been reported from 10 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (3), Georgia (1), Massachusetts (2), Maryland (5), New Jersey (5), New Mexico (3), New York (18), North Carolina (1), Pennsylvania (6), and Virginia (1).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 1 Sep 2011 and 16 Mar 2012. Infected individuals range in age from less than 1 year old to 86 years old, and 50 percent of ill persons are 9 years of age or younger. 58 percent of patients are female. Among the 25 patients with available information, 7 (28 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with turtles and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Nineteen (76 percent) of 25 ill persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Of the 13 ill persons who could recall the size of the turtles with which they had contact, 12 (92 percent) identified turtles less than 4 inches in size. Of the 6 ill persons who could recall the type of turtle with which they had contact, 5 (83 percent) identified red-eared slider turtles.

In February 2012, a sample of turtle tank water from an ill person's home in Pennsylvania yielded the outbreak strain.

_S._ Pomona Outbreak Investigation
--------------------------------
As of 26 Mar 2012, a total of 9 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Pomona have been reported from 8 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (2), Massachusetts (1), Maryland (1), New Jersey (1), New York (1), Pennsylvania (1), Texas (1), and Vermont (1).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 9 Dec 2011 and 6 Feb 2012. Infected individuals range in age from less than 1 year old to 90 years old, and 50 percent of ill persons are 4 years of age or younger. 75 percent of patients are female. Among the 8 patients with available information, 2 (25 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with turtles and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 5 (63 percent) of 8 ill persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Of the 2 ill persons who could recall the size of the turtles with which they had contact, both identified turtles less than 4 inches in size.

In January 2012, a sample of turtle tank water from the home of 2 ill persons in the same California household yielded the outbreak strain.

_S._ Poona Outbreak Investigation
--------------------------
As of 26 Mar 2012, a total of 12 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Poona have been reported from 7 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (2), California (3), Indiana (1), Kentucky (1), Michigan (1), New York (2), and Texas (2). [For a map of locations of cases and a table showing the latest case count, see http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/small-turtles-03-12/index.html. - Mod.MPP]

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 20 Oct 2011 and 18 Feb 2012. Infected individuals range in age from less than 1 year old to 70 years old, and 50 percent of ill persons are 4 years of age or younger. 67 percent of patients are female. Among the 7 patients with available information, 2 (29 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with turtles and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 9 (90 percent) of 10 ill persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Of the 5 ill persons who could recall the size of the turtles with which they had contact, 4 (80 percent) described turtles less than four inches in size. Of the 7 ill persons who could recall the type of turtle with which they had contact, all identified red-eared slider turtles.

[In 2008, CDC reported on an ongoing outbreak of _S._ Paratyphi B var. Java (CDC: _Salmonella_ Infections Associated with Exposure to Turtles - USA, 2007-2008. Morbid Mortal Weekly Rep 2008; 57(03): 69-72; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a3.htm. Some of the discussion of the report is reproduced below:

"The prohibition on the sale and distribution of small turtles was enacted in 1975, after public health investigations demonstrated that small turtles were a major source of human _Salmonella_ infections, particularly in children. In 1972, a study in New Jersey indicated that small pet turtles accounted for approximately 23 percent of _Salmonella_ infections in children (4). In 1980, the 1975 prohibition was estimated to have prevented 100 000 _Salmonella_ infections in American children each year since going into effect (5). However, this prohibition has an exception: small turtles may be sold legally for scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes. During 2001-2006, the number of turtles kept as pets in the USA increased 86 percent to nearly 2 million turtles (6), suggesting that this exception might provide a mechanism by which small turtles become household pets.

"Turtles, like other reptiles, commonly carry _Salmonella_, and fecal carriage rates can be as high as 90 percent (1). Small turtles sold as pets frequently come from breeding farms, where turtles are housed in crowded ponds and nesting areas in a way that promotes _Salmonella_ transmission (7). Attempts to treat turtles, turtle eggs, and turtle breeding ponds with antibiotics to eliminate _Salmonella_ have not been successful and have resulted in a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance (7,8). Other treatments reduce but do not eliminate shedding from turtles (8), and the turtles that continue to shed might recontaminate other turtles during rearing or shipment. Because shedding might be intermittent and stress related, determining whether turtles are free of the bacteria is difficult (1).

"Direct or indirect contact with a reptile is associated with an estimated 6 percent of human salmonellosis in the USA (9). Persons coming into contact with reptiles, reptile habitats, or surfaces contaminated with reptile fecal matter risk infection from salmonellae shed by the reptile (10). Although most reptiles carry _Salmonella_, small turtles are likely to be handled differently than other reptiles and thus carry a greater risk of transmitting _Salmonella_ to children. In contrast to the obvious risk for a bite or scratch, for example, from a snake or an iguana, a small turtle is likely to be perceived as safe, and thus might be given directly to small children to play with. In addition, a young child placed in charge of caring for a turtle has direct contact with water in the turtle habitat, where salmonellae are likely to multiply to high numbers. Although approximately half of the infections associated with this outbreak occurred in young children, who are at greater risk for severe illness from salmonellosis (2,10), several illnesses occurred in adults with turtle exposure, demonstrating that turtle-associated salmonellosis is not unique to children. Additionally, only 20 percent of case-patients interviewed reported awareness of the link between salmonellosis and contact with reptiles, indicating that measures to educate the public about this link have not been successful. CDC has provided recommendations to prevent reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans (2). However, because of the particular hazard associated with small turtles, prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.
