The multi-million pork industry in Papua New Guinea [PNG] is under threat with the African swine fever [ASF] now in the country. The [African] swine fever [virus] is a virus which causes a hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in domestic pigs, killing pigs in large numbers as quickly as a week after infection.

Found in Mendi, Southern Highlands Province, it's believed the disease was transported through carriers, including imported canned food. Southern Highlands and its neighbouring provinces of Enga and Hela have been declared disease areas as of today [Sat 28 Mar 2020], as a containment measure by the National Agriculture and Quarantine Inspection Authority [NAQIA] as it works to stop its spread down to other highlands provinces and the coast.

The announcement made today [Sat 28 Mar 2020] by agriculture minister John Simon comes amidst efforts by the government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus was suspected when a large number of pigs in Mendi, 336, died in February [2020], and samples were taken by an investigation team from NAQIA and sent to Australia with results returning positive.

Prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus, the country was on red alert to prevent the ASF from entering the country. Minister Simon says while efforts were made by NAQIA to put stringent measures at the points of entry into the country, especially the country's borders, the emergence of ASF in Mendi, came a surprise to NAQIA.

This raises the biggest question of how it enters Mendi, with a team of NAQIA inspectors to travel to Mendi to establish where the virus came from. People in the 3 provinces are urged not to eat dead pigs or bring pigs or pig meat from one province to another as they will be checked at roadblocks. Although the virus is not a public health threat, it will greatly affect most people who depend on pigs as a source of food and income, but more importantly to the whole pork industry in PNG.

[According to ABC Radio Australia, pigs are not only a food source in PNG, they are also a crucial part of the culture and mass pig deaths could lead to social upheaval.

PNG is a country in Oceania that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea; the western half is an Indonesian territory. The Southern Highlands province, where Mendi's outbreak is located, is numbered 15 in PNG's administrative map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea#/media/File:Papua_new_guinea_provinces_(numbers)_2012.png.

We are being informed by ProMED-mail's Mod.CRD that the immediate OIE notification on ASF's introduction by PNG's veterinary authorities has been delayed due to technical issues which will, most probably, be solved soon.

OIE's global ASF outbreaks map, presenting all outbreaks (limited to the eastern hemisphere) since 2015, is available at https://tinyurl.com/r33y53k. Please note that the ASF-affected territory closest to PNG is East Timor. The spread of the virus -- against which no vaccine is available -- further eastwards, brings the virus even closer to North Australia, a cause for concern there and elsewhere. - Mod.AS
