1st case of LGV confirmed in Barcelona
-----------------------------------------
In Dec 2004, a patient presented at the sexually transmitted infection unit
in Barcelona with anorectal syndrome. The patient was a 32-year-old
bisexual man from Colombia who had lived in Barcelona for 3 months. He had
had at least 4 sex partners in the previous 12 months, and a history of
syphilis and gonorrhoea over the previous 2 years. Culture of a rectal swab
for _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ was negative, but direct immunofluorescence
testing for _Chlamydia trachomatis_ was positive. The case was confirmed
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as being the L2 genotype. The patient
was also tested for syphilis and HIV, but these were negative.
This patient had a boyfriend in Barcelona from the Netherlands, whom he
reported to be unwell at the time. The patient improved after taking
doxycycline. Further contact tracing has not been possible. This is the 2nd
case of LGV to be diagnosed in Barcelona in 2004; the 1st was a possible
case in Sep 2004 in a patient who had had a sex partner who had been
diagnosed with LGV in Amsterdam (1).
In 2003 and 2004, clusters of patients with LGV were identified in the
Netherlands, followed by a series of case reports in various European
cities among men who have sex with men (MSM), most of whom were
HIV-positive (2,3). The European Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted
Infections (ESSTI, <http://www.essti.org/>) network established a working
group to facilitate information exchange on LGV in May 2004 (4).
The outbreaks in Europe, which have been concentrated in sexual networks of
MSM in large cities, appear to be associated with the sex party scene, and
many patients had had numerous anonymous partners abroad. Therefore,
contact tracing has been of limited use so far.
3 European countries have recently launched enhanced surveillance programs:
Netherlands in Apr 2004, the United Kingdom in Oct 2004 [5], and France in
Jan 2005.
