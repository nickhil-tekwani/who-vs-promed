Since 2008, 9 patients have been admitted to intensive care after contracting this virus transmitted through the urine of an as yet unidentified rodent. Of these, 5 died. There have already been 2 cases this year [2022].

It is one of the candidate viruses for transmission between species, of which a resounding article in Nature, last week, announced that they will multiply in the coming years under the effect of environmental upheavals (read Friday's [29 Apr 2022] letter to the pro). Hantavirus is as rare -- 9 patients admitted to intensive care at Cayenne hospital since 2008 -- as it is severe -- 5 have died. Since the beginning of the year [2022], the service of Professor Hatem Kallel has already received 2, the last of which, last month [April 2022], died. "It is an emerging virus which remains rare but whose clinical signs are extremely severe," confirms Séverine Mathéus, virologist at the Institut Pasteur, on availability at the CHC and author of numerous articles on the subject.

In 2008, the Pasteur Institute asked [her] to look into 500 samples from Guyanese showing clinical signs of Q fever but whose tests turned out to be negative. "We came across a positive sample in serology and then in PCR, which made it possible to establish an etiology (find the cause of the disease) on this patient who presented with lung damage. He had not traveled in the 2 months preceding his lung attack. The information made it possible to corroborate an infection in the department. It was confirmed that hantaviruses, which are extremely rare viruses, are present in Guyana. From there, we put in place all the molecular and serological tools to continue this surveillance."

This 1st sequencing of the Maripa virus was published in the Journal of Virology, in 2012. Today, [Séverine Mathéus] is continuing this surveillance work alongside Anne Lavergne, who heads the hantavirus national reference center (CNR) at the Pasteur Institute in French Guiana. In 2017, they co-authored, with other Guyanese researchers, an article in Emerging Infectious Diseases on the 5 cases of hantavirus identified between 2008 and 2016 in Guyana.

Hantaviruses all over the Americas; a strain specific to Guyana
-----------------------------
Hantaviruses are present almost everywhere on the planet. They are transmitted by the urine of rodents which, under the effect of aerosolization, will be inhaled. In Europe and Asia, they mainly cause kidney damage and are less severe. In France, Alsace is the most affected region. In the Americas, they are found from Canada to Argentina. In South America, only 4 countries have not described a case: Suriname, Guyana, Colombia, and Ecuador. The sequencing carried out by the Institut Pasteur revealed that the strain present in Guyana -- named Maripa from the name of the housing estate where the 1st case was identified -- is different from those circulating in neighboring countries. So there is still a lot to learn.

First, we don't know everything about the rodent that transmits it. "It's not the rats and mice that you come across in town. We have a serious lead. A rodent that lives on the edge of the forest," says Séverine Matheus. This rodent, from the _Oligoryzomis _family, is called the "Guyana pygmy mouse," specifies Benoit de Thoisy, veterinarian at the Pasteur Institute in Guyana: "Of the 9 cases, we found this species positive twice: once in Rémire-Montjoly and once in Macouria. But we didn't find it consistently, and when we did catch it, it wasn't always positive."

It is therefore useless to suspect the common species of our cities: the black rat, the Norway rat, and the house mouse. "We sample all the rodents that we capture for the hantavirus. We tested it. None were positive for the hantavirus," reassures Benoit de Thoisy. In an article in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, he presents the results of 418 rodents, including those in question. The 201 Cayenne rats (_Proechimys cayennensis_) tested were all negative.

The species involved in 2 of the hantavirus cases lives rather in an open environment: in savannahs, on cleared land. Among the infected people, we find, for example, 2 farmers from Iracoubo, a person working on his slash and burn field in Macouria, the inhabitant of a housing estate that had just come out of the ground in Rémire-Montjoly, inhabitants of squats on the Island-de-Cayenne.

"There are still a lot of unknowns," continues Benoit de Thoisy. "This year [2022] is the 1st time we have cases in the rainy season. We never found a cluster, not even with 2 cases. Each time, it was isolated cases. It is extremely disturbing. Is the rodent only positive for a few days, for example? It feels like people were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The analyzes of the 500 samples from 2008 confirm this: 7 (1.4%) showed hantavirus antibodies. This figure, if true, would mean that there are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases."

"We don't know of any moderately serious cases either," [which is a surprise, says] Benoît de Thoisy, which is confirmed by Professor Hatem Kallel, head of the emergency department - critical care at the CHC: "It is possible that very mild cases pass for influenza or dengue fever."

To better understand it, Séverine Matheus pushes the investigations as far as possible: "I discussed a lot with the sister of the patient who we received in March [2022]. I offered her to do a serology so that we could see if she had antibodies (IGG) and understand why she had survived. For the time being, an acute hantavirus infection has never been identified around a confirmed case. But she refused."

Similarly, Professor Hatem Kallel cannot say why some patients admitted to intensive care evolved favorably and others died: "The disease begins in the same way. Patients come to the hospital with the same picture. We use the same resources. Perhaps there is a factor linked to the viral load, but we do not know it for all patients. Or a genetic factor, " assumes the resuscitator. To better understand, a very large cohort would be needed. For now, we are doing observational studies. One of them, on the 6th Guyanese patient, was the subject of an article in BMC Infectious Disease. "In each case, we will continue to investigate. This is how we will know it better," adds Séverine Matheus.

Research on the hantavirus is all the more difficult since, in the 1st days, patients present with quite mild symptoms: cough, fever, and abdominal pain. With such a clinical picture, it is difficult to think of hantavirus in the 1st place. Respiratory problems occur from the 5th day. "As soon as the respiratory syndrome begins to set in, the disease will progress very quickly. One of the patients arrived at 10 a.m. with abdominal pain. At 7 p.m., she was intubated and ventilated. She died at 10 p.m. This is one of the particularities of the Guyana hantavirus: the patients died in the 1st hours. Those who made it through the 1st day got away with it."

To help healthcare professionals, Séverine Matheus communicates regularly about the hantavirus, for example with doctors and interns at the Cayenne Hospital Center. "When we go to investigate cases, we also answer a lot of questions. It helps to reassure [the public]."

[This is the 2nd report of a hantavirus infection in French Guiana. The following reference provides a background on the relationship of Maripa virus to other hantaviruses and information relating to the illnesses suffered by 5 patients and rodent hosts. The virus sequenced in 2012 from a case in 2008 is Maripa virus that corresponds to a new variant of the Rio Mamoré virus species in the Bunyaviridae family, genus _Hantavirus_.

Citation: Matheus S, Lavergne A, de Thoisy B, et al. Complete Genome Sequence of a Novel Hantavirus Variant of Rio Mamoré Virus, Maripa Virus, from French Guiana. J Virol. 2012; 86(9): 5399; https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00337-12.

A study of Maripa virus in French Guiana covering the 2008-2016 period reported, "We performed environmental investigations around the residences of the 5 patients with confirmed hantavirus infections. Patients 1, 3, and 4 were from different parts of the same municipality, Tonate-Macouria (Table), and potentially exposed to hantavirus at a forest edge (patient 1), a periurban area (patient 3), and a slash-and-burn agricultural field (patient 4). Patient 2 was from Rémire-Montjoly municipality, a suburb of Cayenne (the largest city in French Guiana), and patient 5 was from a slash-and-burn agriculture field in the Iracoubo municipality (Table). No secondary human cases were reported near these confirmed cases. We set up a large ecoepidemiologic survey in French Guiana and captured rodents around the patients' homes to characterize rodent reservoirs (10). This survey led to the capture of 20 rodents of 5 different species. By using molecular approaches, we detected 4 Maripa-virus-positive rodents: 2 _Oligoryzomys delicatus_ (formerly named _O. fulvescens_ in French Guiana) (11), 1 of which was found near the home of patient 4, and 2 _Zygodontomys brevicauda_, both found near the home of patient 2."

Given the capability to diagnose human cases of Maripa virus infection and identify rodent hosts in French Guiana, we are likely to receive additional reports when and if new cases occur. - Mod.TY
