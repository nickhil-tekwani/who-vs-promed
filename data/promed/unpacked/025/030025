Wildlife authorities in South Africa's Kruger National Park [KNP] on
Monday said an anthrax outbreak that has claimed around 15 animals
was being monitored. The outbreak was detected in an area 20km south
of the park's far northern Pafuri reserve near South Africa's border
with Zimbabwe, KNP spokesperson Raymond Travers said.
Wildlife officials have found kudu, nyala, buffalo and giraffe that
died of the disease that occurs naturally, he said. "We started
picking up the 1st carcasses about 2-3 weeks ago. Last week we found
more and that's when we became very concerned," Travers told South
African radio. Park authorities and veterinarians did not believe
that the outbreak would spread beyond the area, but were preparing
for this eventuality, he said.
In the event of a spread, the area might have to be burned or cattle
might have to be vaccinated against the disease, he said. The
outbreak has been attributed to the recent high rainfall that
followed unusually dry conditions in the park -- conditions regarded
as typical for anthrax outbreaks that affect all animals.
The 2-million-hectare KNP is home to a wide range of wildlife species
including the big 5 animals -- lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard and
rhino. Nearly a million people visit the park every year.

A task team has been set up to investigate an outbreak of anthrax
which left 15 animals dead in the Kruger National Park (KNP) in the
past few weeks. "They will decide what to do based on the evidence,"
KNP spokesperson Raymond Travers said on Monday.
The carcasses of kudu, nyala, buffalo and giraffe found in the
extreme northern area of the park had all contained traces of
anthrax, SA National Parks (SANParks) said in a statement. Travers
said the task team would include the park's head of conservation
services, Freek Venter, the head of veterinary services, Dr Markus
Hofmeyr, a few other vets and representatives of the Department of Agriculture.
An option open to them would be to burn the block affected to destroy
the disease and ensure it did not spread, he said.
There was very little chance of human infection as the area was
remote with no tourist facilities nearby. Animals -- mainly browsers
-- were infected by eating the anthrax covered leaves of trees or
bushes. Sometimes vultures transferred the anthrax to bushes they
landed on after flying away from the infected carcasses on which they had fed.
He said there had been quite a few helicopter monitoring flights over
the area in the past few weeks. While no more carcasses had yet been
found, it was possible that the situation could escalate. "We would
like to assure the public that this is a minor outbreak of this
disease and, at this stage, there is no major cause for concern as
similar outbreaks have occurred in the past without spreading
further," said KNP executive director Bandile Mkhize.
SANParks said the far north of the KNP was historically an endemic
anthrax area and a few sporadic cases were seen annually. Large
outbreaks -- in which anything between 100 and 300 animals died --
had been recorded in the area in 1959/1960, 1970/71 and 1990/91.

[The Kruger National Park has one of the best veterinary teams in the
world and is an outstandingly run wildlife park. In the past there
were regular anthrax outbreaks in the northern part of the park along
the Pafuri but following severe floods and suspected major soil
erosion associated with the flooding the disease had disappeared from
that area. Obviously it has now returned. It would be interesting to
know whether intra-park strains had moved north or extra-park
Zimbabwean strains had moved south into the Pafuri.
Burning does nothing to the disease but it does move animals away
from browse contaminated by vomiting necrophilic flies; blow flies
vomit their meals in order to better digest them when the vomit is
eaten, thus leaves acquire spores; burning will remove the
spore-covered leaves near to the carcasses that the flies have been
feeding upon. This is why anthrax stops with the onset of the rainy
season in Africa.
Rain within dry weather and just before outbreaks has been recorded
elsewhere. How it works is speculative. The old Pasteur hands
insisted that it was because the spores in the soil germinated and
multiplied but there is no field proof of that. I suspect it is more
likely to be that the rain brings buried spores to the soil surface
and the sprouting ground vegetation gets grazed along with the soil
(and spores) about the roots. And the necrophilic flies then act as
simple case multipliers.
We have been investigating turkey vultures in relation of outbreaks
in West Texas and failed to recover any spores from their faeces
under roosts. Traditionally vultures only present a risk when after
feeding they go and bathe in a cattle trough or shallow pond. Animals
later drinking this water may come down with the disease. I have
recovered live organisms from vulture vomit though -- don't we
epidemiologists have fun? My daughter in Hollywood can silence a room
when recounting tales of family dinner conversations. - Mod.MHJ]
