_Salmonella_ and eggs Â– working group asks for information
A working group on _Salmonella_ in eggs, set up in 1998 by the Advisory
Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) 'to establish the
factors which determine the presence of _Salmonella_ contamination in or on
eggs and to recommend measures to reduce such contamination and consumers'
exposure to it', is requesting help in gathering current information about
_Salmonella_ and eggs. The working group's secretariat would be grateful to
receive factual information such as reports (published or unpublished)
about human outbreaks of salmonellosis associated with recipes using or
foodstuffs containing raw or lightly cooked eggs, data on the use of
_Salmonella_ vaccines in poultry, details of research and surveillance
carried out or commissioned, and knowledge of awareness and concerns in
industry and among consumers. The group will treat any material in strict
confidence if reporters request it to do so.
Please send reports by 30 April 1999 to:
ACMSF Secretariat
Room 502A, Skipton House
