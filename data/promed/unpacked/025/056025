[Paraphrased by Mod.CHC]
The potential epidemic zone had an ideal situation for Rift Valley fever
[RVF] in January: abundant surface water following good rains in the whole
eastern half of the country. On that basis, I ventured to predict that an
outbreak of RVF would occur. Within days we had reports of buffalo
abortions in the Kruger National Park and a waterbuck died in an adjoining
park. On the basis of virus isolations, PCR results and sequencing,
histology and immunohistochemistry, and antibody findings, we were able to
show that both were due to RVF; a giraffe death could not be to proved to
be due to RVF.
Because of a severe heat wave and lack of rain since then, the situation
promptly changed. Predicted bumper crops are now teetering on the brink of
failure.

RVF has evaporated.

[We are indebted to Bob Swanepoel for bringing this brief story to a close.
Still, although RVF has disappeared from the area, RVF virus surely has
not. This is as fascinating an infectious disease story as occurs
anywhere. Unless and until we get a grasp of virus dynamics in
interepidemic/interepizootic periods, as CDC appears to be doing with
hantaviruses in the United States, we will not be able to predict outbreaks
with certainty. Dr. Swanepoel's willingness to go out on a limb in this
situation took courage. - Mod.CHC]
