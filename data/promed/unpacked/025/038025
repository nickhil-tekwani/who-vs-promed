[The 1st human case was reported in 1998. Since then, more than 40 human cases have been diagnosed worldwide. H9N2 viruses are the cause of significant production losses and mortalities in poultry production systems and are endemic in several countries in Africa and Asia.

Human H9N2 infections are generally mild, and there has only been a single reported death due to the virus (a 57-year-old woman with underlying conditions, Sichuan, China, 2016; https://tinyurl.com/wj3cmqc). Human H9N2 cases are more often isolated during periods where other HPAI viruses are being surveyed for, such as H7N9 in China and H5N1 in Egypt and Bangladesh. As of June 2019, there have been a total of 59 laboratory-confirmed human H9N2 infections, with over half of those being recorded since 2015. The majority of those with confirmed infections were young children, and the median age of infection was 4 years (https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/7/620/htm).

It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people be fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories. - Mod.UBA
