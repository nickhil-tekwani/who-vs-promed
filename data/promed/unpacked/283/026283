Influenza update 243, based on data up to 26 Jul 2015
-----------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally, influenza activity remained at low levels in the Northern hemisphere and increased in some countries in the Southern hemisphere.

In North America and Europe, influenza activity remained at low, inter-seasonal levels with influenza B predominating in sporadic detections.

In most of the countries in Africa, where reports were available, influenza activity remained at low levels except in Senegal, which had increased detections of influenza B viruses.

In tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity was reported to be at low, inter-seasonal levels with only Cuba reporting an increase in detections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and parainfluenza viruses.

In western and temperate countries of Asia, influenza activity was at low, inter-seasonal levels with influenza B predominating with co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in western Asia.

In tropical Asia, countries in Southern Asia reported elevated but decreasing influenza activity with influenza A(H3N2) predominating. South East Asia reported low levels of activity; however, Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam reported elevated influenza activity.

In temperate South America, influenza activity decreased with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) predominating. Overall, influenza activity was at lower levels than in previous years.

In South Africa, influenza activity decreased with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) predominating in recent weeks.

In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity increased with both influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses in circulation.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 69 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 13 Jul 2015 to 26 Jul 2015 (data as of 2015-08-06 12:04:14 UTC).

The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 29 591 specimens during that time period. 2699 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2242 (83.1 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 457 (16.9 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 61 (2.7 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2232 (97.3 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 143 (91.1 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 14 (8.9 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Note: Global epidemiology and surveillance updates are periodically collected from data reported by national authorities or organizations responsible for reporting this data.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
Influenza activity remained at low, inter-seasonal levels in all countries in North America. Influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in Canada as well as pneumonia activity in Mexico remained slightly above expected levels for this time of the year.

Europe
Influenza activity was at low, inter-seasonal levels in all regions of Europe. Most countries had reduced or ceased reporting during this inter-seasonal period.

Northern Africa
Northern African countries continued to not report since the middle of May [2015] with influenza detections at low levels at that time.

Western Asia
Western Asian continued to report low, inter-seasonal levels of influenza activity. While influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated earlier in the season, both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses circulated equally in recent weeks.

Central Asia
Central Asia had low or no detections of influenza and ILI cases since the last report.

Eastern Asia
Eastern Asia reported low or decreasing levels of influenza activity. Influenza A(H3N2) predominated in this region with influenza B (Yamagata lineage) circulating at low levels. Influenza activity in Northern China had a decrease in influenza detections after the slight increase in activity in the last report. Japan, Mongolia, and the Republic of Korea all reported low levels of influenza activity.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall, the Caribbean, Central America, and Andean Sub-region reported low or decreasing influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detections in recent weeks with a few exceptions. Cuba reported high levels of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and parainfluenza viruses coinciding with its increase of ILI and SARI [severe acute respiratory infections] cases. Peru had a small increase in influenza activity with detections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and RSV in recent weeks. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity in children in Peru increased in recent weeks.

Central African tropical region
Eastern and Middle African countries continued to report low levels of influenza activity with cocirculation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B. Overall, Western Africa reported low or decreasing levels of influenza activity. Senegal reported an increase in influenza detections of influenza B; however, influenza activity remained at low levels.

Tropical Asia
Southern Asia reported decreased levels of influenza activity and detections. Bhutan, India, and Iran had low or decreasing levels of influenza activity with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses predominating in recent weeks.

Southern China had decreased ILI activity. Influenza detections remained elevated but have started to decrease. Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant virus in circulation with low co-circulation of influenza B (Yamagata lineage) viruses.

In China, Hong Kong SAR, influenza activity peaked in late June [2015] to early July [2015], and ILI activity and influenza detections decreased further. Influenza A(H3N2) predominated while influenza B viruses circulated at low levels.

Influenza activity remained at decreased levels in Sri Lanka with the predominant virus in circulation being influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

Overall, countries in South East Asia reported low or decreasing influenza activity. Lao People's Democratic Republic reported elevated ILI activity and influenza detections. Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant virus in circulation with low co-circulation of influenza B (Yamagata lineage) viruses. Viet Nam reported elevated influenza activity with influenza A(H3N2) predominant in recent weeks. Influenza activity remained low in Singapore with detections of influenza A(H3N2) viruses.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Overall, influenza activity decreased in the Southern hemisphere except in Australia and New Zealand.

Southern Africa
South Africa had decreased influenza activity and detections in recent weeks with an overall mild season: sporadic detections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses were reported in the past few weeks. RSV activity also decreased in recent weeks.

Oceania, Melanesia, and Polynesia
Australia had low but increasing influenza activity in recent weeks. Up to now, the season had been relatively mild compared to past seasons. Influenza B (Yamagata lineage) viruses predominated with co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2). Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B (Victoria lineage) viruses circulated at lower levels.

In New Zealand, influenza activity and detections increased in recent weeks with A(H3N2) and B viruses predominating. ILI activity increased above the average epidemic curve in recent weeks. SARI continued to increase to elevated levels.

Both French Polynesia and the Pacific Islands reported low ILI activity in recent weeks.

Seasonal influenza remains the main contributor to respiratory disease in the human population. The principal viruses throughout both hemispheres remain similar and it is likely that the vaccines in preparation will be appropriate to at least moderate the next seasonal outbreak. Respiratory syncytial virus remains a significant contributor to human respiratory disease. - Mod.CP]
