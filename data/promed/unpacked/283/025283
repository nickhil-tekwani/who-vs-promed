[The latest OIE situation report on African swine fever, from 7-19 Jan 2022, is available at https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2022/01/asf-situation-report-4.pdf. This report mentioned:

"The epidemiological situation of ASF continued to deteriorate in 2020-2022. Since January 2020, 8 countries have reported ASF as a 1st occurrence in the country, while 12 countries reported its spread to new zones. This highlights a continuous spread of the disease in new countries, and in new zones in countries already affected.

"As observed in Europe and in some regions of Asia, the transmission of ASF seems to depend largely on the wild boar population density and their interaction with low-biosecurity pig production systems. The good knowledge and management of the wild boar population and a good coordination among the Veterinary Services, wildlife and forestry authorities are required to successfully prevent and control ASF.

"Members are recommended to implement strict biosecurity measures and to strengthen their early disease detection system, in particular where there is evidence of circulation of low virulent strains of African swine fever virus (ASFV), or transmission in wild suids, and to promptly notify any cases of ASF to the OIE." - Mod.CRD
