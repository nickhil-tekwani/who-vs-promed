Scientists suspect some people have a "genetic disposition" for bird
flu infection, which may explain why some get it and others don't,
and why it remains relatively rare, the World Health Organisation
(WHO) said today.
Evidence, mainly from a family cluster of cases last May in North
Sumatra, Indonesia -- when 7 people in an extended family died --
showed genetic factors might influence human susceptibility to the
H5N1 virus, it said. Only blood relatives were infected in the Karo
district of North Sumatra, the largest cluster known to date
worldwide, "despite multiple opportunities for the virus to spread to
spouses or into the general community," it said.
The theory -- which it said merited further study -- was contained in
WHO's report issued today, on a closed-door meeting of 35 scientific
experts held in late September [see: WHO/CDS/EPR/GIP/2006.3
<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/WHO_CDS_EPR_G
IP_2006_3/en/index.html>
"A genetic predisposition for infection is suspected based on data
from rare instances of human-to-human transmission in
genetically-related persons," the WHO said. "This possibility, if
more fully explored, might help explain why human cases are
comparatively rare and why the virus is not spreading easily from
animals to humans or from human to human," it said.
Bird flu remains mainly an animal disease, but has infected 256
people since late 2003, killing 152 of them, according to the United
Nations agency. Overall, the H5N1 virus continues to show
"inefficient spread", both from animals to humans and among humans, it said.
Much about the disease remains poorly understood, but the present
situation is serious and "the risk that a pandemic virus might emerge
is not likely to diminish in the near future". Results from clinical
trials of candidate pandemic vaccines had "not been promising" and it
may be premature for countries to choose one to stockpile so as to
protect their populations.
Mallard ducks have been identified as the "champion" spreaders of
bird flu, and appear to shed the virus increasingly from the
respiratory tract rather than via faeces, the WHO said. This finding
will require modifying disease surveillance strategies so that
samples are also taken from birds' pharynx, as well as faeces, it
said. "In terms of geographical spread of the virus, mallard ducks
are now regarded as the 'champion' vectors; mute swans are highly
susceptible birds that are thought to serve as sentinels, but
probably not as vectors of virus transmission," it said in the
report. Recent studies had shown that the virus is now moving both
ways in "relay transmission", from poultry to migratory birds and
back again, it said.
Culling birds remains the control strategy of first choice, and had
proven successful in Japan and South Korea, but remains a costly
exercise. High-quality vaccination of poultry was recommended in
resource-strapped countries, yet ducks react differently to poultry
vaccines which are designed for chickens, it said.

[Differences in genetic susceptibility of individuals to H5N1 avian
influenza virus infection has gained favour as the most likely
explanation for the rarity of transmission of infection from infected
poultry to humans. It suggests that the emergence of a new human
pandemic influenza virus is less imminent than initially supposed.
The observation that mallard ducks are enhanced spreaders of avian
influenza virus by virtues of the circumstance that virus is released
to a greater extent from the respiratory tract rather than the
gastrointestinal tract raises the possibility that free-living birds,
rather than domestic poultry, may play the more significant role in
the emergence of a human pandemic virus.
