HERPES ZOSTER OPHTHALMICUS - ETHIOPIA

Reference: Bayu, S., Alemayehu, W. (1997). Clinical profile of herpes
zoster ophthalmicus in Ethiopians. Clin. Infect. Dis. 24: 1256-60.
This prospective study enrolled 100 consecutive cases of herpes zoster
ophthalmicus seen at the Menelik II Hospital in Addis Ababa. Because of
the lack of viral culture resources, diagnoses were made on clinical
grounds, so that patients with potential ophthalmologic manifestations of
zoster infection without evidence of a cutaneous eruption were excluded.
[Zoster is caused by human herpesvirus 3, otherwise known as varicella, the
virus that causes chickenpox - Mod.JW]
Visual acuity and intraocular pressure were determined, and biomicroscopic
examination of the anterior and posterior segments, along with dilated
funduscopic examination were performed.
The mean age of patients was 35 years (range 18-70), with 80% of
participants younger than 45. Males outnumbered females by 2 to 1. 81 of
85 patients (95%) for which serologic testing was performed were
HIV-positive, and 19 of 85 (22%) were VDRL-positive. Ocular complications
of herpes zoster ophthalmicus were reported in 78% of patients, with
corneal involvement in 65%, anterior uveitis in 50%, secondary glaucoma in
25%, and cataracts in 14%. Eyelid involvement was observed in 25%, and
the authors suggest that this increased incidence may be a consequence of
the use of herbal medications. The incidence of postherpetic neuralgia
was 55%. The duration of follow-up ranged from 6-18 months, and 15% of
participants were lost to follow-up. Final visual acuity was < 20/200 for
40% of participants, and 36% had acuities < 20/400 in the involved eye.
Evaluation of treatment could not be made, since only 8 enrollees received
acyclovir.
This study is consistent with previous reports from Malawi (Ophthalmology
101: 1801) and Rwanda (Br. J. Ophthalmology 71: 806) which document the
devastating toll of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in a young population with
a high incidence of HIV infection. Early recognition and treatment is
clearly essential to preserve vision in these individuals.
