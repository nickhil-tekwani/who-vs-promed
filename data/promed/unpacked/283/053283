[2] Ebola epidemic prevention strategies
Date: July 2015

The continuing Ebola outbreak is unprecedented in its magnitude.(1) The fragile health infrastructure of the 3 countries in which transmission spiraled out of control (Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia) made them particularly susceptible to the outbreak.(2) Present international discourse is focused on making health systems more resilient to Ebola and other epidemics. To accomplish this, any initiative must address poverty, strengthen the health workforce with technical and financial support, and develop basic facility and communication infrastructure.

Before the Ebola outbreak, financing of health care was largely supported by donors.(3) In the absence of a strong economy, no financial reserves are available for health care in normal circumstances, or during emergencies, as shown by the shortage of protective equipment for health-care workers during the Ebola outbreak. One underlying obstacle to economic progress is the absence of basic infrastructure. Inadequate transportation systems cut rural Liberia off from the capital, Monrovia, and other urban areas, preventing the distribution of crops and thus discouraging investment in agriculture.

In April 2014 and again in July 2014, when the Ebola crisis was escalating in Liberia, health workers went on strike for increased pay. Additionally, many workers received no relevant training or equipment, which led to many Ebola deaths among them. The supply of health workers in these countries is at risk, e.g. the University of Liberia Medical School is closed because of insufficient funding.

Many facilities do not have basic medical and communication equipment, which severely affects patient care. Basic infection control is difficult without rubber gloves or running water and makes facilities vectors of disease rather than places of healing. During the initial phase of the Ebola outbreak, public health workers did not have the simple and inexpensive instruments needed to communicate vital information quickly. Present proposals for epidemic control, such as a new worldwide response team, or an emergency fund, are unlikely to help [much] if these weaknesses are not addressed. Protection from worldwide pandemics starts locally, with investments in poverty reduction, health workforce development, and basic health and communication infrastructure. The Ministries of Health, Education, Public Works, Finance and Planning, and Agriculture, and the corporations responsible for utilities, such as electricity and Internet, must all cooperate.

We are calling for some of the post-Ebola funding to be used for long-term investment in the economy, in infrastructure, and in people, without which West Africa and the rest of the world will remain susceptible to Ebola and other epidemics.

[3] Liberia resurgence of Ebola cases
Date: 9-10 Jul 2015
Sources: various [edited]


A number of reports have come out concerning the resurgence of Ebola cases in Liberia. Selected reports are grouped here.

8 Jul 2015 Liberia: No Ebola case in Bong
http://allafrica.com/stories/201507091441.html
[Bong County Health Officer, Dr. Sampson Arzoaquoi, says there is no confirmed Ebola case in the county. Dr. Arzoaquoi's clarification comes in the wake of huge speculations in Bong that there were 2 confirmed cases at the Bong Mines Hospital in Fuamah District and Phebe Hospital in Suakoko, respectively. He said suspected Ebola cases had undergone thorough tests and proven negative ... - more]

8 Jul 2015 Liberia: Ebola cases evade detection due to ongoing lack of trust in communities
http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=51365#.VZ6TOfntmko
[In Liberia, adolescent girls trained by UNICEF and partners are part of Adolescents Leading the Intensive Fight against Ebola, or A-LIFE.

The origin of the new cluster of Ebola cases is "not yet well understood," the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) said today [8 Jul 2015] about the outbreak in West Africa, where a residual lack of trust in the response means that some cases still evade detection for too long, increasing the risk of further transmission.]

9 Jul 2015 Liberia: New Ebola infections bring number of confirmed cases to 5
http://www.voanews.com/content/new-ebola-infections-brings-number-of-liberia-cases-to-5/2855264.html
[John Sumo, the health promotion director at Liberia's Ministry of Health, said the 2 newest cases are under investigation, and the source of the new patients' infection is unknown]

9 Jul 2015 Liberia confirms 2 new Ebola cases, 120 quarantined
http://www.necn.com/news/national-international/Liberia-Confirms-2-New-Ebola-Cases-313039191.html
[According to Dr. Francis Kateh, all 4 confirmed [living] patients are at a treatment center near Monrovia, and 14 who are considered active "high risk" contacts are being monitored.

N.B. There has been one death in addition to these 4 cases, making a total of 5 confirmed cases. -Mod.LK]

10 Jul 2015 Liberia: New jump in Ebola virus cases -- 7 in treatment units
http://allafrica.com/stories/201507101609.html?viewall=1
[According to the Deputy Incident Team Manager: There are 7 persons in the ETU. Three of the 7 are suspected cases. Three have undergone initial testing (tested negative) and are awaiting the 2nd test. Dr. Kateh, when speaking at a Ministry of Information News Conference in Monrovia, said:
120 people are under what they call "precautionary observation (voluntary).
11 of the 120 are high-risk contacts.
42 of the 120 not the highest, but high risk.
13 of the 120 are medium-risk.
49 of the 120 are low-risk.]

9 Jul 2015 Surge of Ebola in Liberia may be linked to a survivor
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/world/africa/surge-of-ebola-in-liberia-is-tracked-to-a-survivor.html?_r=0
[Liberia's last confirmed case, in March 2015, was also suspected to be linked to sexual transmission, because the virus isolated from that patient who died closely matched that detected in the semen of her boyfriend, who had recovered from Ebola months before she fell ill. The genome of [that] virus was different from the newly sequenced case and not thought to be connected to it.

Instead, the sequence in the new case most closely matches viruses found circulating in Liberia last July and August [2014], said Michael R. Wiley, a research scientist with the Geneva Foundation and a contractor with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, who flew to Liberia last weekend to help sequence the virus at the Liberia Institute for Biomedical Research.

Scientists had previously shown that the Ebola virus can sometimes persist for months in certain areas of the body that are relatively protected from the immune system, including the testes, the placenta, and the inner portion of the eye. Studies of survivors in Liberia and Sierra Leone are working to determine how often this occurs. Experts recommend that survivors practice protected sex until more is known.

Liberian officials and international experts are still exploring other possibilities that could explain the new findings, including that the virus existed in an unknown reservoir before infecting at least 5 villagers. Experts believe it is unlikely that the virus has been spreading silently in recent months, given the strength of Liberia's surveillance system, including frequent testing of bodies and sick people.

Given that the virus degrades quickly, within hours to days, in the tropical heat, Dr. [Stuart] Nichol [of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] said it was implausible that Ebola had been lying dormant in the environment [on surfaces or fomites -- Mod.JW]. He said the close similarity with other viruses found in people in Liberia last year [2014] argues against the virus having been reintroduced from wildlife. Dr. Nichol said that an initial suspicion among villagers that the illnesses might be connected to a dog "we think is a red herring."
[The dog tested negative, but since it had been buried for an unstated length of time, any virus might have been degraded. - Mod.JW]

The developments showed the power and potential of real-time genetic sequencing done in recent weeks by virologists in West Africa, said Fatorma K. Bolay, director of the Liberia Institute for Biomedical Research. The technique is also being used in Sierra Leone and Guinea, with 27 new cases last week.

In one recent example, scientists used sequencing to connect Ebola cases in 2 areas of Guinea with cases in the capital, which guided epidemiologists and anthropologists. "It helped to go back and untangle exactly how it got from one place to another," said Dr. Bruce Aylward, who leads the Ebola response for the World Health Organization. Dr. Aylward said that while secret burials and hidden illnesses were still complicating the response in Guinea and Sierra Leone, responders had been increasingly able to link new illnesses with exposure to known cases and decrease the number of chains of transmission.

10 Jul 2015 Liberia: Tests show Ebola probably remained latent
http://www.financialexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/tests-show-ebola-probably-remained-latent-in-liberia/98847/
[On Fri 10 Jul 2015, according to health officials, preliminary findings on analysis of the genetic sequence of the virus showed it was reactivated either possibly by sexual contact, or the virus remained undetected for weeks before surfacing again. In addition, it was also found that the virus is closely related to one that was circulating in Liberia in that particular area, and that the virus remained latent in Liberia after the country was declared Ebola-free.]
[Meaning latent in a live person or wild animal. - Mod.JW]

[Summary: In April 2015, the World Bank announced USD 650 million to help Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone recover from the Ebola epidemic, including building their health systems.(1) Although there is consensus on the need for more resilient systems with greater surveillance capabilities(2), there is less clarity on how countries should pragmatically go about this undertaking. In view of the currently severe gaps in health systems whereby almost everything is needed, countries will have to set priorities for initiating this process.

9 Jul 2015 WHO statement to update on Ebola vaccine trial in Guinea
http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/ebola-vax-guineetrials_updt/en/
[Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has received several inquiries on the status of the Ebola vaccine trial in Guinea. An international board of experts known as the Data Safety Monitoring Board met on 3 Jul 2015 to consider preliminary results for the vaccine efficacy trial. They concluded that the trial must continue so that more conclusive evidence can be gathered on the vaccine. The data are being submitted for peer review, an important validation step in scientific process, and will be published in a scientific journal shortly.

The vaccine clinical trial evaluates the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of a single dose of the vaccine called VSV-ZEBOV for preventing Ebola virus disease. ... The ring vaccination trial began in affected communities in Guinea on 23 Mar 2015. Since then, more than 3300 close contacts of 87 patients, including family members, neighbors, and co-workers, have volunteered to participate. ... - more]

10 Jul 2015: Ebola research efforts shift to improving survivors' health
http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/maryland-health/bs-hs-ebola-survivors-20150710-story.html
[A research partnership between USA and Liberian health officials has launched a study to learn more about the long-term health consequences of Ebola, including the risks of passing the virus to close contacts and sexual partners, and the development of long-term immunity to the virus. [Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute] are to lead efforts to explore the virus's effects on eye health. ...

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Liberian Ministry of Health launched a study of the survivors last month [June 2015]. They planned to enroll about 7500 people, 1500 Ebola survivors of all ages and 6000 of their close contacts. Researchers plan to check in with the participants every 6 months for up to 5 years to closely monitor Ebola antibodies, whether the survivors can transmit the virus, and if so, whether those contacts get sick with Ebola.

Eye health
-----------
Dr. Christopher Brady and Dr. Allen Eghrari, assistant professors of ophthalmology at the Wilmer institute, are helping to lead a segment devoted to eye health. The study will include comprehensive exams to learn more about how and why the virus affects vision.

"We don't even know what the problem is," Brady said. "The major issue is to sort out exactly what are the various effects of Ebola on the eye." Theories of the effects, according to the World Health Organization, include damage to the cornea or to ocular nerves. "There's a significant need to characterize what parts of the eye [are affected] and what is the range of complications that can occur," Eghrari said. The study is based in Liberia, and the researchers hope it will also address overall eye care there. The effort will require training Liberian health care workers on how to conduct eye exams, and also making ophthalmology equipment more widely available.

"It's a valuable opportunity for us to work together with Liberian eye care providers to not only study what is needed but to build capacity in Liberia as well," Eghrari said. "The eye needs are significant, both from the immediate effects of the Ebola virus as well as other needs."
