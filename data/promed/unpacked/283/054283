On "2 Mar 2014" [typo? See next paragraph.], the Tepelene district Epidemiological Service notified the Institute of Public Health regarding 4 anthrax cases that presented at the Kuta hospital Tepelene.

These people were infected while butchering & handling the flesh of an ill cow slaughtered on 22 Mar 2014. Those affected are being treated in the Tepelene hospital and are in good health; the situation is under control.

This took place in Great Arrez village in the municipality of Luftinje, a known anthrax outbreak site where, in 2003, some cattle died from anthrax. Epidemiologic investigation continues to focus on relevant measures and, in the days to come, will have updated information.

[Anthrax reports from Albania to OIE are uneven in frequency, with none between 2001 and 2004 and only one outbreak reported in 2005. However, in 2007, there were 2 bovine outbreaks reported in Gjirokaster, one of which also involved cattle, sheep and goats, plus a 3rd outbreak only involving sheep and/or goats. In 2008, there were one bovine outbreak and 2 small ruminant outbreaks, in 2009 one small ruminant outbreak, and in 2010 one bovine outbreak and 3 small ruminant outbreaks. No outbreaks were reported for Gjirokaster in 2011, and to date, there are no anthrax outbreak reports out of Albania for 2012 and 2013.

Latterly, the annual numbers of human cases reported nationally vary from the high teens to 82 cases. I think we can safely assume that this recent event in Great Arrez village is typical.

Gjirokaster is an inland province in southern Albania, near the border with Greece. For maps of Albania, see
