ND cattle herd tests negative for TB; quarantine lifted
-------------------------------------------------------
The cattle herd at the center of a potential tuberculosis outbreak in south
western North Dakota has been found free of the disease and has been
released from quarantine.

"North Dakota's tuberculosis-free status remains in effect, and that is
very good news," agriculture commissioner Doug Goehring said on Friday, 8
May 2009. "Thanks to the efforts of the State Board of Animal Health, state
veterinarian's office, federal officials, and to the cooperation of the
animals' owners, the situation was quickly and efficiently wrapped up."

Dr Susan Keller, the state veterinarian, also expressed her appreciation to
the herd's owners for their assistance in the process. "Without the
cooperation of livestock producers, we cannot eradicate diseases such as
tuberculosis," Keller said. "I want to personally thank these producers for
their willingness to work with our office."

Testing of 2 of the 4 neighboring herds is complete with results on the 3rd
neighboring herd expected this week. Testing of the 4th neighboring herd
will begin this month [May 2009].

Last October [2008], Keller was notified that a cow originating from south
west North Dakota was identified at a Minnesota slaughter facility as a
suspect for tuberculosis. The diagnosis was later confirmed, and a herd
investigation was initiated.

Two whole herd tests have been completed on the herd, and tissues from
suspect animals were forwarded to the National Veterinary Services
Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, for additional testing. All tests by the
NVSL were negative, and the quarantine was lifted Friday, [8 May 2009].

[Although the herd of origin has tested negative, without the other herds
being tested, it may be too early to breathe a sigh of relief. Only time
will tell. Tuberculosis is a slow insidious disease for which there is not
rapid, reliable test available. In order to eradicate this disease
convincingly, there needs to be a rapid, accurate, and reliable test
developed. - Mod.TG
