The Montana Department of Livestock has confirmed that 9 cases of equine West Nile fever have occurred in the state.

As of Thursday [29 Aug 2013] afternoon, Cascade, Blaine, Phillips, McCone, Custer, Petroleum, Musselshell, Big Horn and Stillwater counties had reported equine cases.

Of the 9 cases, 3 were in counties that had previously reported positive mosquito pools.

According to Dr. Marty Zaluksi, state veterinarian for the Montana Department of Livestock, 8 of the infected horses had not been vaccinated. One of the horses was not current on its vaccinations.

Zaluski said that 5 of the horses have died or were euthanized. According to the department's Facebook page, the 1st equine cases were reported 23 Aug 2013.

Teton, Lewis and Clark, Sheridan and Prairie counties have reported positive mosquito pools but have not had equine cases. Cascade, Blaine and Phillips counties have reported both positive mosquito pools and equine cases. A white pelican in Sheridan County tested positive for West Nile several weeks ago, according to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.

The equine case in Cascade County was reported in a horse from the Sun River drainage area, roughly the same area as the report of a positive mosquito pool earlier in August [2013], said Will Patterson, manager of Cascade County Weed and Mosquito Division.

It was confirmed Tuesday [27 Aug 2013] that horse had West Nile fever, Patterson said. "It is my understanding that the horse was euthanized," Patterson said. "My understanding is that it had not been vaccinated."

Patterson said the weed and mosquito division has redoubled its mitigation efforts in the area of the positive pool and equine case, including putting aerial applications of mosquito spray in the Sun River drainage area. "It does raise some concern because it is the same virus that affects humans as horses," Patterson said.

Insect bites are the primary mode of transmission, Zaluski said. Horses cannot transmit the virus to other hosts, he said.

Zaluski encourages horse owners to speak with their veterinarian about getting their horse a booster dose of the West Nile virus vaccine this late in the season if they have not already been boosted.

Patterson reminded people to drain any standing water, limit their outside activities from dusk to dawn, use DEET-based repellant and wear clothing that covers the skin.

"Unfortunately until we get a break in this weather pattern, I'm afraid some of this is going to continue for a while," he said. "We're trying our best to utilize resources we have available the best we can."

[Most horses bitten by carrier mosquitoes do not develop disease. Of those that do, approximately 1/3rd develop severe disease and die, or are so affected that euthanasia is required. The time between the bite of an infected mosquito and when clinical signs appear ranges from 3 to 14 days.

Although horses do not usually develop clinical signs of West Nile virus (WNV) infection, horses that are ill vary in signs from mild signs to serious and near death. Typical signs include muscle trembling, skin twitching, ataxia (incoordination, stumbling, limb weakness) that either appears suddenly or appears gradually and worsens, sleepiness, dullness, listlessness, facial paralysis (droopy eyelids, lower lip), difficulty with urination and defecation, and an inability to rise. Some horses may develop mild fevers, blindness, seizures, and other signs.

WNV may cross the placenta from mother to gestating foal. Horses cannot spread the disease to humans, but humans are susceptible to the disease if bitten by a carrier mosquito. No transfusion related horse illnesses have been reported. However, human-to-human transmission via blood transfusions have been confirmed, so this method of transmission is possible in horses.

Horses vaccinated for WNV and foals of positive-testing mares are likely to have a positive blood test for the virus. Veterinarians consider blood test results, clinical symptoms and the possibility of other neurological diseases, including rabies, Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Western equine encephalitis (WEE), equine rhinopneumonitis (equine herpes virus type 1), and equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), before making a diagnosis. Blood or cerebral spinal fluid samples should be collected by a veterinarian and sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory or to a diagnostic laboratory with capabilities to handle brain samples. Because of the potential for rabies and the related risk to humans and animals, the heads of horses that die or are euthanized due to neurological disease should be submitted to a diagnostic lab for testing.

The case fatality rate for horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV infection is approximately 33 percent. Data have supported that 40 percent of horses that survive the acute illness caused by WNV still exhibit residual effects, such as gait and behavioral abnormalities, 6 months post-diagnosis. Thus vaccination for WNV is recommended as a core vaccine and is an essential standard of care for all horses in North America.

The WNV vaccine is usually combined with Eastern and Western equine encephalitis. As this is a combination vaccine, it is recommended as part of the core vaccinations for all equines.

Currently, 4 USDA licensed vaccines are available (2 are inactivated whole WNV vaccines; one is a non-replicating live canary pox recombinant vector vaccine and one is an inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine):

Inactivated whole virus vaccines with an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 3 to 6 weeks apart followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. These products are labeled as an aid in prevention of viremia or as an aid in prevention of viremia and mortality and an aid in reduction of severity of clinical disease.

Recombinant canary pox vaccine with protective antigens expressed in a vaccine strain canary pox vector which does not replicate in the horse. The vaccine contains an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 4 to 6 weeks apart followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. The product is labeled as an aid in prevention of disease, viremia, and encephalitis.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine with protective antigens expressed in a vaccine strain yellow fever virus vector and contains an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 3 to 4 weeks apart followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. This product is labeled as an aid in reduction of disease, encephalitis and viremia.

All of the current WNV vaccine products carry one year duration of immunity, with challenge, consistent with their respective label claims.
