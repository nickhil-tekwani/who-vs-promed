40 000 contract serious virus in Ukraine, 30 dead
-------------------------------------------------
As the world enters the [influenza] season, another possible virus
emerges as 30 people in the Eastern European country of Ukraine have
died from this latest flu [virus infection].

Each country is dealing with their own cases of the pandemic (H1N1)
2009 virus infection and many have even [under]taken vaccination, but
is H1N1 the only flu out there? A viral infection in Ukraine has taken
the lives of 30 people and at 1st it seemed like an ordinary flu but
after a week the symptoms worsened.

Radio Netherlands Worldwide reports 40 000 Ukrainians have contracted
the disease and at least 100 are in the hospital. Tests are currently
being conducted and all that is known is that it is not the pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 strain of influenza virus [but see comment below].

A large number of schools and childcare facilities are being shut
down, especially in the city of Lvov [Lviv in western Ukraine -
Mod.CP]. Also, government agencies are handing out surgical masks and
gloves to people in the western part of Ukraine.

However, Russia Today is reporting that it is A/H1N1 or Californian
Flu [i.e., the A/California/7/2009 strain from which the current
pandemic vaccines are derived - Mod.CP] and the total number of deaths
is closer to 40.

Prime Minister Timoshenko [of Ukraine] stated, "Express-tests cannot
provide a hundred percent verification of the virus; they give only 50
percent accuracy. That's why blood [samples from] those who died were
sent to special laboratories for further testing, and only this
morning it was confirmed that at least 11 deaths were caused by the
A/H1N1 [pandemic 2009] virus."

The Ukrainian government is calling for international aid to help
fight their epidemic and President Yushchenko believes the country
needs more than USD 6 million to battle the epidemic.

[ProMED-mail also thanks Sharon Sanders for bringing this outbreak of
an undiagnosed influenza-like illness to our attention. It now
appears, contrary to an initial denial and continuing uncertainty,
that the outbreak is likely a consequence of pandemic A (H1N1) 2009
virus infection. ProMED-mail would welcome further information from
any informed source.
