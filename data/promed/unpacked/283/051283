In yet another dubious distinction for Chhattisgarh State, the state has recorded the 2nd highest number of cases of malaria in the country this year [2014]. The state alone accounts for almost 13 percent of the total malaria cases in the country, with almost 39 000 people falling prey to the disease.

According to the latest data of the Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), Chhattisgarh State reported 38 781 cases from January to June this year [2014], 2nd only to neighbouring Odisha State, which reported a whopping 1.30 lakh [130 000] cases. According to the data, Jharkhand State trails with 26 588 cases followed by Madhya Pradesh State (18 793) and Tripura (13 375).

During the same period, the total number of malaria cases recorded across the country was 3.19 lakh [319 000] cases, which claimed 107 lives. Luckily, so far, no fatality has been reported this year [2014] from Chhattisgarh State. However, last year [2013], 43 people had died due to the disease in the state. While a maximum number of 3 deaths this year [2014] has been recorded from Madhya Pradesh, doctors say the toll could be higher across the country, as many fatalities that occur in private hospitals are not reported.

According to health officials, "Malaria control in Chhattisgarh is a complex issue because of vast tracts of forest land with tribal settlement." The officials said the majority of cases in the state are reported in Bastar division, which includes Dantewada and Kanker districts. Unplanned growth of cities, rapid industrialisation, labour concentration at project sites, and movement of people across the borders are some of the reasons for the high number of malaria cases in the last few years.

On the positive side, there has been a considerable reduction in cases and deaths since 2010," said V Jaiprakash, state nodal officer, NVBDCP. Jaiprakash said the easiest, cheapest, and most environmentally friendly method to control malaria is by preventing the mosquito from laying eggs.

"Avoiding or eliminating water collection can do this with ease," he said, adding that a little caution by the people can go a long way in malaria prevention.
