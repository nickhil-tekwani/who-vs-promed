A 75-year-old man became the 4th victim of [a] hantavirus in a locality in the Epuyen mountains. The [cause of] death was confirmed by the provincial Ministry of Health. The virus, which infects rodents, took the lives of a 14-year-old adolescent, a 38-year-old woman and a 61-year-old municipal employee. Due to these cases, the province declared a health alert in the entire zone although this was discarded as an epidemic.

The Esquel Program Area, a unit of the Chubut Ministry of Health led by Adrian Pizzi, yesterday [18 Dec 2018] provided updated information of what happened in the mountain region with hantavirus [infections] and confirmed there is new victim. The man is a Chilean citizen with an unusual history; among other things, he had relocated to Epuyen as an exile during the dictatorship of Augosto Pinochet.

Pablo Nouveau, Jorge Elias and Emiliano Biondo, Program Area authorities, held a press conference where they reviewed the current epidemiological picture and restated the preventive measures to be taken into account. Elias reported the death of a patient admitted into the intensive care unit of the Esquel Area Hospital with a clinical picture of pneumopathology that evolved and that the clinical progression merited reclassification as one of [a] hantavirus [infection] even though the [diagnostic] tests by the Malbran Institute were awaited.

He stated that since 3 Dec [2018] to date [19 Dec 2018], a total of 9 positive cases have been registered, of which 3 patients died and there is this 4th death that awaits results of definitive studies, but it is a fact that this is a hantavirus [infection case]. [Very likely but not proven until the laboratory tests confirm it. - Mod.TY]

In addition, the officials stressed that within the framework of this current contingency, the psycho-emotional shock for family members of victims is ameliorated by institutionalized staff of the Hospital Rural of Epuyen and the Municipality of Epuyen. "As for operations, we are moving in several dimensions, not only from the clinical and epidemiological points of view, but we also begin to strengthen the social and emotional parts," stated the Associate Director of the Program Area. Elias mentioned as well that in this past week a multisectorial work group was constituted, integrated by the provincial sanitary office, the national Ministry of Health, the Malbran Institute and various professionals related to this theme.

"We have reached the hypothetical conclusion that this outbreak situation in Epuyen corresponds to interhuman infections. This must be confirmed by having the virus genome sequences, which is being processed by the Malbran," he added.

Elias repeated, "We are going through a unique and unusual situation. The most clear antecedent is that of 1996 in El Bolson. It is important to tell the community that we are not in an epidemic [situation], rather a localized outbreak that occurred 45 days ago." Given this hantavirus outbreak, the specialists mentioned that the following recommendations offered by the Ministry of Health to:
- Maintain houses and keep sheds ventilated, organized and clean;
- Use bleach as a disinfectant and ventilate environments that were kept closed for a long time for at least an hour;
- Carry out these tasks wearing clothes, adequate shoes and respiratory protection.

And he stated that "in case one decides to camp, select a place free of weeds and do no sleep in direct contact with the vegetation; respect the instructions of the park guards, wildlife guards, posters and health personnel; travel the established trails with adequate clothes and shoes, avoiding places with weeds."

[Epuyen is located in the Andes mountains, and the virus most likely involved, although not stated, is Andes hantavirus, which is endemic in the southern Andes. This is the beginning of the summer season, when cases of hantavirus infection occur. The group quoted above states that they hypothesize that the outbreak is due to human-to-human transmission, which would be unusual. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. No mention is made above of close relationships among these cases. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region. A comparison of the RNA sequences of the viruses in these cases may provide interesting additional information, as would any sequences of the viruses in the rodent hosts present in the localities where the cases occurred.
