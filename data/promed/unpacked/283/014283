Pediatricians said parents should not panic over a rise in the number of herpangina cases in the capital. Herpangina, which is similar in nature to the hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD], mostly affects children, causing them to develop sores or blisters in the mouth. They will also show symptoms of a fever and have difficulty eating and drinking. Often, the symptoms are mild and the disease can disappear within a week.

The number of herpangina cases is on the rise in Beijing, according to the Capital Institute of Pediatrics. The hospital received 987 cases of herpangina over the past week, said Chi Yang, the hospital's public relations official, on Thu 19 Jun 2014. But the disease is not caused by a new virus strain, said Huang Hui, a doctor at the hospital's department of infectious diseases, refuting an online post that linked the rise in cases to a new strain of the herpangina virus.

Both herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease are caused by an infection of enteroviruses, Huang said. The summer and autumn seasons usually see a high incidence of both diseases among children from 1 to 7, Huang said.

Meanwhile, the number of newly discovered cases of hand-foot-mouth disease in Beijing has been increasing every week since the end of April 2014, according to a weekly report of contagious diseases issued by the city's health authorities. There have been 2860 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease reported in the city over the past week, the health authorities said on Thu 19 Jun 2014.

[Herpangina and HFMD can be different manifestations of the same strain of enterovirus and reported in this article published electronically several years ago in Pediatrics (Ruan F, Yang T, Ma H, et al: Risk factors for hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina and the preventive effect of hand-washing. Pediatrics. 2011; 127(4): e898-904; http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/03/21/peds.2010-1497.full.pdf)

Abstract
--------
Background: Hygiene and social distancing are recommended control measures for hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina. However, empirical data to support this recommendation are limited.

Methods: During an outbreak of HFMD and herpangina due to infection by the human enterovirus 71, we defined a case as a vesicular papular rash on the hands, feet, buttocks, or oral mucosa and onset from 30 Apr to 26 Jun 2008. We selected 176 HFMD and herpangina case-children and a stratified random sample of 201 asymptomatic control-children; frequency matched according to residency status. We administered a questionnaire to the parents about their children's exposures and hygienic behaviors.

Results: Risk factors for HFMD and herpangina included playing with neighborhood children (odds ratio [OR]: 11 [95 percent confidence interval (CI): 6.2-17]), visiting an outpatient clinic for another reason 1 week or less before onset (OR: 20 [95 percent CI: 5.0-88]), and community exposures to crowded places (OR: 7.3 [95 percent CI: 4.1-13]). By using a score summarizing responses to 4 hand-washing questions, we found that 50 percent of the case-children and 2.5 percent of control-children had a poor score of 1 to 3, whereas 12 percent of the case-children and 78 percent of control-children had a good score of 7 or higher (OR: 0.00069 [95 percent CI: 0.0022-0.022]) after we adjusted for residency, age, and community exposures by using logistic regression.

Conclusions: Hand-washing by preschool-aged children and their caregivers had a significant protective effect against community-acquired HFMD and herpangina from the human enterovirus 71 infection.
