A Chinese woman in south west China has died from avian influenza, the
Health Ministry said on Wed 18 Jan 2006, in what will be the country's 6th
human death from this virus if confirmed. The 35 year old woman died in
Sichuan province on 11 Jan 2006, the Ministry said in a brief statement on
its website (<http://www.moh.gov.cn>).
The woman, a poultry slaughterer, lived in a village where domestic birds
had died, the statement said, though it did not say if they had succumbed
to the H5N1 virus to which the victim tested positive.
This is the 9th human case of avian influenza reported in China, the
official Xinhua news agency added. External laboratories recognised by the
World Health Organization (WHO) usually test suspected bird flu deaths
before they are confirmed. The Chinese Health Ministry said the new case
had been reported to the WHO. WHO was not immediately available for comment.
