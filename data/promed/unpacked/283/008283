Detection of Bombali ebolavirus in bats in Guinea
----------------------------------------------------
The 6th ebolavirus, Bombali virus, 1st discovered in bats in Sierra Leone (Goldstein et al. 2018) and subsequently detected in Kenya (Forbes et al. 2019), has most recently also been detected by 2 groups in Angolan free tailed bats (_Mops condylurus_) in Guinea. In addition to findings reported by Karan et al. (2019), the virus was also found in 2 live captured Angolan free-tailed bats roosting inside people's houses in Gueckedou and Kissidougou, Guinea. Virus detection was performed by UC Davis (<www.onehealthinstitute.net>) working with the government of Guinea, the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Laboratory of the University of Gamal Abdel Nasser of Conakry, and Metabiota as part of the PREDICT Project (<www.predict.global>), funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Research teams used similar methods to detect the virus and, collectively, results suggest Bombali virus has a wide [geographic] distribution. Studies are ongoing to determine if the virus has spilled over or is pathogenic in people. The government of Guinea and international partners are engaging with local communities to convey what is known about the new virus and how to reduce contact with and live safely with bats.

The role of bats in the environment
------------------------------
People should not attempt to kill or eradicate bats in response to this discovery. While bats have been implicated as reservoirs for a number of infectious pathogens, they play important roles as providers of ecosystem services through pollination of native and agricultural crops, reduction of insect pests that also spread disease and damage crops, and consumption of mosquitoes and other pests that feed on people and livestock. Killing or disturbing bats in their natural habitat could actually increase the risk of transmission of this new virus, as has been seen in studies of Marburg and rabies viruses. Engagement with local communities has occurred throughout the project, and meetings with communities to share plans and answer questions about Bombali virus and how to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus are ongoing.

[This interesting report establishes a new country where Bombali virus is present in bats. It has been found in bats previously in Sierra Leone and in Kenya, and now in Guinea. Further studies are needed to determine if the virus is present in other species of bats or if humans have evidence of Bombali virus infection by the bat, and if humans develop disease from it.

The plea for local people to develop an appreciation for the ecological services that bats provide, including benefits to humans, is important. In the absence of diseases, there is no reason to kill bats in the interest of human or domestic animal health. Many species of bats in West Africa are captured and consumed as bush meat. This cultural and economic practice will be difficult to reverse, but an attempt to do so is well worth the effort.
