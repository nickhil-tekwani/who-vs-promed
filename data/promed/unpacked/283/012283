Apart from the drive to administer vaccine to people in areas identified as vulnerable to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, it has been decided to introduce changes in the method in which the insecticide is administered to cattle in the affected areas to prevent the outbreak of the disease.

It is a known fact that domestic cattle, that venture into forest for grazing, also play host to the ticks that spread KFD. The Department of Animal Husbandry has suggested to the State government to provide pour-on solutions of flumethrin and cypermethrin, and pyrethroid insecticides to control ticks in cattle in the areas affected by KFD.

It may be mentioned here that 4 persons had died by KFD in the district in 2016-17 and 48 positive cases were reported during this period. More positive cases were reported in Kudumallige Gram Panchayat limits in Tirthahalli taluk.

KFD is a tick-borne viral infection that spreads from monkeys to humans. At present, vaccination is provided for humans against the disease in a 5-km [3.1 miles] radius where positive cases among people or monkeys are reported.

Kiran SK, Taluk Health Officer, Tirthahalli, told The Hindu that it there is a plan to provide vaccination against KFD to 55 000 persons in the district in the years 2017-18. The vaccination drive will commence from the 1st week of September [2017]. Ample stock of the vaccine that is produced at the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, Bengaluru, has been maintained in the district, he said.

Earlier, pyrethroid insecticide was provided in oil-bound form and was administered on cattle topically after mixing it with water. As its application was laborious and harmful in humans as well as in cattle, providing the insecticide in the form of pour-on solutions to combat the ticks in an effective manner, has been a preferable option. At a meeting held at the Taluk Panchayat in Tirthahalli on KFD, veterinary experts opined that the administration of this pour-on solution is more efficient

The flumethrin pour-on can be applied topically on the vertebral column of the cattle. According to sources, the Department of Animal Husbandry has requested the State government to provide pyrethroid insecticide in pour-on form worth Rs 3 lakh [USD 0.05] for distribution among the cattle owners in the areas affected by KFD.

Preventive measures

Mr Kiran said that the KFD virus becomes active after the conclusion of monsoon. To prevent the outbreak of the disease among humans, the officials of the Forest Department have been asked to inform the Department of Health and Family Welfare on the unnatural death of monkeys in the forest.

If laboratory tests confirm the presence of KFD virus in dead monkeys, the vaccination against the disease can be undertaken among the humans residing in an area of 5-km [3.1 miles] radius to prevent the spread, he added.

[There is a need to create awareness on how to avoid tick bites and KFD vaccination facilities should be available in the affected areas. KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to prevent KFD.
Flumethrin is a pyrethroid insecticide which is used externally in veterinary medicine against parasitic insects and ticks on cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and dogs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumethrin]. Researchers have demonstrated excellent results with use of flumethrin against heavy tick infestations [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11206390].
Therefore the plan to use flumethrin or equivalent pesticides on the cattle in the region can be a very important measure to minimize the vector involved in the transmission of the virus. - Mod.UBA
