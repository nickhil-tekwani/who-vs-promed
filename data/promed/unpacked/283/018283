A new case of listeriosis was reported today, in addition to the 3
cases over the holiday [Labor Day] weekend [3-5 Sep 2011], bringing
the total to 13 since 1 Aug 2011.

Cases have been reported in Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Denver, Douglas,
El Paso, Jefferson, Larimer, and Weld counties. 2 people died from
listeriosis in August 2011 and the 11 others were hospitalized. In an
earlier outbreak, in June 2011, 2 people diagnosed with the infection
died.

The cause of the most recent outbreak is still under investigation and
there is no clear link between the cases, said Mark Salley, spokesman
for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Safety. Colorado
averages about 10 cases of listeriosis per year.

State health officials are concerned about the sudden outbreak and
have reissued warnings about eating undercooked hot dogs, meat
spreads, soft cheeses, and smoked fish.

Symptoms of listeriosis include fever and muscle aches, diarrhea,
headache, stiff neck, confusion, convulsions, and it can cause
complications with pregnant women. Listeriosis can be treated with
antibiotics, but even with treatment some cases result in death. Those
with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk and listeriosis
rarely affects healthy people. Most of those sickened by the illness
during this outbreak are between 38 and 90 years old, and the majority
are older females.

[In the June 2011 outbreak of listeriosis in Colorado, which was
reported by ProMED-mail (Listeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO) 20110605.1719), 2 of 3 patients died. That all 3 were said to be of
Hispanic or Latino heritage would suggest the source could possibly be
soft Mexican-style cheeses contaminated with _Listeria_ contamination.
However, the sources for both the June and the current outbreaks
remain unknown. The news release above says that there is no clear
link among the cases in the current outbreak; however, it is not
specifically stated if genotyping of patient isolates has been done. A
similar genotype for some or all of the cases would imply a common
source for these cases.

The following is extracted from Mod.ML's comments in ProMED-mail post
Listeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO) 20110605.1719:

"_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely
distributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water,
silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized milk
[***], soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of
many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and in crustaceans,
fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human infections are
foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to
fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth
canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and
farmers by direct contact with infected animals.

Contamination of food can occur in nature, such as, in raw vegetables
contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk by infected cows, or
[contamination can occur] following subsequent cooking or other
processing.

Because the organisms can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, it is
not surprising that listeriosis is usually associated with ingestion
of contaminated milk, meat, or vegetable products that have been held
at refrigeration temperatures. Listeria can also survive in frozen
food. Consumption of raw milk, raw-milk soft cheeses (such as, brie,
camembert, and Mexican soft cheeses), coleslaw, pate, deli meats, and
hotdogs has been sources of human listeriosis. The sources of human
infection can be pinpointed by DNA identification techniques matching
_Listeria_ spp isolated from a possible source with a species
recovered from a patient."

*** In reference to the statement in the 1st paragraph of these
comments, above: reports have suggested that _L. monocytogenes_ is
relatively resistant to heat, which has raised concern about the
effectiveness of pasteurization for eliminating this organism from
milk (Bryan FL: _Listeria monocytogenes_. In: Riemann H, Bryan FL,
eds. Food-borne infections and intoxications. 2nd ed. New York:
Academic Press, 1979: 266-8; Bearns RE, Girard KF: The effect of
pasteurization on _Listeria monocytogenes_. Can J Microbiol 1958;
4(1): 55-61; abstract available at
http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/m58-007). In an
outbreak of listeriosis that occurred in Massachusetts in 1983,
pasteurized whole or 2 percent milk was implicated as the source of
infection (Fleming DW, Cochi SL, MacDonald KL, et al: Pasteurized milk
as a vehicle of infection in an outbreak of listeriosis. N Engl J Med
1985; 312(7): 404-7; available at
http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198502143120704). An
inspection of the milk-producing plant detected no apparent breach in
the pasteurization process. In addition, 2 percent of pasteurized milk
samples from more than 700 US milk-producing plants were
culture-positive for _Listeria_ species, primarily _L. monocytogenes_,
in a survey conducted during 1987 and 1988 as part of the Food and
Drug Administration's (FDA's) Dairy Product Safety Initiatives (Food
and Drug Administration. FDA's dairy product safety initiatives: 2nd
year status report to the states. Washington, DC: US Department of
Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, 1988).

However, the US CDC has noted that several studies have shown that _L.
monocytogenes_ is inactivated by standard milk pasteurization
practices and that contamination of pasteurized milk in the reports
cited above were most likely due to improper methods of pasteurization
or post-pasteurization contamination (see
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001316.htm).
