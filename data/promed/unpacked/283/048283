I would be interested to know how the contacts of this case of meningitis
on the flight were managed?
With the increase of air travel to various parts of the world and shorter
flying times, we are likely to see more of these cases either during
transit or after disembarkation at the airport.
At Heathrow Airport-London, we see at least 1 case of meningococcal
meningitis per year and a number of suspected cases. We are also
occasionally asked by the Port Health Authority at other airports to deal
with the contacts of meningitis cases who disembark in London.
We do have a protocol but would like to refine it, and to share with others
who have similar experiences.
