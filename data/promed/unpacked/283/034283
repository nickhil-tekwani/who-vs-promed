Viral disease claims 200 sheep, goats
-------------------------------------
A viral disease epidemic has claimed over 200 sheep and goats near
here [Kharan]. The disease is so dangerous it was not being controlled
by veterinary and livestock department officials. According to
details, a viral disease was rapidly spreading in Aabdari area some 45
km [30 mi] northeast of Kharan.

[Results of clinical and laboratory investigations into the event
described are anticipated. One of the main possible causes of such
mortality is peste des petits ruminants (PPR, sheep and goat plague)
which is endemic in Pakistan; however, no data on the clinical disease
seen is included. In case PPR is identified, further losses can be
prevented by vaccination.

[It is interesting how everyone jumps to the conclusion that an
undiagnosed disease, in animal or humans, must be caused by a virus.
There are, unfortunately, plenty of diseases caused by bacteria and
parasites as well. - Mod.JW]
