I am forwarding this response from Dr. Joseph Annelli regarding National
Epidemic Response for Animal Diseases, posted in ProMED Digest, Thursday, 4
February 1999, Volume 99 : Number 023.
There is a national epidemic response resource for animal disease outbreaks.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) through our Animal Health Emergency Management
System has teams of veterinarians that go on site when State animal
agricultural officials request help.
APHIS calls their teams "Early Response Teams" or ERT. They are comprised
of veterinarians with expertise in foreign animal disease diagnosis,
epidemiology and pathology. These veterinarians also have advanced degrees
or are graduates of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC)
Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) and, therefore, have a good
understanding of zoonotic agents and their expression in animal outbreaks.
They also contact local public health officials when necessary. Since the
inception of the ERT in 1996, they have been called to two other incidents;
the atypical PRRS [Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome] outbreak,
and an equine botulism outbreak in New Mexico, USA.
Presently, APHIS has an ERT in Arizona working with State Animal Health
officials and local veterinarians for the outbreak described in the
ProMEDmail thread, "Undiagnosed horse illness - USA (Arizona)". To obtain
the latest information on this outbreak, please call the Arizona Department
of Agriculture at 800-294-0305.
For more information on our APHIS emergency management activities or the
United States Animal Health Emergency Management System, please call
1-800-940-6254.
