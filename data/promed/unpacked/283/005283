[1] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Bannu): 2 new cases, media report
Date: Sat 11 May 2019

Two new polio cases were reported from Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP] on [Sat 11 May 2019], raising the number of polio victims to 15 in the country this year [2019].

Health experts, however, feared the number of polio cases would grow further by the end of 2019, as health and polio workers have been facing multiple problems to eradicate the disease in Pakistan and particularly in KP and erstwhile tribal areas. According to officials, the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad confirmed the 2 new polio cases.

Among the 2 children, one is a 6-month girl baby diagnosed with polio. She belongs to Kotka Zafar Khan village of union council Ghora Bakakhel in Bannu district.

As per clinical history of the child, as reported by her father, the child was stable when she developed high grade fever on [16 Apr 2019]. She was then taken to a local physician and he prescribed her some medicine for fever.

According to her father, the child developed left-sided weakness on [18 Apr 2019], for which she was taken to the same physician on [20 Apr 2019] who advised CT scan, which was normal.

The child was then referred to Dr Tariq Ayub, who labelled the child as hemiplegia and reported it as an AFP [acute flaccid paralysis] on [21 Apr 2019]. The child belongs to a poor family and authorities concerned in their reports claimed she had not received any dose of routine immunisation.

The 2nd child, diagnosed with polio, is an 8-month baby boy who also belongs to Bazida Kokalkhel, Lalozai union council, in Bannu district. Officials quoting his mother said that the child was having fever for 3 to 4 days, for which they took him to a local physician on [26 Apr 2019], where a medical technician gave him an intramuscular injection on one gluteal muscle and then again another IM injection was given to him on [27 Apr 2019] on another gluteal muscle in the morning.

On the same day, his mother noticed weakness in both his lower limbs and left upper limb, for which they visited Women and Children Hospital Bannu wherefrom physician Dr Samiullah reported the case as AFP and labelled the child as "left hemiplegia" on [28 Apr 2019].

The child was later taken to Peshawar for further treatment and was admitted to the Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) Peshawar. As happens in each and every polio case, officials concerned also claimed that the 2nd child had also not received any dose of routine immunisation.

Like other areas, where polio workers have been facing security issues or refusals from parents or other elements opposing vaccination, here too the child receives one dose during supplementary immunisation (SIAs) activities and during the SIAs, the child was only finger marked and OPV [oral polio vaccine] was not given to the children. During the last 6 rounds up to March 2019, the child received no dose.

The child belongs to a poor family and his father is a carpenter. Out of 15 polio cases, 8 [10] cases have been reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

[Very discouraging to read of yet another 2 newly confirmed cases. Both come from Bannu district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. To understand further what is happening, I strongly suggest reading the Washington Post article in item [3] below.

[2] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: more on new cases
Date: Mon 13 May 2019

https://tribune.com.pk/story/1971568/1-two-polio-cases-surface-bannu/


With 2 more cases coming to the fore in Bannu on [Sat 11 May 2019], the total number of polio cases in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) have reached 10. While in the country, the number has touched 15.

"Of the 10 cases, 5 have been reported in Bannu, 2 in North Waziristan, and 1 each in Bajaur, Hangu, and Khyber district so far in 2019," said provincial government officials on [Sun 12 May 2019].

"The virus has been detected from the sewage of Peshawar, Bannu, Mardan, Dera Ismail Khan, and South Waziristan districts," they added.

An official communiqu√© from the federal capital to the Emergency Operation Centre Peshawar stated that the Peshawar incident in April [2019] had increased the risk of children contracting the poliovirus in the province. In April [2019], protesters burnt down a health facility in Peshawar following reports that multiple children had fallen sick after being administered anti-polio vaccine.

The protest was triggered by hearsay as medics at Peshawar's Lady Reading Hospital, where most of the children were taken, said that an overwhelming majority of them were fine.

The protesters mobbed the Basic Health Unit Mashokhel and ransacked the premises before setting it on fire.

No one was hurt as the staff had left before the protesters reached there. However, the untoward incident has created panic among the polio teams.

The letter from Focal Person to the Prime Minister on Polio Babar bin Atta stated that the current situation needed to be dealt with efficiently and aggressively through collective efforts by all stakeholders.

The letter also stated that the main responsibility was on the shoulders of the respective district management.

In order to deliberate on the ongoing polio situation in the province, especially in Peshawar and Bannu, a high-level delegation, headed by the federal minister of state for national health services, is expected to visit Peshawar on [Wed 15 May 2019].

Atta has issued directions for holding a meeting of the provincial task force on polio eradication on the same day. The members of the task force, including provincial health minister, chief secretary, K-P IG police, Peshawar commissioner, have been directed to participate in the meeting.

[3] Pakistan: challenges to eradication
Date: Fri 10 May 2019
Source: The Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistan-had-all-but-eliminated-polio-then-things-went-badly-wrong/2019/05/10/87f328e8-711c-11e9-9331-30bc5836f48e_story.html


Nobody saw it coming. The virus was so close to being wiped out. Millions of young children had been repeatedly inoculated, and in March [2019] older ones were added in a final nationwide vaccine push to ensure that Pakistan -- 1 of only 3 countries where polio remains endemic -- could be officially declared polio-free.

But another danger was lurking, in the same communities where vaccination efforts had long been underway. It was fear and suspicion, and it was so visceral -- and so fast-moving in the digital age -- that a single rumor of vaccinated children falling sick in a village school last month [April 2019] triggered panic and violence nationwide.

Since then, the anti-polio drive has been suspended until July 2019 while officials scramble to regroup. Half a dozen vaccinators or their guards have been killed, and new cases of children with numb or paralyzed limbs are being reported every week, setting back years of effort to eliminate the virus, health workers say.

"We blundered badly. We wanted to achieve a technical and operational success, a data-driven masterpiece. But we forgot that for a father and mother, the most sensitive thing is their child," said Babar bin Atta, the government's top anti-polio official. Despite intensive efforts to educate the public about the benefits and safety of the vaccine, he said, "we underestimated the degree of community resistance."

At a time when fear and rejection of vaccines are rising globally and measles cases are spiking, polio is seeing at least a momentary resurgence in Pakistan. Between 1994 and last year [2018], the number of infected children in Pakistan plunged from 20 000 to just 12. But 15 new cases have been reported this year [2019]. Unless the vaccination drive starts up again soon, some health experts fear that new cases could exceed 50 this year.

The threat of polio remains relatively low compared with that of measles, which was officially eradicated in the United States in 2000 but appeared in 350 new cases in 2018 and more than 700 this year [2019]. Across Europe, 34 000 measles cases were reported in January [2019] and February [2019] alone.

Measles can be fatal, especially to babies, and it caused more than 110 000 deaths worldwide in 2017. Polio, though rarely fatal, is incurable, and it can permanently paralyze a child within hours of infection. It is spread through fecal matter, especially in poor and unsanitary conditions, and is endemic only in Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

"It is so depressing. One day of drama has ruined 3 years of work," said a government epidemiologist in Pakistan, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. "People who used to welcome our teams into their homes are now closing the doors."

The hysteria that started at a school in the northwestern village of Mashokhel -- and quickly spread via mosque loudspeakers and WhatsApp -- had both unique cultural roots and broader, modern-day lessons.

The northwest tribal belt, an ethnic Pashtun region near the Afghan border and the epicenter of polio in Pakistan, is deeply conservative, religious, and suspicious of authority. Refusals for polio vaccines were once common there; many people suspected that the drops were part of a Western plot to control the Muslim birthrate, and Islamist militants periodically attacked vaccination teams.

Over the past several years, Atta and health officials said, educational campaigns and support from Muslim clerics helped change public opinion, extremist groups were driven from the region, and vaccine refusals plunged. But this spring [2019], when officials announced that all children up to age 10 would be required to get polio drops, suspicion began to creep up again.

"We created a nuisance," Atta said. "People got fed up with our teams making so many visits and asking so many questions. It only took one spark."

On [22 Apr 2019], vaccinators spent the morning at a school in Mashokhel, a few miles outside Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Soon after they left, school administrators reported that dozens of students were vomiting and fainting. Among local residents, long suppressed suspicions burst into a frenzy. An angry mob attacked the school and burned down the local health clinic.

"People were pelting my house with stones," said Arshad Khan, 35, a longtime local healthcare worker. He said that even during the years when Islamist militants were attacking vaccination teams, he stayed on the job. "There is nothing wrong with the drops," he said, "but this misunderstanding, these fake reports, have hurt our efforts all over the country."

As the news circulated that day via social media and cellphones, frightened parents rushed 40 000 children to hospitals in Peshawar. Health officials later reported that almost all were found healthy and sent home, but by then it was too late to contain the panic. Across the country, hundreds of thousands of parents refused to let their children receive the drops, and the vaccination drive was suspended.

Police arrested 16 people in connection with an alleged plot to sabotage the polio campaign, including several staff members at the school, and pernicious messages and videos were posted online that added to the crisis. One showed a man, who was later arrested, instructing schoolboys to lie down on hospital cots and pretend to be sick. Another showed an unidentified man denouncing polio vaccinators as pimps and prostitutes working for the United States.

Pakistani officials placed some of the blame on Facebook, saying they were in the process of asking the company to take down the posts. "They call this free expression, but there are some crazy pages with people playing a dirty game," Atta said, adding that Facebook has millions of users in Pakistan. "They are exhorting anti-polio elements to go after our workers. People are being killed."

Polio workers have long been targeted by Islamist militants, with more than 100 killed in the past decade. But over time, the attacks dwindled to a few incidents as public support grew and militancy was quashed. Now, in just 3 weeks, 6 vaccinators or their guards have been shot dead in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. Some attackers, officials said, may not be religious fanatics but tribal militia members trying to "protect" their areas.

In Peshawar, people are still shaken by the Mashokhel scare, and this week some said it had revived their suspicion of polio drops. Even some local officials said they plan to refuse to vaccinate their children. Some demanded to know why the government kept focusing on this particular disease and not others that are more common, such as malaria or dengue.

"I don't understand why the government is forcing children to be vaccinated," said [AA], 38, a trading merchant who said he had now decided not to let his 2-year-old daughter receive the drops. "They keep insisting, but I keep refusing. I am the father of my children, and it is my choice."

In Rawalpindi, a large city in Punjab province, water and sewer samples from many poor Pashtun communities have repeatedly tested positive for the polio virus. Health officials said they had hoped to vaccinate about 14 000 children there in the past month, but more than half of the parents refused. Several vaccinators were beaten.

Noor Jahan, 30, a veteran vaccinator, made the rounds last week [week of 29 Apr 2019] in a Pashtun neighborhood she has visited dozens of times. She chatted with families, trying to convince them that the drops were safe and that their children still needed a series of doses to become immune. People were polite but not really swayed.

"Look at how we live. The water is low, the sewers are bad, there is no health care when we get sick. But by hook or by crook, the government keeps bringing these drops to our houses and chasing our children in the street. Why?" said [AB], 35, a father of 2. "This is not up to the vaccine or the virus. It is up to God."

[The Washington Post article is a very sobering look at what is going on in Pakistan, where it is clear the anti-vaccination movement is taking an aggressive position in the country and using old suspicions as well as new fake events to further scare parents away from vaccinating their children. As the article points out, there is a mix of old with new technology, using social media to amplify the scare tactics and sabotage vaccination efforts.

There seems to be a clear role for the assistance of medical anthropologists who can provide guidance in how to overcome this fear mongering and return the country to the former path approaching eradication of the disease with interruption of transmission of the WPV.

A very disturbing observation is the former report we posted stating that there was 95 percent coverage of the target population with the polio vaccine during the April 2019 vaccination campaign in the country (see Poliomyelitis update (34): global (Pakistan, Niger), follow-up 20190509.6462140). The reports strongly suggest that the coverage in KP was significantly lower than 95 percent, leading to concerns rather than optimism about the march towards eradication. - Mod.MPP

Despite great differences in geography and culture, there are some shared aspects in the community resistance to the polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan and the Ebola control efforts in northeast Congo. For the latter, see, for example: https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/05/10/721020887/threats-by-text-a-mob-outside-the-door-what-health-workers-face-in-the-ebola-zon.

In both situations, individuals or organized groups have exploited local disease ignorance and distrust of national authorities to foment violence against public health teams. This misinformation and distrust have culminated in otherwise unfathomable destruction of healthcare clinics and murders of healthcare workers. As highlighted in the articles above, local people naturally become suspicious about the singular attention devoted to only one disease, using resources that are visibly funded by foreign agencies. Meanwhile, they perceive that the government neglects their basic needs and their children continue to die of preventable diseases, such as malaria and cholera, which don't enjoy the international attention devoted to polio and Ebola. Perhaps, indeed, a radical rethink of disease control strategies is overdue, one that takes into account the broader health needs and priorities of the local population. - Mod.LXL]
