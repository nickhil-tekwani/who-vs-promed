Barley yellow dwarf [BYDV] [is] developing in oats. A few fields that were recently scouted were found to have virus infected plants [which] were few and scattered throughout. Advanced symptoms included leaves that were yellowing from the tips and initial symptoms included parallel yellow and green streaks running the length of the leaves.

In South Dakota, the most common aphids that spread BYDV include the bird cherry oat aphids and English grain aphids. Although incoming aphids can be already carrying the virus, within field sources of inoculum will increase the risk for BYD.

Oat varieties may vary in their susceptibility to BYD. Although no data are available on oat variety response to BYD, if a planted variety is showing high incidence of BYD, a different variety can be selected for the next growing season.

[Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and affects a wide range of grass species (Gramineae) including cereal crops like barley, wheat, oats, rice, maize, and rye. It is the most destructive of the virus diseases for wheat, but oats are particularly susceptible. Grain yields may be reduced by one-third. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species; a distinctive red discolouration of leaves in oats), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Yield reduction is most severe if infection occurs at the seedling stage. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within a field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family Luteoviridae (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species (family Aphididae) and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. The bird cherry(-oat) aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and (English) grain (wheat) aphid (_Sitobion avenae_) are vectors of the severe _Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV_ (type member of genus _Luteovirus_). Coinfections of several BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either more severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection) symptoms, depending on the virus partners.

The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs ("green bridge"). Disease management includes use of crop cultivars with reduced sensitivity to the viruses and control of the aphid vectors. To protect beneficial insects such as bees or other pollinators, some neonicotinoid insecticides have now been banned in a number of countries which, unfortunately, is leading to increased use of other agrochemicals also under debate for potential environmental implications.
