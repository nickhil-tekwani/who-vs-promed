[1] South Korea study: indoor exposures and infections
Date: Wed 9 Dec 2020 11.23 AM

https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-12-09/five-minutes-from-20-feet-away-south-korean-study-shows-perils-of-indoor-dining-for-covid-19?_amp=true&__twitter_impression=true


Dr. Lee Ju-hyung has largely avoided restaurants in recent months, but on the few occasions he's dined out, he's developed a strange, if sensible, habit: whipping out a small anemometer to check the airflow. It's a precaution he has been taking since a June [2020] experiment when he and colleagues recreated the conditions at a restaurant in Jeonju, a city in the southwest of South Korea, where diners contracted COVID-19 from an out-of-town visitor. Among them was a high school student who was infected with the coronavirus after 5 minutes of exposure from more than 20 feet away.

The results of the study, for which Lee and other epidemiologists enlisted the help of an engineer who specializes in aerodynamics, were published last week in the Journal of Korean Medical Science. The conclusions raised concerns that the widely accepted standard of 6 feet of social distance may not be far enough to keep people safe.

The study -- adding to a growing body of evidence on airborne transmission of the virus -- highlighted how South Korea's meticulous and often invasive contact tracing regime has enabled researchers to closely track how the virus moves through populations.

"In this outbreak, the distances between infector and infected persons were....farther than the generally accepted 2 meter [6.6 foot] droplet transmission range," the study's authors wrote. "The guidelines on quarantine and epidemiological investigation must be updated to reflect these factors for control and prevention of COVID-19."

KJ Seung, an infectious disease expert and chief of strategy and policy for the nonprofit Partners in Health's Massachusetts COVID response, said the study was a reminder of the risk of indoor transmission as many nations hunker down for the winter. The official definition of a "close contact" -- 15 minutes, within 6 feet -- isn't foolproof.

In his work on Massachusetts' contact tracing program, he said, business owners and school administrators have fixated on the "close contact" standard, thinking just 14 minutes of exposure, or spending hours in the same room at a distance farther than 6 feet, is safe. "There's a real misconception about this in the public." said Seung, who was not involved in the South Korea study. "They're thinking, if I'm not a close contact, I will magically be protected."

Seung said the study pointed to the need for contact tracers around the world to broaden the net in looking for people who had potentially been infected and to alert people at lower risk that they may have been exposed.

Linsey Marr, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Virginia Tech who studies the transmission of viruses in the air, said the 5-minute window in which the student, identified in the study as "A," was infected was notable because the droplet was large enough to carry a viral load, but small enough to travel 20 feet through the air. "'A' had to get a large dose in just 5 minutes, provided by larger aerosols probably about 50 microns," she said. "Large aerosols or small droplets overlapping in that gray area can transmit disease further than one or 2 meters [3.3 to 6.6 feet] if you have strong airflow."

The South Korean study began with a mystery. When a high school senior in Jeonju tested positive for the coronavirus on [17 Jun 2020], epidemiologists were stumped because the city hadn't had a COVID-19 case in 2 months. North Jeolla province, where Jeonju is located, hadn't had one for a month. The girl hadn't traveled out of the region in recent weeks, and had largely gone from home to school and back.

Contact tracers turned to the country's Epidemic Investigation Support System, a digital platform introduced in South Korea amid the pandemic that allows investigators to access cellphone location information and credit card data of infected individuals in as little as 10 minutes.

Cellphone GPS data revealed that the student had briefly overlapped with another known coronavirus patient from a different city and province altogether, a door-to-door saleswoman who had visited Jeonju. Their connection was a 1st-floor restaurant on the afternoon of [12 Jun 2020] -- for just 5 minutes.

Authorities in the city of Daejeon, where the door-to-door saleswoman was visiting from, said the woman did not tell contact tracers she'd visited Jeonju, about an hour's drive away, where her company held a meeting with 80 people on the 6th floor of the building with the restaurant.

Lee, a professor at the Jeonbuk National University Medical School who has also been helping local authorities carry out epidemiological investigations, went to the restaurant and was surprised by how far the 2 had been sitting. CCTV footage showed the 2 never spoke, or touched any surfaces in common -- door handles, cups or cutlery. From the sway of a light fixture, he could tell the air conditioning unit in the ceiling was on at the time.

Lee and his team recreated the conditions in the restaurant -- researchers sat at tables as stand-ins -- and measured the airflow. The high school student and a 3rd diner who was infected had been sitting directly along the flow of air from an air conditioner; other diners who had their back to the airflow were not infected. Through genome sequencing, the team confirmed the 3 patients' virus genomic types matched.

"Incredibly, despite sitting a far distance away, the airflow came down the wall and created a valley of wind. People who were along that line were infected," Lee said. "We concluded this was a droplet transmission, and beyond 2 meters."

The pattern of infection in the restaurant showed it was transmission through small droplets or larger aerosols either landing on the face or being breathed in, said Marr, the Virginia Tech professor who was not involved in the study. The measured air velocity in the restaurant, which did not have windows or a ventilation system, was about a meter per second, the equivalent of a blowing fan.

"Eating indoors at a restaurant is one of the riskiest things you can do in a pandemic," she said. "Even if there is distancing, as this shows and other studies show, the distancing is not enough."

The study was published at a time when South Korea, like many other countries, is on edge amid a new wave of COVID-19 infections, with daily case rates hovering around 600 in recent days. Seoul, the capital, this week began requiring restaurants to close by 9 p.m., limiting coffee shops to take-out only and forcing clubs and karaokes to shut down.

The research echoed the findings of a July study out of Guangzhou, China, which looked at infections among 3 families who dined at a restaurant along the flow of air conditioning in tables that were 3feet apart, overlapping for about an hour. Ten of the diners tested positive for the coronavirus. Contact tracers in South Korea similarly mapped out a large outbreak at a Starbucks in Paju in August [2020], when 27 people were infected by a woman sitting under a 2nd-floor ceiling air conditioning unit.

Seung, of Partners in Health, said by retracing infection routes epidemiological investigators in South Korea had helped researchers worldwide better understand the coronavirus' spread.

"I showed it to my team doing contact tracing in Massachusetts, and their jaws are dropping," Seung said. "We know how hard it is to do something like that -- it's impressive."

[2] COVID-19 vaccine performance
[2a] AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine
Date: Wed 9 Dec 2020
Source: GenomeWeb/buzzfeed News [edited]
https://www.genomeweb.com/scan/still-questions?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium= email&utm_campaign=Scan%20Wed%202020-12-09&utm_term=The%20Scan% 20Bulletin #.X9ET0dhKhPY


Researchers from AstraZeneca and Oxford University have published results from their SARS-CoV-2 clinical trial, but BuzzFeed News reports that scientists critical of their earlier results announcement still have questions.

In November [2020], AstraZeneca and Oxford University announced that their candidate vaccine could have up to 90% efficacy when given as a half-dose followed a month later by a full vaccine dose, while a 2 full-dose regimen had an efficacy of 62%. Overall, they said their findings suggest an average efficacy of 70%.

However, revelations that the half-dose followed by a full-dose regimen was the result of an error and was primarily given to people under the age of 55 raised concerns about the trial, as did an apparent pooling of data from different arms of the study, BuzzFeed News writes.

As Nature News notes, the AstraZeneca and Oxford University team is the 1st of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine makers to publish their clinical trial data. In the Lancet, the researchers provide efficacy results from their trials in the UK and Brazil and safety results from the trials in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa.

"The efficacy and the safety are fine," the University of Leeds' Stephen Griffin tells Nature News. "Overall, what you can say is that it does work."

BuzzFeed News, however, notes that the paper doesn't clear up all the confusion. "In terms of policy making, the 70% number remains hard to interpret," University of Florida's Natalie Dean tells it.

[2b] UK Roll out: early polls on Pfizer/Nanotech vaccine
Date: Wed 9 Dec 2020
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/9/uk-investigates-possible-allergic-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccine


United Kingdom regulators have had 2 reports of possible allergic reactions from people who took part in the 1st day of Britain's mass vaccination programme against COVID-19. Dr. June Raine, head of the UK's medical regulatory agency, MHRA, reported those reactions as she testified on [Wed 9 Dec 2020] to a parliamentary committee.

The UK began vaccinating elderly people and medical workers with a vaccine developed by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech on [Tue 8 Dec 2020], the world's 1st roll-out of the vaccine.

"We're looking at 2 case reports of allergic reactions,'' she said. "We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn't a feature. But if we need to strengthen our advice, now that we have had this experience with the vulnerable populations, the groups who have been selected as a priority, we get that advice to the field immediately," she said.

Raine's comments came as part of a general discussion of how her agency will continue to monitor people who receive the Pfizer vaccine, which was authorised for emergency use last week [week 30 Nov to 6 Dec 2020].

Health officials said people who have a "significant history'' of allergic reactions should not receive the new vaccine while experts investigate the reactions.

Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the National Health Service in England, said health authorities were acting on a recommendation from the MHRA. "As is common with new vaccines, the MHRA has advised, on a precautionary basis, that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after 2 people with a history of significant allergic reactions responded adversely yesterday,'' Powis said in a statement. "Both are recovering well."

A total of 70 UK hospitals started the vaccine programme on [Tue 8 Dec 2020]. The UK has recorded 62 000 COVID-19 related deaths - more than any other country has reported in Europe, and at least 1.7 million cases.

The first 800 000 doses are going to people over 80 who are either hospitalised or already have outpatient appointments scheduled, along with nursing home workers. Others will have to wait their turn.

The UK, home to about 67 million people, has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 20 million people, as it is given in 2 injections, 21 days apart.

There are 3 routes for transporting the vaccine into the country, which officials have warned will be challenging because it needs to be shipped and stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94F), or below. Because the vaccine needs to be stored at this level, to begin with, people will only be inoculated at hospitals, rather than in nursing homes.

[2c] India: Vaccine approval and roll out plans
Date: Mon 7 Dec 2020
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/7/indias-serum-institute-seeks-emergency-use-nod-for-covid-vaccine


The Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine producer by volume, has sought government approval for emergency-use authorisation of the coronavirus vaccine that it has developed in partnership with the University of Oxford and British drugmaker AstraZeneca.

The experimental vaccine can be stored at 2 to 8 deg. Celsius and can be distributed more easily in India, which has the world's 2nd-highest number of infections at 9.6 million.

The company has applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), with Poonawalla saying the vaccine will "save countless lives" without giving details. The move comes close on the heels of Pfizer Inc applying for a similar authorisation of its coronavirus vaccine in India on [Sat 5 Dec 2020].

Last month [November 2020], Pfizer and BioNTech said their experimental vaccine was 90% effective while the US biotech firm Moderna Inc said its COVID-19 vaccine showed 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19.

According to Indian media reports, Serum's application stated that data from four clinical studies, 2 in the UK and one each in Brazil and India, showed that the vaccine, Covishield, was highly effective against severe COVID-19 infections.

Last month [November 2020], a 40-year-old man from the southern city of Chennai had alleged that he suffered serious "neurological and psychological" symptoms after receiving the vaccine in a trial being run by the Serum Institute of India. But the Indian government last week said it had found no reason to stop the Oxford vaccine trials in India after reviewing the volunteer's allegation of serious adverse effects. The vaccine is currently in the Phase III clinical trial in India.

Phase III trials of India's first indigenous vaccine started last month. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech company has been developing the vaccine, Covaxin, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - India's premier medical research body.

Last month [November 2020], AstraZeneca said it might have to run an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine, after concerns were raised about the effectiveness of its jab. Earlier, the British company said their drug had proved on average 70-percent effective.

Experts warn that before rolling out any vaccine, it should pass through scientific scrutiny. "Before the government rolls out the vaccine, it must be very much clear to the public - the whole process, the vaccine manufacturing and everything should come out in the scientific papers. It should be provided to the scientific community to scrutinise to see whether they (manufacturers) have rushed to make the vaccine just to get a monetary benefit or just to save the government's face," said former president of AIIMS Resident Doctors' Association (RDA) Harjit Singh Bhatti.

Dr. Jayaprakash Muliyil, an epidemiologist at the Christian Medical College in southern state of Tamil Nadu, added that it would not be an easy task to carry out the vaccination drive across India. "It will be logistically very difficult for India to take the vaccine to every village," he said, adding that the distribution drive "needs a lot of training and the cold chain support needs to be very strong". He however, said that a trial should be carried out before using any foreign-made vaccine like Pfizer.

"The regulatory business in India demands that we test it here on Indian population. We need to look for evidence whether this particular vaccine is going to behave the same way in India as it does in other countries," Muliyil told Al Jazeera.

[As the roll out of the various vaccines authorized and approved for emergency use ensues, there may be many challenges. The SARS-CoV2 vaccines' pre-testing has been done in record time periods and the 'real' test of the efficacy, adverse reactions and ultimate impact in interrupting viral transmission for each of these products will be on populations that receive them. The success of COVID-19 vaccination campaign will therefore heavily rely on public trust that the vaccines are not only effective, but also safe. Already there is a lot of incorrect rumors and myths with the vaccines that are being made available coupled with wild conspiracy theories threatening the ultimate uptake.

In order to build that trust, this 'infodemic' needs to be handled with technical evidence; the medical and scientific communities have a responsibility to engage in difficult discussions with the public about the significant fraction of people who will experience temporary side effects from these vaccines and the risk versus benefit equation that applies to the current global situation. - Mod.UBA].

[3] Integrating COVID-19 in routine surveillance
Date: Dec 2020
Source: WHO Influenza Newsletter, Issue no. 14 [edited]
https://us8.campaign-archive.com/?e=__test_email__&u=c35eb4938c7246655f6384192&id=71390dc70d#Brazil


When COVID-19 reached Brazil, existing surveillance systems were adapted to include the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus; these are now being routinely used to report data and support decision-making in the ongoing pandemic.

Since 2009, Brazil has made great strides in monitoring influenza and other respiratory viruses. After the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, the Ministry of Health, through its Secretariat for Health Services (SVS), added a system for the surveillance of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). This system and the existing sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system were integrated into a surveillance network for influenza and other respiratory viruses.

The integrated system has long been used to detect and monitor influenza and other respiratory diseases. Now it is also being used to monitor COVID-19. As part of the pandemic response, all health facilities that manage ILI must investigate and notify all ILI cases, regardless of whether they belong to sentinel network.

To monitor hospitalized cases of COVID-19, the Ministry of Health also incorporated laboratory and epidemiological surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the procedures established for the SARI system.

And through Brazil's Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (SIVEP-Gripe), sentinel units have integrated the detection of SARS-CoV-2 into their routine activities for monitoring other respiratory diseases. Epidemiological data for influenza and other respiratory viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) continue to be reported through FluNet and FluID. All COVID-19 epidemiological data are reported through Ministry of Health Epidemiological Bulletins.

At the same time, the Ministry of Health equipped state laboratories with automated extractors, scaling up their capacity for COVID-19 testing. This has been critical in ensuring the availability of laboratory diagnosis to confirm cases and guide health care strategies, isolation and biosafety for health professionals. It also boosted the integrated ILI/SARI surveillance capacity for respiratory infections needed to respond to the ongoing pandemic.

In Brazil, SARI surveillance in the context of COVID-19 has provided a better understanding of the dynamics of community transmission. It has also enabled: the monitoring of severity and trends; the detection outbreaks in the community; and a description of the co-circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses.

Brazil is committed to strengthening both the laboratory and epidemiological components of its integrated surveillance system. Surveillance performance indicators are improving, although their use could be further strengthened. Other priorities in the medium and long term include continuing to adapt information systems to integrate COVID-19, especially as ILI/SARI sentinel surveillance will likely remain the primary approach to detecting and monitoring the disease.

[Both Influenza and SARS-CoV2 are respiratory pathogens with many common characteristics, most prominently the potential for epidemics and pandemics. In this regard, WHO has recently published 2 important documents. The first one is a policy brief on 'Readiness for influenza during the COVID-19 pandemic' which can be accessed at https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Influenza-readiness-COVID-19-2020.1. The brief provides a concise summary of information and considerations to ensure optimal management of influenza during the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes a list of technical guidance and other resources to assist policy makers with monitoring the situation, preventing seasonal influenza, reducing severe complications and mortality, protecting specific populations and communicating to and engaging with the public.

The 2nd document is an updated interim guidance titled 'Maintaining surveillance of influenza and monitoring SARS-CoV-2' https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/maintaining-surveillance-of-influenza-and-monitoring-sars-cov-2-adapting-global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system-(gisrs)-and-sentinel-systems-during-the-covid-19-pandemic. This interim guidance is most useful for countries interested in monitoring relative circulations of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The document provides practical information to maintain surveillance of influenza and monitor SARS-CoV-2 using existing surveillance systems. It contains updated considerations for addressing disruptions in the influenza sentinel surveillance and extending to include COVID-19 wherever possible. Updated algorithms for testing of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 for surveillance are also included.

The important message here is that surveillance for other important pathogens needs to be strengthened using principles of integrated disease surveillance and response as this will help harness the capacities and resources acquired during the pandemic towards development of more resilient public health systems. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet)].

Data by country, area, or territory for 9 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC9_1607616946.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 43.7% of daily case numbers and 28.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 28.8 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Panama, Chile, and Peru. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Paraguay, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Costa Ria, and Ecuador.

- The European region reported 40.5% of daily case numbers and 55.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 20.8 million. Countries not reporting cases today (9 Dec 2020) include Spain and Kazakhstan. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Turkey, Russia, Germany, Italy, France, Ukraine, and UK. There are 25 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.4 6.2% of daily case numbers and 7.0 6.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.25 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, UAE, Tunisia, and Lebanon. Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.4% of daily case numbers and 2.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.57 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Algeria, Nigeria, and Botswana.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.99% of daily case numbers and 1.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.93 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, French Polynesia, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 8.0% of the daily newly reported cases and 6.1% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.19 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Myanmar.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. Japan is the dominant country in the Western Pacific region, while South Korea continues to report more than 600 cases daily; Russia and now France dominate in the European region. India continues to dominate in the South East Asia region, South Africa in the African region, and Iran in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.
