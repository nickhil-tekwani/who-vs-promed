Elephant dies of anthrax
------------------------
An elephant died of anthrax in Noam Range under Kalimpong forest
division recently. Its body was recovered on Sunday [18 May 2008] and
the examination of its blood sample confirmed that the pachyderm had
died of anthrax.

The forest department has started a thorough screening of the forests
in North Bengal to find out whether any other elephants have died recently.

[As has been noted previously anthrax has been reported sporadically
in Indian elephants for decades. However, when investigated there is
not unusually an ongoing covert problem in forest deer, which has
spectacularly and suddenly spilt over into these undeniable and
obvious pachyderm cases. Then folk sit up and pay attention.
Elephants dying is but a part of a larger problem. Our thanks yet
again to Satadal for forwarding this report.

Though this is technically in the state of West Bengal, the site is
in the far north of this wandering border state with
Kalimpong/Kalimpang close to the southern border of Sikkim. See
