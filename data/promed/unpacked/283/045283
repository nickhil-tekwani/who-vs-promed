By 27 Oct 2005, 32 cases of gastroenteritis due to Salmonella [_S.
enterica_ serotype] Goldcoast had been detected in tourists who are known
to have stayed in Majorca (Spain) during Sep and Oct 2005.
Health Protection Scotland has reported 24 cases in Scottish tourists to
Enter-net (the international surveillance network for the enteric
infections Salmonella and VTEC O157,
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm>). By 26 Oct 2005, the
Health Protection Surveillance Centre of Ireland had reported 2 cases of
serotype Goldcoast in tourists. There have also been 3 cases in Swedish
tourists, 2 cases in Danish tourists and 1 case in a Norwegian tourist.
The Health Protection Agency's Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens in England
and Wales has reported 68 cases of serotype Goldcoast between 1-25 Oct
2005, compared with only 3 cases in the same period in 2004. The majority
of cases are in patients who are believed to have visited Majorca. Phage
typing results that are available indicate that the same type is being
identified.
Illness onset for the 20 cases for which information is available was
between 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2005. Only 5 patients had symptom onset during
their holidays in Majorca; most patients had symptom onset between 1 and 10
days after returning to their home countries. The patients stayed in
several different towns and different apartments throughout Majorca between
13 Sep and 10 Oct 2005.
The regional health authorities in the Balearic Islands have informed
Spain's Instituto de Salud Carlos III that they have not detected any
Spanish case of serotype Goldcoast in Majorca in 2005. The Spanish National
Reference Laboratory has found 8 Goldcoast isolates between January and
August 2005 in different regions throughout Spain. None of the isolates
were from the Balearic Islands.
Epidemiological information that could identify the source or possible
places where food was eaten or acquired is limited so far. An international
investigation has been initiated with a view to identifying the vehicle(s)
of infection in Majorca.
Information on any other _S. Goldcoast_ cases related to travel to Majorca
should be sent to Dr Alison Smith-Palmer, coordinator of the Scottish
investigation (<Alison.SmithPalmer@hps.scot.nhs.uk>), and Drs Gloria
Hernandez Pezzi and Pilar Soler Crespo, coordinators of the Spanish
investigation (<ghpezzi@isciii.es> and <psoler@isciii.es>), and copied to
the Enter-net scientific coordinator (<Enter-net@hpa.org.uk>).

[Majorca -- spelled Mallorca in Catalan and Spanish -- the largest of the
Balearic Islands, and along with its sister islands of Menorca and Ibiza,
lies in the Mediterranean Sea off the southeast coast of mainland Spain.
This outbreak of salmonellosis in tourists is likely to continue to grow as
more cases identified in other countries are linked. The vehicle for
transmission is yet unknown but will likely be identified after the results
of the investigation are available.
Other outbreaks of this serotype of _S. enterica_ have been transmitted by
watercress sprouts (1), fermented sausage (2) and cheddar chesse (3).
