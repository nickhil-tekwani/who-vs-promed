A total of 4 people who were in flood-ravaged Theodore [a village in
central Queensland] in the past few weeks have been confirmed to have
a severe bacterial infection.

Theodore Dr Bruce Chater said there were 4 confirmed and one
suspected case of leptospirosis. "I haven't seen a case of
Leptospirosis in 20 years," said the doctor who has been servicing
the community since 1981. "Probably because it's been dry for 20
years. In this case, it was very severe." Dr Chater said one person
had been in Theodore just after the floods and had gone back to
Brisbane and presented to health professionals in the state's
capital. He said another person was transferred to Brisbane while 2
people were treated in Moura Hospital [located in the town of Moura,
43km [26.7 miles] north of Theodore, see
<http://maps.bonzle.com/c/a?a=p&p=1166&cmd=sp>].

Dr Chater said there were concerns for the patients and what people
might get it. He said there were no more concerns in the community as
the mud had now dried. Dr Chater said people started presenting with
symptoms the day after the community was allowed back into Theodore.
"We came back on the Friday and they started getting sick on the
Saturday," he said.

The infection is commonly transmitted to humans by allowing water
that has been contaminated by animal urine to come in contact with
unhealed breaks in the skin, the eyes, or with the mucous membranes.

[Significant flooding occurred in many areas of the Australian state
of Queensland during late December 2010 and early January 2011, with
three quarters of the state, including the village of Theodore,
declared a disaster zone. Theodore, with a population of around 450,
is located on the Dawson River in central Queensland, about 450 km
(280 miles) northwest of Brisbane (see
<http://maps.bonzle.com/c/a?a=p&p=1166&cmd=sp>). About 300 of its
residents were evacuated, some by helicopter, when the Dawson River
reached a record high level of 46 feet on 27 Dec 2010 (see
<http://english.ntdtv.com/ntdtv_en/ns_asia/2010-12-28/865837038386.html>).

Leptospirosis is caused by exposure to _Leptospira_ bacteria, in
fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been
contaminated by urine of animals chronically infected with one of the
several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.
Rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the usual reservoirs for this
organism. Leptospirosis occurs worldwide and frequently follows
flooding after heavy rains, as is now being reported in Theodore. For
a history of leptospirosis in Australia, see ProMED-mail moderator
MPP's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Leptospirosis, military
personnel - Australia (QLD) 20050322.0824.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors
or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings
(such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers,
trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers,
dairy farmers, or military personnel. Also leptospirosis is a risk
during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water
swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking,
that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds
contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals, as well as a
risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Most patients with leptospirosis have a non-specific mild, flu-like
illness. Some patients develop severe disease with myocardial,
pulmonary, renal, or hepatic involvement. Multi-organ failure,
thrombocytopenia, and bleeding may develop. Severe infection may be
fatal in 5-40 percent of cases. Because of the relatively nonspecific
nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, the diagnosis
of leptospirosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory
confirmation. (See prior ProMED posts: Leptospirosis, military
personnel - Australia (QLD): not 20050329.0910 and Leptospirosis -
Jamaica (02) 20071018.3409.)

Although the above news release says that people became ill within a
day after the community was allowed back into Theodore, it is likely
they became infected during exposure to flood water the week before
and the onset of illness followed the usual the incubation period for
leptospirosis of about 7 days (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/leptospirosis_t.htm>).
