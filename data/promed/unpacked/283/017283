*Data subject to change due to ongoing investigations. Fields related to the final status of the case are updated as information is available.
NA = not available
NR = not reported

From 2012 through [30 Nov 2019], a total of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV and 858 associated deaths were reported globally to WHO under the International Health regulations (IHR 2005). The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.

WHO risk assessment
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in healthcare settings.

The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel's raw milk), or humans (for example, in a healthcare setting or household contacts).

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

[As of 30 Nov 2019, there have now been a total of 2494 cases of MERS-CoV, including 858 associated deaths, reported to WHO since 2012. Since 30 Nov 2019, there have been 3 newly confirmed cases with the most recent report being on 14 Dec 2019. Since 14 Dec 2019, there have been no newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia.

An interesting observation is that 10 out of 10 cases reported during the month of November [2019] had diabetes, 5 out of the 10 also had hypertension, and 3 also had ischemic heart disease. The one fatality had a combination of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and ischemic heart disease. This is in keeping with the letter to the editor in the January 2020 Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases in which the authors concluded, "We found that DM (diabetes mellitus), hypertension, and COD (chronic organ damage seen with cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease) co-occurred frequently in MERS-CoV-infected patients, and severity of illness and frequency of death were higher for patients with multiple and more severe underlying conditions." (See Alanazi KH, Abedi GR, Midgley CM, Alkhamis A, Alsaqer T, Almoaddi A, et al.: Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Death among 32 Patients with MERS-CoV Infection, Saudi Arabia.
