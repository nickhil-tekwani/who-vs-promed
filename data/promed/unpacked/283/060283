Two gorillas are suspected of becoming the latest victims of China's
tainted milk-powder health scandal, showing the early signs of kidney
stones, local media reported on Thursday [25 Sep 2008].

The gorillas, both from Hangzhou Wildlife World in eastern Zhejiang
province and aged one and 3, had been diagnosed with crystallization
in their urine, according to a report on the Hangzhou newspaper
website <http://www.hangzhou.com.cn>.

Both had been fed with milk powder made by Sanlu Group, at the heart
of the scandal in which 4 infants have died and thousands have fallen
sick with kidney stones.

The company has said the infants became sick after drinking milk
contaminated by melamine, a compound used in making plastics and
added to cheat nutrition tests.

"The crystallization now is very small, but it will grow bigger and
then block the urine," Zhang Xu, a doctor from the animal hospital
where the 2 gorillas were being treated, was quoted as saying. "No
visible stones have been found so far," Zhang added.

Kidney stones are small, solid masses that form when salts or
minerals normally found in urine crystallize inside the kidney.

If they become large enough, they can move out of the kidney, cause
infection and lead to permanent kidney damage.

A Chinese zoo is checking its animals after a lion cub and 2
orangutans were found to be developing kidney stones from drinking
contaminated powdered milk, state media reported today [26 Sep 2008].

The 3-month-old African cub at the zoo near the eastern city of
Hangzhou was under medical supervision after tests showed he was in
the early stages of developing kidney stones, the Beijing Morning
Post said.

Zookeepers fed the animals Sanlu milk powder -- a product discovered
to be contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine -- the report
said, adding the milk brand was introduced at the zoo 2 years ago.

More than 53 000 Chinese infants have fallen ill after drinking
contaminated milk and 4 have died in what has become a national food
safety crisis.

Dairy producers added the chemical, which is normally used to make
plastics, to their milk to make it test richer in protein.

Worried zoo staff brought the lion, along with 15-month-old orangutan
Qimao and her 3-year-old brother Liumao, to the veterinarian yesterday
[25 Sep 2008], the newspaper reported. Urinalysis and ultrasound
images confirmed zookeepers' fears, the report said. "The crystal is
at an early stage of stone development as it is still as small as a
pen point," a veterinarian identified only by the surname Shan, was
quoted as saying about the orangutans' condition. A kidney stone
begins as a tiny crystal.

The zoo planned to test other animals over the coming days, the report said.

Although many countries and regulatory agencies are carefully
monitoring human dry milk and dry milk products, this piece
demonstrates the potentially overlooked issue of milk products for
many young animals. Are countries checking animal milk substitute
products? Are regulatory agencies and veterinarians looking for
intoxication in young animals?

Some veterinary groups have done some research in some young species.
Young domestic animals such as calves, lambs & kid goats are
functionally non-ruminants, and could potentially suffer renal failure
just as pets did in 2007 -- see ProMED archives below. Adult cows
appear to be able to handle melamine as a non-protein source, but it
has been shown in some research that adult sheep may also be sensitive
to melamine.

This article clearly indicates melamine may be contaminating animal
milk products. We are requesting more information on what regulatory
agencies and veterinarians are doing regarding checking for affected
animals and checking milk products for animals. - Mod.TG]
