A total of 8 people at the Center for Animal Health and Welfare in Williams Township [Northampton County, Pennsylvania] are being vaccinated for rabies after coming into contact with a cat that had the disease at the shelter. Acting shelter manager Dan Roman said the cat was brought in about 2 weeks ago. A woman from Glendon [Northampton County, Pennsylvania] found it in her yard, put it in a container and brought it to the shelter. It was taken to Easton Animal Hospital, where it was determined to have wobbly leg syndrome.

The cat was returned to the shelter and put into isolation to confirm it didn't have rabies, which Roman said is normal procedure. After about a week in isolation, the animal was found dead. Testing on the dead animal came back positive for rabies. All 8 people who had contact with the cat at the shelter immediately were contacted. Some touched the cat, others were bit or scratched by it. Those 8 people were sent to the hospital immediately for rabies shots. They've been given 2, and a 3rd will be administered soon. The woman who brought in the cat and 2 staffers at Easton Animal Hospital also were contacted about the rabies confirmation, so they could be vaccinated.

Roman said no one from the public was in contact with the cat. "They've done everything possible to contain the disease," said Roman. "The public does not have to worry -- other than the fact that the cat came from Glendon and it had rabies out in the open. If you see an animal acting oddly, call health department and police. An animal with early stages of rabies may not show any symptoms."

[Fortunately this was handled by the book and no one was at serious risk, and the proper precautions taken. Which is why veterinarians and related professions need to keep their rabies shots up to date and monitor their antibody titres. Not every rabies case is presented carrying a label.

For those uncertain, like myself, as to what "wobbly-leg" syndrome is, here is a brief description:

"Wobblers syndrome or wobbler disease is catchall term that refers to many different spinal-column disorders that are commonly found in large and giant-breed dogs and in certain breeds of horses. The symptoms are leg weakness and clumsy, or 'wobbly,' walking that may lead to paralysis. Most of the disorders described as wobblers are caused when the cervical (neck) spinal column is compressed and can't send clear signals to the legs. In dogs, it's also called cervical spondylolisthesis, cervical spondylomyelopathy, cervical vertebral instability and cervical vertebral malformation. In horses, it's sometimes called wobbler's syndrome.

Depending on the cause, untreated animals may grow out of it or otherwise improve, but their symptoms are more likely to stabilize or worsen. According to Bruce R. Wittels, DVM, of the United Kingdom German Shepherd Dog Helpline, cases that are worsening but not treated or are given too-conservative treatment may cause the animal pain, serious movement problems or paralysis.

If your pet has wobbler symptoms, take her to the veterinarian. She may have a serious condition that needs treatment right away. If she's more than a year old, take her to the vet immediately -- without treatment she may be permanently paralyzed." ... and more [see: http://www.ehow.com/about_5137385_untreated-wobblers-syndrome.html; also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobbler_disease]. - Mod.MHJ
