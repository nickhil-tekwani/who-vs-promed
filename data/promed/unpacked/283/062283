920 prisoners are suffering from hepatitis
------------------------------------------
Program manager of Sindh Chief Minister's Program for Hepatitis
Prevention and Control, Dr Abdul Majeed Chhutto has said that blood
screening of prisoners in jails confirmed that a total of 920
convicted as well as under-trial prisoners are suffering from
hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Talking to senior journalists at the
Hyderabad Press Club on Monday [23 Nov 2009], Dr Abdul Majeed Chhutto
said that under the Sindh Chief Minister's Program for Hepatitis
Prevention and Control, the vaccination and treatment of these
prisoners have been started with due care.

He said that the treatment of each patient is costing INR 0.3 million
[approx USD 6500], however all out efforts are being made to provide
hepatitis treatment to the maximum [number of] patients. Dr Chhutto
said that so far, 0.7 million new-born babies and 0.625 [million?]
people of the province have been vaccinated against hepatitis [that
is, hepatitis B, there is currently no approved hepatitis C vaccine -
Mod.CP], however, he emphasized the need for prevention of the
disease, which could be made possible through public awareness, he
added.

He said that maximum number of hepatitis patients has been reported
from Ghotki district, while Kambar-Shahdadkot, Jacobabad, and
Khairpur districts are also areas most affected by hepatitis.

[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused
by hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the
most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver
disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the
liver and liver cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have
been infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), and more than 350
million have chronic (long-term) liver infections. A vaccine against
hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95
percent effective in preventing HBV infection and its chronic
consequences.

Hepatitis B is endemic in Pakistan and many parts of Asia. Most
people in the region become infected with HBV during childhood. In
these regions, 8 percent to 10 percent of the adult population is
chronically infected. All infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine:
this is the mainstay of hepatitis B prevention. The vaccine can be
given as either 3 or 4 separate doses, as part of existing routine
immunization schedules. In areas where mother-to-infant spread of HBV
is common, the 1st dose of vaccine should be given as soon as
possible after birth (that is, within 24 hours). The complete vaccine
series induces protective antibody levels in more than 95 percent of
infants, children and young adults. After age 40, protection
following the primary vaccination series drops below 90 percent. At
60 years old, protective antibody levels are achieved in only 65 to
75 percent of those vaccinated. Protection lasts at least 20 years
and should be lifelong. Detailed information can be obtained from the
WHO fact sheet at
