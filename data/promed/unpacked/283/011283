["The dynamic of the spread of influenza viruses is extremely complex and difficult to predict. Several factors can influence it, such as the wild bird migration pattern, unregulated trade, farming systems, biosecurity, and immunity status.

"During the Northern Hemisphere winter, the wild bird movements may increase, and lower temperatures may facilitate the environmental survival of AI [avian influenza] viruses, increasing exposure of infection in poultry. Additionally, the mixing of wild birds from different geographic origins during migration can increase the risk of virus spread and genetic reassortment resulting in changes in viral properties. At local level, as the AI viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, they can be easily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of infected animals as well as contaminated boots, vehicles, and equipment if the adequate biosecurity measures are not implemented."
