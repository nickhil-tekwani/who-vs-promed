Another case of CCHF recorded in Kizilordinskaya oblast
-------------------------------------------------------
Kazakhstan Today reports that a 4th case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) has been registered in the Kizilordinskaya Oblast according to the
regional public heath department. A 55 year old woman was admitted to the
regional hospital at Shieli on suspicion of tickborne rickettsiosis. The
woman felt sick on 1 Aug 2009; on 2 Aug 2009 she went to a clinic and on 5
Aug 2009 she was referred to the regional hospital.

The working diagnoses were chronic gastritis, chronic pyelonephritis, and
kidney stones. The woman denied receiving a tick bite. On 7 Aug 2009 the
fever increased with onset of gum bleeding, which prompted a consultation
with an infectious disease specialist. A diagnosis of tickborne
rickettsiosis was suggested. On 8 Aug 2009 the patient remembered receiving
a tick bite while working outdoors. A diagnosis of CCHF was established
later on the basis of clinical data. This case is the 4th in the region.
The 1st 3 cases had favorable outcomes.

The regional emergency committee organized a meeting in Shieli to discuss
treatment options for the territory. There are 23 contacts under medical
observation, including 15 health care workers and 8 family members. The
head of the regional public health department stated that the epidemic
season for CCHF is from April to July and the current case is probably a
consequence of the protracted and cool spring. There have been 14 cases of
CCHF in the South Kazakhstan region this year, including 7 fatal cases.
