Awaiting vaccines after death of 3 cattle
-----------------------------------------
Trashigang has yet to receive the anthrax spore vaccine from the National Center for Animal Health. Although the 1st outbreak of anthrax was reported in Younphula under Kanglung gewog (or Kanglung subdistrict authority) on 18 Feb 2012 the dzongkhag (district main office) has still not received the vaccine.

On 20 Feb 2012, a cow died from symptoms of anthrax in Shingchen gonpa, around 2km from the place of the 1st outbreak. A cow bled from its orifices, had fever and bloated before it died. It was found that the cow in Shingchen gonpa was grazing on the same pasture land with the cow that died in Younphula. A laboratory examination in the regional livestock development center later confirmed that both cows died from anthrax. Blood samples from both carcasses showed presence of _Bacillus anthracis_, the bacteria that cause anthrax.

On 27 Feb 2013 the 3rd [cow] died at Rongthung with similar symptoms of bleeding from orifices, bloating and fever. Of the 9 cattle that died in the dzongkhag, 3 were confirmed positive from the lab test at the centre of having succumbed to anthrax.

But even after the report of 3rd anthrax case in the dzongkhag, the centre is still awaiting the anthrax spore vaccine. Though the officials gave antibiotic treatment to the animals, they said it was likely the bacteria spread further to Rongthung because of lack of vaccination. The centre's veterinary officer, Dr Sangay Letho said the source of the bacteria in Rongthung could be from Younphula. Rongthung is 12km drive down from Younphula. "It is possible the bacteria in Rongthung might have been transmitted from Younphula by commuters or from the sharing of the same pasture land," Sangay Letho said.

Dzongkhag veterinary hospital officials said the requisition for the vaccine was sent immediately following the outbreak.

The animal health centre's program director Dr N Dahal said the vaccines would be sent to Trashigang on 16 Mar 2012. "We do not give vaccination immediately after the outbreak to reduce the bacterial spread with use of antibiotics," he said. "Only then we proceed with the vaccination." He said the vaccination in Trashigang was not delayed yet but that it would happen at the right time. Trashigang had no outbreak of anthrax for the last 12 years.

The last case of the outbreak was reported on 27 Feb 2012 and since then, veterinary health officials said, no cases had been reported.

"Cattle in all affected areas have been given antibiotics," a veterinary official said. "The carcasses of the dead cattle were also burnt and buried after being treated with lime." The areas including the shed were also decontaminated with disinfectants.

Dr Sangay Letho said the cattle in the affected areas had to be vaccinated since the anthrax outbreak was confirmed. "We'll soon begin the vaccination that is arriving this week," he said.

Some villagers also consumed meat from a bull carcass that veterinary officials suspect had died from anthrax. No transmission, however, has been reported of anthrax to humans.

[While the prompt treatment of animals possibly incubating this infection but still apparently healthy has much to recommend it, and is strongly recommended, it is standard practice to vaccinate the whole herd as soon as possible. This is usually some 7-10 days after the antibiotic treatment to allow any antibiotic titre in the blood to be no longer a threat to the live vaccine. The reluctance of the veterinary authorities in Thiumpho to release vaccine is hard to understand as Sterne vaccine is probably the cheapest vaccine, human or animal, in the world.

Granted that anthrax is truly sporadic in Bhutan with only 7 outbreaks during 2004-2010, but in 2 outbreaks 2 dozen or more cattle were affected; one of these, in 2010, in Zhemgang involved 24 cattle, 8 equids, 4 swine, and 6 cats in 5 villages. There were 12 human cases that year and one death. To limit losses response has to be rapid and efficient. In the prior 2012 outbreak reported below, 11 cattle had died before the veterinary extension officer arrived on the scene.
