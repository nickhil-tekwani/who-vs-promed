Anthrax in North Dakota
-----------------------
11 premises in south eastern North Dakota have had confirmed cases of
anthrax this year [2005] in bison, cattle, and horses as of 14 Jul 2005. It
is not uncommon to find anthrax in the state annually, but Beth Carlson,
DVM, deputy state veterinarian for the North Dakota State Board of Animal
Health, says there seem to be a few more cases this year. She recommends
that horse and other livestock owners in the area contact their
veterinarians to determine whether vaccinating their animals against
anthrax would be appropriate.
Anthrax occurs naturally in some states, and horses occasionally get the
disease. The anthrax agent is a resilient spore-forming bacterium called
_Bacillus anthracis_, which lives in the ground. Livestock ingest _B.
anthracis_ when they forage close to the ground or when they eat feed grown
on infected soil. Horses seem to be more resistant to anthrax than other
livestock species, such as sheep or cattle. Veterinarians have ventured to
say a very wet spring in North Dakota could have caused dormant _B.
anthracis_ in the ground to sporulate.
Roughly 30-35 animals have been infected with anthrax in the current
outbreak. "It's a few more than we normally see; some years we only see few
or none," says Carlson. "But sometimes we see an increase. Looks like this
year's going to be like that." All of the cases are in Ransom and Barnes
Counties. 4 premises had horses, with one horse on each premises. None of
the horses survived.
"I think it's been several years since they've had anthrax (in that area),"
she adds. "Most of these people were not vaccinating against anthrax, or
have been kind of sporadic with vaccinating. The actual pastures where
these animals have died have never had it diagnosed."
She says, for the most part, North Dakota livestock owners are good about
reporting anthrax cases to state officials. "Most people, when they find a
case, will call us and call the lab as well," she said. "Some people
hand-deliver their samples (to the North Dakota State University Diagnostic
Laboratory) to get a faster diagnosis."
Generally, a farm owner will have confirmation of anthrax in one animal,
and any other cases that mimic the 1st will be assumed as anthrax and
reported to animal health officials. Anthrax is a reportable livestock
disease in North Dakota, and affected premises are quarantined for 30 days
following vaccination of susceptible livestock on the premises. Owners are
also required to burn or bury infected carcasses of animals within 36
hours. Carlson says most owners are practicing both methods of disposal.
"We don't panic when we see anthrax, it's something that we have learned to
deal with," says Carlson.
