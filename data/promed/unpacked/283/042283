A new study shows that people who have been infected with West Nile
virus may have persistent virus in their kidneys for years after
initial infection, potentially leading to kidney problems. The
research, which appears in the 1 Jan [2009] issue of The Journal of
Infectious Diseases, is now available online
(<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/648731>).

Spread by infected mosquitoes, West Nile virus was first detected in
the United States in 1999. Since then, approximately 25 000 human
cases have been reported, causing more than 1000 deaths. Many more
have become infected without showing symptoms. Previous animal
studies raised the possibility that patients may still be infected
with the virus several years after recovering from their initial
illness. Prior to this latest research, however, humans were thought
to remain infected with West Nile virus only for the 1st few days of
illness. The study, led by Kristy Murray, DVM, PhD at the University
of Texas School of Public Health in Houston, demonstrates that not
all individuals clear the virus from their system within the 1st few
days -- and that it can remain in the kidneys for years, potentially
leading to kidney failure.

Dr Murray and her colleagues followed more than 100 patients in
Houston [Texas, USA] with severe initial West Nile virus infections
for 7 years. Individuals were evaluated and blood samples collected
every 6 months. More than half continued to have infection-related
symptoms years after their initial illness, although symptoms began
to plateau around 2 years after infection. The deaths of 5
participants due to kidney failure led researchers to consider
whether the kidney could be a preferred replication site for the virus.

To test this hypothesis, Dr Murray and her team collected urine
samples from 25 patients from their original cohort and tested them
for presence of West Nile virus. In this group, 5 patients (20
percent) tested positive for the virus. Viral RNA could be detected
in the urine for at least 6 years following infection. Of the 5, 4
patients who tested positive for virus also experienced chronic
symptoms. Of these 5, one patient developed kidney failure. These
results show that West Nile virus is capable of long term persistence
in patients, particularly when chronic symptoms are present.

In an accompanying editorial, Ernest Gould, PhD, of the Centre for
Ecology and Hydrology in Oxford, England, points out that this study
raises the additional concern that West Nile virus and other
flaviviruses may be transmitted to mosquitoes by apparently healthy
humans or animals. This possibility has the potential to start
epidemics in new regions of the world.

According to Dr Murray, patients who have been infected with West
Nile virus should "have their kidneys monitored by their physician
for any evidence of disease and be aware that persistent infection of
the kidneys can happen." Dr Murray also reminds the public to take
proper precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites during
transmission seasons, typically the summer and fall, to avoid infection.

More research is needed to "understand the underlying mechanisms
related to the shedding of virus particles in urine, whether shedding
of the virus is constant or intermittent, and whether or not this
represents true infection resulting in kidney disease," the
investigators say. They continue to evaluate all study participants,
particularly in regard to kidney function. In addition, they are
focusing on developing treatment options for those who remain
infected with the virus.

[The detection of West Nile virus (WNV) RNA in urine of convalescent
individuals 6 years after their acute infection has significant
clinical and epidemiological implications. The critical question in
this and similar studies documenting flavivirus RNA persistence is
whether intact, infectious virus is being shed and is transmissible
to new hosts. Reisen et al., demonstrated presence of detectable St
Louis encephalitis virus, a close relative of WNV, in spleen tissue
of one of 13 house finches (_Carpodacus mexicanus_) one year after
infection. SLEV RNA was detectable by RT-PCR but not by plaque assay.
Persistence of arthropod-borne viruses has been a seldom studied
topic recently, although a few published reviews point to its
occurrence (see the Kuno and Seminov et al. references below).
