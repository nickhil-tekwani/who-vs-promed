EPIDEMIC METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS STRAIN
Canada Communicable Disease Report - Volume 24-6, 15
Several recent reports have indicated that the prevalence of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Ontario health-care
facilities has increased significantly during the last few years(1-4). In
addition, these reports have suggested that this increase has been due
primarily to the spread of a single MRSA strain. Since 1994, the Central
Public Health Laboratory, Toronto, has received a steadily increasing
number of S. aureus isolates reported as methicillin-resistant from
hospitals and other institutions throughout the province. The number of
MRSA isolates analyzed by the laboratory increased from 247 in 1994 to 354
in 1995, representing a 43% increase during this period. In 1996, a total
of 1,418 MRSA isolates was analyzed; this represented a fourfold increase
in the number of isolates analyzed over the previous year.
The number of MRSA isolates exhibiting phage type (PT) 95 increased
markedly from 1994 to 1996 (Table 1). In 1994, PT 95 isolates represented
only 3% of all MRSA isolates typed in the laboratory. In 1995, the
frequency increased to 19%. In 1996, a total of 565 isolates were
identified as PT 95, representing 40% of all MRSA isolates. This rapid
increase in the frequency of MRSA PT 95 isolates was reflected in the
increasing number of hospitals affected by these organisms between 1994 and
1996 (Table 1). In 1994, MRSA PT 95 isolates were encountered in only three
hospitals in Ontario. However, the number of hospitals affected by these
organisms increased sharply to 10 in 1995 and to 31 in 1996. In
addition, MRSA PT 95 isolates were associated with outbreaks in several
long-term care facilities during this period.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the Central Public Health Laboratory
has shown that MRSA PT 95 isolates are uniformly resistant to several
antimicrobial agents, including erythromycin, clindamycin, and
ciprofloxacin; most isolates are also resistant to gentamicin and
trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (Table 2). Resistance to vancomycin has not
been observed among these isolates. The results of molecular typing have
demonstrated that most MRSA PT 95 isolates have the same pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) genome fragment pattern, but some have minor
variations in their patterns which indicate that they represent subtypes of
the predominant genotype(5). Several unusual phenotypic properties,
including a negative rapid-slide coagulase test, a negative or weak tube
coagulase reaction at 4 hours but positive at 24 hours, and a negative or
weak DNase reaction have been associated with isolates of this strain(6).

The recent emergence in Ontario of an epidemic MRSA strain exhibiting PT 95
has been preceded by the emergence of a similar epidemic strain in Europe.
Since 1993, a multiply resistant MRSA strain with a genome fragment pattern
corresponding to those of _S. aureus_ strains of PT 95 has spread rapidly
through health-care institutions in several regions of Germany(7,8).
Similarities between the PFGE patterns of the epidemic strains from Germany
and Ontario suggest that these strains belong to the same clonal group of
_S. aureus_ strains exhibiting PT 95. Previous studies have indicated that PT
95 strains have a higher colonization capacity than strains of other phage
types; this property may have played an important role in the rapid
emergence of the epidemic strain in Ontario health-care facilities(9,10).
