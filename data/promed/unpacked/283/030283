H5N1 avian flu: call for wild bird early warning system
--------------------------------------------------------
Bernard Matthews Foods [whose website describes it as "the No 1 bran of
cooked meats in the UK" - Mod.SH] has urged the UK government and poultry
industry to work together in establishing an early warning system for
migratory birds that may carry H5N1 avian flu. Then armed with this
knowledge, free range turkey producers would be able to take measures to
avoid contact between wild birds and poultry.

Delivering his Temperton Fellowship Report "Living through avian flu H5N1"
at the Farmers Club in London, Bernard Matthews Foods' technical director
Jeremy Hall highlighted the trend to free range Christmas turkeys. "TV
chefs are encouraging consumers to go free range which has led to
substantial growth, now accounting for 15 per cent of the Christmas turkey
volume. But outdoor farming brings risk and the challenge is to rear
turkeys through the highest risk months without any outbreaks."

One major factor undermining the industry's preparedness is the lack of
information on movement of the virus. Hall said that while there was good
EU information, the approach was disjointed and data was only available
when 4-5 months out of date. Mr Hall added: "I remember having meetings
with the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and I was amazed by the
sophistication of their records and mapping. Using this data together with
satellite tracking system, we would know precisely when birds start their
journey back to the UK. "But the government needs to put more support into
wild bird testing and monitoring. At the moment, we depend on the good will
of the RSPB and BTO for wild bird surveillance."

Mr Hall believes the common pochard is the most likely candidate for
carrying and harbouring the H5N1 avian flu virus. "Looking at wild birds
testing positive, there were mainly swans and pochards. But as swans either
migrate short distances, or don't migrate at all, they are picking up
infection from other species."

In contrast, the common pochard travels huge distances to its breeding
grounds in eastern Russia and China, so spends the summer in contact with
wild fowl in areas known to have a high presence of infection. And about 84
000 of these return to Britain each autumn.

[An interesting call for action as the speaker's concern about wild birds
appears to be unmatched by a concern about the movements, recorded and
unrecorded, of poultry products about which his company still has
unanswered questions from their own outbreak; see 20070202.0424,
20070202.0427, 20070203.0432, 20070203.0437, 20070207.0477, 20070215.0572,
20070221.0643, 20070420.1302. If Hall is correct about the numbers of the
Christmas turkeys currently being raised free-range in the United Kingdom,
however, this would be an interesting retest of the risk reality of carrier
migratory birds and free-range poultry in the epidemiology of this
infection. - Mod.MHJ]
