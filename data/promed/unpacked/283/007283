Update on the avian influenza situation as of 28 Jan 2005
-----------------------------------------------
1. Latest information on Avian Influenza
Outbreaks of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in poultry were
reported in Thailand and Viet Nam, and human cases were reported in Viet
Nam during the preceding month [December 2004]. Having lunar New Year day
on 9 Feb 2005, movement of poultry and poultry products will increase in
the region. The needs for biosecurity of domestic poultry to prevent
infection and enhanced early warning in order to detect every additional
case are highest during this season to avoid new cases of HPAI in poultry
and to minimize the risk to humans.
Country situation
Thailand:
Since 3 Jul 2004, H5N1 HPAI infection has been confirmed in 57 provinces,
and more than one million birds have died or been culled in response. HPAI
outbreaks were confirmed in 13 districts in the week of 9-16 Dec 2004,
resulting in culling of 23 243 birds. As at 27 Jan 2005, 8 locations in 3
provinces, Pitsanuloke, Rayong and Nakorn Pathom were still the subject of
the 21-day surveillance period imposed by the Department of Livestock
Development (DLD), Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. In January
2005, HPAI outbreaks were reported in native chickens in PhitsanuLok
Province and in fighting cocks and native chickens in Rayong Province. The
Agriculture and Cooperatives and Public Health Ministry's disease control
department ordered stepped-up inspections of poultry and of the human
population in border provinces.
Viet Nam:
[During the period 1-28 Jan 2005], avian influenza has been confirmed in 30
provinces and cities and 897 149 birds have died or have been culled.
[On 17 Jan 2005], the Prime Minister sent an urgent message to concerned
ministries, sectors and provinces calling for "drastic" measures. In his
message, the Prime Minister says that bird flu is returning, particularly
in the Mekong Delta and southern provinces, and tends to spread quickly;
ministries must consider the fight against the outbreak as their "key and
immediate mission" to ensure the health and safety of the public and food
supplies during Lunar New Year. Imports of poultry and poultry products
from neighboring countries are temporarily suspended, with any detected
consignments to be seized at the border and destroyed. The owners will not
receive any compensation but will be requested to pay for the cost of
culling birds. The Ho Chi Minh City Police Department has deployed its
forces to cooperate with the animal health bureau and market monitoring
staff to check the trading at markets and, especially, the transport of
fowl at gateways to the city. In Danang City, trade in live fowl at major
markets is banned.
Up to 29 Dec 2004, the WHO reported 27 HPAI human cases in Viet Nam, with
20 fatalities. This number increased dramatically in one month, as, by 26
Jan 2005, a further 10 patients were confirmed as HPAI-infected, of which,
9 have died. The provinces with suspected or confirmed human case since
December 2004 are: Dong Thap, Tra Vinh, Tay Ninh, Hau Giang, Tien Giang,
Bac Lieu, Thai Binh, Hung Yen, Phu Tho, Kien Giang, Binh Dinh Provinces and
Hanoi.
Hong Kong SAR:
A "Chinese pond heron" (_Ardeola bacchus_) was found dead in the New
Territories ecological mitigation area of Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Project 1
on 10/01/05. Avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 was confirmed in the heron.
Genetic sequencing of the hemagglutinin cleavage site is to be conducted.
All poultry farms within 5 km of where the heron was found have been
checked and no unusual mortalities or illness were detected. Local poultry
farms are routinely under constant monitoring and surveillance, and
individual farms have biosecurity plans that include bird-proofing of all
sheds. All chicken farms are routinely vaccinated with inactivated H5N2
vaccine, and 60 unvaccinated sentinels are kept in each batch of chickens.
Extensive surveillance, including viral culture, is conducted in wholesale
and retail poultry markets, in bird parks and in wild bird populations.
Lao PDR:
There has been no outbreak reported since February 2004. At the time of the
outbreak, the river between Thailand and Lao PDR was extremely low.
Migratory birds may have been attracted to remaining water reservoirs and
ponds in villages and farms adjacent to the river. Almost all reports of
infection came from locations close to the river. The Lao Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries imposed a ban on the introduction of poultry from
Thailand, and this decree is still in place. Check points have been
established at major traffic points to monitor movements. Public awareness
programs emphasize the need for improved "local" quarantine and prevention
of exposure, as far as practicable, in both villages and commercial
premises. Interviews with farmers revealed that, within infected farms, the
disease spread more quickly where birds were kept on litter than in layer
cages, suggesting that the fecal-oral route of transmission was more
important than aerosol transmission. Some 20 percent of the national
poultry flock is held in commercial enterprises servicing the larger urban
human populations around the cities of Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Champasack
and Savannakhet. Of these, egg producers obtain most of their replacements
as "point-of-lay" 16 week-old pullets from Thailand. Similarly, day-old
commercial broiler chicks are imported into farms and are available in
small numbers at the larger district markets. There is no commercial
production of ducks or turkeys. Village poultry in Lao PDR have close
contact with each other, with pigs and with children, creating a risk of
inter-species transmission. There are no large "wet" markets in Lao.
Poultry are sold in the village or the local district market. The system of
selling poultry in the market in Lao is unique: Consumers are offered live
birds by traders in the market; birds that are not sold that day are
processed and offered as fresh or cooked carcasses the following day. At
the market level, this system effectively works on an "all-In, all-Out"
basis. There are no large commercial poultry slaughtering establishments in
Lao. Rather, processing is done by owners or traders with small basic
facilities. Village poultry populations are self-replacing with few
introductions from outside the village. Thus, in the event of HPAI
outbreaks in the village, disease may be limited to the locality, with
little risk of further spread. Active surveillance must be continued,
encouraged and results recorded.
Cambodia:
There has been no outbreak reported since October 2004. Surveillance: The
passive surveillance system found 3 suspected cases that were investigated
in May-July 2004, due to a possible link with suspected human cases. An
active surveillance program for markets was launched in early August 2004
in the major live bird markets in the town. Monitoring of repopulated farms
has been proposed for previously infected farms, and for farms located
within a 3 km radius of outbreaks, to declare those places free of disease,
and some farms are being used as sentinel farms in the country. The central
epidemiology team has visited every province involved in this monitoring.
Monitoring has already started in Phnom Penh and Kandal provinces. The
identification and geo-referencing of commercial and semi-commercial farms
in the outbreak areas (3-4 km around the outbreak) has been initiated and
will be extended to the whole country. The data collected will be shared
with the statistics department of the Ministry of Agriculture. A study
based on interviews of citizens suggests that many villages around the
outbreak sites faced an HPAI outbreak. Preliminary results also suggest
that the spread of the virus was higher among "village poultry" than
between independent farms. Possible explanations for the absence of new
outbreaks since last April [2004] are: very high temperatures from
mid-April to mid-May; the very high case fatality rate in chickens (often
reaching 100 percent) prevented birds from acting as virus carriers;
drastic reductions in animal movements in the country and the number of
live birds in markets; and the low human and animal population density in
the country. Many ducks are reared for egg production in rice fields and
are quite separate from the local chickens.
China:
There has been no outbreak since July 2004. The Ministry of Public Health
has recently discussed an emergency program to guard against HPAI. Large
cities have stepped up surveillance. Yunnan Province, which shares a 1200
km border with Viet Nam, has taken emergency measures to prevent HPAI from
spreading from Viet Nam into China. Poultry farms, regions on the
China-Viet Nam border, and places that experienced HPAI early last year
[2004] have been urged to vaccinate poultry. The provincial government is
encouraging local agriculture, health, import and export quarantine, public
security, quality inspection and customs officers to work together to
monitor the spread of HPAI and to become better informed on the
distribution of poultry and egg products. The local animal husbandry
department has set up a 30-km-wide "immune protection zone" in the area
bordering Viet Nam and has established disinfection stations at the
frontier crossings and border ports to check and disinfect all vehicles and
personnel crossing. Any outbreak of bird flu must be reported to
authorities within 24 hours.
Malaysia:
There has been no outbreak reported since November 2004. During the last
few outbreaks, there was an unusual disease pattern, with low or no
detected mortality (mortality 2 to 40 percent in infected village poultry).
The most recent isolates of virus (in November 2004) were from clinically
normal birds in villages with no apparent increase in chicken mortality.
Pakistan:
During November 2004, outbreaks of H7 avian influenza were reported in
unvaccinated chickens in Haripur and Abbottabad, North Western Frontier
Province; H7N3 and H9N2 were isolated from chickens in Karachi.
