As of 1700 on Mon 6 Aug 2007, 224 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF), including 5 child cases, have been registered in 8 regions of the
Southern Federal District [Okrug] of Russia, compared with 191 cases,
including 4 children, that were registered during the same period of 2006.
63 cases have been registered in the Republic of Kalmykia (65 in 2006), 53
in the Rostov region (52 in 2006), 58 cases in the Stavropol region (40 in
2006), 28 cases in the Volgograd region (16 in 2006), 19 in the Astrakhan
region (15 in 2006), one in the Republic of Karachaevo-Cherkessia (none in
2006), one in the Republic of Ingushetia (none in 2006), and one in the
Republic of Dagestan (3 in 2006).
Four patients have died: one fatality in each of the regions of Volgograd,
Rostov, Republic of Ingushetia, and the Republic of Kalmykia (compared with
5 fatalities in 2006); 2 fatal cases in Kalmykia and one each in the
regions of Stavropol, Rostov, and Astrakhan. The situation in the
Stavropol, Volgograd and Astrakhan regions remains unsatisfactory, where
levels of morbidity are 1.5 times or more than those observed in the
preceding year [2006].
Insufficient expenditure on measures to control exposure of cattle and
other livestock to tick infestation in natural foci of CCHF infection has
contributed to expansion of CCHF infection in several regions of the
Southern Federal Region [Okrug]. The extent of tick dis-infestation has
varied: less than 50 per cent in the Astrakhan area, 34 per cent of cattle
and 8 per cent of other livestock both in the public and the private
sectors (compared with 61 per cent and 12 per cent respectively in 2006).
In the Krasnodar region, the corresponding figures are 27 per cent of
cattle and 24 per cent of other livestock (compared with 33 per cent and 45
per cent respectively in 2006). In the Republic of Dagestan, the
corresponding figures are 9 per cent and 2 per cent (compared with 37 per
cent and 6 per cent respectively in 2006).
17 776 persons sought treatment for tick bites in the Southern Federal
District [Okrug], including 5349 children, whereas in 2006, the
corresponding figures were 14 113 adults and 3751 children. 944 people
sustaining tick bites, including 236 children have been preventively
hospitalized (compared to 707 and 117 respectively in 2006).

[It is evident that CCHF virus infection is currently an increasing problem
throughout Russia and central Asia. To what extent this is due to a
reduction in expenditure on tick control measures or to an increased
abundance of virus-infected ticks is as yet unclear.
