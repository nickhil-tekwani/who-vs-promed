EBOLA VIRUS: ADVANCES IN VACCINE RESEARCH
*****************************************
A ProMED-mail post

A recent report in Nature Medicine 4(1):37-42, 1998, published by Ling Xu
et al. indicates that guinea pigs can be protected from Ebola virus
infection by immunization with plasmids containing the viral genes for
either the secreted or transmembrane forms of the viral glycoprotein, GP.
The research team, working under the direction of Gary J. Nabel at the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute of the University of Michigan Medical
Center, found that protection was correlated with antibody titer and
antigen-specific T-cell responses to secreted GP or membrane GP. Animals
immunized with plasmids containing the viral genes for nucleoprotein NP
alone were apparently not protected.
The authors indicate that this use of immunization by gene therapy offers
the first successful vaccination protocol to protect experimental animals
against Ebola virus. They are hopeful that nucleic acid vaccines will
facilitate efforts to limit the spread of this disease in humans.
