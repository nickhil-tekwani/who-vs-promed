CDC sharply raises H1N1 case estimates; kids hit hard
-----------------------------------------------------
Another month's worth of data on pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus
infection has led federal officials to more than double their
estimates of total cases, hospitalizations, and deaths and to assert
that the impact on children and younger adults has been far greater
than that of a typical flu season.

After analyzing data for the weeks from 18 Oct 2009 through 14 Nov
2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated
that 47 million people, or about 15 percent of the population, have
been infected and 9820 have died in the pandemic. That compares with
estimates of 22 million cases and 3900 deaths issued 12 Nov 2009 and
covering the period from April through 17 Oct 2009. The new estimate
of hospitalizations is 213 000, compared with 98 000 a month ago.

"By 14 Nov 2009, many times more children and younger adults,
unfortunately, have been hospitalized or killed by [pandemic] H1N1
influenza than happens in a usual flu season," CDC Director Dr Thomas
Frieden said in a news briefing today [10 Dec 2009]. The additional
weeks covered in the latest report spanned the peak period for the
fall wave of H1N1. In terms of the number of states reporting
widespread activity, the last 2 weeks in October marked the crest,
with 48 states in that situation. The number dropped to 43 states by
the 2nd week in November and has declined further since.

In an online report, the CDC estimated there have been 16 million
cases in children up through age 17, leading to 71 000
hospitalizations and 1090 deaths. For adults age 18 through 64, the
agency estimated 27 million cases, 121 000 hospitalizations, and 7450
deaths. For elderly people, who are believed to have some protection
form the virus because of past flu exposures, the new estimates are 4
million cases, 21 000 hospitalizations, and 1280 deaths.

Less than 5 percent of the increases in total cases,
hospitalizations, and deaths are explained by late reporting of
events that occurred before 17 Oct 2009, the CDC report says. Frieden
commented, "There is some correction for late reporting. But there
has been a lot more disease in the month that's reported than in the
months before." All the numbers represent the midpoints of ranges of
estimates the CDC produced with a new estimation method, which was
unveiled on 12 Nov 2009. The numbers of confirmed cases and related
hospitalizations and deaths are far lower, because most people
infected, including some who get severely sick, are not tested.

When he was asked to compare the H1N1 pandemic with seasonal flu,
Frieden said, "We know that it's much milder for older people. It's
much less likely to result in death because older people are much
less likely to get infected. But it has been a much worse flu season
for people under the age of 65, particularly younger adults and
children." According to CDC estimates that are often quoted, the
nation has about 200 000 flu-related hospitalizations and 36 000
deaths in an average flu season, with about 90 percent of the deaths
occurring in elderly people. Frieden noted today [10 Dec 2009] that
the pandemic estimates are not derived in the same way as these
seasonal flu estimates. While the estimation methods are different,
seasonal flu is believed to cause fewer than 1000 deaths per year in
people younger than 50, he added. He said the CDC doesn't have a
specific estimate of H1N1 deaths among adults under age 50, but a
"large share" of the adult deaths is in that group. "So it is really
many times more severe in terms of severe illness, and
hospitalizations are several times higher for children and young
adults than in a usual flu season," he said.

The CDC estimates that between 5 percent and 20 percent of the
population get seasonal flu in an average year. If 15 percent of
people have already been infected with H1N1, the nation, 8 months
into the pandemic, is already approaching the upper end of the
average attack rate for seasonal flu. However, the estimated death
toll so far, 9820, remains well below the estimated seasonal flu toll
of 36 000, though children and younger adults make up about 87
percent (8540) of that total, the opposite of what is seen with
seasonal flu. Meanwhile, the estimate of 213 000 [pandemic] H1N1
hospitalizations is slightly above the estimate of 200 000 hospital
cases for a typical flu season.

In terms of case-fatality rate (CFR), the new CDC estimate of 9820
deaths in 47 million cases translates into an overall rate of about
0.021 percent, or about 210 deaths per million people sickened by the
virus. That's just slightly higher than the 0.018 percent CFR
indicated by the previous CDC estimate of 3900 deaths among 22
million cases. But the CFRs differ considerably by age group. The CFR
for children, with an estimated 1090 deaths in 16 million cases,
comes to 0.007 percent, or about 70 deaths in a million cases. The
CFR for adults between 18 and 64 comes out much higher, at 0.028
percent, or 280 deaths per million. And the rate for the elderly is
higher yet, at 0.032 percent, or 320 deaths in a million cases --
supporting the view that while seniors seem less likely to get sick,
they are more likely to die if they do.

Frieden used the new estimates to stress the importance of getting
vaccinated against the pandemic virus. If about 15 percent of the
population has already been infected, he said, "That still leaves
most people not having been infected and still remaining susceptible
to H1N1 influenza." He reported that another 12 million doses of
vaccine became available in the past week, bringing the cumulative
total to about 85 million doses. Many states now have met the vaccine
demand from priority groups and have begun offering doses to
everyone, he added. The CDC in the past week began offering the
vaccine to all employees, in line with state policy in Georgia,
Frieden reported. Though cases have been declining recently,
vaccination is prudent given the possibility of a 3rd wave of cases
this winter [2009-10], he said. "Flu season lasts until May. And we
don't know what the future will bring in terms of H1N1 influenza," he observed.

Analysis of the 3 age groups
----------------------------
Children 0-17
-------------
CDC estimates 16 million cases, 71 000 hospitalizations, and 1090
deaths. 24.35 percent of the US population of 308 million = 75
million children. 16 million cases out of 75 million children = 21.3
percent case attack rate [CAR] (21 sick children out of every 100 children)

1090 deaths out of 16 million cases = 0.007 percent case fatality
rate (70 dead children out of every million sick children). 21.3
percent (CAR) x 0.007 percent (CFR) = 0.00149 percent population
mortality rate (14.9 dead children out of every million children in
the population)

71 000 hospitalizations out of 16 million cases = 0.44 percent case
hospitalization rate. (4.4 hospitalizations out of every 1000 sick
children). 1090 deaths out of 71 000 hospitalizations = 1.5 percent
inpatient mortality rate (15 dead children out of every 1000 children
hospitalized)

Adults 18-64
------------
CDC estimates 27 million cases, 121 000 hospitalizations, and 7450
deaths. 62.9 percent of the US population of 308 million = 194
million adults. 27 million cases out of 194 million adults = 13.9
percent case attack rate (14 sick adults out of every 100 adults)

7450 deaths out of 27 million cases = 0.028 percent case fatality
rate (280 dead adults out of every million sick adults). 13.9 percent
(CAR) x 0.028 percent (CFR) = 0.003892 percent population mortality
rate (38.92 dead adults out of every million adults in the population).

121 000 hospitalizations out of 27 million cases = 0.45 percent case
hospitalization rate (4.5 hospitalizations out of every 1000 sick
adults). 7450 deaths out of 121 000 hospitalizations = 6.2 percent
inpatient mortality rate (62 dead adults out of every 1000 adults
hospitalized).

Seniors 65+
-----------
CDC estimates 4 million cases, 21 000 hospitalizations, and 1280
deaths. 12.8 percent of the US population of 308 million = 39 million
seniors. 4 million cases out of 39 million seniors = 10.3 percent
case attack rate (10 sick seniors out of every 100 seniors)

1280 deaths out of 4 million cases = 0.032 percent case fatality rate
(320 dead seniors out of every million sick seniors). 10.3 percent
(CAR) x 0.032 percent (CFR) = 0.003296 percent population mortality
rate (32.96 dead seniors out of every million seniors in the population).

21 000 hospitalizations out of 4 million cases = 0.52 percent case
hospitalization rate (5.2 hospitalizations out of every 1000 sick
seniors). 1280 deaths out of 21 000 hospitalizations = 6.1 percent
inpatient mortality rate. (61 dead seniors out of every 1000 seniors
hospitalized)

Comparisons by parameter
------------------------
CFRs: 0.007 versus 0.028 versus .032 -- the pandemic is most deadly
for seniors, least deadly for kids.

CARs: 21.3 versus 13.9 versus 10.3 -- the pandemic is likeliest to
sicken kids, least likely to sicken seniors.

PMRs [proportionate mortality ratio]: 0.00149 versus - -0.003892
versus 0.003296 -- adults have been hardest hit, seniors almost as
hard, kids have been hit least hard.

Hosp rates: 0.44 versus 0.45 versus 0.52 -- sick seniors are likelier
to be hospitalized than sick adults or kids.

Treatment success: 1.5 versus 6.2 versus 6.1 -- hospitalized adults
and seniors are much likelier to die than hospitalized kids

Conclusion
----------
The pandemic is attacking a higher percentage of children than of
adults and seniors. But among the 3 groups, the children are least
likely to need hospitalization and least likely to die. It is
nonetheless true that the pandemic is more deadly than the seasonal
flu to young adults and children. Think of it this way. 90 percent of
the 36 000 seasonal flu deaths in an average year are over 65,
leaving only 3600 deaths between children and adults under 65. By
comparison, 11 percent of pandemic deaths so far are children, 76
percent are adults, and 13 percent are seniors. The population is 24
percent children, 62 percent adults, and 13 percent seniors. The
seasonal flu discriminates overwhelmingly against seniors; the
pandemic flu discriminates against younger adults, though less overwhelmingly.

It's terrible that the pandemic is killing a lot more children than
usually die from the flu. It is nonetheless true that the pandemic is
less dangerous to children than to adults and seniors.

Analysis of pandemic versus seasonal flu
----------------------------------------
Pandemic cases: 47 million cases so far (15.3 percent of 308 million)
-- versus seasonal flu average of 31 million (10 percent of 308
million). The CDC range for the seasonal flu case attack rate is 5-20
percent. So the pandemic is already near the upper end of the
seasonal flu range.

Pandemic hospitalizations: 213 000 hospitalizations so far -- versus
seasonal flu average of 200 000.

Pandemic deaths: 9820 deaths so far -- versus seasonal flu average of 36 000.

So far, the number of pandemic H1N1 cases (15 percent of the
population) is getting close to the upper end of the CDC's estimated
range of seasonal flu cases (5 percent to 20 percent of the
population); those cases have led to 106 percent as many
hospitalizations (213 000 pandemic hospitalizations versus a seasonal
average of 200 000 hospitalizations), which have led to only 27.3
percent as many deaths (9820 pandemic H1N1 deaths so far versus a
seasonal average of 36 000 deaths).

Or, without numbers: The pandemic has already sickened a lot more
people than the seasonal flu average. About the same number (really
slightly more) as the seasonal flu average needed hospitalization.
Less than one-third of the seasonal flu average died.

If "mild" means number of people who get sick, the pandemic is not
milder than the seasonal flu average. If "mild" means the percentage
of the population or the percentage of sick people who die, it is
milder than the seasonal flu average. What's happening to children
under 18 is certainly not mild compared to the seasonal flu in their age group.
