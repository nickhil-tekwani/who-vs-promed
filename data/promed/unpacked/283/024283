2001/023 Outbreak of rhizomania in Denmark
---------------------------------------------
In autumn 2000, rhizomania (caused by beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus
[BNYVV - EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was reported for the first time in
Denmark. There were 2 outbreaks found on the island of Lolland, which is
the main [sugar beet production area in Denmark. Analysis of plant and
soil samples from 2 farms situated about 25 km from each other showed
infection by BNYVV. A third occurrence was observed in a beet plant in a
glasshouse.
No direct connection could be established between these findings, and the
possible origin of this infection has yet [to be determined. Further
investigations are being carried out to determine the extent of the
disease. The Danish Plant Directorate has intensified surveillance in the
affected region and soil sampling is being carried out at relevant locations.
The situation of BNYVV in Denmark can be described as: Present: only in 2
areas in Lolland and in one glasshouse.

[Presence of _Polymyxa betae_, the fungal vector of the pathogen, confirms
that the virus is established in the soils of the affected areas. The
disease also occurs in Sweden. - Mod.DH
