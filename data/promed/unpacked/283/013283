Subject: Israel & US military smallpox vax experience
--------------------
I thought the below (transcripts of NPR newscast items from Fri 20 Dec
2002) might be of interest to the list.

--------------
Israel got the jump on the United States in vaccinating health care workers
against smallpox. An Israeli researcher told an expert US panel about the
experience so far.
Since October, Israel has vaccinated 17,500 health care workers. There have
been only a handful of serious side-effects. That's partly because all the
vaccinated Israelis had been immunized years before...lowering their risk
of side effects.
But one case is catching attention. An Israeli surgeon ignored warnings
that people should not be vaccinated if someone at home has low immunity.
His wife was on medication that lowers immunity. The surgeon infected her
with the vaccinia virus, a cousin of smallpox. Days later her body was
covered with sores. She survived after a 3-week hospital stay. but she's
scarred for life.
The case shows that some people who shouldn't be vaccinated will slip
through the most careful screening programs.

[Text of NPR report of 20 Dec 2002 by Richard Knox] [edited]
In the first report on the week-old program to protect US military
personnel against smallpox, officials say many have medical conditions that
disqualify them for vaccination.
Since last Friday, the military has screened 276 personnel for possible
vaccination. But only 174 have actually gotten the vaccine. Nearly 40
percent were screened out. Most had a medical condition that put them at
risk of a severe vaccine reaction. But many had someone in their household
with such a risk. For 3 weeks after vaccination, a person can pass on the
vaccine virus [vaccinia] to close contacts. Many people were worried they
might infect relatives at holiday gatherings.
Defense Department officials told an expert panel that no bad side effects
have shown up so far. But they expect some problems, despite efforts to
screen out people who shouldn't be vaccinated. In the next few months, a
half-million military personnel will get the vaccine.
Additional comment by Richard Knox: The Israeli experience is based on a
presentation by Dr. Yehuda Danon before the Committee on Smallpox Vaccine
Implementation of the National Institutes of Medicine on Thursday 19 Dec
2002. The military vaccination experience is based on a presentation by US
Assistant Secretary of Defense Dr. William Winkenwerder before the [IOM]
committee.
In addition here are the most up-to-date data from the US military
experience, presented by Dr. Winkenwerder:
Military personnel screened for smallpox vaccination between 6 and 19
December 2002: 278
People exempted from vaccination: 102 (37 percent)
Reasons: Pregnancy: 9
Immune compromise: 16
Skin diseases: 60
Allergy: 1
Other: 33
Self exemptions: 68*
Household contact exemptions: 46*
People vaccinated against smallpox: 174 (63 percent)
Adverse events: "nothing remarkable to date"
People who developed a "take": TBD [to be determined]
*I assume this adds up to more than the total number exempted because in
some cases the same person was exempted for both "self" and "household
contact" reasons [comment by Richard Knox]

[While this thread refers to information on the Israeli experience, there
is preliminary information on the USA military experience that is
complementary and therefore was included in this post. The discussion re:
the contact vaccinia case described in the Israeli experience is clearly of
concern, as the vaccine recipient theoretically had the medical knowledge
that should have lead to self exclusion from vaccination. If a trained
medical person has erred in terms of self exclusion, what is the
probability that an untrained medical person will correctly identify their
need for self exclusion? Based on the small numbers presented on the US
Military vaccination, 40 percent of the military personnel
(educational/professional status not mentioned) self excluded -- much
higher than the 25 percent estimate given in the Kemper
paper (<http://www.acponline.org/journals/ecp/marapr02/kemper.htm>)and
discussed in the ProMED-mail posting: Smallpox vaccine, ACIP
recommendations - USA (02) 20020621.4560. Clearly a very complex issue.
The NPR article also mentions that vaccinations in Israel were given to
non-naive individuals who theoretically would have a shorter duration of
vaccinia replication (infection) and thereby be shedding the vaccinia virus
(and potentially contagious to contacts) for a shorter time period than
naive individuals. Again, more information from official sources in Israel
would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
