Bats from West Virginia caves being tested for white-nose syndrome
------------------------------------------------------------------
Bats from Pendleton County are being tested for a fungal disease known as
white-nose syndrome (WNS), a condition that has killed thousands of cave
bats in several species in the Northeast, according to Craig Stihler,
wildlife biologist for the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources
(WVDNR). The National Wildlife Health Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin, is
culturing fungi from bat specimens submitted for testing by WVDNR [West
Virginia Division of Natural Resources].

"Culturing this fungus is a time-consuming process, and the official
results of the analyses will not be available for another 2 weeks. However,
our biologists note that everything observed in the field suggests these
bats were affected by WNS," said Stihler.

The bats were collected from 2 caves near Franklin in Pendleton County on
30 Jan 2009. Since then, biologists have discovered affected bats in a cave
near Upper Tract. In addition, cavers have reported the condition in an
additional cave near Franklin.

"Although little is known about this condition, what is known suggests that
large numbers of bats in West Virginia are likely to be affected and die
within the next couple years," Stihler said. "The void in the night skies
created by the absence of thousands of bats could affect all West
Virginians because bats prey on a variety of insect pests."

The cause of white-nose syndrome, named for the white fungus, which is
often observed on the muzzles of affected bats, is not known. The fungus
also grows on the bat's wings and ears. This fungus may be the actual cause
of WNS, or it may be a secondary infection of bats that are stressed by
some other factor. The fungus associated with WNS belongs to a group of
fungi that often dwell in the soil. This particular species grows well in
the cool, moist caves where many bats spend the winter.

Scientists are not sure exactly how WNS affects the bats, but they do know
that bats with the disease use up their fat reserves too quickly, and by
mid-winter, the fat reserves needed to survive the long winter are
depleted. Although the insects the bats feed on are not available during
the winter, starving bats often fly out of their hibernation sites during
freezing temperatures in a futile attempt to find food.

No one knows how WNS is spread, but it is probably spread by multiple
means. It seems likely that bats move the condition from cave to cave, but
people who visit caves may also spread WNS on contaminated clothing and
gear. DNR biologists ask cavers to clean and disinfect all gear between
caving trips both within the state and between states. Guidelines for
disinfecting gear, and additional information on white-nose syndrome, can
be found on the US Fish and Wildlife Service website at
<http://www.fws.gov/northeast/white_nose.html>.

White-nose syndrome was first observed near Albany, New York in 2006. In
2007, biologists in New York documented the condition in 4 caves in the
Albany area, but no dead bats were observed at that time. In early 2008,
however, thousands of dead bats were seen in these caves. At some sites,
more than 90 per cent of the bats had died. By the end of last winter
[2007-08], this problem had spread to Connecticut, Massachusetts, and
Vermont. Earlier this winter [2008-09], white-nose syndrome had been
confirmed in 2 additional states: Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and had been
suspected in New Hampshire. White-nose syndrome affects several species of
bats, including the federally endangered Indiana bat. If WNS is confirmed
in Pendleton County, a 2nd endangered species, the Virginia big-eared bat,
could be impacted.

Biologists with the DNR Wildlife Diversity Unit have been monitoring
populations of hibernating bats in the state's caves and did not note any
evidence of WNS during surveys conducted in Randolph and Tucker counties
earlier this winter [2008-09]. In January 2009, photographs of 2 little
brown bats with fungus on them were taken by cavers visiting Hamilton Cave
on the John Guilday Cave Preserve.

DNR and US Fish and Wildlife Service biologists, along with cavers with the
National Speleological Society, the owner of the cave preserve, visited 3
caves on the preserve to conduct winter bat counts and to look for evidence
of white-nose syndrome. Even before reaching the caves, dead bats were
found on the trail leading to the caves. Bats suspected of having WNS were
seen in Hamilton and Trout caves, and specimens were collected for
analysis. On 5 Feb 2009, DNR biologists discovered signs of WNS in Cave
Mountain Cave near Upper Tract. About the same time, cavers reported
possible WNS-affected bats in Kee Cave near Franklin. The 4 suspected sites
are in Pendleton County, but this condition may be present, but so far
undetected, in other counties of the state.

[This is significant as the region concerned has not previously been
affected and if found in the West Virginia region may demonstrate this
syndrome is slowly moving southward. It may also imply that other species
of bats are affected by this syndrome. - Mod.TG
