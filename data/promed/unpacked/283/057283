Here is the latest official press release on dengue fever from the Ministry
of Health in Fiji.
Summary of the current dengue situation:
To date there have been nearly 8,200 clinically-presenting cases of dengue
fever. Some of these cases have shown signs of dengue haemorrhagic fever
(DHF), a more serious form of the disease. There have been eight deaths due
to suspected DHF to date, all reported from CWM hospital in Suva. The most
recent death occurred in an eight year old boy on Monday, 26 January at the
CWM Hospital.

It appears that dengue fever cases are on the rise, and are widespread.
Lautoka Hospital has noted a surge in outpatients seeking treatment for
suspected dengue fever in the past few days. The epidemic can be expected
to continue and worsen unless members of the public act quickly and
decisively to destroy mosquito breeding sites in their areas, and in areas
under their responsibility.
Dr. S. Veitogavi, Divisional Medical Officer, Central Eastern Division,
warned that school children were the latest victims of the dengue epidemic,
with increasing numbers seen in area health centres since schools
re-opened. Health inspectors found that many of the schools in the Division
had not implemented clean-up measures, and mosquito larvae were found. He
urged schools not to waste any more time in implementing clean-up measures,
fearing the trend in infected school children would continue to increase.
[Writer's note: Clean-up campaigns continue, though spraying activity has
temporarily ceased in some areas after an intensive spraying campaign. The
local media has continued to strongly support a nation-wide public
awareness campaign. While the epidemic appears to be more severe than the
1989-90 epidemic (40 deaths, ~4,000 seeking treatment at government
facilities), the overall mortality rate appears to be lower due to the hard
work of local doctors to implement appropriate treatment guidelines.
There have still been no reports of tourists or visitors to Fiji being
affected through the media or through rumours, and while the epidemic
appears to be widespread, it still seems to be limited mostly to areas
where most visitors are unlikely to go - peri-urban areas, rural villages
and settlements, school and government compounds, industrial areas and
remote outer islands. Visitors are advised to take normal precautions
against day-biting mosquitoes, and to avoid the above-mentioned areas. The
risk for the average visitor appears to be low.

epidemic of dengue. Are age-stratified data available for the
case-patients? - Mod.CHC
