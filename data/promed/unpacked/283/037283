Health authorities in the province of Herrera confirmed on Friday [30
Apr 2010] the 2nd case of [a] hantavirus [infection] recorded in the
province thus far in 2010.

The regional health director for the province, Tomas Higuera,
reported that the patient is a 69-year-old male from the community of
San Jose de Los Pozos. Higuera [said that the man] is currently being
held in the intensive care unit of the El Vigia Hospital in Chitre.

[The accuracy of this report is questioned. A report from the
Minister of Health in Panama published on 4 Mar 2010 indicated that
there were 7 reported hantavirus infections (hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome) in Herrera province in 2010 as of that date. As indicated
earlier for cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Panama, the
hantavirus most likely to be the etiological agent in these cases is
Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number
20081027.3389, hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in
Panama include Rio Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo
(_Oligoryzomys fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and Calabazo
(_Zygodontomys brevicauda (cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only
Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

[2] Brazil (Mato Grosso), suspected

Health [authorities] await with anxiety and worry the 2nd
[laboratory] tests to determine if the death of a 16-month-old boy in
Juara, Mato Grosso was due to [a] hantavirus disease [infection]. The
mother of the boy, when he exhibited the 1st symptoms, took the child
to the [local] health post and later to the Municipal Hospital where
he was treated for pneumonia. Since this is indeed a type of
pneumonia, he was taken later to the Sao Lucas Hospital where the
pediatrician, Dr. Haroldo Hatanaka, sent him the same day, 25 Mar
2010, to Cuiaba, due to his serious health condition. The boy died
the same day that he arrived in the capital for more specialized
treatment. Afterward, samples were taken for testing, and the results
were positive for hantavirus [pulmonary] disease [syndrome, HPS], and
new samples were taken to confirm, or not, this disease, and the
results must be reported by Wed 28 Apr 2010.

Nurse Paula Hieki Hatanaka informed Radio Tucunare by telephone that
they were in Porto dos Gauchos with other technical staff working on
an investigation, since, according to information given to the
technical staff of the Regional Health Pole by the mother of the boy,
they were accustomed to camping in Porto los Gauchos city, and she
took the boy along.

The technicians of Epidemiological Surveillance of the Regional
Health Pole, and of the Municipality are apprehensive about the
results of the 2nd test because if that disease [HPS] is confirmed,
Cuiaba technicians are expected to add Juara to their municipal work
load with an intensive investigation in order to discover where the
focus of the infection was and thus avoid an outbreak such as
occurred in Tangara da Serra in 2008, where several people died,
explained Nurse Paula. For safety and conduct of routine [procedures]
for such cases, all the physicians in the city will receive a
notification of the event soon.

The hantavirus [there are many more than one species (see comments
below). - Mod.TY] is transmitted by _Peromyscus leucopus_, being
present in their urine and feces [This statement is not correct. _P.
leucopus_ is a reservoir for hantaviruses in North America but is not
present in Mato Grosso. See the comments below for possible
hantaviruses and their rodent hosts in Brazil. - Mod.TY]. This virus
does not cause disease in its animal carrier, just in human beings.
It is believed that humans are infected when exposed to contaminated
dust from the nests or droppings of mice. However, the disease
[virus] is not transmissible between humans. Dust contaminated [with
virus] is frequently encountered when cleaning houses sheds, or other
enclosed areas that are long uninhabited.

However, there is no known effective [curative] treatment for the
hantavirus [infections]. Even with intensive care, more than 50
percent of diagnosed cases were fatal. [Supportive treatment is
helpful, however, and may include extracorporeal oxygenation].

[This report does not indicate which hantavirus was responsible for
this case. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving further information
about the confirmation of the specific hantavirus involved in this case.

The ProMED-mail report of cases in Brazil dated 23 Feb 2008
(ProMED-mail archive no. 20080223.07412) indicated that hantaviruses
circulating in Mato Grosso included: Laguna Negra, which has the
_Calomys callosus_ rodent host, and Castelo dos Sonhos, which had
previously been found in Para state but without a known host there.
Field research found that, in Mato Grosso, the rodent _Oligoryzomys
moojeni_ was the host of the Castelo dos Sonhos virus.

A brief description of other hantaviruses that occur in Brazil and
their rodent hosts is given in ProMED-mail archive no. 20080702.2020,
which comments that Anajatuba virus is a possible etiological agent
of HPS in Brazil. Its rodent host is _Oligoryzomys fornesi_ in Brazil
and is cited in: Rosa ES, Mills JN, Padula PJ, Elkhoury MR, et al,
2005: Newly recognized hantaviruses associated with hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome in northern Brazil: partial genetic
characterization of viruses and serologic implication of likely
reservoirs. Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis 5: 11-9 (abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15815145>).
