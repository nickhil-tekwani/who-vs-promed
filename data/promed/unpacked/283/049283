More than 100 people have now reported that they became ill with possible foodborne illnesses at a national Food Safety Summit held earlier in April 2014 in Baltimore, MD. Maryland state health officials say they still don't know what caused the outbreak of gastroenteritis that left participants suffering symptoms that included diarrhea and nausea. "We are working on evaluating possible exposures and doing testing at the Maryland state public health laboratory to attempt to identify an agent," officials said in a letter to attendees.

The conference, held from 8-10 Apr 2014 at the Baltimore Convention Center, attracted at least 1300 of the top food safety officials in the nation, including staff from federal agencies such as the FDA and the CDC as well as businesses such as McDonald's, Tyson, and ConAgra Foods. Health officials have heard back from about 400 of those who attended, so the actual toll of illness might be higher.

City health officials inspected the convention center and its food service provider, Centerplate. The company was issued a violation notice for condensation dripping from one of the 2 ice machines in the kitchen, a spokesman said.

[There is certainly something ironic regarding foodborne illness occurring at a national summit on food safety. It is not clear as yet how many of the 1300 participants became ill. The etiology of the illness or illnesses is not defined at this point. Important information regarding the illness would include what foods were eaten/drunk, how long the illness lasted, whether fever was present, and when the illnesses began as related to the food diary. It is not necessarily the case that the last food eaten before symptoms occurred was the vehicle. - Mod.LL
