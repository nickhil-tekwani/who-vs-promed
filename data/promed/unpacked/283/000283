disease of unknown etiology. After extensive correspondence
over the Internet, in which further tests were suggested, the
diagnosis was eventually established as thallium poisoning. For

Topic: homicide attempt
A recent article appeared in "U. S. Medicine" regarding the
work of Dr. Steve Cunnion, a U. S. Navy physician, which states
that a report has been made to the Bureau of Public Security in
China, alleging that Zhu Ling's thallium poisoning was the result
of an attempted murder. It was further alleged that the
perpetrator was a jilted suitor and that the source of the thallium
was *not* the laboratory in which Zhu Ling worked.
