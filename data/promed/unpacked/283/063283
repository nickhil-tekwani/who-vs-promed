State health inspectors found the DNA of Shiga toxin in an unopened packaged beef at a South Royalton [Windsor County] restaurant and believe that undercooked hamburgers at Worthy Burger were the source of an [enterohemorrhagic] _Escherichia coli_ contamination that sickened several people in late summer, a Vermont health official said on Tue 29 Sep 2015.

Bradley Tompkins, a health surveillance epidemiologist with the Department of Health, also said 2 more cases have been linked to people who dined at the restaurant, and that there now are 6 confirmed and 3 probable cases in the Vermont outbreak. All have recovered, although to varying degrees, he said. Tompkins said 8 of the 9 diners ate ground beef at Worthy Burger between the end of August 2015 and the middle of September 2015, when investigators with the Vermont Department of Health inspected the restaurant, recommended some changes, and took some beef and lettuce, which is served on the hamburgers, to test.

The lettuce tested negative -- "we do not believe lettuce played a role in this outbreak," Tompkins said -- but the health department found the DNA for Shiga toxin in the ground beef. When they grew the _E. coli_ in the lab, however, it came out to be a slightly different strain than the one found in the patients from Vermont. Still, Tompkins said, the department believes the beef is to blame.

"It's certainly not conclusive that it did come from the ground beef, (but) based on the interviews that were done with the patients and that we found the _E. coli_ and the Shiga toxins ... we do believe the outbreak was caused by the ground beef that was being undercooked from the restaurant," Tompkins said.

Asked which farm the beef came from and where it was slaughtered and packaged -- Worthy Burger relies on local suppliers for its grass-fed beef and other food -- Tompkins referred a reporter to the US Department of Agriculture's [USDA] Food Safety and Inspection Service, which oversees slaughterhouses. USDA spokeswoman Gabrielle Johnston said "there's still debate whether it's actually been linked to the beef" and said the matter is "still under investigation."

Aaron Lavallee, another USDA spokesman who was on the same phone line with Johnston, said the agency was not at a point where it would name which slaughterhouses are being investigated, but said officials are "trying to trace this back all the way to the slaughter facility. We want to get to the bottom of this," he said. "We need actionable information."

Worthy Burger closed for 5 days starting [17 Sep 2015], switched several food vendors, and made other changes, and state health officials have said the public should feel confident eating there. They've also advised that hamburgers be cooked to 155 deg F [68.3 deg C] for at least 15 seconds to ensure any potential pathogens are cooked out.

Worthy Burger's executive chef Jason Merrill said on [Tue 29 Sep 2015] the beef that was tested was taken from the restaurant's walk-in cold storage in its original packaging from a Vermont slaughterhouse, leading him to suggest the contamination could have occurred at what he called a "USDA-inspected plant".

"The samples they took from us were in a receiving walk-in, and we hadn't even touched it," he said. "I believe the beef was OK (at the farm), and when it got to the slaughterhouse, that's when the infection happened," Merrill said. Merrill said the restaurant had been using the same purveyor without any problems for 2.5 years, but declined to identify the vendor or slaughterhouse, saying health officials "are asking me not to say until they have more conclusive evidence." Worthy Burger now is using beef from a different slaughterhouse until the investigation is completed.

Tompkins said the 2 new cases that health officials announced [Tue 29 Sep 2015], dated back to the late August/early September 2015 time period. One of the patients was "really sick," but wasn't tested by her providers and "didn't think anything of it until later," he said. The other case initially was identified in another state but involved a Vermont resident, according to Tompkins.

[The report does not state whether the outbreak strain is serotype O157 or one of the other serotypes associated with Shiga toxin production. Nor does it specifically state what differences were found between the outbreak strain and the strain isolated directly from the ground beef. Like in many bacteria infection-related foodborne illness, appropriate kitchen hygiene and adequate cooking can eliminate or at least minimize the clinical impact. - Mod.LL
