A European Union (EU) ban on all English pig exports imposed after an
outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) will be reduced to apply to the
region surrounding the infected farms, EU officials said. The move,
recommended at an emergency meeting of top EU veterinary experts, means the
export embargo will now cover just 3 counties - Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk
- in the east of the country. Britain's Agriculture Ministry welcomed the
decision and said it now expected the United States (US) to follow suit by
lifting its blanket ban.
The discovery of the highly contagious swine virus, which is not dangerous
to humans, at 5 different locations in the region prompted the European
Commission (EC) on 14 Aug 2000 to ban all English exports until 31 Aug
2000. But since then UK authorities have placed curbs on the movement of
animals from the infected area and carried out tests on pigs throughout the
country. The tests have yet to find a new case outside the original area.
"The ban stays in place but the reference to England is replaced by the 3
counties of Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk," an EU official said following the
vets' meeting. One EU official said the 3-county ban would remain in place
until 15 Sep 2000 and would be reviewed at the beginning of September. A
British Agriculture Ministry spokesman said in London the move "was
unanimously agreed (at the Brussels meeting) and it is obviously a
satisfactory outcome."
The British outbreak remains small compared to the one which hit the
Netherlands in 1997 and then spread to neighbours Belgium and Germany.
It took more than a year to bring under control, some 14 million pigs had
to be slaughtered and EU compensation totalling close to one billion euros
was paid to farmers.
