Hundreds of people, irrespective of their age and sex, in 4 villages in the
Delang block of Puri district have been afflicted by an unidentified fever
during the last few weeks. According to Bishnu Prasad Mahapatra, a victim
of the disease, the affected persons experience high fever for a couple of
days followed by pain and swelling in their knees and other joints. Though
the fever recedes after taking medicines, the pain and the swelling
continues to persist.

Within a week the disease spread through Praharajpur, Sripratap Pur and
Pidhapatana villages, Mr Mahapatra said. The visiting doctors were
administering conventional medicines to the patients, advising to wait till
the report comes from labs, he added.

Puri chief district medical officer Dr D N Sarangi said a team of medicos
had been sent to the area and blood samples were collected from the
affected patients. The samples were sent to the testing laboratories of the
state and Delhi for diagnosis.
