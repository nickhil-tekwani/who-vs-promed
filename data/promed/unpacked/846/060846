The government has allocated a total of Rp 158.6 billion
(approximately USD 17.6 million) to curb the spread of rabies over the
next 2 years.

Agriculture Ministry Director General for Livestock and Health,
Prabowo R Caturuso, said the largest portion of the funds would go to
Bali, North Sumatra's Nias Island, and Maluku's West Maluku Tenggara,
given their "emergency" rabies status.

"These areas recorded the highest numbers [of] people being bitten by
dogs," Prabowo said on Friday [4 Feb 2011], as reported by
kontan.co.id. Of the funding, Bali will receive Rp 44.6 billion [about
USD 5 million] in 2011 and Rp 38.5 billion [about USD 4.3 million] in
2012; Nias Rp 27.5 billion [about USD 3 million] in 2011 and Rp 24.5
billion [about USD 2.8 million] in 2012, and West Maluku Tenggara Rp
13.5 billion [about USD 1.5 million] in 2011 and Rp 11 billion [about
USD 1.2 million] in 2012. The funds are expected to be used to
purchase rabies vaccines and to monitor and evaluate the
implementation of prevention programs.

The island of Bali recorded the highest number cases, with more than
57 800 people bitten by dogs and 119 dead from rabies in 2010. Nias
reported more than 1100 people bitten by dogs and 26 deaths. West
Maluku Tenggara reported 359 dog bites and 20 deaths. Nationwide, the
figures stood at more than 74 800 people being bitten, and 195 deaths
from the disease.

[From the account above, echoed in other Indonesian media, the rabies
death toll on Bali in 2010 is estimated currently to be 119.
Correspondent Merritt Clifton comments further, however, that if the
27 known rabies deaths that occurred in 2008 and 2009 are included,
the death toll becomes 146 going into 2011. With at least another 5
reported rabies deaths in January 2011, the current total of rabies
deaths on Bali since the onset of the outbreak becomes 151.

Only one case, however, is known to have been contracted after 1 Oct
2010.
