An extreme heatwave in Australia has led to the deaths of more than 90 wild horses in the outback, authorities say. Rangers found dead and dying animals in a dried-up waterhole near Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, last week [around 17 Jan 2019]. About 40 of the animals had already died from dehydration and starvation. Surviving horses were later culled.

It comes amid record-breaking heat, with temperatures hitting 49.5 deg C (121.1 deg F) north of Adelaide in South Australia. The mercury rose to 47.7 deg C (117.9 deg F) in the city itself on Thursday [24 Jan 2019], breaking a record set in 1939. [If there is a heat index, then it will be substantially higher than this number. Heat index is usually a combination of heat and humidity; therefore, how hot it feels is usually above the temperature on the gauge. - Mod.TG]

Australia has experienced a fortnight of extreme heat that has broken dozens of records across the nation. More than 13 towns in the state of South Australia have seen heat records eclipsed. Emergency services in more than 13 districts are on alert for fear of possible bushfires.

Meanwhile in Alice Springs, near where the horses were found, temperatures have exceeded 42 deg C (107.6 deg F) for almost 2 weeks -- more than 6 deg C above January's typical average, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.

Rangers came across the horses after their absence was noted by a remote community, said local authority Central Land Council (CLC). A local resident [R.T.] also visited the site and posted photos online, describing the scene as "carnage."

"I was devastated. I'd never seen anything like it -- all the bodies," [R.T.] told the BBC. "I couldn't believe something like that had happened." Another local [R.S.] told the ABC water was "normally there" and the horses "just had nowhere to go [for water]".

The council said it had organised a cull of the remaining horses because they were found close to death. They also planned to cull another 120 feral horses, donkeys and camels "dying from thirst" in a neighbouring community, said CLC director David Ross. "With summer temperatures well and truly upon us, we expect these emergencies to occur with increasing frequency and nobody is truly prepared and resourced to respond to them," Mr. Ross wrote in a press release.

Several other wildlife species have also suffered, with reports of mass deaths of native bats in New South Wales. Up to one million fish have also been found dead along river banks in the drought-affected state. The government has launched a review into the fish deaths.

South Australia health authorities said 44 people had come in for treatment in the space of 24 hours due to the extreme temperatures. Officials nationwide have issued health warnings urging people to stay indoors and minimise physical activity, with heightened concerns for the elderly, the chronically ill and children.

Earlier this month, officials confirmed that 2018 and 2017 had been Australia's 3rd and 4th hottest years on record, respectively.

More than 100 more feral animals could be culled in central Australia because they are dying from thirst in the prolonged extreme heatwave. Meanwhile, in Western Australia (WA), the ABC has reported as many as 2500 camels have been shot in the Goldfields region, as they come in from the Gibson desert to congregate around water sources on remote stations. The Central Land Council is consulting a remote community about carrying out an emergency cull of 120 horses, goats and donkeys in central Australia because the animals are in such poor health they cannot be mustered or transported.

It follows the publication of shocking images showing 40 dead horses at the dried-up Apwerte Uyerreme waterhole. More than 50 more horses found at the same site had to be killed via an aerial cull last Friday [18 Jan 2019].

Prolonged temperatures above 42 deg C (108 deg F) have left the council and its residents concerned about the health of native and feral animals. "Horses and other feral animals are dying of thirst and hunger because many reliable water sources, such as Apwerte Uyerreme, have dried up in the current heatwave and areas overpopulated by feral animals suffer erosion and vegetation loss," the council said on Thursday [17 Jan 2019]. "As horse carcasses foul waterholes the native animals depend on, these too die."

The council was alerted to the latest case of animal suffering in the heat on Monday [21 Jan 2019] and is working with traditional owners to obtain permission for an emergency cull. About 120 animals are watering at a trough near the community, which has not yet been named while the talks are ongoing.

David Ross, the director of the Central Land Council, said it was important to obtain the consent of traditional owners before carrying out the cull. "However, in emergencies, such as last week in Ltyentye Apurte, we will go ahead without consent if necessary," he said. "With climate change and summer high temperatures well and truly upon us, we expect these emergencies to occur with increasing frequency and nobody is truly prepared and resourced to respond to them."

Ross said to try to manage the situation the council was working with traditional owners to develop management plans for the 4 large indigenous protected areas (IPAs) in its region that would allow traditional owners and rangers to reduce the number of feral pests and sell healthy animals where they can find a market for them.

The cases in central Australia are just 2 having emerged showing the impact the extreme heat is having on large feral animals. The ABC has reported as many as 2500 camels have been shot in the Goldfields region of WA. Pastoralists say the animals were in very poor condition and have called for an urgent cull.

The WA agriculture minister, Alannah MacTiernan, said the government would discuss the issue with the Goldfields Nullarbor Rangelands Biosecurity Association (GNRBA) on Thursday [24 Jan 2019]. Feral camels are a significant problem in the Goldfields and have been known to destroy windmills in search of water.

According to GNRBA's large feral herbivore management plan, which covers feral horses, donkeys and camels, more than 25 000 feral camels were culled from unallocated crown land between 2011 and 2013. The association funds regular aerial culls and also provides an ammunition rebate for pastoralists. MacTiernan said the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development was currently developing a statewide plan for managing large feral herbivores.

[These reports are about feral animals dying of thirst in the current central Australian heat wave, but domestic animals and people are also at risk. One must carefully watch their livestock, ensuring there is plenty of water and necessary shade. Likewise, ensure that you and your family are careful in this horrible heat. It can easily take a toll, resulting in injuries from passing out and/or dehydration. Furthermore, this kind of heat can make it difficult for a power grid to maintain inside cooling temperatures for homes and office buildings. Walking and exercising in this kind of heat can even be dangerous.

We are most saddened about the animal deaths, the lack of water, and the suffering of people and animals. It is hoped people in this heat will be careful to hydrate and not overdo the stress or the fun summer can bring.
