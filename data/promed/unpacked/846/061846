An outbreak of plague in Madagascar has killed 2 people, a health official said on [Tue 18 Sep 2018], marking the official start of the season when the disease is considered to be at its deadliest. Last year, in 2017, more than 200 people were killed before epidemics of bubonic and pneumonic plague were brought under control in November [2017].

The WHO has warned that 2018's strain could be even more virulent. "According to counts undertaken between [1 Aug 2018] and [13 Sep 2018], we recorded 8 suspected plague cases, 6 of whom recovered and 2 died in their villages," said health ministry official Manitra Rakotoarivony. The 1st fatality was recorded in Fiadanana, north of the capital Antananarivo, while the 2nd was reported in Ambalavao in the Indian Ocean island's interior, added Rakotoarivony.

Madagascar has suffered bubonic plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often caused by rats fleeing forest fires. The disease tends to make a comeback each hot rainy season, from September to April. On average, between 300 and 600 infections are recorded every year among a population approaching 25 million people, according to a UN estimate.

Last year [2017], cases sprang up far earlier than usual and, instead of being confined to the countryside, the disease infiltrated towns. The authorities recorded more than 2000 cases.

The plague bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ is typically transmitted to humans from infected rats via fleas. It can also be transmitted from human to human through cough droplets expelled by a person with a pneumonic form of the disease. Pneumonic plague can prove fatal between 24 to 72 hours while the bubonic form is less dangerous.

[2017 was indeed a "banner" season for plague in the island nation of Madagascar. The outbreak was notable not only for the large number of cases but also for the high percentage of cases of pneumonic plague in urban settings and in areas where the infection generally does not occur.

The following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998;4(1):101-4, PMID: 9452403 (available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm.

"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had "virtually disappeared" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the "black plague" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med. 1997;337(10):677-80, PMID: 9278464; available at, http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL
