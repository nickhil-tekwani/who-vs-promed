Zimbabwe: Anthrax Outbreak Hits Wedza
-------------------------------------------
Three villages in Wedza district have been quarantined following an
outbreak of anthrax last month [?January 2007]. The matter came to
the fore after 6 people from the villages fell ill from disease after
consuming meat from slaughtered infected beasts. The persons
developed lesions similar to those seen on infected cattle but were
all successfully treated. [Sic]
No cattle movement is being allowed in and out of the 3 villages,
Goneso, Ruzane and Ushe. Slaughter of livestock in the villages has
also been put on hold until the stipulated 30-day vaccination period
expires. The animals were vaccinated on [13 Jan 2007].
Wedza district veterinary animal health inspector Mr Eliah
Mutsiwegota said 10 cattle died around the festive season leading the
district to vaccinate a total of 7159 beasts. Mr Mutsiwegota said the
district lost another 25 cattle due to tick-borne diseases such as
redwater fever and gall sickness.

[There seems to be a confusion in the description of the human cases.
Successful treatment would suggest that these 3 persons developed
cutaneous anthrax and not gastrointestinal anthrax. Cattle can
develop cutaneous anthrax but it is less common than the systemic
form arising from the ingestion of contaminated soil or bloody soils.
Either way, the local clinic is to be congratulated on the rapid
recognition and treatment of these patients.
