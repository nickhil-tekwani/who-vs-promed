State Health Department officials, along with a team [from the] Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV), are camping in Kariyana village in Babra taluka of Amreli district [in Gujarat state] after a virology report that 4 persons who died last week [week of 7 Jul 2013] tested positive for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). According to [local] sources, 7 people had lost their lives in fever a week ago [around 8 Jul 2013] in Kariyana village. Later on, the blood samples were sent to NIV for laboratory testing. Sources said that the sudden deaths scared villagers and they started moving out from the village to live on the outskirts of the village. "The health department teams carried out [a] survey and all preventive measures are being taken. Samples of all those persons who came into contact with CCHF-positive people [have been] sent to Pune," said Dr. B N Desani, Block Health Officer, Babra.

Sources said that more than 10 people from the village have been taking treatment at various hospitals in Rajkot and Ahmedabad. "We have taken blood samples of all people who complained of fever in the village and are monitoring them constantly," Dr Desani said. The village has around 5000 population and their main occupation is animal husbandry and agriculture. Officials said that symptoms characterizing the initial stage of CCHF include mood instability, agitation and mental confusion. Other signs are nose bleeding, bloody urine, vomiting, and black stools. Sources said that after an incubation period of 1 to 3 days following a tick bite, flu-like symptoms appear which may resolve in a week. In up to 75 per cent of cases, however, signs of hemorrhage appear 3 to 5 days after the onset of the illness if it is not contained properly.

Teams from the State Health Department and the Pune-based National Institute of Virology have reached Kariyana town in the district to control the outbreak. Many inhabitants of Kariyana have [left the village] after onset of the disease, according to [local] sources.

[Cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been reported from rural areas of Gujarat in the north-west of India in previous years, despite the fact that it is one of the most industrialised regions of India. The development of the outbreak and progress on its control can be followed by accessing the ongoing FluTrackers thread at: http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=208849.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by a nairovirus. Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans occur. The disease is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe and Asia. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is present (and probably endemic) throughout northern India.

The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30 percent, with death occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In those patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness. When patients with CCHF are admitted to hospital, there is a risk of nosocomial spread of infection.

CCHF virus may infect a wide range of domestic and wild animals. Animals become infected with CCHF from the bite of infected ticks. A number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, but the most efficient and common vectors for CCHF appear to be members of the genus _Hyalomma_. Trans-ovarial (transmission of the virus from infected female ticks to offspring via eggs) and venereal transmission have been demonstrated amongst some vector species, indicating one mechanism which may contribute to maintaining the circulation of the virus in nature. However, the most important source for acquisition of the virus by ticks is believed to be infected small vertebrates on which immature _Hyalomma_ ticks feed. Once infected, the tick remains infected through its developmental stages, and the mature tick may transmit the infection to large vertebrates, such as livestock. Domestic ruminant animals, such as cattle, sheep and goats, are viraemic for around one week after becoming infected.

Disease management in humans consists of general supportive therapy. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in treatment of established CCHF infection with some apparent benefit. There is no protective vaccine. (For further information, see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/index.html).
