[extracted from a report by Mireya Tabuas in El Nacional, Caracas, 10 July
1997]
A new outbreak of cholera in Caracas has taken place since June 18, affecting
12 patients with the death of a 62 year old man from Gramoven. This is the
second outbreak of cholera this year (the last was from December to February
when two patients died) and has been focused in the areas of Gramoven and
Nueva Tacagua in addition to one case in El Valle.
The report was provided by the Director of Health of the Federal District,
Jose Leon Uzcategui, and the Director of Epidemiology, Eva Rodriguez, the two
of whom declared an epidemiological alert in Caracas. The cause of the
outbreak is not know, but may be due to contaminated fish that is sold on
the street. Measures for proper sanitation and food handling were emphasized
again.
