[This is the 4th immediate notification on HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in the Palestinian Authority since the beginning of 2015. The previous notifications were dated 20 Jan 2015 (West Bank, 3 outbreaks), 24 Mar 2015 (West Bank, 1 outbreak) and 2 Apr 2015 (Gaza strip, 1 outbreak). The current notification relates to 6 new outbreaks since April 2015, addressing ProMED-mail's RFIs 20150414.3297762 and 20150618.3447479.

HPAI H5N1 in the Gaza Strip, a territory separated from the West Bank by Israel's territory while bordering Egypt (the Sinai peninsula), is of particular concern. Gaza strip is densely populated, including numerous backyard holdings in both rural and urban areas. Control of HPAI in such holdings is a complex undertaking.

Subscribers are referred to the following report from the Times of Israel, dated 22 Jul 2015, which may add background to the current notification: (http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-coops-warned-after-gaza-bird-flu-outbreak/):

"The Agriculture Ministry warns chicken coop owners in Gaza periphery communities of the risk of their fowl contracting bird flu, following an outbreak of the disease in the Gaza Strip.

According to Palestinian Authority reports, several farms breeding some 45 000 egg-laying chickens and other fowl are suspected of contamination [with] the virus.

The ministry instructs coop owners near the Gaza border fence to report any unusual chicken deaths in their farms and to seek approval when transferring birds from their coops. The Gaza periphery farms that received the warning are located mostly within 10 km from the epicenter of the breakout in the Gaza Strip.

The Agriculture Ministry and the PA have increased coordination in preparing for battling the disease, with ministry officials and their Palestinian counterparts undergoing joint training on how to defeat the virus.

According to NRG, Israel gave the PA kits to identify the disease, as well as equipment to protect handlers and medicine to treat the disease. Additionally, Israel is allowing the PA to send samples for tests in the Beit Dagan Veterinary Institute in order to predict future outbreaks in PA-controlled areas."

Information on the genotype involved is requested; in case it is, as suspected, similar to the virus clade 2.2.1.2 with putative human health impact circulating in Egypt, severe measures should be applied to protect exposed humans. - Mod.AS/CRD
