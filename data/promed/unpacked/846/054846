EHV1 Myeloencephalitis in Australia: Enigmas and a Place for Specific
Antibody Testing
---------------------------------------------------
[In a comment appended to a previous ProMED-mail post, entitled Equine
herpesvirus type 1, diagnosis 20030412.0885, the Moderator (AS) observed
that: "Dr Studdert's information was complementary to the data on
differential diagnosis of the 2 equine herpesviruses, currently available
in the OIE Manual of Standards, Diagnostic tests and Vaccines, 2000, as
referred to in our last EHV1 posting (20030323.0719). It would be
appreciated if further developments of the said outbreaks and/or laboratory
findings become available to our subscribers." In response Dr. Studdert has
sent the following information which begins with the Abstract of a longer
article in Veterinary Record (ref. 1).]
"5 of 10 pregnant, lactating mares, each with a foal at foot, developed
neurological disease. 3 of them became recumbent, developed complications
and were euthanized; of the 2 that survived, one aborted an equine
herpesvirus type 1 (EHV1)-positive fetus 68 days after the first signs were
observed in the index case, and the other gave birth to a healthy foal on
day 283 but remained ataxic and incontinent. The diagnosis of EHV1
myeloencephalitis was supported by postmortem findings, PCR identification
of the virus and by serological tests with an EHV1-specific ELISA. At the
time of the index case, the 10 foals all had a heavy mucopurulent nasal
discharge, and PCR and the ELISA were used to detect and monitor EHV1
infection in them. The status of EHV1 infection in the 5 in-contact mares
was similarly monitored. Sera from 3 of the affected mares, taken 7 days
after the index case, were negative or had borderline EHV1-specific
antibody titres. In later serum samples there was an increase in the titres
of EHV1-specific antibody in 2 of the affected mares. In contrast, sera
from the 5 unaffected in-contact mares were all EHV1-antibody positive when
they were first tested 7 or 13 days after the index case."
Based on the results of the EHV1/EHV4 specific antibody detection ELISA the
authors concluded that EHV1 antibody negativity is a hitherto specifically
unidentified, major, perhaps the most important, risk factor in the
development of EHV1 myeloencephalitis.
Beginning 28 Mar 2001 Australia experienced its first confirmed major
outbreak of EHV1 myeloencephalitis and the results of a study of that
outbreak were recently published in the Veterinary Record (ref. 1). Of the
4 syndromes caused by EHV1, respiratory disease, abortion, perinatal foal
mortality and myeloencephalitis, myeloencephalitis is the least common.
Like outbreaks of EHV1 abortion and perinatal foal mortality, outbreaks of
myeloencephalitis are always dramatic and challenging. The outbreaks that
occurred on the National Stud, UK in 1979, the Lipizzan Stud, Austria in
1983 and some more recent outbreaks in Germany, UK and USA (see below
ProMED postings) attracted worldwide attention and greatly challenged
clinicians and their diagnostic support teams, as have all outbreaks. We
have learned much since the early-recorded outbreaks but as highlighted by
the Veterinary Record paper there are still enigmas.
There is epidemiological evidence that only certain EHV1 strains cause
myeloencephalitis, but genomic markers for such strains have not been
identified. Other risk factors have been variably reported as: pregnancy,
nursing, foals at foot with EHV1 respiratory disease leading to a large
'build-up' in the amount of EHV1 circulating in the group and commingling
of disparate groups of horses. None of the foals in the present study
developed myeloencephalitis, which suggests age and maturity as risk factors.
The pathogenesis of EHV1 myeloencephalitis is quite unlike that produced by
the alphaherpesviruses of other animal species, including humans. The
primary lesion appears to be a vasculitis with thrombosis, haemorrhage, and
anoxic changes and has been attributed to the tropism of EHV1, transported
in leukocytes as a cell-associated viraemia, for vascular endothelium (ref. 2).
It has also been suggested that the pathogenesis may also be
immune-mediated, possibly immune complex-mediated, with the implication
that the antibody of the immune complex is pre-existing EHV1 antibody. The
report (ref. 1) suggests that the antibody of such complexes is not EHV1
antibody, certainly not high-affinity EHV1 IgG. To the contrary, EHV1
antibody negativity is identified as a major, perhaps the most important,
risk factor in the development of EHV1 myeloencephalitis. The authors used
an EHV1 antibody detection ELISA. This proprietary ELISA (SVANOVIR,
EHV1/4-Ab ELISA, Svanova Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) discriminates between
EHV1 and the related 2nd equine alphaherpesvirus, EHV4, which primarily
causes respiratory disease only. EHV4 and EHV1 share many cross-reactive
antigenic determinants. The EHV1/EHV4 ELISA is robust and well-validated
and is included among the tests described in OIE 'Manual of Standards,
Diagnostic tests and Vaccines, 2000', as referenced in a previous EHV1
ProMED posting (20030323.0719). The antigen used to capture specifically
the EHV1 or EHV4 antibody is a recombinant protein made to the variable
carboxyl terminal region of glycoprotein G, one of 12 or so virion envelope
structural proteins. The data presented show that all 10 mares had antibody
to EHV4.
The 5 unaffected mares also had antibody to EHV1. 3 of the 5 affected
mares, for which appropriate sera were obtained before death, were either
negative or had borderline levels of EHV1 antibody, and in the case of 2
surviving mares, there was a rising EHV1 antibody titre. These findings,
suggesting EHV1 antibody negativity as a major risk factor in the
development of EHV1 myeloencephalitis, are reminiscent of those reported in
a major outbreak of EHV1 abortion in Australia (ref. 3) in which EHV1
antibody negativity was identified as a risk factor for EHV1 abortion.
If EHV1 antibody negativity is such an important risk factor in the
development of EHV1 myeloencephalitis and abortion why has it, for so long,
gone without specific supporting data? There is an enormous amount of EHV1
antibody testing conducted around the world each year. These tests are
either virus neutralisation or complement fixation assays. Because of the
antigenic cross-reactivity that exists between EHV1 and EHV4, these assays
do not discriminate between the 2 viruses with certainty, and when used to
report back EHV1 antibody detection results, will more often than not be in
error.
Looking to the future, an important confounding factor in the application
and interpretation of the specific EHV1/EHV4 antibody detection ELISA is
the use of combined inactivated EHV1/EHV4 vaccines. Such vaccines would be
expected to elicit antibody to at least the viral structural proteins,
including glycoprotein G. The level of glycoprotein G antibody produced
following vaccination and its persistence are matters for further
investigation.
It will be argued that the data presented in the paper are too skimpy to
support the conclusions. Those clinicians and their diagnostic support
teams will know that the high drama of managing an outbreak of EHV1
myeloencephalitis requires a lot of effort, and what is done is much
influenced by what tests are not only available to be used, but are in fact
used. Right or wrong, the findings recorded in the Veterinary Record paper
clearly point the way to resolving some of the remaining enigmas of EHV1
myeloencephalitis.
