Glades Horse Contracts Rare Disease
Warning Issued To Avoid Mosquito Bites
-----------------------------------

There has been 1 Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV)-confirmed positive horse (onset 6/25/12) reported from the Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services (FDACS) for Glades County.

This is the 11th horse in the state to be reported with EEEV infection with onset during 2012 and is the first case for Glades County.

To protect your horses from mosquitoes, you should consult with your veterinarian on getting your horses vaccinated for Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile Virus (WNV).

Anyone in an area where the virus is circulating can get infected with EEEV. The risk is highest for people who live in or visit woodland habitats, and people who work outside or participate in outdoor recreational activities, because of greater exposure to potentially infected mosquitoes. It takes 4 to 10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms of EEE.

EEE is a rare disease [in people - Mod.TG] that is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes. EEEV is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). EEEV is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito.

Avoiding mosquito bites is the best way to prevent disease.

The Glades County Health Department will continue with surveillance and encourage everyone to take basic precautions to help limit exposure.

[We don't hear of too many people being diagnosed with EEE, but it does happen and is not really all that rare, as it happens almost every year.

What is very sad is there is a very good vaccine to protect horses. It is usually combined with West Nile virus. Yet every year people forget, or choose not to vaccinate their animals and we have infected animals. Infected animals usually die or are euthanized for humane reasons and possible danger to their human care takers.

It is the mosquito season. Please vaccinate your animals.
