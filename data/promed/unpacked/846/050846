From: Stephen A. Berger, M.D. <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

[In response to the Chief Medical Officer of Liberia having been quoted as
saying that epidemic yellow fever is common in Liberia in the rainy season,
ProMED-mail asked Steve Berger to search GIDEON for pertinent data, we have
this summary. - Mod.CHC
The following data on yellow fever in Liberia were extracted from the
GIDEON software program. I haven't seen anything on activity this year (to
June).
Liberia is designated an "endemic area" by W.H.O., which lists the
following areas at risk for infection: Boma, Bong, Lofa and Simoe counties.
Proof of vaccination is required for travelers over 1 year of age.
- Five cases were reported in 1967. No autochthonous cases were reported
during 1973 to 1994.
- 360 cases (9 fatal) were reported from Bassa County (Buchanan District)
and 1 case from Bong County in 1995 - resulting in immunization of
approximately 1,040,000 people.
- No cases were reported in 1996.
- One case (fatal) was reported from Lofa County in 1997.
