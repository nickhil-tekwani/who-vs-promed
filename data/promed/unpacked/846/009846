Foot-and-mouth disease hits 2 more Vietnamese localities
-----------------------------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease has stricken 2 more localities of Viet Nam, raising
the number of its affected cities and provinces to 36, according to a local
animal health agency on Wednesday [24 May 2006].
The latest cases were found in northern Hai Phong city and northern Ha Nam
province several days go, said the Department of Animal Health under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
As of Tuesday [23 May 2006], 12 out of 36 affected localities, including
the 8 northern provinces of Cao Bang, Bac Can, Ha Giang, Thai Nguyen, Phu
Tho, Yen Bai, Hai Duong and Lai Chau; 2 central localities, namely Nghe An
province and Da Nang city; and the 2 central highlands provinces of Gia Lai
and Lam Dong, had declared FMD outbreaks in their territories.
Viet Nam is intensifying control over cattle transport and trade in
affected areas, surveillance of the disease and vaccination of healthy
animals. It is expected to import some 11 million doses of vaccines from
mid-June to September 2006 to serve prevention work nationwide.
The disease has jumped to 420 communes in 36 cities and provinces
nationwide, hitting nearly 17 100 bulls and buffaloes and some 18 400 pigs,
the department said, noting that nearly 12 000 pigs and some 240 buffalos
and bulls have either died or been culled due to the outbreak.
