A comment on the undiagnosed deaths in Bengal
---------------------------------------------
[Professor T. Jacob John has sent the following comments relating to
the ProMED-mail post archived as: Undiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh,
India (03) 20070501.1413, in which the deaths were attributed to an
outbreak to dengue fever. - Mod.CP]
According to the Moderator [on the basis of the information contained
in a report by local investigators - Mod.CP] the balance of evidence
suggests an outbreak of dengue fever. However, there are a few
pointers against dengue fever.
(1) Age of victims -- quite unlike dengue fever, which is mostly in
children and adolescents in this endemic region.
(2) Dengue fever is not "contagious;" the 36 year-old man got
infected from a patient by close contact.
(3) Dengue fever does not cause death; only dengue haemorrhagic fever
causes death. (Also not in such clusters, case fatality in the range
of 10-20 percent).
(4) Although dengue virus can rarely cause encephalitis, a cluster of
encephalitis cases cannot be due to dengue virus.
(5) This general geographic area has previously been affected by
Henipah virus outbreaks. Clinical and epidemiological features are consistent.

Nipah virus threat
------------------
As of Thu 3 May [2007], according to preliminary observations of
state health department officials about the mysterious disease that
claimed 5 lives in Nadia, a new, deadly virus poses a stiff
challenge. Experts, after visiting the areas affected in the
district, said the symptoms are similar to ailments caused by Nipah
virus, which is a newly recognised zoonotic virus. It is generally
found in Malaysia and Bangladesh.
Dr. Sanchita Baksi, the state's director of Health Services, said,
"Though the symptoms are of Nipah, we are yet to confirm the virus.
It will become clear after we get the viscera report of a victim from
the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Nipah virus created a spot
of bother in Siliguri a few years ago."
Various viral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Japanese
encephalitis have caught the department unawares. According to
experts, the virus was "discovered" in 1999. It has diseased animals
and human beings and is infectious. The virus is named after the
location where it was first detected in Malaysia. Though the virus
has only caused a few focal outbreaks, the virus's biological
property can infect a wide range of hosts and produce a disease
causing significant mortality in humans. This emerging viral
infection has become a public heath concern. It is believed that
certain species of fruit bats are the natural hosts of Nipah virus.
The mode of transmission from animal to animal, and from animal to
human is uncertain, but appears to require close contact with
contaminated tissue or body fluids from infected animals. It is
unlikely that the virus is easily transmitted to man, though previous
outbreak reports suggest that Nipah is transmitted from animals to
humans more readily than other viruses. The virus's incubation period
is between 4 and 18 days. The onset usually has "influenza-like"
symptoms with high fever and muscular pain. The disease may progress
to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) with drowsiness,
disorientation, convulsions and coma, and 50 percent of clinically
apparent cases die. No drug has proved effective in treating Nipah
virus infection.
SNS (Statesman News Service) adds from Krishnagar: Specialist doctors
of the Delhi's National Institute of communicable Diseases visiting
the district was still at sea today about the mystery disease that
claimed five lives.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph P. Dudley, Ph.D
[An outbreak of dengue fever is no longer favoured as an explanation
for the mysterious deaths that have occurred in the border region
embracing West Bengal and Bangladesh, The characteristics of the
outbreak are now regarded as consistent with the occurrence of an
outbreak of bat-transmitted Nipah virus, or a similar Henipa virus.
However, as yet there has been no positive identification of the
etiologic agent. The results of diagnosis by laboratory procedures
are still awaited. No new cases have been reported. - Mod.CP].
