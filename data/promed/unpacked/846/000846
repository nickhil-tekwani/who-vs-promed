----------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the _Mycoplasma bovis_ investigation in New Zealand, please note that MPI [Ministry of Primary Industries] is still assessing the possible means by which _Mycoplasma bovis_ entered the country. The Ministry's current view, following a preliminary review of the scientific information, is that while imported semen remains a possible entry pathway, it is considered low risk due to the hygiene practices around collection and distribution. New Zealand imports a large amount of bovine semen and has done so for decades, apparently without previous adverse events. Nevertheless, a formal reassessment of the risk posed by imported semen is ongoing.

[We are grateful for Dr van Halderen's response. While the investigation is on going, it is understandable that imported semen remains the number one suspect of this current outbreak. But if semen is proven not to be the source then it would seem the current risk assessment may be adequate. - Mod.TG]
