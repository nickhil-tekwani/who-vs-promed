Six months since an outbreak was declared, syphilis continues to surge in Saskatchewan as doctors struggle to track down at-risk patients.

The Saskatchewan Health Authority and Indigenous Services Canada declared an outbreak in June [2019] after 42 cases of syphilis were diagnosed in the North Battlefords-Lloydminster area in the 1st 6 months of the year [2019].

Saskatchewan has a relatively low rate of syphilis compared to other Canadian provinces. However, as of October [2019], the Ministry of Health counted 277 cases of syphilis so far in 2019 compared to just 85 in 2016 -- an increase of more than 300 percent.

Indigenous Services Canada also reported 83 new cases across the province's 82 Indigenous communities, a staggering 2000 percent increase since 2017.

Northern medical health officer Dr Mandiangu Nsungu said the biggest challenge has been tracking down people who have had sexual contact with existing patients.

Nsungu said health care workers have only been able to locate 65 percent of contacts, of which 80 percent have tested positive for syphilis so far. "That tells us there are a good proportion of people who are infected who have not been detected yet," Nsungu said.

Syphilis can incubate for up to 3 months after contact. When initial symptoms do present, they fade quickly on their own, meaning many infected people do not realize they have the disease. "The disease can evolve in silence," Nsungu said. Once identified, syphilis is treatable and curable. Nsungu said 90 percent of identified cases have been successfully treated and he was "encouraged" that newer cases are being identified earlier, suggesting the health authority's outreach campaign is having an effect.

Khan said most new cases were young people and women of child-bearing age who were having unprotected sex with multiple partners. 43 percent of cases this year [2019] were women compared to just 7 percent in 2017, creating concern the disease could spread to a newborn child. The leading risk factor in new cases is a previous STI [sexually transmitted infections].

But Khan said he's worried by a newer trend driving syphilis infections: sex fuelled by crystal meth. "We also saw crystal meth play a role," Khan said. "When you use meth, you usually aren't too worried about using a condom."

Saskatchewan's outbreak follows similar trends across Canada and in the United States. The Public Health Agency of Canada estimates syphilis rates in Alberta, for example, increased more than 800 percent this year [2019].

It's also not the only STI on the rise; rates of gonorrhea in Saskatchewan have increased more than 80 percent since 2016. In the 2017-18 federal budget, [CAD] 4.3 million [about USD 3.3 million] was allotted to fight the spread of STIs in Saskatchewan. Heather Hale, executive director of Saskatoon Sexual Health, said the silver lining of the rising figures is that more people are getting tested and catching the illness early. Her centre has seen a 72 percent increase in the number of tests conducted compared to the same time period last year [2018]. "If you're doing more testing, that usually means you're going to have more incidents," Hale said.

The Middlesex-London Health Unit (MLHU) [Ontario] has declared a community-wide syphilis outbreak after a recent increase in cases. The number of syphilis cases in the Middlesex-London region [has] more than tripled so far this year [2019] to 113.

"We want to emphasize that something is happening that is causing the case numbers to increase, and that syphilis transmission is occurring more easily," said Dr Alex Summers, associate medical officer of health with the MLHU. "It's important to alert the community about what's happening. We're seeing that cases of syphilis are becoming more widespread, and because this is a disease we're concerned about, it's critical to make sure people understand how to protect themselves."

The [Middlesex-London] health unit first detected the increase in the number of cases among men who have sex with men, but more recent data shows that a growing proportion of cases are being diagnosed in people who have sex with members of the opposite sex and those associated with the sex trade.

This is the 2nd time since 2005 the local rate of syphilis cases has exceeded the provincial [Ontario] rate.

[In recent ProMED-mail posts, illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, has been cited as a contributing factor to recent increases in syphilis cases in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Ontario, and Manitoba, and the 1st news report above adds Saskatchewan to that list. This news report also mentions a 2000 percent increase in syphilis cases that has occurred in Saskatchewan's 82 Indigenous communities in since 2017.

Methamphetamine can be swallowed, snorted, smoked, or injected by needle and syringe (https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/methamphetamine). When methamphetamine is injected, transmission of syphilis may occur as a consequence of sharing a needle/syringe contaminated with infected blood from somebody who has primary or secondary syphilis (https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/health/04-28TransmissionSyphilis.asp); but syphilis can also be acquired by direct contact with an infected lesion during oral, vaginal, or anal sex when the drug is taken by any route of administration. Methamphetamine use is associated with sexual behaviors that increase the risk for acquiring syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, including having multiple sex partners, inconsistent condom use, and exchange of sex for drugs or money (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm).

The linkage of methamphetamine use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially crack cocaine, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification.

The news reports above also note that the incidence of syphilis is also increasing in women. Bacteremia due to _Treponema pallidum_, the cause of syphilis, which occurs during primary, secondary, and latent syphilis, can result in transplacental transmission of this organism to the fetus during pregnancy and cause congenital syphilis. An increase in the incidence of syphilis in women in the population is commonly accompanied by increasing rates of congenital syphilis.

Battlefords--Lloydminster, with a population of 73 506 residents in 2016, is a federal electoral district in Central-Western Saskatchewan, Canada; 22.2% of the population is Indigenous (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefords--Lloydminster). A map showing the location of Battlefords--Lloydminster can be found at (https://homer.ca/maps/saskatchewan.htm).

The Middlesex-London Health Unit delivers services to the people who live in the city of London (2016 population 383 822) and Middlesex County (2016 population 71 551), which is a primarily rural and has 3 Indigenous reserves (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesex_County,_Ontario).
