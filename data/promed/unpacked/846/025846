Thousands of visitors to the Melbourne Aquarium have been warned by health
authorities to be alert for symptoms of legionnaires' disease after an
outbreak of
the illness was traced to the tourist centre. Four people are in hospital
with the
illness after visiting the $33 million aquarium this month. Two of them are
critically ill.
Health authorities tracked the source of the outbreak to the four-month old
building on the banks of the Yarra. The four victims, two men and two
women, all over 65, fell
ill after visiting the aquarium on April 13 and 15. It is likely the
victims were infected while queuing outside the building as the disease is
most commonly spread by spray drifts from infected cooling towers on the
roofs of buildings.
Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Graham Rouch, said the aquarium was
"probably one of the safest places to be in the city" now that the towers
had been disinfected. But he warned that visitors during the recent school
holidays should see their doctor immediately if they developed flu-like
symptoms such as headache, fever, chills, muscle aches and pains.
The aquarium has had more than 300 000 visitors since it opened on 17 Jan
2000. An average of about 5000 people a day visited during the school
holidays. The head of infectious diseases at the Department of Human
Services, Professor William Hart, said early diagnosis was crucial but
parents should not worry as legionnaires' disease did not affect healthy
children.
Legionnaires' disease is an infection, most commonly due to the _Legionella
pneumophila_ bacterium, which causes a severe form of pneumonia. Professor
Hart also revealed yesterday that Victoria "technically" had an epidemic of
legionnaires' disease as there had been 57 notified cases this year,
compared with 64 cases for all of 1999.

National health alert issued over legionnaires outbreak
The Victorian Department of Human Services has issued a national health
alert over the outbreak of legionnaire's disease at the Melbourne Aquarium.
The number of confirmed cases has risen to seven, with all patients in
hospital in intensive care.
Five people are in a critical condition and two are recovering.
Dr John Carnie, from the Department of Human Services, expects more cases
of the disease to be detected. "What we're suggesting is for people
interstate who visited Victoria during the relevant period, again just as
we've told people in Victoria, if they're concerned about it, if they've
been to that vicinity and they are currently ill, to see a doctor and ask
to get tested for this disease," he said.
