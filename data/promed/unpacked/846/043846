Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
COVID-19 can cause severe illness in children and adolescents.

What is added by this report?
Weekly COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents rose nearly 5-fold during late June to mid-August 2021, coinciding with increased circulation of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. The proportions of hospitalized children and adolescents with severe disease were similar before and during the period of delta predominance. Hospitalization rates were 10 times higher among unvaccinated than among fully vaccinated adolescents.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Preventive measures to reduce transmission and severe outcomes in children and adolescents are critical, including vaccination, universal masking in schools, and masking by persons aged 2 years or older in other indoor public spaces and childcare centers.

Discussion
----------
Rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization among children and adolescents increased rapidly from late June to mid-August 2021, coinciding with predominance of the delta variant. With more activities resuming, including in-person school attendance and a return of younger children to congregate childcare settings, preventive measures to reduce the incidence of severe COVID-19 are critical. Universal indoor masking is recommended for all teachers, staff members, students, and visitors in kindergarten through grade 12 schools, regardless of vaccination status. CDC recommends that persons aged 2 years or older who are unvaccinated, as well as vaccinated persons in areas of substantial or high transmission, wear masks in all indoor public spaces.

CDC also recommends that childcare centers serving children too young to be vaccinated consider implementing universal indoor masking for persons aged 2 years or older. All persons who are eligible should receive COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the risk for severe disease for themselves and others with whom they come into contact, including children who are currently too young to be vaccinated.

Singapore will maintain current virus curbs despite a recent rise in cases, and plans to start vaccine booster shots soon for vulnerable groups as highly contagious variants remain a concern.

With one of the world's best vaccination rates, Singapore plans to boost testing and allow infected people with mild symptoms to recover at home. The government is also targeting to start booster shots for those above 60 years and people who are immunocompromised this month [September 2021].

The country is moving into a phase of "living with COVID" and there is no need to impose more restrictions, Finance Minister and co-chair of the virus taskforce Lawrence Wong said at a Friday [3 Sep 2021] briefing. "We would only revert to such a tightened posture as a last resort to prevent our hospital system from being overwhelmed," he said. "At the same time, we do not intend to make any new opening moves at this juncture, because there is a time lag between the onset of infections to serious illness, and so we want to take some time to monitor the situation."

The current measures will remain "for a while more" to allow authorities to monitor the situation, Trade Minister Gan Kim Yong said at the same briefing. Meanwhile, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung expects about 85% of the population to be inoculated within a month. The ministers' remarks signal an intention for Singapore to tentatively push forward with a strategy to gradually lift strict virus curbs that have been in place since last year [2020]. Officials have pledged to do so once 80% of its population is fully vaccinated -- a milestone achieved last weekend.

Singapore's resolve has been tested in recent weeks with Friday's [3 Sep 2021] cases going well above 200, marking the highest number of infections in the broader community since the start of the pandemic. The ministers had earlier anticipated a rise in cases following a gradual loosening of strict containment curbs as part of reopening strategy geared toward treating the virus as endemic, though they pointed out on Friday that serious cases remain stable.

Officials have reiterated that any return to tougher measures would be done to reduce the strain in hospitals, which have allocated 1000 beds in intensive care units. Currently there are 528 cases warded in hospitals with most under observation while 5 are in critical condition and 27 require oxygen supplementation, government data showed.

Here are measures authorities are looking at to keep the virus situation under control:

- Encouraging people to self-test regularly with antigen rapid kits as a "matter of social responsibility" if they attend large-scale events or take part in high-risk activities.
- Asking employers to promote antigen rapid tests in the workplace and make this part of business continuity plans.
- Setting up 20 quick test centers to fulfill employment requirements or to allow unvaccinated people to attend a mass event.

Authorities said Friday [3 Sep 2021] they will start booster shots for selected groups this month, given emerging data on the waning vaccine efficacy against COVID with time. The government this week said it can send half a million Pfizer-BioNTech shots to Australia this week in return for receiving the same number in December [2021].

Those above 60, who are among the first to be offered vaccines, and many completed their 2nd shot around March [2021], will be eligible for their 3rd dose this month [September 2021]. For the immunocompromised, they are recommended to get a 3rd dose 2 months after their 2nd shot, officials said.

[3] Delta: has it peaked?
Date: Wed 1 Sep 2021
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/briefing/delta-peak-covid-caseload.html


Has the delta-fueled COVID-19 surge in the USA finally peaked? The number of new daily US cases has risen less over the past week than at any point since June [2021], as you can see in the chart [see source URL above].

There is obviously no guarantee that the trend will continue. But there is one big reason to think that it may and that caseloads may even soon decline.

Since the pandemic began, COVID has often followed a regular -- if mysterious -- cycle. In one country after another, the number of new cases has often surged for roughly 2 months before starting to fall. The delta variant, despite its intense contagiousness, has followed this pattern.

After delta took hold last winter in India, caseloads there rose sharply for slightly more than 2 months before plummeting at a nearly identical rate. In Britain, caseloads rose for almost exactly 2 months before peaking in July [2021]. In Indonesia, Thailand, France, Spain and several other countries, the delta surge also lasted somewhere between 1.5 and 2.5 months.

And in the US states where delta first caused caseloads to rise, the cycle already appears to be on its downside. Case numbers in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri peaked in early or mid-August [2021] and have since been falling [see figure at source URL above].

We have asked experts about these 2-month cycles, and they acknowledged that they could not explain it. "We still are really in the cave ages in terms of understanding how viruses emerge, how they spread, how they start and stop, why they do what they do," Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, said.

But 2 broad categories of explanation seem plausible, the experts say. One involves the virus itself. Rather than spreading until it has reached every last person, perhaps it spreads in waves that happen to follow a similar timeline. How so? Some people may be especially susceptible to a variant like delta, and once many of them have been exposed to it, the virus starts to recede -- until a new variant causes the cycle to begin again (or until a population approaches herd immunity).

The 2nd plausible explanation involves human behavior. People don't circulate randomly through the world. They live in social clusters, Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, points out. Perhaps the virus needs about 2 months to circulate through a typically sized cluster, infecting the most susceptible -- and a new wave starts when people break out of their clusters, such as during a holiday. Alternately, people may follow cycles of taking more and then fewer COVID precautions, depending on their level of concern.

Whatever the reasons, the 2-month cycle predated delta. It has repeated itself several times in the USA, including both last year [2020] and early this year [2021], with the alpha variant, which was centered in the upper Midwest [see figure at source URL above].

We want to emphasize that cases are not guaranteed to decline in coming weeks. There have been plenty of exceptions to the 2-month cycle around the world. In Brazil, caseloads have followed no evident pattern. In Britain, cases did decline about 2 months after the delta peak -- but only for a couple of weeks. Since early August [2021], cases there have been rising again, with the end of behavior restrictions likely playing a role [see the following about Britain's willingness to accept rising caseloads https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/28/world/europe/coronavirus-britain-uk.html].

In the USA, the start of the school year could similarly spark outbreaks this month [September 2021]. The country will need to wait a few more weeks to know. In the meantime, one strategy continues to be more effective than any other in beating back the pandemic: "Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine," as Osterholm says. Or as Nuzzo puts it, "Our top goal has to be 1st shots in arms."

The vaccine is so powerful because it keeps deaths and hospitalizations rare even during surges in caseloads. In Britain, the recent death count has been less than one-tenth what it was in January [2021].

In a few countries, vaccination rates have apparently risen high enough to break COVID's usual 2-month cycle: The virus evidently cannot find enough new people to infect. In both Malta and Singapore, this summer's [2021] surge lasted only about 2 weeks before receding.

[4] Mu variant
[A] Colombia
Date: Fri 3 Sep 2021
Source: Agence France-Presse via The Vibes [edited]
https://www.thevibes.com/articles/world/40343/mu-coronavirus-variant-predominant-in-colombia-health-official


A new coronavirus variant known as "mu," identified first in Colombia in January [2021], is now the country's predominant strain and behind its deadliest pandemic wave yet, a health official said Thursday [2 Sep 2021]. The variant was responsible for Colombia's deadly 3rd infection wave between April and June, health official Marcela Mercado told a local radio station.

During this period, with about 700 deaths per day, nearly two-thirds of tests from people who died came back positive for the mu variant, she said. "It is already in more than 43 countries and has shown high contagiousness," she added.

On Tuesday [31 Aug 2021], the World Health Organisation declared mu, scientific name B.1.621, a "variant of interest." It said the variant has mutations that indicate a risk of resistance to vaccines and further studies were needed to better understand it. "The mu variant has a constellation of mutations that indicate potential properties of immune escape," the agency said.

There is widespread concern over the emergence of new variants as infection rates tick up globally, with the highly transmissible delta variant taking hold, especially among the unvaccinated and in regions where anti-virus measures have been relaxed.

All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, mutate over time and most changes have little or no effect on the properties of the virus. But certain mutations can alter how easily a virus spreads, the severity of the disease it causes, or its resistance to vaccines and drugs. The WHO lists 4 coronavirus variants of concern, including alpha, present in 193 countries, and delta, in 170.

Colombia recently has counted around 100 COVID-19 deaths and 2000 infections per day, on average. Fewer than one-third of Colombians have been vaccinated against the virus, which has claimed nearly 125 000 lives in the country to date [3 Sep 2021].

[B] More on the mu variant
Date: Fri 3 Sep 2021 09:21 EDT
Source: The Washington Post [abridged, edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/03/mu-coronavirus-variant-explained/


About 2000 mu cases have been identified in the United States, so far, according to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), the largest database of novel coronavirus genome sequences in the world. Most cases have been recorded in California, Florida, Texas and New York, among others.

However, mu is not an "immediate threat right now" within the United States, top infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci told a press briefing on Thursday [2 Sep 2021]. He said that while the government was "keeping a very close eye on it," the variant was "not at all even close to being dominant," as the delta variant remains the cause of over 99% of cases in the country.

Mu has yet to be designated a variant of interest or concern by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post.

The California Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Post on Thursday [2 Sep 2021] that 348 cases associated with mu had been reported in the state so far and that it would continue "to monitor all variants circulating in the state."

It's unclear how much protection the vaccines offer against this variant. "The mu variant has a constellation of mutations that indicate potential properties of immune escape," the WHO said in a statement Tuesday [31 Aug 2021], raising concerns that it may be more resistant to coronavirus vaccines than other variants. "But this needs to be confirmed by further studies," it added.

Fauci said that while laboratory data had shown that the mu variant can evade certain antibodies -- among them those induced by vaccine shots -- there is currently a lack of clinical data and other research involving people, showing this. He underscored that in general, vaccines remain effective and the best protection against the coronavirus.

Vaccine maker Pfizer told The Post in an email that it was studying the mu variant and expected to share data soon with a peer-reviewed journal. "To date, we are encouraged by both the real-world data and laboratory studies of the vaccine and see no evidence that the virus or circulating variants of concern regularly escape protection," said Pfizer's spokesperson Kit Longley.

Paul Cardenas, a professor of infectious diseases and genomics at Universidad San Francisco de Quito in Ecuador, has studied mu and told The Post that current evidence showed that it was likely "more transmissible" than the original coronavirus strain. Mu has "been able to outcompete gamma and alpha in most parts of Ecuador and Colombia," he said.

However, there was no sign yet that people should be more worried, Cardenas added. "People should know that these variants emerge all the time and it is important that they are characterized in order to be tracked," he said.

Mu is the 5th "variant of interest" being monitored by the WHO. It has not yet been moved up to the WHO's list of "variants of concern," which currently includes the delta variant ravaging the United States, along with the alpha, beta and gamma variants that are deemed more transmissible or virulent by the public health body.

Most viruses change over time, and although some mutations have little to no impact on the virus's properties, others can change how it spreads, its severity and the effectiveness of vaccines or other medicines. For now, the WHO says more studies are needed to understand the characteristics of the mu variant -- and that it will monitor how it may interact, in particular, with the more common delta variant.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/01/who-monitoring-new-coronavirus-variant-named-mu


At least 32 cases of the mu variant have been detected in the UK, where the pattern of infections suggests it was brought in by travellers on multiple occasions. A report by Public Health England (PHE) in July [2021] said most were found in London and in people in their 20s. Some of those testing positive for mu had received one or 2 doses of COVID vaccine.

The mu variant was added to PHE's list of variants under investigation in July [2021]. The designation, which refers to mu as VUI-21JUL-01, means the variant will be monitored to see how it behaves. So far it has not raised alarm as much as alpha and delta, which are classified as more serious variants of concern, largely because of their increased transmissibility but also concerns about evading immune defences.
