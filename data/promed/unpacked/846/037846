A mumps outbreak in Asturias was confirmed yesterday [5 Dec 2012] after the Health Department indicated that 150 cases had been diagnosed in recent weeks. This is the 3rd outbreak occurring in the region in the last decade. Epidemiological Surveillance experts relate it to the ease of transmission of the disease in which 1/3rd of the infections are so mild that there is no warning of an outbreak.

Most of the patients are male, aged between 15 and 34 years. Langreo is the area with the largest number of detected cases, but the outbreak has spread to Gijon, Oviedo, and Aviles. Although much of the population is vaccinated, the Health Ministry stated yesterday [5 Dec 2012] that the virus spreads easily because the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, and occasionally there can be an abrupt increase in the number of cases. One of the outbreaks was centered in the faculty of biology at Oviedo, where several of the students contracted the disease, spreading alarm among their fellow students.

The Directorate General of Public Health recommends that patients do not go to school or work until 4 days after the onset of symptoms. The Director General also advises those under 35 who have not been vaccinated previously to go to their health center to be vaccinated.

Mumps can cause major complications, particularly in men, in whom complications can result in sterility if not properly treated.

[Outbreaks of mumps have been frequent throughout Spain in recent years. The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after a person is infected with mumps virus. The average incubation period is around 17 days. Swelling of the parotid glands is the most common symptom of mumps. Both glands are usually affected by the swelling, although only one gland can be affected. The swelling can cause pain, tenderness, and difficulty with swallowing. Other symptoms of the mumps include: headache, joint pain, sickness, abdominal pain and fever.

Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu: inside infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and passed into the mouth or nose. A person is most contagious 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms and for 5 days afterwards. During this time, it is important to try to prevent spreading the infection to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated. Normally, infection resolves without complications and provides life-long immunity.

For unvaccinated persons born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating these individuals with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measles and mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respectively. For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella.

Two doses of mumps vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at preventing the disease; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective. The 1st vaccine against mumps was licensed in the United States in 1967, and by 2005, high 2-dose childhood vaccination coverage reduced disease rates by 99 percent. Adults at higher risk, such as university students, health care personnel, and international travelers, and persons with potential mumps outbreak exposure should ensure that they have been vaccinated. (Further information can be obtained from the USCDC website (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html#vaccines).

Asturias, officially the Principality of Asturias, is an autonomous community of Spain. It is coextensive with the province of Asturias and contains nearly all of the territory that was part of the former Kingdom of Asturias. The autonomous community of Asturias is bordered by Cantabria to the east, by Castile and Leon to the south, by Galicia to the west, and by the Bay of Biscay to the north.
