Botulism in the Samara region of Russia
---------------------------------------
16 persons have been hospitalized with botulism in Tolyatti, including 5
children. According to information from Vladimir Drobyshev, the main health
officer of the city, 3 patients are on artificial respirators due to
paralysis of the diaphragm. Their condition is stable, however, the physician
noted.
The poisoning took place in a school in the Avtozavodskoy district of the
city. Analysis has shown that people were poisoned by a salad prepared from
home-canned food [tinned cucumbers, according to
<http://www.rian.ru/incidents/20050225/39461567.html>]. According to
Drobyshev, this salad had been eaten by 27 additional persons, who are under
daily supervision of physicians.
