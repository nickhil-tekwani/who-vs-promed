[The location of the outbreak in the Marmara region of Turkey, just south
of the Bulgarian border, can be seen by accessing the full OIE report. This
outbreak is in the same general region as the January [2007] outbreak in
Edirne.
The epidemiology of the outbreak should serve as a reminder that exposure
to wild boar, a mode of introduction that has been frequently associated
with classical swine fever, can also serve to introduce other disease
agents. - Mod.PC]
