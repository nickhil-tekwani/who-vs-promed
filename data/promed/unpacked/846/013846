[re: ProMED-mail Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (04): Kenya (LK) alert, 20191112.6775112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAO's Early Warning Bulletin, "Forecasting threats to the food chain affecting food security in countries and regions" no. 33, October-December 2019, includes the following forecast for Central and Eastern Africa, in relation to Rift Valley fever (http://www.fao.org/3/ca6744en/ca6744en.pdf, pages 7-8):

"During the past 3 months, above-average and heavy rainfall and flash floods occurred in the region particularly during the end of August and early September as well as in early October 2019. The precipitation forecasts predict above-average rains for the coming period (October-December 2019) for Chad, Central African Republic, southern the Sudan and the whole eastern Africa region. According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, there are large areas at risk of RVF vector amplification in central-southern Chad, western-central Kenya, central-southern Sudan, eastern-southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Tanzania. In August 2019, the 1st confirmed case ever of RVF in humans was reported in Bangui, Central African Republic. In early October 2019, media reported suspected cases of RVF in humans and animals in Red Sea state (north-eastern Sudan) and cases of hemorrhagic fever in humans in Kassala (eastern Sudan) and North Darfur states (western Sudan). Considering the past and recent RVF outbreaks occurrence in the region, Chad, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic could be considered at high risk of RVF occurrence. The other countries of the region could be considered at moderate risk of RVF due to the predicted suitability for RVF vector amplification as well as the movement of potentially infected animals."

Rapporteur [JD] comment:
The reports of severe and widespread flooding events in recent weeks are highly reminiscent of those that preceded the widespread outbreak of RVF in eastern Africa during May-August 2018 (see FEWS article, dated 8 Nov 2019, at https://fews.net/east-africa/seasonal-monitor/november-8-2019). Precipitation anomaly mapping from satellite imagery supports media reporting of exceptionally high levels of rainfall during early November and the preceding 90-day period of August-October in the same areas of eastern Africa most affected by a major outbreak of RVF in 2018.

A comparison of 90 day rainfall anomalies from March-May 2018 and August-November 2019 indicates high risk for an even more extensive regional RVF outbreak in East Africa during the next few months, with very large high risk precipitation index areas covering most of Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and parts of Tanzania.

Drought periods in southern Africa are often associated with unusually high levels of rainfall in East Africa -- and vice versa.

[Subscribers are encouraged to access the FEWS article dated 8 Nov 2019, referenced above, with special reference to the 4 pictures included (rainfall maps). From the said East Africa Seasonal Monitor, we hereby copy the segment addressing Kenya:

"In Kenya, flash floods were reported to have adversely affected about 25 counties, especially Marsabit, Wajir, Garissa, Turkana, and Kitui. The recent floods caused human and livestock fatalities and damage to infrastructure. Over 48 people lost their lives and 144 000 are estimated to have been displaced. However, the on-going short-rains performance has been largely beneficial for rangeland and cropping conditions across the most vulnerable pastoral and marginal agropastoral communities. There is an increased likelihood for the above-average crop yield prospects if the rainfall forecast for enhanced rains continue into December. On the other hand, there are concerns for pre-and post-harvest losses in the Western and North-Rift counties of Kenya due to on-going rains in the harvesting and drying period. There is also an elevated risk of further flooding at the peak of the rainfall season in November, which is associated with an increased incidence of malaria, water-borne diseases, and RVF."

The mechanisms that maintain the RVF arbovirus in nature and cause it to emerge in epidemic form are incompletely understood and might differ between areas. Transmission cycles are best understood in savanna regions, where the virus is thought to survive between outbreaks in the dried eggs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes found in shallow depressions in the soil (dambos). Infected mosquitoes are thought to hatch when the dambos fill after heavy rainfall and initiate transmission cycles involving additional mosquito species, and animals that act as amplifying hosts. The vertebrate amplifying hosts are thought to be critical in propagating epidemics. In Kenya's Savanna grasslands, the rainfall of between 500-1250 mm (20-50 inches) is concentrated into March-May (long rains) and September-October (short rains) and there is a long dry season in between; there are multi-annual fluctuations as well. Additional and updated details in ref 1 below.

RVFV introductions into Egypt in 1977 and the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 followed epizootics in Sudan in 1976 and the Horn of Africa in 1998, respectively; the mode(s) of inter-boundary transmission yet to be fully clarified; in Egypt, the main suggested vector was _Culex pipiens_. The potential for the globalization of arboviruses has been demonstrated by various disease agents (such as West Nile, chikungunya, Zika viruses).

Many thanks to Joe for his valuable comment.

This would be a good time to consider livestock vaccination in areas designated as at high risk of RVF. Once an outbreak occurs, it is too late. Intensified surveillance for early detection of RVF cases in livestock and humans in high-risk areas is also advisable, as well as monitoring of populations of mosquito vectors for abundance and virus presence. However, these measures may be difficult logistically in flooded areas. - Mod.TY
