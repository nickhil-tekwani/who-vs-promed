State agriculture officials ordered a quarantine of swine within a 2-mile
radius of the Messner-Widing farm while they monitor the outbreak of
pseudorabies, a highly contagious viral infection thought to have been
eradicated in New Jersey 4 years ago.
More than 320 hogs on the farm were destroyed following the diagnosis last
month, said Ernest Zirkle, an animal health official with the state
Department of Agriculture.
Other pigs on farms in Gloucester and nearby Camden and Burlington counties
will be tested for exposure to the virus, Zirkle said.
Pseudorabies, which is related to herpes, causes serious respiratory
problems and stillbirths in hogs. It is not harmful to humans.
Because the virus poses a serious threat to the nation's pork producers,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture 10 years ago launched a pseudorabies
eradication program, which includes vaccinations.
Zirkle said the source of the latest New Jersey outbreak appears to be a
livestock dealer in Pennsylvania. The Messner-Widing farm purchased the
hogs in Lancaster County.
New Jersey farms had been disease-free for 4 years. More than 6,800 hogs
are infected and under quarantine in Pennsylvania, USDA records show.
The sick New Jersey hogs were incinerated Aug. 24 at a facility in Indiana,
Zirkle said.

[Pseudorabies virus is a DNA heres virus Although the pig is the only
natural host, the virus can infect cattle, sheep, cats, dogs, and goats as
well as such feral animals as raccoons, opossums, skunks and rodents.
Experimental studies in non-human primates indicate rhesus monkeys and
marmosets are susceptible but chimpanzees are not. Reports of human
infection are limited and are based on seroconversion rather than virus
isolation. Infection in horses are rare.
Transmission of the virus can occur via nose-to-nose or fecal-oral contact.
Indirect transmission commonly occurs via inhalation of aerosolized virus.
Infectious virus can persist for up to 7 hours in air with a relative
humidity of greater than or equal to 55 percent. Data from England indicate
that virus may travel via aerosols for up to 2km in certain weather
conditions. Other studies have demonstrated the virus can survive for 2
days in anaerobic lagoon effluent and in green grass, soil, feces and
shelled corn, 3 days in nasal washings on plastic and pelleted hog feed and
4 days in straw bedding.
Generally, the signs are those of central nervous system (CNS) disease and
include such things as tremors and paddling. Respiratory disease may be a
problem in weaned pigs. Pigs of all ages have a generalized febrile
response, anorexia and weight loss.
Although there is no specific treatment for acute infection with
pseudorabies virus, vaccination can alleviate clinical signs in pigs of
certain ages. Mass vaccination all pigs on the farm with a modified live
virus vaccine is usually recommended.
Pseudorabies is a reportable disease. Is Lancaster County Pennsylvania one
of the counties in Pennsylvania that is quarantined? If so, how did the pig
get sold to New Jersey? - Mod.TG
