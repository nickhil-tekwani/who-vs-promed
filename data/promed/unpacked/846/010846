[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 858 705 with 81 554 (9.5%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 777 151 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 206 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 72 983 cases when compared with the data on 30 Mar 2020, with the USA accounting for 24 282 (33.3%), Italy for 4053 (5.6%), Spain for 7967 (10.9%), and Germany for 4923 (6.7%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 90.5% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 22.0% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA and Italy have overtaken China in total numbers of cases. A global total of 42 151 deaths have been reported, 38 846 (92.2%) outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world, and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily, new case counts hovering around 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and Italy is number 2. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Spain and Turkey have been accelerating. To get an understanding of how rapidly things increase, look at Turkey. The 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 20 days the country has confirmed 13 531 cases and it now ranks number 10 out of 206 countries/territories in terms of absolute numbers of confirmed cases, having ranked number 12 just 24 hours ago. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Guam: US Naval Ship outbreak
Date: Tue 31 Mar 2020 4:36 PM PDT
Source: San Francisco Chronicle [abridged, edited]
https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Exclusive-Captain-of-aircraft-carrier-with-15167883.php


The captain of a nuclear aircraft carrier with more than 100 sailors infected with the coronavirus pleaded Monday [30 Mar 2020] with US Navy officials for resources to allow isolation of his entire crew and avoid possible deaths in a situation he described as quickly deteriorating.

The unusual plea from Captain Brett Crozier, a Santa Rosa native, came in a letter obtained exclusively by The Chronicle and confirmed by a senior officer on board the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, which has been docked in Guam following a COVID-19 outbreak among the crew of more than 4000 less than a week ago.

"This will require a political solution but it is the right thing to do," Crozier wrote. "We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset -- our sailors." In the 4-page letter to senior military officials, Crozier said only a small contingent of infected sailors have been off-boarded. Most of the crew remain aboard the ship, where following official guidelines for 14-day quarantines and social distancing is impossible. "Due to a warship's inherent limitations of space, we are not doing this," Crozier wrote. "The spread of the disease is ongoing and accelerating." He asked for "compliant quarantine rooms" on shore in Guam for his entire crew "as soon as possible."

"Removing the majority of personnel from a deployed US nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for 2 weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure. ... This is a necessary risk," Crozier wrote. "Keeping over 4000 young men and women on board the TR is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those Sailors entrusted to our care."

Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly spoke to CNN. "I heard about the letter from Capt Crozier (Tuesday) morning [31 Mar 2020], I know that our command organization has been aware of this for about 24 hours and we have been working actually the last 7 days to move those sailors off the ship and get them into accommodations in Guam. The problem is that Guam doesn't have enough beds right now and we're having to talk to the government there to see if we can get some hotel space, create tent-type facilities," Modly said.

"We don't disagree with the (captain) on that ship and we're doing it in a very methodical way because it's not the same as a cruise ship, that ship has armaments on it, it has aircraft on it, we have to be able to fight fires if there are fires on board the ship, we have to run a nuclear power plant, so there's a lot of things that we have to do on that ship that make it a little bit different and unique but we're managing it and we're working through it," he said.

So far, none of the infected sailors has shown serious symptoms, but the number of those who have tested positive has jumped exponentially since the Navy reported infections in 3 crew members on [24 Mar 2020], the 1st time COVID-19 infections had been detected on a naval vessel at sea.

Retired Admiral James Stavridis, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told The Chronicle Tuesday [31 Mar 2020] in an email that "we should expect more such incidents because warships are a perfect breeding ground for coronavirus." "Unfortunately, naval vessels are ideal breeding grounds for the spread of viruses because it is impossible to do social distancing on one" because of the tight quarters on board, Stavridis said. The ship's problems will "compound", Stavridis said, because you can't tie the vessel up "and send everyone ashore. It is full of weapons, billions of dollars of equipment, fire hazards, and nuclear reactors".

Scrubbing the Theodore Roosevelt of the virus will not be complicated, but "time-consuming", he said. He estimated cleaning would take 5 to 10 days with a crew of 350 people. Senior military officials said last week that the entire crew of more than 4000 will be tested. The carrier's home port is San Diego.

At the time, Modly expressed confidence that they identified all the sailors who had been in contact with the trio of infected sailors and they had been quarantined. "This is an example of how we are able to keep our ships deployed at seas and underway, even with active COVID-19 cases," Modly said. But by the time the ship reached port in Guam on Friday [27 Mar 2020], the number of cases had grown to 25, and soon after to 36, according to reports.

But by Monday [30 Mar 2020], a senior officer on board the massive aircraft carrier, who wished to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak to the media, said between 150 and 200 sailors had tested positive. None had been hospitalized -- yet, the source said. The Chronicle agreed to withhold the officer's name based on its anonymous sources policy.

Gilday told reporters last week [week of 23 Mar 2020] it was unclear if sailors became infected following the ship's previous port of call in early March [2020] to Da Nang, Vietnam. Gilday said they debated whether to go on with the Viet Nam visit, but at the time there were only 16 coronavirus cases in northern Viet Nam and the port was in the central part of the country. Sailors were screened prior to returning on board. The 1st 3 sailors tested positive 15 days after leaving Vietnam, officials said.

The virus has been hard to contain on board ever since. Federal and military guidelines recommend individual quarantine, including no use of common areas. "Due to the close quarters required on a warship and the current number of positive cases, every single sailor, regardless of rank, on board the TR [Theodore Roosevelt] must be considered 'close contact,'" Crozier wrote. The tight quarters on the carrier are "most conducive to spread", he wrote, including large amounts of sailors in a confined space, shared sleeping quarters, restrooms, workspaces and computers, a common mess hall, meals cooked by exposed personnel, and movement constraints requiring communal contact with ladders and hatches.

The captain compared the situation to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, citing a study that focused on what could have happened to that cruise ship had no isolation been done. A total of 712 passengers eventually tested positive for COVID-19 from that cruise departing from Japan; however, the study found if there had been no early isolation close to 80% of passengers and crew would have been infected. And had the cruise line immediately evacuated the ship after the 1st positive tests, the study found only 76 people would have tested positive.

Of the 1st 33 Roosevelt sailors testing positive, 7, or 21%, originally tested negative. After testing negative, those 7 sailors presented symptoms within 1 to 3 days after their initial negative test, Crozier said. The testing should be utilized, the captain wrote, after a proper 14-day quarantine to ensure no infected sailors return on board a clean ship. As part of his plan, 10% of the crew would stay on board to run the reactor plant, sanitize the ship, ensure security and provide contingency response for emergencies.

[It does seem as though ships in general are ideal incubators for this virus (the SARS-CoV-2). Cruise ships with cabins for 2-4 passengers have proven to be excellent captive audiences for the virus to spread (see prior post: COVID-19 update (60): global, cruise ships, lessons learned, WHO 20200329.7156949 for a recent summary of cruise ship related outbreaks as well as a series of posts from mid-February 2020 through the present 20200215.6993525, 20200220.7009533, 20200223.7017958, 20200305.7051670, 20200306.7056224, 20200307.7060338, 20200308.7062997, 20200309.7066281, 20200320.7116046, 20200321.7121173, 20200324.7133464, 20200326.7143838, and 20200328.7153651). In addition to having people in close quarters even in "luxury liners" where maintaining a minimum of 6 feet (2 m) separation is virtually impossible, meals are often buffet style, with serving instruments shared by all. Imagine naval ships with more dormitory style quarters, perfect locations for rapid viral transmission. One can't help but wonder how many other naval vessels from multiple countries around the world are also experiencing similar outbreaks on their ships. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- No new countries/territories/areas reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- As mentioned by the director-general in his regular media briefing yesterday [30 Mar 2020], ensuring free movement of essential health products is vital for saving lives and curbing the social and economic impacts of the pandemic. WHO is working intensively with partners to increase access to life-saving products, including diagnostics, PPE [personal protective equipment], medical oxygen, ventilators, and more. More information is available at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---30-march-2020

- Operations support and logistics [OSL] continues to monitor critical markets and in partnership with the Pandemic Supply Chain Network, has increased engagement and coordination with private companies. For more details, please see the section 'subject in focus' below.

Subject in focus: WHO strengthens supply chains and releases guidance on setting up treatment centres
---------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO OSL continues to support the COVID-19 emergency operations despite continued disruption to critical supply markets where demand outpaces global supply.

Since the beginning of the outbreak, OSL has shipped more than 800 000 surgical masks, 54 000 N95 masks, 873 000 globes, 15 000 goggles, and 24 000 face shields to 75 countries. OSL has also shipped COVID-19 testing kits to 126 countries.

A Supply Chain Inter-Agency Coordination Cell (SCICC) has been established to provide an overview of supply chain requirements and ensure that COVID-19 needs are prioritized within the wider humanitarian response. The SCICC has established a Supply and Market Working Group to streamline procurement of critical supplies and equipment to address global shortages.

A common platform for private-sector donations of critical items in support of the COVID-19 response will be announced shortly. The list of critical items is available online (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/covid-19-critical-items)

OSL continues to monitor critical markets and has increased engagement and coordination with private companies, in partnership with the Pandemic Supply Chain Network.

OSL has released the 1st edition of a practical manual to set up and manage a Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) treatment centre and a SARI screening facility in health-care facilities. The manual is available online (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/severe-acute-respiratory-infections-treatment-centre) and accompanying training modules are available to the public through Open WHO (https://openwho.org/courses/SARI-facilities).

- Module 1: overview of basic operational and IPC [infection prevention and control] principles in COVID-19 context
- Module 2: designing a SARI [severe acute respiratory infections] screening area and treatment centre
- Module 3: repurposing an existing building into a SARI treatment centre

An additional module for WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene), waste management, energy requirements, and installations for SARI facilities is currently under development.

OSL is also working to build tactical infection prevention and control (IPC) surge support to hospitals with an aim to help improve infectious disease management protocols, limit nosocomial transmission, and support rational consumption of personal protective equipment.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 201. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 51 countries (including 16 territories) from the Americas region, and 41 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 20 764 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 86.6% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada (3.2%) and Chile (2.6%). The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 31 131 (54.1%) new cases and 2733 (82.9%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy accounting for 13.0% of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 20.6% of newly confirmed cases, Germany for 14.8% of newly confirmed cases, and France for 13.9% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 62.3% of newly confirmed cases in Europe, up from 59.9% yesterday (30 Mar 2020). In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 3186 new cases representing 79.3% of the regional newly reported cases. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq represent 6.0%, 3.8%, and 2.1% respectively. In the African region, Algeria reported 19.0% of the newly reported cases in the past 24 hours and South Africa and Nigeria reported 15.3% each of the newly reported cases in the region. In the Western Pacific region, Australia reported 39.5% of the newly confirmed cases followed by Malaysia at 15.7%; the Philippines reported 12.9% of the total (excluding China), followed by Japan with 8.7%. In South East Asia, only Indonesia and Myanmar reported newly confirmed cases.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [31 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve shows a lowering in the past 48 hours probably related to inconsistent reporting over the weekend.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
