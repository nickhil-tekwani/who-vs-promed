Rift Valley Fever Update - Saudi Arabia and Yemen
-------------------------------------------------
DUBAI: Saudi Arabia has said that the death toll from Rift Valley fever had
claimed 4 more lives, raising to at least 105 the official toll from the
disease in the Kingdom and in neighboring Yemen. The Health Ministry said in
a statement carried by the official Saudi press agency on Wednesday that a
total of 68 people among 353 people in Saudi Arabia who had contracted the
viral disease since it broke out in the southern province of Jizan last
month had died. It said 123 had recovered after treatment.
Yemen has said at least 37 have died from the disease there. The official
death tolls by Yemen and Saudi Arabia were far lower than unofficial counts
from medical sources and newspapers, who have said 200 people have died
after suffering symptoms including diarrhoea, ruptured arteries [blood
vessels and renal failure. The disease, which is transmitted from infected
livestock to humans through contact or by mosquitoes, broke out on both
sides of the Saudi-Yemeni border last month.
