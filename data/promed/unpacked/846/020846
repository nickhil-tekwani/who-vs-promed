As a pediatrician in private practice I have noticed an increased
incidence of erythema infectiosum [caused by parvovirus 19] in Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil, in the last 2-3 months. I have confirmed this
with other practitioners. It is often mistaken for German measles
[rubella] and even scarlet fever. My main concern is that pregnant
women and their obstetricians may be unaware of the potential
fetal risks. Because it is not a reportable disease, public
authorities with whom I have been in contact have no information
on a possible outbreak.
Molluscum contagiosum is also being diagnosed with increased
frequency this year.
Is this happening elsewhere?

[How many cases? Geographic and age distributions? - Mod.CHC]
[Erythema infectiosum is also known as Fifth disease. It is a mild,
epidemic, usually non-febrile disease producing a red rash,
especially in children. The rash is marked on the cheeks, as if they had
been slapped; it is lace-like on the trunk & extremities & may fade &
reappear for up to 3 weeks, or longer if exposed to sun or heat.
In adults there may be no rash at all, but joint pain & arthritis lasting
for months. It is easily confused with rubella & scarlet fever.
Transmission is by contact with infected respiratory secretions, &
also from mother to fetus, with a less than 10% risk of fetal death if
infected in the first half of pregnancy.
Molluscum contagiosum is caused by Molluscipoxviruses, and
presents as persistent papules or rash in the more embarrassing
parts of the body, that may itch. It is spread by contact.
