Infectious salmon anemia, Norway
--------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 31 Oct 2013 from Dre Kristina Landsverk, Chief Veterinary Officer, Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Brumunddal, Norway

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 28 Oct 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 30 Oct 2013
Report date: 31 Oct 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 31 Oct 2013
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Infectious salmon anemia virus
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, Laboratory (advanced), Necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: 11728, Gulen, Sogn og Fjordane
Date of start of the outbreak: 28 Oct 2013
Outbreak status: Resolved (31 Oct 2013)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Water type: Salt water
Population type: Farmed
Production system: Semi-open
Affected animals: Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_)

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 145 453 / 15 000 / 1000 / 144 453 / 0
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 10.31 percent / 0.69 percent / 6.67 percent / 100.00 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: From an epidemiological point of view, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) at present considers the ISA outbreak in Gulen likely to be a 1st occurrence in this geographical region. This ISA event seems to be a separate one without any epidemiological correlation to previous occurrences of the disease earlier this year [2013].

Control measures
Measures applied: Stamping out; Movement control inside the country; Emergency harvest; Official destruction of clinically diseased aquatic animals; Official destruction of aquatic animal products; Surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone; No vaccination; No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Zoning; Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); Tracing forward; Tracing back; Surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory) / Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / immunohistochemical test / 30 Oct 2013 / Positive
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory) / Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / histopathological examination / 31 Oct 2013 / Positive
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory) / Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / real-time PCR / 31 Oct 2013 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is one of the most important viral diseases of farmed Atlantic salmon. This highly contagious disease can be insidious, with an initially low mortality rate; however, the cumulative mortality can sometimes exceed 90 percent if the disease remains unchecked. Infectious salmon anemia was 1st described in Norway in 1984, and it continues to be a problem in that country despite control measures. Since the late 1990s, outbreaks have also been reported in other locations. This disease devastated the salmon industry of the Faroe Islands in 2000, and an epizootic in Scotland in 1998-1999 cost an estimated USD 32 million to eradicate. ISA has been a recurring problem in Chile, the Cobscook Bay in Maine (USA), and the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick, Canada.

Understanding of the epidemiology of ISA is still incomplete, which complicates its control. The reservoirs for the virus are not known, but experiments have shown that several species of salmonids can carry virulent ISA viruses asymptomatically. These viruses might cause outbreaks if they are transmitted to farmed Atlantic salmon. Noncultivable, apparently nonpathogenic, isolates have also been detected in wild salmonids (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/infectious_salmon_anemia.pdf).

There is no indication that ISA viruses can affect humans. Because this virus is inactivated at body temperatures of 37-40 C (98.6-104 F), it is unlikely to infect any mammal or bird (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/infectious_salmon_anemia.pdf).

OIE's internationally agreed-upon requirements pertaining to infection with infectious salmon anaemia virus are spelled out in chapter 10.5 of OIE's Aquatic Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.5.htm.

During 2013, Norway submitted 7 immediate infectious salmon anemia (ISA) notification reports to the OIE. To date (1 Nov 2013), a total of 8 outbreaks of ISA have been reported (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Countryreports.
