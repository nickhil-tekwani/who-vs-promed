Ohio: West Nile Virus-positive Mosquito Pool Found near Blue Ash Airport
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A pool of mosquitoes found near Blue Ash Airport has tested positive for
West Nile virus. Tim Ingram, Hamilton County health commissioner, said it
was the first pool of mosquitoes that had tested positive for the virus in
Hamilton County. Earlier this month, state health officials said that West
Nile virus had been confirmed in 25 other counties in Ohio. A mosquito
carrying West Nile virus was caught in a trap on 19 Jun 2002 at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton.
In recent weeks, birds found in Delhi Township and Silverton/Madeira area
of Hamilton County, and in Wayne Township in Clermont County, and 2 dead
birds found in Warren County, 2 in Metcalfe County, and one in Butler
County, all have tested positive for West Nile virus.

West Nile Virus Moves West; Now in Manitoba, N. Dakota & Texas
--------------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has passed the 97th meridian on its trek west, now detected
as far west as Dallas Co., Texas; Grand Forks Co, North Dakota; and
Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Winnipeg lies about 150 miles north of Grand
Forks on the Red River of the North.
In 2002 West Nile virus has been detected in at least 23 states and
Washington DC in the US, as well as in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec
provinces of Canada. Reports from North Dakota, Manitoba and Quebec are the
first ever for West Nile virus. In addition West Nile virus has recently
been reported for the first time this year in Arkansas and Wisconsin.
The following are recent reports since Fri 12 Jul 2002 (in alphabetical
order by state/province. [see ERAP website for additional and historical
information: <http://www.cfe.cornell.edu/erap/WNV/>].
ALABAMA -- So far 2 birds tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV) from
Baldwin Co (SW AL, on Gulf Coast and Florida border) and 7 counties have
detected WNV in 2002.
ARKANSAS -- The first positive WNV result for 2002 was announced 12 Jul
2002 from St. Francis County (E. Arkansas) in a bird found 22 Jun 2002. In
2001, 4 birds tested positive from El Dorado (Union Co; S. AR, on Louisiana
border), Benton County (NW AR, on Oklahoma and Missouri borders), and Fort
Smith (Sebastian Co; W. AR, on Oklahoma border).
ILLINOIS -- 5 more counties detect WNV and 2 more mosquito pools found in
Cook Co (Chicago Metro Area). The 5 new counties are: Boone Co (N. IL, on
Wisconsin border), DeKalb Co (N. IL), Franklin Co (S. IL), Mercer Co (W.
IL, on Iowa border), Sangamon Co (Central IL, location of Springfield), and
Will Co (NE IL, on Indiana border). WNV has thus far been detected in 17
counties in Illinois. Health Dept says that WNV is likely present in all
counties in Illinois.
INDIANA -- WNV was detected in Bartholomew Co (S. Central IN) for the first
time. This is the sixth county to detect WNV in 2002.
KENTUCKY -- 3 more counties detect WNV: Jefferson Co (N. KY, location of
Louisville, on Indiana border), Laurel Co (SE KY), and Woodford Co (Central
KY). 6 counties have now detected WNV in 2002.
MARYLAND -- A correction from the USGS NBII website: "On 3 Jul 2002,
National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) mistakenly reported
confirmed presence of West Nile virus in a Maryland horse. No horses in
Maryland have tested positive for the Virus in 2002. NBII regrets this
error." The statement had been based on a preliminary test, results of
which are not yet posted on the Maryland WNV website.
MASSACHUSETTS -- 3 more cities/towns detect WNV, for a total of 5 cities in
3 counties. New detections are in Boston (Suffolk Co, E. MA), Cambridge
(Middlesex Co, NE MA), and Marblehead (Essex Co, NE MA, on Massachusetts Bay).
MICHIGAN -- Macomb County (SE in Detroit Metro Area) became the sixth
county to detect WNV in 2002.
MONTREAL, QUEBEC, CANADA -- 12 Jul 2002, preliminary WNV-positive results
on 2 crows were announced from Beaconsfield, a suburb of Montreal (S.
Quebec). This is the first time that WNV has been detected in Canada east
of Ontario, and in Quebec.
NORTH DAKOTA -- WNV was detected for the first time ever in North Dakota in
a young gelding from Grand Forks County (E. ND, on Minnesota border). The
horse began showing signs of West Nile 30 Jun 2002 and was euthanized 2 Jul
2002. Confirmation of the positive preliminary result is expected this week.
OHIO -- 8 more counties detect WNV (Erie, Licking, Medina, Morgan,
Paulding, Scioto, Williams, and Wyandot counties) and 2 more counties
report WNV-positive mosquito pools (Montgomery and Hamilton). The Ohio
health department believes WNV is most likely present in all 88 counties,
although it is only confirmed in 41 counties.
WINNIPEG, MANITOBA, CANADA -- A preliminary WNV-positive crow was found 7
Jul 2002 for the first time ever in Winnipeg, Manitoba (S. Manitoba). This
is the first time that WNV has been detected in Canada west of Ontario.
WISCONSIN -- The first detection of WNV in 2002 was in a dead crow
announced 11 Jul 2002 from Milwaukee (Milwaukee Co, SE WI), found on 25 Jun
2002.
