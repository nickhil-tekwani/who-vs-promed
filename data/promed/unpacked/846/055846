A rare (and deadly) form of leptospirosis has infected 2 Oahu [Hawaii] men this year [2019]. Local doctors are alarmed after 2 men were diagnosed with a deadly form of leptospirosis known as Weil's disease. The bacteria attack the organs causing them to rapidly shut down.

Looking at [the patient on Wed 13 Feb 2019] you'd never know the rare disease nearly claimed his life a few weeks ago. The 44-year-old was hospitalized in January [2019] with kidney and liver failure after doing something he's done all his life: walk by the river in his slippers. "Yea, I had mud, but after you walk through the water -- the thing wash 'em off. Yea," said [the patient]. He says symptoms started about a week later. "I wake up in the morning for go do my birds. And I felt my body kind of sore. But I didn't think nothing," said [the patient]. " Not knowing that was the start."

Doctor Scott Miscovich says the disease is almost unheard of. In his 30 year career he's only ever treated one case -- that is until last month [January 2019]. "To have 2 cases in a matter of 3 weeks walk into my office for something this rare was really exceptional," said Dr Miscovich. He says in its early stages symptoms of the disease can often mimic the flu, "You can get an upset stomach, you can throw up, you can get diarrhea, you can have muscle aches. 90 percent of the people will develop a fever."

Dr Miscovich's other patient is a taro farmer in Kahaluu who had to be hospitalized for a month. "He had a prolonged course in the intensive care unit that included a full cardiac arrest. His heart had to be restarted and resuscitated," said Dr Miscovich. In both cases doctors determined that the bacteria entered the patient's body through a small cut on the foot. "Anybody that has exposure to mud and standing water or potentially has ingested water from our fresh water streams, they need to be aware of this," said Dr Miscovich.

For [the 1st patient], his near death experience has prompted him to trade in his slippers for boots when he's in the mud. And he shares these words of advice to people who think, "that'll never happen to me. No think you untouchable," said [this patient] as he laughed. "When you least expect it -- it can bite you in the ass."

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic, spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to wet soil or fresh (not salty) water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with one of the several hundred pathogenic serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or wet soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Although vaccines are available for immunizing other animals against leptospirosis, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans.

Leptospirosis initially presents as a non-specific illness with chills, fever, headache, myalgias, and conjunctival suffusion. Patients often have a dry cough, which is usually mild and without any sequelae, that accompanies the other symptoms. Severe leptospirosis, known as Weil's disease, is characterized by liver damage (causing jaundice), renal failure, and bleeding. Meningoencephalitis and myocarditis may also be present. However, pulmonary involvement, which manifests itself as pulmonary hemorrhage, can be severe, with massive hemoptysis, respiratory insufficiency and death (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3519021/).

Leptospirosis-associated severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome has been increasingly reported worldwide and is associated with case fatality rates greater than 50 percent (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16148523 and https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/14/3/07-1064_article)

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The leptospira Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available.

Oahu, with a population of about 1 million residents, is the 3rd-largest of the Hawaiian Islands and is home to the state capital, Honolulu, on Oahu's southeast coast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahu). Kahaluu, with a population of 4738 people, is a residential community in Honolulu (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahaluu,_Hawaii).
