A recent outbreak of illness caused by dangerous listeria bacteria
originated in a Czech dairy plant that has stopped production, Prague
Radio reported.
Michael Vit, the Czech Republic's chief public health officer, said
Thu 1 Feb 2007 that the food contaminated with listeria was traced to
only one plant, whose name and location he did not disclose.
In 2006, 80 people were diagnosed with listeriosis, and 13 died, the
radio said, 5 times more infected people than in 2005. Listeria
bacteria may be found in un-pasteurized milk, soft cheeses, and raw
and processed meats.

Recently, the papers here have been full of alarming reports
concerning listeria infection in the Czech Republic. So far in 2007,
there have been a number of highly publicized cases of poisoning with
listeria bacteria, which are often found in certain types of ready
made salads and ripe cheeses.
Usually, there are only one or 2 deaths every year from listeria
poisoning in the Czech Republic. In 2006, however, 10 people have
died from being infected with the bacteria. A significant number of
pregnant women have also had miscarriages as a result of being
infected, and, in the last week alone, 3 women have lost their babies
because of listeria.
There was a recent news report on how a woman suffering from
listeriosis lost her baby after she became infected with the listeria
bacteria. It's ordinarily a rare occurrence in this country, but in
2006 the number of serious incidences of listeria infection has risen
significantly, and the mortality rate has increased almost 10-fold.
Dr. Michael Vit, the Chief Public Health Officer for the Czech
Republic, says that there are a number of reasons for the rise in
serious cases of listerioisis:
"One of the reasons could be that there has been some slackness when
it comes to proper procedures in the factories where they produce
soft and mature cheeses as well as various delicatessen salads.
Another reason could be the warm weather we have had over the past 3
months. It may also be that some of the groups at risk of listeria
poisoning have forgotten that it is not ideal for them to eat these
kinds of foods."
Besides pregnant women, the groups at risk whom Dr. Vit mentions
include people whose immunity systems may be deficient, such as old
people, young children and people with diseases such as cancer and
severe diabetes.
Despite the high levels of press coverage for recent cases of
listeria poisoning, Dr. Vit says that no comparative data is
available for 2006; the incidence of listeria in the Czech Republic
is generally comparable to many other European countries, and there
is no need for the public to be alarmed.
"We are not an exception in the Czech Republic. Our rates of
infection according to most recent figures puts us around the same
level as Holland, Germany and France. Every food producer has to
follow a series of strict controls. If these are observed, then it
means the level of contamination should be limited."

recently in the Czech Republic. The risk factors related to the other
