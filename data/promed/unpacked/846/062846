I would be interested to know if the information in the article from the
(Penn) Valley Independent 22 Apr 2000 [edited concerning rabies is
accurate in it's description of a dog being put in quarantine for 3 months.
If the dog had a previous rabies vaccine, a booster and a 6-week home
quarantine is all that is necessary. There are no reports of a vaccinated
animal developing rabies or the ability to transmit rabies after contact
with a rabid animal.
Also, saliva or other body fluid contact of a rabid animal is not
transmissible through intact skin, so casual contact is not a real concern.
My comments are based on research and personal experience.

[From a previous post: The Allegheny County Health Department is warning
residents to avoid contact with raccoons, other wildlife and stray dogs and
cats because of a growing rabies outbreak. Two rabid animals found this
week bring the total in the county so far this year to 8, compared to just
1 reported by this time in 1999.
I thought some more background information would be useful. Here are the
numbers and types of rabid animals reported in Allegheny County (which is
in the southwestern part of the Commonwealth, where Pittsburgh is located),
by year:
Raccoon Bat Skunk Cat Dog Total
2000 7 0 0 1 0 8
1999 11 2 0 1 0 14
1998 8 2 0 1 0 11
1997 9 2 0 3 0 12
1996 25 1 0 0 1 26
1995 17 3 2 0 0 22
1994 11 1 0 1 0 13
As you can see, the occurrence of animal rabies (including rabid cats) in
Allegheny County is nothing new.

[The statistics are appreciated. It would seem from these statistics the
Allegheny County has a good rabies vaccination program in domestic animals.
This is purely speculation on my part. - Mod.TG
