Minamata victims found in Amazon
Asahi Shimbun, January 26, 1999
Three people living along the Amazon River in Brazil have been found to be
suffering from symptoms of Minamata disease, the first time such patients
have found outside of Japan, according to a team of Japanese researchers.
The researchers, who visited Brazil to check up on reports of mercury
poisoning along the vast waterway, said they expect to find more victims.
The survey was conducted by Junko Nakanishi, a professor specializing in
the environment at Yokohama National University, and Masazumi Harada,
assistant professor of psychiatry and psychopathy at Kumamoto University.
Mercury is used along the Amazon River as part of the process to refine
gold from deposits collected in the area. Minamata-like symptoms resulted
from microorganisms living in the river that change the inorganic mercury
discharged from refineries into organic mercury, the researchers said.
Patients apparently consumed organic mercury from fish caught in the river,
the researchers said.
Researchers had previously symptoms of inorganic mercury poisoning among
gold refinery workers. However, the three patients poisoned by organic
mercury live in a fishing village far from refinery facilities. In
cooperation with a Brazilian university, Nakanishi surveyed 800 local
residents in 10 villages from 1992 through 1998. Nakanishi found organic
mercury accounted for 96 percent of mercury contained in hair samples of
residents who consumed a lot of fish caught in the Amazon.
Harada, an expert in Minamata disease, examined 50 residents in November
who had high levels of organic mercury poisoning. Harada found that three
of them had symptoms peculiar to Minamata disease, such fits of trembling
and other sensory disorders. The team detected 50 ppm to 70 ppm of mercury
in one of the patients, a man in his mid-50s. The World Health
Organization's provisional safety standard is 50 ppm. The other two
patients had mercury levels of between 20 ppm and 30 ppm, the researchers
said.
Harada said the three cases constitute the first Minamata cases outside of
Japan. He said the cases originated from organic mercury poisoning in the
food chain. He said that shows that people can develop Minamata disease
after being exposed to low-level pollution over a long period.
