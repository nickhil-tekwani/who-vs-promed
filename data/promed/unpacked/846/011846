Hundreds of young Chinese swimmers using the same pool have been taken to
hospital suffering from high fever, prompting a call for improved
sanitation standards nationwide, state media said.
More than 400 children had fallen ill since late July 2005 using the public
pool in Hohhot, capital of the northern region of Inner Mongolia.
Hygiene has become a popular issue ahead of the Beijing Olympic Games in
2008, with campaigns to clean up notoriously dirty public toilets and to
halt spitting in the street. It has also gained urgency amid a current
outbreak of a pig-borne disease that has killed 39 people in southwest China.
The pool in Hohhot has since been closed, but 73 of the victims were still
in hospital, some suffering skin rashes as well as fever. "The Hohhot
Health Supervision Office tested water sample from the pool and found ...
the total number of bacteria exorbitantly higher than normal levels," the
official Xinhua news agency said in an overnight report.
The Ministry of Health had issued an urgent notice to health authorities
across the country, asking them to strengthen supervision and inspection of
swimming pools, Xinhua said. Parts of China have suffered a prolonged heat
wave in recent weeks, with temperatures in the north reaching as high as 39
degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) in June and July.

[Swimming pools are frequently associated with outbreaks of
gastrointestinal and febrile illnesses associated variously with pathogenic
bacteria, parasitic protozoa, and enteric viruses. In the present instance
the agent responsible for the outbreak has not been identified. The high
bacterial count may be indicative of a lapse in water treatment procedures
rather than an identification of the causative organism.
A reliable source has informed us that parainfluenza virus infection is
suspected on the basis of 2 positive parainfluenza virus type 2 IgM tests.
Additional tests are under way on children who did not attend the swimming
pool to establish the validity of this observation. If the causative agent
is a parainfluenza virus -- usually transmitted by a respiratory route --
it is likely that the infection was contracted in the changing facilities
rather than in the pool. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
