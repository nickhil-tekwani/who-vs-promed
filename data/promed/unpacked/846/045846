A civilian researcher working for the Army on a vaccine against a rare
bacterial disease contracted the illness after accidentally being exposed
to bacteria. The civilian microbiologist, identified only as a man in his
mid-30s, was recently diagnosed with glanders, a bacterial infection
typically found in horses and donkeys, said Col. Gerald W. Parker,
commander of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of
Infectious diseases (USAMRIID), where the exposure occurred. USAMRIID is
located in Fort Detrick, Maryland.
While the disease is almost always fatal if left untreated, the
microbiologist was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and was
expected to make a full recovery.
The researcher was working on a vaccine for glanders. He first became ill
in March, complaining of fever, malaise and weight loss. He was admitted to
nearby Frederick Memorial Hospital 2 May 2000 and transferred to Johns
Hopkins 4 May 2000.
The disease in humans is virtually unknown in the U.S., but appears
periodically in South America, Africa and Asia. It was allegedly used by
the Japanese during World War II to infect horses, civilians and prisoners
of war.

[Glanders, caused by _Burkholderia (formerly _Pseudomonas_) mallei_, has
not caused a naturally acquired human infection in the U.S. since 1938.
This is serious disease in humans.
Glanders is a contagious, acute or chronic, usually fatal disease of
Equidae (horses, donkeys) characterized by serial development of ulcerating
nodules occurring most commonly in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and
skin. Man, Felidae, and other species are susceptible, and infections
usually are fatal. Glanders is one of the oldest diseases known and once
was prevalent worldwide. It has not been eradicated or effectively
controlled in many countries, including the USA. In recent years, the
disease has been reported in Iraq, Turkey, India, Mongolia and China.
Nasal, pulmonary, and cutaneous forms of glanders are recognized in animals
and an animal may be affected by more than one form at a time.
In the cutaneous form (farcy), nodules appear along the course of the lymph
vessels, particularly of the extremities. These nodules degenerate and form
ulcers discharging a highly infectious, sticky, pus. The liver and spleen
also may show typical nodular lesions.
In the pulmonary form, small tubercle-like nodules, which have caseous or
calcified centers surrounded by inflammatory zones, are found in the lungs.
Nodules develop in the mucosa of the nasal septum and lower parts of the
nasal turbinates in the nasal form. The nodules degenerate into deep ulcers
with raised irregular boarders.
There is no vaccine. Prevention and control depend on early detection and
elimination of affected animals, as well as complete quarantine and
rigorous disinfection of the area involved.
Treatment is given only in endemic areas. Antibiotics are not very
effective. - Mod. TG]
