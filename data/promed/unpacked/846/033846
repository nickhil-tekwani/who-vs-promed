A comment on "Hemorrhagic Fever" in Bashkiriya
-----------------------------------------------
[Professor Henttonen has sent the following comment in response to
the ProMED-mail post " Hemorrhagic fever - Russia (Bashkiriya): RFI,
which contained our request for clarification of the identify of the
"dangerous" virus. ProMED-mail appreciates Prof. Henttonen's prompt
response. Confirmation, from a local source, that _Puumala virus_ is
the etiologic agent in this outbreak would be appreciated also -
Mod.CP]
Bashkortostan (earlier Bashkiriya), its capital Ufa, and the
surrounding area is well-known for the prevalence of hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by the hantavirus _Puumala
virus_. This is the same large focus which extends from Samara, on
the river Volga, and surrounding areas east to Bashkortostan and
south to Uralsk on the Kazakhstan side. This focal area has been
reported upon previously in ProMED-mail in 1999/2000 [see references
below].
The carrier of _Puumala virus_ is the bank vole _Clethrionomys
glareolus_, not the "field vole," which, in common language, usually
refers to _Microtus_ species (and, officially, is _M. agrestis_).
Usually, the HFRS caused by _Puumala virus_ peaks in autumn to early
winter due to the seasonal dynamics of bank voles. Consequently,
higher than normal numbers of human cases in spring/early summer may
indicate a slow decline from a vole peak in autumn 2003, or, a
present increase in rodent densities. Nephropathia epidemica, the
mild form of HFRS caused by Puumala virus, has a low case fatality
rate (e.g. 0.1 percent or less in Finland).
