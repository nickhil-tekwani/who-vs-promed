You say: "[I have always wondered why ARS is working so hard and so long to
control this ant. Our published economic studies indicate that this ant does
significantly more good than harm. See Jemal A & M Hugh-Jones, "A review of
the Red Imported Fire-Ant (_Solenopsis invicta_ Buren) and its impacts on
plant, animal, and human health. Preventive Veterinary Medicine 17:19-32. -
- Mod.MHJ"
It is clear that you do not live in a fire ant infested area. Anyone who has
inadvertently stepped in a fire ant mound or has seen young animals (wild or
domestic) suffering or dead because of overwhelming fire ant stings can tell
you why controlling them is an important measure. The impact on wildlife in
particular is dramatic. In some affected areas, ground nesting birds have
almost disappeared. We treat dozens of horrifically affected fawns brought
in my good Samaritans each year. Many of them die in spite of heroic
measures. I personally invite you to come here for a good dose of fire ant
venom and you will see why control of this pest is vital.

[Three things ... the paper was written in a state which has had this ant
since the late 1950s and utilised published and unpublished data recorded by
others; much generated by the then USDA response. I have lived here for 20
years, with my fair share of ant bites. And lastly, and in parallel with
lambs having their eyes plucked out by crows, why did your fawns not move as
the bites are instantly painful? Possibly like the lambs they were ill
before this started. Checking with Louisiana colleagues with more rural
experience than mine indicates they have not seen nor even heard of
ant-afflicted fawns. Which is not to say it doesn't occur in Louisiana,
seemingly we just don't seem to see it, but we have had fire ants for
significantly longer than Texas. - Mod.MHJ

The idea, expressed in a recent posting related to fire ants, stating that
"Our published economic studies indicate that this ant does significantly
more good than harm," needs to be corrected immediately. Without doubt, the
red imported fire ant (_Solenopsis invicta_) causes large amounts of
environmental and economic damage each year. The article by Jemal and Hugh
Jones cited in the comment by Mod. MHJ was written from a point of view that
ignored or was ignorant of the health of natural systems. In addition it
assumed benefits from fire ant consumption of ticks and other supposedly
harmful species, when no significant control, at least to the level of
economic or environmental thresholds has ever been demonstrated. The idea
that higher nutrient levels in a grass plant that grows next to a fire ant
mound can be considered to be a benefit is preposterous. All in all, the
damages caused by imported fire ants probably outweigh the benefits by 100:1
or more.

FIRST, FIRE ANTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT NUISANCE AND POSE HEALTH THREATS TO HUMANS
1. It is not pleasant for me to have to deal with one or two children each
year who get into a fire ant mound when playing in my back yard. They often
come screaming to the door, have to have their clothes rapidly removed, the
ants removed, and the areas treated with a topical anesthetic.
2. In the past few years, I have had to treat or rush to a hospital a number
of students with allergies to hymenopterous stings who stepped into mounds
during field trips. One of these students may have died without treatment.
Keep in mind that fire ants are so abundant in nature in the southeastern
United States that anyone with any outdoor duties of any type is bound to be
bitten and stung frequently. If I had to estimate how many times I have had
such encounters, it would be in the hundreds. A person allergic to
hymenopterous stings can usually avoid bees and wasps by careful activity
and alertness. However, to completely avoid fire ants essentially means
never going out of doors.
SECOND, FIRE ANTS INTERFERE WITH FARMING, HORTICULTURAL, GARDENING, LAWN AND
TURF MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES, AND OTHER OPERATIONS
Under some conditions fire ants eat planted seed before the seed has had
time to germinate. This necessitates re-planting. Wheat, corn and sorghum
seed have been found to be most susceptible to this type of damage.
Fire ants may be taken into machinery during use and affect the operator,
may cause difficulty in use of machinery because of the mounds (especially
in clay soil areas where the mounds may become hardened), may interfere with
the growth of vegetation in the area of the mound, and are unsightly
components of a yards and other areas maintained for a variety of human uses
(golf courses, sports fields, etc.).
Painful stings of fire ants interfere with livestock grazing and are a
serious problem where hand harvest of agricultural products must be done. At
times, fire ant nests may be found in electrical boxes and other housings
for equipment. At present, control of fire ants in such areas requires the
use of chemicals that may damage other organisms and are costly for
homeowners and land managers to purchase. Totally, for those for whom
economics is everything, the dollar amount of the damages listed above is
very large.
THE FOREGOING AREAS OF CONCERN ARE RELATIVELY MINOR (EXCEPT FOR THE AFFECTS
OF INSECTICIDES USE ON HUMANS AND NON-TARGET ORGANISMS), BUT WOULD
CERTAINLY WARRANT EFFORTS AT BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AND ERADICATION. HOWEVER THE
MAJOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY FIRE ANTS IS RELATED TO THEIR DAMAGE TO NATURAL
SYSTEMS AND THEIR DECIMATION OF NATIVE ANIMAL POPULATIONS. I MENTION HERE
ONLY A FEW ITEMS OF CONCERN.
Fire ants are known to decimate ground dwelling insect populations. This
means that native insects are being driven to extinction by the presence of
these ubiquitous predators. The extinction of insect populations may mean
little to those without a grasp of the importance of insects in natural
systems. As examples, consider the results of:
1. Fire ant decimation of populations of beneficial insects that keep
damaging insects under control.
2. Decimation of ground-nesting bees that serve as important pollinators for
native species and commercially important species.
3. Elimination of insect species that serve as the basis of food webs that
support the existence of native organisms (birds, bats as examples)
4. Elimination of insect types that serve as shredders of litter and thus
mediate the return of vegetative material to natural cycles for re-use.
These are but a few examples.
Fire ants are known to decimate populations of ground-dwelling vertebrates
by preying on eggs and young. Animals that have been shown to be affected or
for which population declines coincide with fire ant increase include native
rabbits, skunks, ground-dwelling snakes, ground-nesting birds, and native
small rodents, to mention examples.
Perhaps the current attempt at biological control will succeed in reducing
fire ant numbers to levels at which most damage will be less significant.
Unfortunately, the ARS and other agencies have started innovative work too
late. Early efforts at eradication with toxic chemicals caused significant
damages. All in all the USDA has been negligent in its efforts to control
exotics and has been worse in its efforts to control imports. The
surreptitious and probably illegal introduction, by the ARS, of the exotic
lady beetle _Harmonia axyridis_ is an example of where this agency has gone
badly off track. But let's give credit where it is due. This is the best try
they have made yet on fire ants. Lets hope it shows some results.

[Disregarding the hyperbole, first of all let's see your data; negative
lists are one thing, data on costs & benefits are something else. Here, fire
ants are a nuisance but we get on with it. Those who were children in the
pre-fire ant era tell me how they had to be de-ticked every day on coming home
from playing. One can take one's pick of which infestation, and then of
tick-borne diseases or ant hypersensitivity. The most serious fire ant
losses occurred when infestation first arrived and some farm records were
quite spectacular as the infestation 'front' came through their property.
Afterwards things settled down. Published records concentrate on the former,
more dramatic scenarios. They do eat newly germinated plants but in any
cultivated field the ants quickly escape the cultivation disturbance by
moving to the margins & field edges where they will feed only on nearby
plants. Soya beans and cotton continue to be major and significant crops in
the state. In Louisiana, except for strawberries, we no longer harvest by
hand and haven't done so since long before the fire ants arrived. The major
complaint I have heard - other than the pain from bites, which is usually
ascribed to stupidity for not taking care where hands or feet were placed -
is that the mounds play havoc with farm machinery, but this reflects the
poor pasture management & weed control by most Louisiana farmers; chain
harrowing would do much to reduce the grazing infestation and level any
mounds.
But as George states USDA may be too late. We will see. It will be
interesting to see what data are being collected on, say, wildlife species
diversity & density before and after Phorid introduction. Any by what
percentage the fire ant population is permanently reduced. - Mod.MHJ

Query: After the fly hatches larva, how does the host react? What happens
next?

does it attack others as well? - Mod.MHJ
