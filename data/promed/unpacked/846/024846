A severe cholera outbreak looms over Kissy, and Calaba Town environs,
medical sources reveal. Residents of Kissy, Rokupa, Wellington, Calaba and
Allen Towns in Freetown have been faced with a severe water crisis for the
past 1 month.
5 people have reportedly died at the Rokupa Government Hospital as a result
of the disease while over 200 people have been admitted at the hospital. A
senior nursing sister at the hospital who wants to remain anonymous said
the hospital is currently treating over 200 patients for cholera related
symptoms.
"We have found out that the communities where these patients are coming
from lack pure drinking water and decent toilet facilities," she asserted.
A resident of Rokupa explained that the environment lacks pure drinking
water, and infested with poor toilet facilities with piles of garbage
within the community. He pointed out that his uncle was experiencing
frequent stool and vomiting recently.

[4] Cholera - Angola (Huila)

<http://www.angolapress-angop.ao/noticia-e.asp?ID=477949>

Health authorities of Quipungo district, south Huila province, reported
that the 33 new cholera cases have claimed 10 lives in the past 8 days.
The fact was revealed to ANGOP this Thu, 5 Sep 2006, by the director of the
Municipal Health Section, Antonio Marcelino who informed that there has
been an increase of 3 deaths and 12 cases since the outbreak in the region.
Antonio Marcelino asked competent authorities of the province in order to
send medicines with urgency, as well as install tents to accommodate the
sick, because the single hospital in the region does not have the capacity
to attend to all patients. Among the efforts to fight against the disease,
the Municipal Health and Waters Department disinfected 12 wells, 8 water
reservoirs, and holds cleaning and rubbish collection campaigns.
The districts of Lubango, Quipungo and Matala are the mostly affected by
cholera, which has already killed 90 people.
