Hepatitis E Virus Infection Linked to 3 Deaths in Tokyo
-------------------------------------------------------
Hepatitis E, once considered a disease of developing countries with poor
sanitary conditions, has claimed the lives of 3 Japanese since the 1990s,
research undertaken by Toshiba Hospital in Tokyo has found. Of the main
viral forms of [hepatitis], which inflames the liver, only hepatitis E
virus infection can be spread by animals. The Health, Labor and Welfare
Ministry began researching the number of cases of hepatitis E virus
infection and studying the route of infection, after Europe and the United
States reported increased [incidence] of the disease in recent years. The 3
patients who died were diagnosed with hepatitis E virus infection during
autopsies. Among them was a Hokkaido woman who was diagnosed with acute
hepatitis 6 days after being admitted to a hospital last year and later
underwent a partial liver transplant from a living donor. However, she died
3 months after the operation.
A research team led by Shunji Mishiro, director of Toshiba Hospital's
research department, detected hepatitis E virus (HEV) when testing her
blood after her death. Another research group also found HEV in the serums
of 2 elderly men of the Tohoku Region who died of acute hepatitis in the 1990s.
The cases, the first fatalities confirmed to be caused by hepatitis E virus
in the nation, were reported to a meeting of experts last month. Mishiro
and his team also detected HEV in the blood of 7 patients in Tokyo, Saitama
Prefecture and Hokkaido who had been diagnosed with acute hepatitis between
1996 and 2002. As none of the 7 had been to places abroad where the disease
is prevalent, experts said it is likely the virus has taken root in the
country. Cases of people returning from abroad with the illness also have
been confirmed.
Examinations found 3 [genotypes] of HEV among the 7 people who contracted
the virus in Japan, all of which were different from the types of the virus
found overseas. Mishiro determined that HEV came to the country through 3
routes. HEV, as with hepatitis A virus (HAV), is contained in patients'
stools, and can be caught through consuming food or water contaminated by
feces from an infected person.
According to studies in areas where the virus is rampant, hepatitis virus
infection E can become more serious than hepatitis A. The virus is fatal in
1-2 percent of cases; a death rate 10 times that of hepatitis A. About 20
percent of pregnant women who contract acute hepatitis E die.
In Japan, HEV has not been considered a serious risk because it has been
associated with countries with underdeveloped water supplies. In light of
this and the fact that HEV testing is not widely available, it is possible
that other people infected with the virus have gone undiagnosed. HEV can
[survive] and grow in the body of animals without causing serious problems
to its host. Therefore, pigs, goats, and rats are thought to carry the
virus in some foreign countries. As the virus can spread if left unchecked,
the ministry is trying to determine as soon as possible the number of
hepatitis E cases among patients infected with unspecified forms of acute
hepatitis.

[As stated above, Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been associated
with developing regions and attributed to oral-fecal transmission due to
inadequate sanitation. Several recent findings, however, have led to a new
understanding of this virus. A number of novel isolates have been
identified in patients with acute hepatitis from regions other than Japan
not considered endemic for HEV (Austria, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Spain, and the United States). These individuals reported no recent travel
to HEV-endemic areas. In addition, a number of HEV-like sequences have also
been isolated from swine worldwide, suggesting the potential of an animal
reservoir.
The August issue of the Journal of General Virology (83(Pt 8):1931-1940,
2002) contains a paper by Takahashi et al. describing the identification
of 2 distinct genotypes of hepatitis E virus in a Japanese patient with
acute hepatitis who had not travelled abroad. The paper should be consulted
for an up-to-date assessment of the situation. The authors conclude among
other things that one of the 2 strains had higher sequence identity to
human and swine HEV isolates from the United States (US1, US2 and swUS1)
than to those reported thus far from Japan (JRA1 and swJ570). The 2
co-infecting strains identified from the single patient shared only 80.1
percent nucleotide identity. These results indicate that multiple genotypes
of HEV co-circulate in Japan, and that genotype IV comprises a remarkably
heterogeneous group of HEVs. It seems clear that at least 4 distinct
genotypes of hepatitis E virus are prevalent in Japan and that this should
be taken into account in the treatment of acute hepatitis. - Mod.CP]
