Three dogs tested positive for canine enteric coronavirus at a meeting in Christchurch on Monday last week [week of 12 Jul 2021].

The discovery meant 6 race meetings had to be cancelled, with the next event scheduled for 26 Jul 2021.

The virus only affects the gastrointestinal system of dogs and is not related to the COVID-19 coronavirus.

Christchurch Greyhound Racing Club manager Tony Music said the dogs at the race meeting where the virus was detected would be isolated. The infected greyhounds have been isolated.

These cancellations will have a "significant" financial impact on the industry. "You can't get those meetings back,'' he said.

"My understanding is that the virus is very contagious, so the safest thing to do was abandon the races."

New Zealand Veterinary Association companion animal veterinary manager Lorelle Barrett said the disease was rare in domestic dogs.

"We tend to see it where there are dogs in higher density kennels. Greyhound kennels would be a typical situation,'' she said. "It is not commonly reported at all in our domestic dog population."

She said clinical signs included diarrhoea and vomiting. "It is quite contagious, but they usually recover quickly."

["There are 2 forms of canine coronavirus: enteric canine coronavirus (CCoV) and respiratory canine coronavirus (CRCoV). Vaccines protecting against enteric coronavirus infection do not provide protection against the respiratory form of this disease [see ref below].

"The enteric canine coronavirus (CCoV) and respiratory canine coronavirus (CRCoV) are not the same viruses as SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the COVID-19 infection. For more information on COVID-19 and pets please visit the CDC website [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html]

"Transmission
Enteric canine coronavirus is spread through contact with oral secretions or contact with infected feces. Coronaviruses are fairly resistant and can remain infectious for longer periods outdoors at frozen temperatures.

"Clinical signs
- Depression
- Loss of appetite
- Vomiting
- Acute diarrhea
- Yellow to orange diarrhea varying from soft to watery (may also contain blood)
- Fever (occasionally)

"Risk factors
- Young dogs
- Dogs coming from shelters, rescue centers, breeding kennels, or pet stores [and racing conditions, where there are many animals gathered in an area. - Mod.TG]
- Boarding at a kennel or doggie daycare
- Visiting groomers, dog parks, or engaging with other dogs on a daily basis
- Dogs that live in multiple pet homes

"Are there diseases that can be confused with canine coronavirus?
There are many causes of diarrhea in dogs. Severe cases of coronavirus can be easily confused with parvovirus, and they may occur at the same time. Be sure to see your veterinarian if your dog has diarrhea that does not resolve within twenty- four hours or is associated with significant lethargy or loss of appetite.

Is there any treatment?
There is no specific treatment for canine coronavirus."

For the safety of the dogs and to stop this outbreak, the track seems to have acted appropriately as this virus could rapidly spread through these canine athletes and could be detrimental to the animals

It is a difficult situation, but it is about the health of the dogs. Hopefully, they will return to health soon and the race can perhaps be reinstated. - Mod.TG
