The Veterinary Services Department has reported outbreaks of lumpy
skin disease across the whole country.
In an interview on Monday [8 Jan 2007], the acting principal director
in the department, Dr Unesu Ushewokunze-Obatolu, said cases of
livestock succumbing to lumpy skin disease have been recorded countrywide.
Dr Ushewokunze-Obatolu said the situation was being worsened by the
fact that farmers were failing to immunise their livestock against
the disease. She stressed that it was farmers' responsibility to do so.
She added that some farmers were importing lumpy skin vaccines from
South Africa, which she said was not the ideal situation as local
companies were supposed to do so.

[Lumpy skin disease (LSD), a listed capripox virus disease, is
endemic in Zimbabwe. As said in the above newswire, the disease is
observed throughout Zimbabwe; 2005 data can be found at OIE's WAHID
data-base, available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=disease_status_detail>.
The apparent increased disease incidence in Zimbabwe reflects the
deteriorated disease-control systems and infrastructure. - Mod.AS]
