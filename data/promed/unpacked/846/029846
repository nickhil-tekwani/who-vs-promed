Fungal disease hits coconut cultivation
---------------------------------------
The Coconut Development Board (CDB) on Friday [24 October 2008] ordered
cultivators in the Southern Province to destroy over 750 coconut plants
following a major fungal disease which affected a large extent of coconut
lands. The disease has been reported from Hambantota, Galle, Matara,
Akmeemana, Habaraduwa, Tangalle, and Beliatta areas.

Plantation minister DM Jayaratna told the Sunday Observer that the
government has taken all possible measures to prevent the disease from
spreading to other areas. "Creating awareness of all coconut growers about
the signs of the disease through CDB area officials and deploying adequate
officers specialised in the coconut cultivation process, to districts where
coconut is cultivated, are some of the measures taken by us to prevent
[spread of] the disease further," he said.

Young coconuts falling and the tender leaves of trees withering are the
main signs of the fungal disease. According to CDB statistics, agricultural
experts have already tested nearly 7000 coconut plants in the affected
areas and it is reported that the disease has spread to nearly 600 other
trees. "However, we have already allocated nearly [LKR] 180 million [about
USD 1.64 million] for testing and future experiments," the minister said.

[Although the fungal disease affecting the coconut palms is not specified
above, it is most likely the leaf rot disease (LRD), which has been
reported from the area earlier (ProMED-mail post no. 20071118.3734). LRD is
due to a complex of fungi including up to 14 different species, but the
main species are generally considered to be _Glomerella cingulata_ and
_Setosphaeria rostrata_. The emerging spindle leaf is particularly
vulnerable to LRD. Symptoms are blackening and shriveling of leaflets in
the spindle and the younger leaves. The affected portions break off giving
the leaves a fan-like appearance. New leaves get infected until all fronds
show symptoms. The reduction in leaf surface affects nut yield and plant
vigour. Disease management includes removal of all severely affected fronds
followed by fungicide treatments.

In Sri Lanka, a phytoplasma was also shown to be associated with the
LRD-affected palms (ProMED-mail post no. 20080225.0757) and is considered
to be the predisposing factor for the LRD. Scientists of the national
Coconut Research Institute (CRI) identified about 200 000 palms with
suspected phytoplasma symptoms (yellowing, leaf necrosis, nut drop) in the
southern part of the country. However, it seems to be the secondary LRD
that causes the death of the palms. The identity and possible origin of the
phytoplasma are still being investigated.

A quarantine zone and eradication programme established around Matara
district last year [2007] does not seem to have been effective in confining
the problem.
