Snow Brand Milk Products Co.'s Osaka plant chief made a bombshell
announcement Saturday that a milk solid that likely promoted the growth of
bacteria had been found inside a valve in the plant production line that
caused an outbreak of food poisoning that sickened more than 6000 people in
8 prefectures.
Making a circle with his fingers about the size of a 10 yen coin, Shimono
said: "The contaminant was about this size. It was not invisible."
When the production line was approved by the Health and Welfare Ministry,
the company did not report on the facilities it used to recycle leftover
products, such as temporary pipes or spare tanks, as it should have done in
accordance with the Food Sanitation Law.
In addition, no record of such facilities was included in the plan of the
production line that the company handed in to the Osaka municipal
government. As a result, the presence of the bacteria inside the valve was
not detected when municipal officials carried out an on-the-spot inspection.
The temporary pipe was not covered by an automatic washing system, and a
company executive pointed out that this contravened company rules.

Police on Sunday raided an Osaka factory responsible for producing
contaminated milk that sickened thousands last week. The Snow Brand Milk
Products Co. plant, located in Osaka's Miyakojima-ku, was probed on
suspicion that staff had caused injuries to an indefinite number of people
through professional negligence. The company has admitted that it went
against its own policy and failed to clean for over three weeks a valve
suspected of contaminating milk with bacteria.
On the same day, the Osaka Municipal Government ordered the temporary
closure of the Miyakojima plant until quarantine control at the factory is
brought up to a proper standard.
The order followed the conclusion of Osaka Prefecture that bacteria
detected in certain batches of Snow Brand's low-fat milk has caused food
poisoning in over 6500 people so far in 8 prefectures in western Japan.
Forty-two people had been hospitalized as of Sunday. Many victims have
complained of stomach aches, diarrhea and vomiting.
Prefectural government health officials found poisonous remains of
_Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteria in the low-fat milk product.
Officials said it proved that the bacteria, which staff found on remains of
solidified milk stuck inside a valve of the plant, were the culprits behind
the mass poisoning incident.
Snow Brand has admitted that the valve had not been cleaned since June 2 -
violating an in-house rule that stipulates that it should be washed once a
week.
Osaka city health officials, who had inspected the plant four times since
Wednesday in an attempt to determine the cause, were furious at the fact
that the contaminated valve was not on the factory's blueprints, which had
been submitted to the local government.
"We could not inspect the valve because we did not even know it existed,"
an angry health official said.
It is believed that the firm's slow response to the food poisoning after it
learned of the breakout made the situation worse. People began to complain
about symptoms of food poisoning on Tuesday, and Osaka city officials had
launched an inquiry on Wednesday afternoon. But Snow Brand did not start
recalling the low-fat milk until Thursday morning and did not publicize the
incident until that night.
