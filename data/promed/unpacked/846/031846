Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 teen had no Tamiflu record
-------------------------------------------------
A genetic mutation of influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus [swine
flu] that is resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu has been
detected in a Japanese teenager who had not previously been treated
with the drug, a Japanese health official said. This case could mark
Japan's 1st instance of person-to-person transmission of a
Tamiflu-resistant strain of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, but
Health Ministry official Takeshi Enami said there was still
insufficient evidence to confirm that. "We cannot deny that this
could be person-to-person transmission, but we are not able to reach
that conclusion," Enami said. Japan has had 8 cases of [pandemic
(H1N1) 2009] infected patients who were resistant to Tamiflu, he
added. The Geneva-based World Health Organisation (WHO) said in late
September [2009] that drug-resistant pandemic flu viruses had
appeared infrequently and there was no evidence that they were
spreading, but that further cases were likely.

The mutation was detected by health officials in Sapporo, northern
Japan, in a teenage girl who had developed a fever on 22 Aug 2009.
She was given GlaxoSmithKline's Relenza and recovered a day later,
the ministry said in a statement. The detected mutation did not
worsen the virus, nor were there signs of an unusual rise in new H1N1
cases nearby, it said.

The risk of resistance is higher in patients who suffer from weak
immune systems and have already been treated with Tamiflu,
(manufactured by Roche Holding under license from Gilead Sciences).
It is also high in people who are treated with antivirals as a
precaution after exposure to someone with influenza but nevertheless
develop the disease.

[Comments by the correspondent: this is 8th case of
Tamiflu-resistance in Japan. The 7 other cases were treated with
Tamiflu. The Official Health Lab of Sapporo City examined a total of
149 cases between 11 Jun and 9 Sep 2009, but found no
Tamiflu-resistant cases, except this case.

US flu study confirms H1N1 more serious in youth
------------------------------------------------
A study of people who became seriously ill and died with the new
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection (swine flu) confirms it is
hitting a younger population than the seasonal flu and causes often
different symptoms. The study of 272 patients sick enough to be
hospitalized showed about 40 percent had diarrhea and vomiting --
usually rare with seasonal flu -- and confirmed that quick treatment
with antivirals could save lives.

Dr Seema Jain of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), who led the study, said the findings had informed the CDC's
advice on who should worry about the new H1N1 virus and when to get
treatment. "Of the 272 patients we studied, 25 percent were admitted
to an intensive care unit and 7 percent died," Jain's team wrote in
the report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. They
said 45 percent were children under 18, just 5 percent were over 65,
and 73 percent had at least one underlying condition such as asthma,
diabetes, heart disease, and pregnancy. The soonest any of the
patients who died were treated with an antiviral drug was 3 days
after they started showing symptoms, the researchers found. All
patients treated earlier survived.

Roche AG's Tamiflu or GlaxoSmithKline's Relenza should be given
within 48 hours of symptoms to be the most effective. But Jain said
it was never too late to try. "We really believe that antivirals
should be started as soon as possible in patients who are
hospitalized," Jain said in a telephone interview. Even if patients
do not have the traditional risk factors for serious disease, they
should get antiviral drugs if they are sick enough to be
hospitalized, Jain said.

The cases her team examined represented about a quarter of the
hospitalized H1N1 patients in the United States between 1 May and 9
Jun 2009, before the World Health Organization declared the epidemic
a pandemic. All the patients had fever and cough, 42 percent of the
children had diarrhea or vomiting, and all of the patients 65 and
older had an underlying condition. Some studies suggest people born
before 1952 have some immunity to the [pandemic] H1N1 virus. Of those
whose height and weight were available, 29 percent were obese and 26
percent were morbidly obese. Jain said the percentage of people who
were obese reflected the general US population, but only 5 percent of
the population is morbidly obese. Some other studies have suggested
that morbid obesity -- defined as having a body mass index or BMI
[weight in kg/height in metres, squared] - Mod.CP] of 40 or higher --
may raise a person's risk of serious complications and death from
[pandemic] H1N1. Jain said that question needed more study.

The study found that 7 percent of the hospitalized patients died, and
all of those who died had been on ventilators. Those who died ranged
in age from 1 year to 57 years. Those who died were more likely to
have been short of breath, to have pneumonia, a neurological
disorder, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. They were also less
likely to have received a seasonal flu vaccine over the past year.

In its weekly report on death and disease, another CDC team found
that 41 percent of children aged 6 months to 2 years got a seasonal
flu vaccine last year [2008], 32 percent of 2- to 4-year-olds, 20
percent of other children aged up to 17, 32 percent of young adults,
42 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds, and 67 percent of those over 65 --
who have the highest risk of severe illness or death from seasonal flu.

[3] Herd immunity?

Areas hit hard by flu in spring see little now
----------------------------------------------
While concern over the spread of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
sweeps the country, epidemiologists in New York and a few other
cities that were awash in swine flu last spring [2009] are detecting
very little evidence of a resurgence. Although flu season will not
peak until the weather gets cold, in New York, which was the nation's
hardest-hit city, officials say that flu activity is no higher than
it normally is at this time of year and that school attendance is
normal. Last week [week of 30 Sep 2009], Dr Anne Schuchat, the
director of immunization at the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), said, "Most states do have quite a lot of
disease right now, and that's unusual for this time of year."

But public health officials say there appears to be a pattern of
areas that had big outbreaks in the spring, like New York, Boston,
and Philadelphia, seeing less swine flu now. New York City health
officials now believe that while only 10 percent to 20 percent of New
Yorkers were reported ill with [pandemic H1N1] flu last spring, as
many as 20 percent to 40 percent may have been exposed to the disease
and developed immunity that has prevented it from spreading. Although
it is too early to be sure, they said, the high level of immunity may
mean that the 2nd wave of swine flu infection ends up being far less
extensive than expected.

The immunity theory has gained enough credence that Dr Thomas A
Farley, New York City's health commissioner, put it forward at a
conference on the national preparations for [pandemic 2009] H1N1 last
Friday [2 Oct 2009] in New York, led by Kathleen Sebelius, the health
and human services secretary, and Dr Thomas R Frieden, director of
the disease control centers. "We're not seeing illness in the city
right now," Dr Farley said at one session. "We're seeing essentially
no disease transmitted in the city. We had 750 000 to one million
sick people last spring. We were the hardest-hit city then. So we
have a lot of immune people right now."

Officials say the conflicting data show the delicate balance public
health officials are walking with swine flu. So far it has turned out
to be less deadly than it seemed when a pattern of deaths was
reported in Mexico last spring [2009]. At the same time, officials
fear that it could take a turn for the worse, and they want to
maintain a high level of alertness without crying wolf too many times.

Dr Martin S Cetron, a flu expert at the disease control agency and
the co-author of a 2007 study of how the 1918 flu hit 43 American
cities, called the idea that flu is not big now because it was big in
the spring "an interesting hypothesis, with biological plausibility,"
but said that only the rest of the winter would tell. "To say, Oh,
all of us in New York are immune, we won't have any more disease and
we don't need to take vaccine, is a dangerous conclusion to draw," Dr
Cetron said.

New York City public health officials are in fact conducting an
extensive immunization campaign, and they agree that it is far too
early to draw any final conclusions. "It's like Sherlock Holmes
looking at the evidence and saying, 'Hmmm, that's a plausible
solution,'" Dr Don Weiss, an epidemiologist with New York City's
health department, said Wednesday [7 Oct 2009]. "This sort of fits
with what we're seeing, but there could be other explanations."
Still, Dr Weiss added, "The theory that everybody's talking about is
that maybe because New York had such a bad outbreak in the spring, it
won't be so bad in the fall." The amount of immunity in a population,
called the herd immunity, "will tell you whether or not you will have
an outbreak," Dr Weiss said. For highly infectious diseases, like
measles, it is generally accepted that 90 percent to 95 percent of
the population has to be immunized to prevent an outbreak, he said.
For flu, a virus that is constantly changing year to year, it is less
clear what the herd immunity has to be to prevent a further outbreak,
but it may be as little as half, and New York may be very close to
that, Dr Weiss said.

Since September [2009], only about 150 to 250 people a day have been
going to New York City emergency rooms complaining of flu-like
symptoms, officials said. The presumption in New York and elsewhere
is that most flu cases this time of year are swine flu [pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection], because it is still early in the year
for the so-called garden-variety flu.

Attendance in the New York City's public school system, with just
over a million students, was 91 percent Wednesday [7 Oct 2009]. Last
spring [2009], when the virus was rampant, nearly 60 schools were
closed and about 18 percent of students were absent.

In Boston, where an estimated 11 percent of adolescents got swine flu
in the spring, public schools and college health services have
reported very little flu activity this fall, Dr Anita Barry, director
of the infectious disease bureau of the Boston Public Health
Commission, said Wednesday [7 Oct 2009]. But Dr Barry said she was
reluctant to draw any conclusions so early in the season, without
taking blood samples to test for immunity.

Seattle, Connecticut, and Utah also had lots of swine flu in the
spring, but appear to have less now, said Donald R Olson, research
director for the International Society for Disease Surveillance. Some
states, including Georgia, Indiana, and North Carolina, had "false
waves" of swine flu in the spring, Mr Olson said, which seemed to
have been caused by the "worried well" flocking to hospitals. "Of the
places that had 'real waves' last spring," he said, "none have really
taken off." Georgia in particular took off when schools reopened in
August [2009]. In the last week of September, there were 81
hospitalizations and 8 deaths from H1N1 in the state, according to
the Georgia Department of Community Health, compared with 44
hospitalizations and one death in the 3-months from late April
through late July [2009].

As of Monday [5 Oct 2009], 7 pregnant women were on respirators in
Arkansas hospitals, officials said "We're hearing from doctors and
clinics across the state that they're swamped," said Ann Wright, a
spokeswoman for the Arkansas Department of Health. Since August
[2009], about half the children seen in the emergency room at
Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock have complained of flu,
about double the usual number for this time of year, said Craig H
Gilliam, the hospital's director of infection control. Mr Gilliam
said the hospital had a record number of emergency room visits on 15
Sep 2009, which he attributed to the flu.
