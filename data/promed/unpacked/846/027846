Week 09/2015 (23 Feb - 1 Mar 2015)
--------------
Summary
-------
- Influenza activity continues to increase in eastern and central countries of the WHO European Region, but is decreasing in western countries.

- Since week 40/2014, 18 countries have experienced higher than usual levels of influenza activity during this season.

- Since week 04/2015, the proportion of influenza virus detections in sentinel specimens has been about 50 per cent, which is typically seen during peaks of the influenza season. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and type B viruses continued to circulate in the Region, with A(H3N2) predominating, despite increasing detections of type B viruses.

- Excess all-cause mortality among people aged at least 65 years, concomitant with increased influenza activity and the predominance of A(H3N2) viruses, has been observed since the beginning of [2015] in Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (see EuroMOMO).

- Most of the A(H3N2) viruses characterized so far show antigenic differences compared to the virus included in the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. The observed reduced effectiveness of the A(H3N2) component of the vaccine might have contributed to the excess mortality reported among elderly people. The A(H1N1)pdm09 and B components of the vaccine are likely to be effective.

- The circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has decreased to low levels across the European Region.

Virus characteristics
---------------------
Since week 40/2014, the antigenic characteristics of 996 influenza viruses have been reported and 1049 viruses have been characterized genetically. The 222 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized to date are similar to the components included in the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere vaccines.

Analyses of A(H3N2) viruses included 538 viruses characterized antigenically, of which 66 per cent were A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like and dissimilar to the vaccine virus, A/Texas/50/2012. Of the 723 A(H3N2) viruses characterized genetically, 63 per cent fell in genetic subgroup 3C.2a, represented by A/Hong Kong/5738/2014; 27 percent in subgroup 3C.3, represented by A/Samara/73/2013; 9 per cent in genetic subgroup 3C.3a, represented by A/Switzerland/9715293/2013; 1 per cent in genetic subgroup 3C.1, represented by A/Texas/50/2012; and <1 per cent in genetic subgroup 3C.2, represented by A/Stockholm/1/2013 (Table 3).

Viruses in genetic subgroups 3C.2a and 3C.3a have been shown to be antigenically dissimilar to the current A(H3N2) vaccine virus. Together, these observations indicate that the current A(H3N2) component of influenza vaccines will probably have reduced effectiveness.

Of the 236 influenza B viruses characterized antigenically, 97 percent were of the Yamagata lineage, which is included in the current 2014-2015 northern hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines (Table 2). Six viruses were of the Victoria lineage. Of the Yamagata lineage viruses, 24 per cent were similar to B/Massachusetts/2/2012, a virus from genetic clade 2, while 75 per cent were like B/Phuket/3073/2013, the virus from genetic clade 3, recommended for the southern hemisphere 2015 influenza season vaccines. In addition, one B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like and two B/Florida/4/2006-like Yamagata lineage viruses have been reported. Of the 215 B/Yamagata lineage viruses characterized genetically to date, 97 per cent belong to clade 3, represented by B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Table 3). The three influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (recommended for inclusion in quadrivalent vaccines).

Further details of virus characteristics with collection dates since 31 May 2014 can be found in the ECDC December 2014 virus characterization report.

The influenza vaccine recommendation for the northern hemisphere 2015-2016 season was made on 26 Feb 2015. It is recommended that vaccines for use in the season (northern hemisphere winter) contain the following:

- A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;
- A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus;
- B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage).

It is recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing 2 influenza B viruses contain the above 3 viruses and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage).

None of the viruses that underwent phenotypic or genotypic testing for neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility showed evidence of reduced susceptibility.

[Additional data of significance are the ages of patients. Where data on age were available, since the start of the season, 1596 of 3061 (52 per cent) hospitalized cases were aged at least 65 years; 850 of these were admitted to ICUs. Influenza virus A(H3N2) was more frequently reported in patients admitted to hospital and ICUs compared with A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B. In total, 249 influenza A viruses from patients aged at least 65 years in ICUs were subtyped: 183 (74 per cent) as A(H3N2) and 66 (26 per cent) as A(H1N1)pdm09. - Mod.CP
