Erie County Health officials say they have had an "uptick" of pertussis reports, specifically on Grand Island and in East Aurora. 13 cases have been reported to the county so far for the month of November 2014. December numbers have not been tallied yet. All, except one, have been school-age children.

Grand Island Superintendent Dr Teresa Lawrence says they've had 10 cases of pertussis in the middle and high school. East Aurora is also dealing with several students with pertussis. Jerome Polakiewicz, Director of Pupil Services and Special Education say they have 8 confirmed cases, and 3 more probable cases. They have also sent a letter home to parents. The county says this is just a slight uptick and there was a more widespread outbreak in 2011 and 2012.

A wide swath of Central and Southside Virginia is seeing an increase in pertussis, or 'whooping cough'. "We are seeing more than we would expect right now," said Haley Philips, a Virginia Department of Health epidemiologist, this week. The increase is in the department's Southwestern region of Virginia, which encompasses an area that includes Alleghany, the Cumberland Plateau, Central Virginia, Mount Rogers, New River, Pittsylvania County/Danville, Lenowisco, Roanoke, and West Piedmont.

Philips would not identify the number of cases occurring either in Lynchburg or the Southwestern region, but according to Virginia Department of Health surveillance reports, 18 Virginians died as a result of pertussis in October [2014], the most recent month for which data is available. [It is unlikely that the figure quoted was for deaths from pertussis. - Mod.LL]

None of those cases occurred in the Central Virginia Health District, which includes Lynchburg and the counties of Appomattox, Amherst, Bedford, and Campbell. Philips said Tue, 9 Dec 2014, that "pertussis is always a concern" for health departments. Pertussis is one of a number of diseases the health department continually monitors. Right now, Philips said, "We certainly are paying attention."

Seven East High School students were kept home from school on Thu 4 Dec 2014, while school officials and the Salt Lake County Health Department worked to contain an outbreak of whooping cough. The school also conducted on-site immunizations for roughly 30 students who had not yet received pertussis, or whooping cough, vaccinations, East High School Principal Paul Sagers said. "We've personally called every student who has not been immunized," Sagers said. "We have basically told them that they need to be immunized." The school's quick reaction to contain the cluster comes as whooping cough cases have declined in Utah, after a spike 2 years ago.

There have been 748 confirmed cases of whooping cough in Utah in 2014, according to Rebecca Ward, a health educator with the Utah Department of Health. That's down from 1132 at this time in 2013. In 2012, there were 1544 cases.

Unlike the cold or flu, which peak during the winter season, pertussis circulates throughout the year, said Ward. Schools in Weber County and Sevier County were hit with outbreaks in February and May 2014. "It's not as high as it has been and that's a good thing," Ward said. "We're probably not going to get to 1000 cases by the end of 2014."

Salt Lake County health officials were told of the 1st case of whooping cough 2 weeks ago, department spokeswoman Pamela Davenport said. As of Thu 4 Dec 2014, there were 6 confirmed cases, Davenport said, enough to classify as an outbreak under CDC guidelines.

Parents of 2 southeast Nebraska school districts are on alert regarding the whooping cough. Within the past week, students in the Nebraska City and Syracuse districts [Otoe County] have contracted pertussis. Nebraska City School Superintendent Dr Jeff Edwards tells KMA News reports were received from students at Nebraska City Middle School and Hayward Elementary School. Edwards says school officials worked with the Southeast District Health Department to inform students and parents about the illnesses.

"Through the health department," said Edwards, "we received a letter from them, and then a fax sheet, that we mailed out to all of our parents in the middle school and at Hayward. Basically, that fact sheet talked about what parents should look for, what are some of the symptoms of the whooping cough, and if their child has not received immunization, how they can go about doing that." Edwards says it's hard to tell how many students contracted whooping cough.

"There's a lot of crud going around out there," he said. "Whether it's from the pertussis or whooping cough, or whether it's from the general flu, I would say our numbers (of absences) are typical for this time of year. Anytime you've got weekends where it's 60 deg F [15.5 deg C], and the next day, it's 20 [deg F/-6.6 deg C], wearing a jacket and not wearing a jacket, there's all kinds of different factors out there."

[5] Michigan (Allegan County)

Allegan County's medical director, Dr Richard Tooker, told 24 Hour News 8 he thinks 2014 may go down in history as the county's worst ever for whooping cough. "I've been in public health since 1984 and I have never seen anything like this," Tooker said.

There were 4 cases of whooping cough in Allegan County in 2011. Tooker said that was typical. In 2012, there were 27 cases. There were 25 case in 2013. There have already been 26 cases in 2014. 21 of those have happened since August. Most have affected Hamilton High School students, but there have also been cases reported involving middle school students.

Tooker said there are many more cases that his office expected, even though the number of cases has been on the rise for the last decade. The problem isn't that the children getting sick haven't received their pertussis vaccination. All of the Hamilton students who have been diagnosed with the illness have been properly vaccinated.

"We recognize, in all likelihood, the vaccine doesn't produce long-term immunity like it used to," Tooker said.

The CDC says the problem is nationwide. In 2012, there were 48 277 cases in the US -- the most since 1955. Whooping cough claimed 20 lives nationwide that year. Most of the deaths were of infants under the age of 3 months.

The Michigan Department of Community Health says there have been 1079 cases through 30 Nov 2014. In 2013, there were 766 in the same time period -- that's a 41 percent increase. There have been no whooping cough deaths in Allegan County. But there have been a few in the state in the last couple of years. Tooker said that is unacceptable. He said that even given waning efficacy, vaccination is still the best protection.

Tooker said he expects the CDC to begin convening expert panels to address the issue. He said that there currently seems to be no end in sight to the steady increase in the number of cases.

With 7 confirmed cases of pertussis in Dickinson County it is cause for concern. Students from the county's schools are missing classes because of the illness.

The Dickinson Iron County Health Department Director Joyce Ziegler, says that the best prevention is through vaccination. "While we still may have some cases out there we don't probably have as many as we could potentially if people weren't vaccinated. So, vaccination is prevention. What that does is it protects the entire community."
