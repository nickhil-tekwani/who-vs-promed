Test of tonsil sample from suspected vCJD case does not confirm diagnosis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry's public health director Colin Tukuitonga told
reporters that tests in Melbourne on samples from a Waikato man admitted to
hospital [as a suspected case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease] had
come back negative. "The Ministry of Health has been advised today of test
results ruling out variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD
(new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail] as a diagnosis," he said. "Health
authorities are now confident this diagnosis can be excluded and there are
no risks to public health," he said. A second test on the man's
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was "suggestive of sporadic CJD", Dr Tukuitonga
said. Sporadic CJD infects 3 or 4 people in New Zealand each year, almost
always aged 50 to 65.
The Health Ministry announced 8 days ago that it was awaitng results of
tests on the 26 year old farm worker to see if he had vCJD, a disease
thought to be caused by eating meat or meat products from cattle infected
with mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE). The New
Zealand Food Safety Authority and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
(MAF) announced today the man had been cleared.
While the results might relieve concern from the farming sector, the man
was still considered very ill in Waikato Hospital. "This is an extremely
difficult time for the family," said Derek Belton, MAF director of animal
biosecurity. "However, the exposure in this case has highlighted the
enormous volume of evidence that New Zealand is BSE free, and the
importance of the measures we have in place to maintain BSE freedom," Dr
Belton said.
Food Safety Authority spokesman Stuart MacDiarmid said the scare could well
be repeated in the future. "We have to remind New Zealanders that although
vCJD has been ruled out in this case, we believe that cases could well be
seen in future," Dr MacDiarmid said. "For several years we have recognised
the risk of cases of vCJD in New Zealand because of exposure to risk
material in foods imported prior to 1996 and because of the amount of
overseas travel New Zealanders do. This case was a timely reminder to us
all that it could happen here." The health authorities wanted to provide a
reassurance that New Zealand continued to be BSE free and there were
extensive measures in place to protect the food supply from it.
There were other possible diagnoses for the man's illness, including
"ordinary" CJD, Alzheimer's, or other brain diseases. He remained in a
stable condition in a general ward at Waikato Hospital this morning.
[However] Paul Timmings, the man's neurologist, said that the CSF test for
vCJD is at best suggestive and the tonsil test has high rates of false
positives and false negatives. Dr Timmings said the false negative rate was
25 to 30 per cent.

inconsistent with the provisional clinical diagnosis of vCJD, a final
verdict must await the outcome of brain biopsy analysis which the current
condition of the patient does not justify. - Mod.CP]
