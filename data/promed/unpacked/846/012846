The most rigorous study ever on the safety of transplanting animal
parts into humans found no evidence people caught a worrisome
pig virus. The reassuring finding could spur experiments using pigs
and other animals as organ donors.
At issue is "xenotransplantation,'' transplanting organs or cells
from one species into another. Doctors hope this still highly
experimental field could one day save thousands of lives by easing
a worldwide shortage of donated organs.
But some scientists fear animal-to-human transplants could cause
new epidemics. The AIDS virus is thought to have jumped from
monkeys to people long ago, and just last year pigs in Malaysia
were sickened by a deadly new virus that spread to people.
So scientists are breeding pigs -- the most likely species for
xenotransplants -- specially tested against infections. But concern
arose when researchers recently discovered the genes of all pigs
harbor a previously unknown virus that test-tube experiments
showed could infect human cells.
The virus did not harm the pigs, but nobody knew if it would hurt
humans.
The new study, published in Friday's edition of the journal
"Science", suggests this so-called "porcine endogenous
retrovirus,'' known as PERV, is not a big threat.
Scientists at the British biotechnology company Imutran Ltd.
tracked down 160 patients from 8 countries who were treated
experimentally with living pig tissue. Using the most rigorous viral
testing available -- and supported by testing at the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -- Imutran scientists found
no evidence PERV had infected the 160 patients. [There is no
indication what type of rigorous tests were performed.
Among the virus-free patients were 36 people deemed at high risk
because they had very weak immune systems.
"It's really good news for all those people waiting for this potentially
lifesaving technology,'' said lead researcher Dr. Khazal Paradis of
Imutran, which is developing ways to transplant entire animal
organs.
The study is not proof xenotransplantation is safe, cautioned
CDC's Dr. Louisa Chapman. "It's a substantial advance that gives
us more confidence'' about allowing certain experiments to
proceed, she said. But all xenotransplants must continue to be
closely watched for viruses, she added.
The patients studied included diabetics who had received
transplants of pig pancreas cells, burn victims who had temporary
pigskin grafts, & liver- or kidney-failure patients who had their blood
filtered through pig livers or kidneys outside the body while awaiting
a human organ transplant. [The key here may be the organs were
outside of the human body.
The study's biggest surprise: pig cells remained alive, with no
detectable ill effects, inside a small group of Russian patients 8
years after they had an unusual treatment. [If the pig cells are
viable, could viruses and bacteria also survive?
"We did not expect the pig cells to survive for that long,'' Paradis
said.
The Russians had undergone therapy apparently used nowhere
else. The blood of 100 child burn victims was filtered through a
fresh pig spleen for 1 hour to help them fight severe infection.
Blood normally runs through the spleen, part of the immune system,
and Russian scientists have contended this therapy works.
Regardless, Paradis found living pig cells in 23 of the 100
Russians.
In most other experiments, the human immune system has quickly
killed animal cells -- another roadblock to attempting transplants of
entire animal organs.
The downside when animal cells survive is that "any virus may not
be seen by the immune system either,'' said Dr. Jonathan Allan, a
virus expert at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research
in San Antonio, who has been outspoken about the potential risk of
xenotransplantation.
"This study is not a green light'' to rush ahead, warned Allan, who
wants xenotransplant experiments limited to small numbers of
closely monitored patients.
For now, that is the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)
approach. It is allowing a few small pig-to-people experiments,
including implants of fetal pig cells into Parkinson's disease
patients' brains, while scientists hunt potential infections.
Attempts at transplanting animal organs into people date to 1905,
but they have failed to keep patients alive for more than a few days.
The most famous was the 1984 transplant of a baboon heart into
tiny Baby Fae, who died 20 days later.
The problem is people's immune systems quickly recognize the
animal organs as foreign and launch a vicious attack.
Scientists are working on ways to prevent such attacks and make
animal organ transplants feasible. Research ranges from better
immuno-suppressing drugs to work by Imutran Ltd., which is
genetically engineering pigs to harbor a human gene scientists
hope will make people's bodies more tolerant of the pigs' organs.
Also, scientists are trying to keep some liver transplant patients
alive by filtering their blood through pig livers outside the body, a
temporary "bridge'' until they get a donated human liver for
transplant.
Pigs are the most likely species for animal-to-human transplants
because their major organs are similar in size and structure to
people's.

[There is no indication how long this study was done for. Perhaps
there are no viruses or repercussions, or perhaps it has not been
long enough to know. There may be long term effects that are not
yet known, or perhaps the patients dont live long enough for effects
such as new cancers to show.
On the other hand, since not everyone is an organ donor, but every
life is precious, maybe this is the solution to saving those we love.
The world is not perfect, but the attempts to beat disease and death
are wonderful. - Mod.TG
