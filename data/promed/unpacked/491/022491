Cholera - United Republic of Tanzania.
Since the end of January [1997], a
cholera outbreak with increasing numbers of cases and deaths
has occurred in the country. The first cases reported were in
Dar es Salaam, and then it spread to seven other areas. Vibrio
cholerae El Tor Ogawa has been confirmed.
As of 30 April
1997, nearly 3000 cases with over 100 deaths had been reported.
These reports only related to cases which were admitted to
hospitals.
Cholera cases were also reported in Zanzibar where
there were 30 cases with 2 deaths since the end of March.
The Tanzanian Government, WHO and UNICEF are organising an
emergency strategy to combat cholera. WHO will also provide
US $15 000 to assist the government to implement control
activities (health education, training etc.) and to purchase
supplies and equipment. WHO will send consultants to provide
technical support if requested by the government.
