The Douglas County Health Department has reported the 1st confirmed case of enterovirus D68 [EV 68] in a Douglas County resident. The patient was a child less than a year old who was hospitalized with coughing and difficulty breathing and later released. Symptoms typically include cough, sneezing, a low-grade fever, runny nose and possible body ache. EV-D68 appears to more seriously affect children with asthma or pre-existing respiratory conditions. According to the CDC, most infected people have mild or no symptoms.

Douglas County Health Director Dr. Adi Pour says there is no need to see a physician unless children begin having difficulty breathing. Signs that could prompt a quick response include wheezing, difficulty speaking or eating, the child's belly pulling in with breaths, and blueness around the lips. Dr. Pour says to avoid becoming infected, you should wash your hands frequently with soap and water, cover your cough using your sleeve or a tissue, and stay home if you are sick to avoid spreading this or any other illness.

An infant from St. Lawrence County was diagnosed with enterovirus D68, according to Laurie Maki, director of preventative services with the St. Lawrence County Department of Public Health. Few details about the child were available late Monday [22 Sep 2014] morning, other than the fact that the child was taken to a Syracuse hospital last week, and that the state Department of Health notified St. Lawrence County's health department of the diagnosis Friday [19 Sep 2014] evening.

Monday [22 Sep 2014] afternoon, officials at Jefferson County Public Health Service said they received word that a case had been confirmed in the county. Officials had no other details. "We will receive more positives, and eventually the state will stop testing," said Stephen Jennings of Jefferson County Public Health. The state will stop testing because the virus is already considered a widespread outbreak, he said.

The virus has the symptoms of a bad cold but can be severe for children with respiratory problems like asthma. Schools have been advised about the virus from the state Department of Health.

[3] CDC update

The number of confirmed enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) cases in US children has risen from 130 to 153 and the number of states affected from 12 to 18 in just the past 2 days, according to an update today [19 Sep 2014] from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In addition, California has just announced its 1st confirmed cases, which are not included in the CDC update.

States previously affected were Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. Now Connecticut, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Virginia, and California join the list. Canada has seen cases as well, in Alberta [and Ontario].

Virginia has reported at least 7 confirmed cases (cases are considered confirmed after testing at CDC or state public health labs). Well over 300 children visited the emergency department at just one hospital, St. Mary's, with 46 admitted, says an ABC News item updated today [19 Sep 2014]. "We've never been to this capacity. ... There [are] a lot more patients and a lot more severely ill than we saw with H1N1," said a pediatrician at the hospital.

Connecticut reported its 1st confirmed case yesterday [18 Sep 2014]. It involved a child who was treated at and discharged from a hospital last week, says a notice from the state's department of public health (DPH). Other hospitals in the state have reported suspected cases that await confirmation.

Minnesota's department of health confirmed that state's 1st case of EV-D68 as well, according to a story yesterday [18 Sep 2014] in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The story says that "hospitals in the Twin Cities have been flooded with children experiencing severe breathing problems over the past week" and that "the University of Minnesota Children's Hospital is seeing respiratory illnesses at a rate usually only seen during influenza season." The latter facility has confirmed 11 cases in its laboratories. Finally, the California Department of Health (CDPH) announced confirmation of 4 cases there today [19 Sep 2014]. The notice says that 3 are in San Diego County and one in Ventura County. Other specimens from throughout the state are undergoing testing, the CDPH says.

The EV-D68 illness that is circulating began in mid-August 2014 and has been severe, sending many children to emergency departments or hospitals with wheezing and difficulty breathing. Children with asthma seem to be particularly at risk.

[4] CIDRAP News report
Date: Mon 22 Sep 2014

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/news-scan-sep-22-2014


The national count of confirmed enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) cases reached 160 in 22 states on 19 Sep 2014, which is 7 more cases and 3 more states than reported a day earlier, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The latest states to join the list were Georgia, Michigan, and Washington, the agency's update showed. Cases have been confirmed by the CDC or by state labs that report their results to the agency.

EV-D68, a respiratory virus that was fairly rare until now, causes cold-like symptoms but can lead to serious breathing difficulty, especially in children who have asthma. Infants, children, and teenagers are most at risk for symptomatic EV-D68 infections.

The CDC continues to predict that more states will have confirmed EV-D68 cases, noting that several states are investigating clusters of severe respiratory illness and that testing is complex and slow.

Non-polio enteroviruses are very common and can infect anyone. Most people who get infected with these viruses do not get sick, or they only have mild illness, like the common cold. But some people can have serious complications, especially infants and people with weakened immune systems.

[According to the CDC, non-polio enteroviruses are very common and can infect anyone. Most people who get infected with these viruses do not get sick or they only have mild illness, like the common cold. But some people can have serious complications, especially infants and people with weakened immune systems. Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is one of many non-polio enteroviruses. In America, this virus was 1st identified in California in 1962, but it has not been commonly reported in the United States. EV-D68 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness. Mild symptoms may include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough, and body and muscle aches. Most of the children who were very ill with EV-D68 infection in Missouri and Illinois had difficulty breathing, and some had wheezing. Many of these children had asthma or a history of wheezing.

According to the most recent information from the CDC, a total of 175 people in 27 states have now been confirmed to have respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. The cases of EV-D68 infection were confirmed by CDC or state public health laboratories that notified CDC. Most states are likely to be confirmed as affected by respiratory illnesses caused by EV-D68 in due course. In the absence of clinically relevant information, in future, case numbers will only be recorded at intervals. - Mod.CP
