Over the past 3 years, the incidence of sugarcane leaf scald disease (LSD)
caused by _Xanthomonas albilineans_ has increased at alarming rates in some
Caribbean countries. LSD [has been in a] latent phase since 1978, when the
disease was reported in Cuba, until February 1998 when typical symptoms
were observed in germ plasm collections and in some commercial plantings.
More than 150 bacterial isolates from different sugarcane varieties and
from different localities were isolated on Wilbrink agar medium and
characterized. All isolates [showed] similar cultural and biochemical
patterns. However, serological differences between isolates from the recent
outbreak and the ones obtained prior to 1998 were detected by indirect
ELISA. Differences between Cuban isolates obtained prior to 1998 and those
from the recent outbreak were confirmed by analysis of repetitive DNA
sequences dispersed throughout the genome. According to the pattern
obtained, the newer isolates were similar to reference strains classified
as haplotype B by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (1). It is concluded
that the recent outbreak of LSD was caused by a strain different than the
ones previously detected in Cuba.

[Sugarcane leaf scald disease was first reported in 1911 in Australia. The
disease has been found in at least 55 countries, many of which are in the
most productive sugarcane areas of the world. It has the potential to
seriously limit cultivation of susceptible cultivars. The disease may often
be latent for years before expression of acute and chronic phases. The
bacterium is limited to xylem tissues. There are several serological
strains of the bacterium. The pathogen is spread by contaminated cutting
knives on machinery as well as by contaminated hand tools. Development of
an improved PCR test has resulted in a highly specific assay for the pathogen.
