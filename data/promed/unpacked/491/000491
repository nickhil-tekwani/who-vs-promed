Comment on "West Nile virus, effectiveness of spraying? (05)"
----------------------------------------------------------
This is not a pesticide issue, it's effectiveness of the entire program.
Effective source reduction is manpower-intensive. In an urban situation one
person can only cover 250 acres or so in a 10-day period. They need to
"step up" quite a bit more before they make any difference.
