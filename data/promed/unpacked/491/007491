COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), Hong Kong (SAR-PCR)
------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 3 Apr 2020 from Dr Thomas Sit, chief veterinary officer/assistant director (inspection & quarantine), Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Hong Kong, Hong Kong (SAR-PRC)

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 30 Mar 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 31 Mar 2020
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 1 (scale 0 to 5)
Mortality: 0 (scale 0 to 5)
Zoonotic impact: zoonotic potential unknown at this time
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Aberdeen, Southern District, Hong Kong
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Mar 2020
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cats / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: a cat kept in the same household as a confirmed COVID-19 patient. The animal did not show any relevant clinical signs.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cats / 100 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: likely human-to-animal transmission.
Epidemiological comments: the cat was placed under quarantine on [30 Mar 2020] after its owner was hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection. Following veterinary examination, nasal, oral, and rectal swab samples were taken after the cat's admission to the quarantine facility. All samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The cat has not exhibited any specific clinical signs. Follow-up oral and nasal swab samples taken on [1 Apr 2020] continued to test positive. Investigations are continuing to determine the duration of virus detection. Risk management measures are in place for this case, including cleansing and disinfection of the premises, and proper personal hygiene and protection. Mammalian pets from households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 will be placed under quarantine and veterinary surveillance for 14 days. Samples will be collected for testing of SARS-CoV-2 as appropriate.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; traceability; quarantine; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Cat / Real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 31 Mar 2020 / Positive
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Cat / RRT-PCR / 3 Apr 2020 / Positive
School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong (regional reference laboratory) / Cat / RRT-PCR / 31 Mar 2020 / Positive
School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong (regional reference laboratory) / Cat / RRT-PCR / 3 Apr 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Subscribers are encouraged to read the OIE's Questions and Answers information on COVID-19, last updated Wed 1 Apr 2020, at https://tinyurl.com/v3geqme. The following is sourced from that information:

1. Can humans transmit COVID-19 virus to animals?

Now that COVID-19 virus infections are widely distributed in the human population, there is a possibility for some animals to become infected through close contact with infected humans. Several dogs and cats have tested positive to COVID-19 virus following close contact with infected humans. Further information reported to the OIE can be found below in the 'More information' section. (Note: Readers can obtain this information in the URL indicated above.)

Studies are under way to better understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the COVID-19 virus and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that animals infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person contact.

2. What do we know about COVID-19 virus and companion animals?

The current spread of COVID-19 is a result of human-to-human transmission. To date, there is no evidence that companion animals have spread the disease. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals that may compromise their welfare.

Some examples of animal infections have been reported to the OIE. Further details on these events can be found in the 'More information' section. So far, these appear to be isolated cases, and there is no evidence that dogs or cats are playing a role in the spread of this human disease. Further studies are under way to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19 virus. The OIE will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available.

3. What precautionary measures should be taken when companion or other animals have close contact with humans sick or suspected with COVID-19?

Currently, there is no evidence that companion animals are playing a significant epidemiological role in this human disease. However, because animals and people can sometimes share diseases (known as zoonotic diseases), it is still recommended that people who are sick with COVID-19 limit contact with companion and other animals until more information is known about the virus.

When handling and caring for animals, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented. This includes handwashing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, licking or sharing food.

When possible, people who are sick or under medical attention for COVID-19 should avoid close contact with their pets and have another member of their household care for their animals. If they must look after their pet, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask if possible. Animals belonging to owners infected with COVID-19 should be kept indoors as much as possible and contact with those pets should be avoided as much as possible.

4. What can National Veterinary Services do with regards to companion animals?

Public Health and Veterinary Services should work together using a One Health approach to share information and conduct a risk assessment when a person with COVID-19 reports being in contact with companion or other animals. If a decision is made as a result of a risk assessment to test a companion animal that has had close contact with a person/owner infected with COVID-19, it is recommended that RT-PCR be used to test oral, nasal and fecal/rectal samples. While there is no evidence of a COVID-19 infection spreading from one animal to another, keeping animals that test positive for COVID-19 away from unexposed animals should be considered best practice. - Mod.CRD
