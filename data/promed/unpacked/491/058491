Health officials are reporting a recent case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in western Garfield County, in what's serving as a reminder of the particular risk the mouseborne disease can pose during spring-cleaning season. Garfield County Public Health and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment are investigating the case. A county news release didn't provide information on the victim's age, gender, hometown or condition.

This is the 2nd case in the county in 2 years. Last year a Silt resident survived after contracting the disease, which has close to a 40 per cent mortality rate.

Hantavirus[es] are carried [shed] in the saliva, urine and droppings of certain infected mice found in the western and central United States. Most human infections result from breathing in [a] hantavirus that becomes airborne when contaminated dust and dirt are stirred up, although transmission also can occur by a bite from an infected mouse.

Yvonne Long, Garfield County's public health director, said in a news release, "If you have mice in or around your home, barns, or cabins you are at risk for exposure to hantavirus[es]. That is why we are urging people to exercise extreme caution when they enter or clean up an area with evidence of rodents." Authorities advise against sweeping or vacuuming areas where mice have been present. Instead, they say to use protective gloves, wet down areas with a solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water, and keep the area wet for 5 minutes before beginning cleanup. Dead mice should be sealed in plastic bags before disposal.

Health officials also recommend mouse-proofing homes through measures such as storing food in rodent-proof containers, plugging holes and other entryways, removing outside wood and junk piles and abandoned vehicles where mice may hide, and trapping or poisoning mice inside homes or hiring an exterminator.

Symptoms of hantavirus [infections] typically take 2-4 weeks after exposure to appear. Early symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, and other symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, chills and abdominal problems. Within 1-5 days after symptoms begin, coughing and difficulty breathing occurs [hantavirus pulmonary symdrome].

There is no specific treatment, cure or vaccine for hantavirus, but prompt treatment may improve the chance for recovery.

[Although not stated in the report above, the specific hantavirus involved in this and the previous hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases in Colorado probably is Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) there. Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious, as the 3 HPS deaths in Colorado this year (2015) indicate. The pubic needs to be aware of the circumstances that lead to risk of virus transmission. This is particularly important at this spring season of the year, when cabins and other outbuildings that have been closed for several months, are reopened and cleaned out, raising dust that may be contaminated with virus from deer mice hosts. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information about the condition and outcome of the above case and the dates of the illness.
