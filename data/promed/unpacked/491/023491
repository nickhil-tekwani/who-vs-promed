A German resident developed a febrile illness on [Sun 13 Aug 2017]. She also noticed an eschar on the left thigh on the same day.

She had returned from Zambia on [Wed 9 Aug 2017]. The last 7 days before the return flight were spent in the South Luangwa National Park (northern aspect), together with her husband. They went on game tours and described the area as being very wet due to a comparatively heavy rain season. She recalled several bites by tsetse flies during the time spent there.

She presented to the Frankfurt University hospital emergency department on [16 Aug 2017] and blood was immediately taken and examined for parasites. Trypanosomes could be seen in a QBC microscopy and a thin film. Treatment with suramin was initiated and the case was brought to the attention of the WHO.

The patient is suffering from human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), East African form. Her symptoms consisted of fever, headache, muscle aches and a very notable eschar. The patient had a remarkable pancytopenia initially.

According the WHO, 8 cases of HAT were reported in Zambia in 2015 (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1637). In 2015, a case of HAT was reported in a Canadian tourist who had also visited South Luangwa National Park (http://www.promedmail.org/post/20150904.3625005).

Another 3 cases were described on ProMED-mail in 2010, all of which had visited South Luangwa NP [20101111.4093, 20101022.3833, and 20100915.3338]

HAT is repeatedly affecting travelers to the African subcontinent, when they are exposed to tsetse flies. Clinically, an eschar can be an important clue to the diagnosis.

[ProMED-mail thanks professors Wolf and Just-Nuebling for this communication.

Zambia is endemic for African trypanosomiasis caused by _Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_. A map of areas in Zambia where there is trypanosomiasis can be found at http://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/country/Zambia_whole_1014.jpg.

An update of the distribution up to 2014 was recently published: "Franco JR et al. Monitoring the elimination of human African trypanosomiasis: Update to 2014. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2017; 11(5): e0005585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5456402/.

Overall, the incidence in humans has been declining over the past decade, and a list of all countries affected with either _T. rhodesiense_ or _T. gambiense_ is found at http://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/country/foci_AFRO/en/.

The case illustrates that not all patients returning with fever from Africa have malaria and the availability of qualified microscopy service is important. - Mod.EP
