A federal report says a viral outbreak that killed 11 children at the [Wanaque Center For Nursing And Rehabilitation in Haskell, New Jersey] was made worse because those in charge didn't plan for such an outbreak and didn't react fast enough. The Record reports the pediatric medical director of the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation didn't know how many children were infected with adenovirus or what his job entailed at the time of the outbreak last fall [2018]. The deficiencies in leadership "contributed to the delay in identification and containment of (the) adenovirus outbreak, affecting 33 residents (and) one staff, and resulted in 11 pediatric resident deaths," the report said.

Center administrator Rowena Bautista says the report by regional offices of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is "riddled with factual inaccuracies and blatant misstatements." She says the center has appealed the findings and will "vigorously dispute" the allegations. "We are infuriated that, after a cursory review, federal surveyors put together a report riddled with factual inaccuracies, disregard of medical judgment, and blatant misstatements about how viruses spread," she said in a statement.

The 114-page report was written on [17 Nov 2018]. The inspectors visited the Wanaque center during the peak of the outbreak on [13-17 Nov 2018]. The center has 92 beds for children and 135 for elderly residents. No new cases of the virus have been reported at the center since [12 Nov 2018]. But the state still bars new admissions to its pediatric ventilator unit.

Adenovirus usually poses little risk for healthy people. It can cause mild cold or flu symptoms, and some strains also cause diarrhea and pinkeye. The strain found in the Wanaque rehab center outbreak is called type 7 and is among the more potent types. It sometimes causes more serious respiratory illness, especially among those with weak immune systems.

Inspectors initially blamed poor hygiene for the spread of a virus that killed 11 children at a Wanaque nursing home last fall [2018], but a federal report says the larger problem was that those in charge of the facility didn't plan for such an outbreak and didn't respond fast enough when it struck. Most disturbingly, the report describes the pediatric medical director of the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation as so disengaged that he didn't know how many children were infected, or what exactly his job entailed.

That doctor -- not named in the report -- admitted to inspectors that he was barely aware of the burgeoning crisis until it was well under way. "I knew we had a problem after the 4th death," he told inspectors, according to the report. But it took 5 more weeks -- and the deaths of 7 more children -- before one of the nation's deadliest long-term-care outbreaks was brought under control.

The deficiencies in leadership "contributed to the delay in identification and containment of [the] adenovirus outbreak, affecting 33 residents [and] one staff, and resulted in 11 pediatric resident deaths," the report said.

Adenoviruses typically cause only a cough, cold, conjunctivitis or urinary tract infection, but the strain that struck Wanaque -- adenovirus 7 -- was especially severe. And patients like the children at Wanaque, who relied on ventilators to breathe and, in many cases, tubes into their stomachs for nutrition, are particularly vulnerable.

No new cases of adenovirus have been reported at the center since [12 Nov 2018], but the state still bars new admissions to the pediatric ventilator unit, pending approval of the center's recently submitted infection-control plan. The center's administrator, Rowena Bautista, has challenged the findings of the report by staff from the New York regional offices of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, calling them "unfounded allegations".

"We are infuriated that, after a cursory review, federal surveyors put together a report riddled with factual inaccuracies, disregard of medical judgment, and blatant misstatements about how viruses spread," she said in a statement. The center has appealed the report's findings, she said, "and will vigorously dispute the allegations."

An infectious disease specialist hired by the center at the direction of the state Health Department said the "outbreak itself was unavoidable, and its scope and consequences were attributable to a particularly dangerous strain of virus that afflicted a very vulnerable population." The statement was issued by Dr Edward J McManus of Infectious Disease Care, a New Jersey practice with 40 physicians.

The 114-page federal report, written [17 Nov 2018], and the facility's plan of correction, written [31 Jan 2019], were obtained by NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey.

The inspectors visited the Wanaque center from [13 to 17 Nov 2018], at the peak of the outbreak. Thirty-three children had already been diagnosed, 11 had died and an unknown number were in area hospitals being treated. The inspectors wrote that everyone living at the Wanaque center -- not only those in the pediatric ventilator unit, but another 150 people -- was in "immediate jeopardy of contracting adenovirus infections, with the likelihood to cause serious harm, impairment, or death." The center has 92 beds for children and 135 for elderly residents.

The mere arrival of the federal team was unusual, experts said, because surveys of long-term-care facilities are usually delegated to the states. The state already had inspected multiple times and stationed a staff member from its communicable disease service at the center. The federal inspectors found 6 "immediate jeopardy" citations, denoting the highest level of concern for government regulators, whose agencies provide most of the revenues for long-term care. Such citations can result in termination from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs if not corrected, as these have been.

"That's an extremely high number of 'immediate jeopardies'," said Richard Mollett, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a non-profit based in New York that analyzes federal data and advocates for nursing home residents. Only 5 per cent of the deficiencies cited each year by nursing-home regulators rise to that level. The inspectors cited the Wanaque center's administration for systemic failings that went well beyond hand-washing and housekeeping.

By law, a nursing home medical director is required to oversee medical policies and procedures at the institution and coordinate residents' medical care. He is the clinician responsible for medical care at the center. When nurses notice a change in a patient's condition and need a doctor's orders to give Tylenol or antibiotics or transfer the patient to a hospital, they must call the patient's doctor. For the children at Wanaque, that doctor was the pediatric medical director. The doctor is not required to be physically present at the nursing home, even when the facility's residents include such medically fragile children as those at Wanaque.

His lack of involvement in the nursing home's operations resulted in one of the 6 immediate-jeopardy violations. Only 6 nursing homes in the United States received the same citation last year [2018]. It was not MG's 1st encounter with regulators. Last June [2018], MG settled an investigation by the Office of the State Comptroller's Medicaid fraud division into overbilling by his office by paying USD 42 000.

[According to the report above, there were serious observations on the facility's compliance with infection prevention and control requirements during a mandatory inspection, including adherence to hand hygiene practices before and after patient contact, or use of correct technique and proper use of personal protective equipment (https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/MMWRhtml/rr5116a1.htm).

The important lesson here is that implementation of guidelines and practices necessitates a commitment from institutional management at the highest level with implementation and continuous follow up by a dedicated leadership. Healthcare leadership must be orientated and trained for implementation of strict standards as well as development of response plans in case of outbreaks of healthcare associated infection. - Mod.UBA
