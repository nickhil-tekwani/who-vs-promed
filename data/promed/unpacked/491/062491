The Ohio Department of Health (ODH), working along with partners at the
Ottawa County Health Department, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), the Ohio EPA, Ohio Department of Agriculture, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, issued a preliminary report as to the
cause of a gastrointestinal illness outbreak in summer 2004.
The findings have identified widespread ground water contamination as the
mostly likely source of the illnesses. This came about through exhaustive
study of ill people who fit the case definition; extensive testing of many
water systems on the island; a study of the groundwater or aquifer on the
island; a review of past hydrological studies of the island and the
aquifers; and a case control study comparing sick people with their well
traveling companions.

[The preliminary report identified 1450 cases of gastrointestinal illness
in residents and visitors to South Bass Island from 23 Jul to 12 Sep 2004.
Infections included cases of campylobacteriosis, giardiasis, and norovirus
infection. A case control study found that cases were more likely than
controls to drink tap water on the island (matched odds ratio = 4.3, CI
2.2-9.3, p=0.000005) with a significant dose-response effect to tap water
consumption. Cases were also more likely than controls to have had any
drink on the island that contained ice (matched odds ratio = 7.1, CI
2.2-25.5, p=0.0002). No clear association of illness was found with any
lake or swimming pool exposure. The complete report can be found at above
