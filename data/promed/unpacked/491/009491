Officials from South Korea's agriculture ministry have confirmed a
new case of pig foot and mouth disease -- the first case since the start
of the World Cup football finals. The latest outbreak was confirmed at
a farm outside a tight control zone.
The authorities had previously confirmed 12 cases of the disease, but
the last incident had been recorded nearly 2 weeks ago.
The new outbreak is a big blow to South Korean officials. The
confirmation came just one day before the end of a 2-week period after
which the authorities could have declared South Korea free from the
virus.
Another worry is that the latest outbreak, at a farm at Pyongtaek City in
Kyonggi province, falls outside a quarantine zone set up to control the
outbreak. Pigs at the affected farm are being slaughtered and
disinfection efforts are being stepped up.
Agriculture officials were meeting on Mon 3 Jun 2002 to discuss other
measures to control the disease, including the slaughter of hogs within
a wider area and the possible vaccination of animals.
More than 110 000 pigs have been slaughtered since the first case of
foot and mouth was confirmed in early May [2002]. South Korean
officials are dismayed that the disease has re-appeared as the country
co-hosts the football World Cup and is welcoming hundreds of
thousands of visitors. The country has been pulling out all the stops to
present a tourist-friendly image. It may now have to devote more
energy to allaying fears about the disease, and stressing that football
fans are not at risk of carrying the disease as the stadiums are well
away from the contaminated areas.
