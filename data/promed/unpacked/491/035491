Five months after UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon promised to "use every opportunity" to push for funding to eliminate cholera from Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic, government officials in both nations are still waiting on donors to open their wallets. The feet-dragging comes as the rainy season begins and a new French study says the disease could quickly be eliminated from Haiti if investments are made to restrain transmissions.

"Cholera is only shrinking and has not yet disappeared. But it can disappear if the fight is correctly managed," said Dr Renaud Piarroux, who has studied the deadly waterborne disease in Haiti since it first appeared in October 2010. Piarroux's study first came to light last week [week of 22 Apr 2013] when Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe was asked at Columbia University about the government's plan to combat cholera. But he mischaracterized the report's findings when he stated that "cholera right now is disappearing" from Haiti and the country is seeing less than three cases a day. Lamothe's Ministry of Health statistics show an average of 150 cholera cases a day so far in 2013.

His comments triggered a debate in Haiti about whether the government was underplaying the seriousness of the epidemic. He later backed off the statement when asked by The Miami Herald for clarification. "This isn't a sign of cholera's disappearance, but rather its persistence and the reasons are simple -- funding for the cholera response has greatly declined, and the response capacity has therefore diminished," said Jake Johnston, international research associate and lead blogger on Haiti's relief and reconstruction for the Center for Economic and Policy Research. "This is now the 3rd year that funding for cholera has diminished prior to the rainy season when cases will predictably spike, leading to more easily preventable and unnecessary deaths," Johnston added.

Johnston said he isn't surprised by the UN's inability to mobilize funding to eradicate cholera in Haiti, where more than 654 000 have been sickened and more than 8100 have already died.

Doctors Without Borders and Partners in Health, a Boston-based medical aid group working in Haiti's Central Plateau, said while the number of people contracting cholera is down from the onset of the disease, too many Haitians continue to get sick -- and die -- from it. They agree with Piarroux that the low incidences of the disease in the dry season provides the opportunity to eradicate it.

"There is a sense that it's OK for people to be getting sick from a preventable disease," said Dr Louise Ivers of Partners in Health, which saw a spike in January and February 2013. "No deaths from cholera should be acceptable. We should be striving for zero deaths."

Two years after an independent panel of experts issued a report on Haiti's cholera outbreak, the UN has failed to implement many of its own recommendations, the group said. The report, commissioned by Ban, steered clear of placing blame for the outbreak but listed 7 recommendations to move forward. A spokesman for the UN secretary general said 5 of the 7 recommendations are being implemented. For example, additional wastewater treatment centers have been installed along with septic tanks and other sanitary measures at all UN camps in Haiti. Meanwhile, as the rains begin, Piarroux said it's important for Haiti to view eliminating cholera "as an emergency" issue.

[2] Strain mutations
Date: Tue 16 Apr 2013

The cholera strain that transferred to Haiti in 2010 has multiple toxin gene mutations that may account for the severity of disease and is evolving to be more like an 1800s version of cholera. The strain, "altered El Tor," which emerged around 2000, is known to be more virulent and to cause more severe diarrhea and dehydration than earlier strains that had been circulating since the 1960s. [A Northwestern Medicine] study reports the altered El Tor strain has acquired 2 additional signature mutations during the past decade that may further increase virulence. In addition, these newly discovered signature mutations documented in the study further link the Haitian cholera epidemic to the strain from Nepal. The paper was be published 16 Apr 2013 in the journal mBio.

The new study suggests the strain with multi-signature toxin gene mutations may trigger a unique pattern of infection accounting for the severity of disease noted during the Haiti cholera outbreak. "The cholera strain from the 1800s epidemic did the same thing," said Karla Satchell, the senior author of the paper and an associate professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. "That strain also modified its toxin genes and the cholera got worse."

Satchell has spent her career studying a single toxin of the bacterium that causes cholera, MARTX, which helps the bacteria block the body's immune defense so cholera can colonize the gut. She closely followed genomics research conducted to track the Haiti epidemic, curious to see how her toxin was affected. She was shocked to see it had completely mutated out of existence.

Satchell and colleagues analyzed publicly available genomic sequencing data and found this new cholera strain had accumulated some curious genetic changes during its global spread. First, the main cholera toxin that causes the diarrhea acquired genetic changes that converted the toxin to a form similar to that produced by strains prevalent during the historic cholera epidemics of the 1800s. Surprisingly, this new strain next acquired a genetic lesion that inactivated the MARTX toxin, previously recognized to be important for evading the immune system. A 3rd as yet uncharacterized genetic mutation in the cholera toxin followed, suggesting a mutation emerged in the cholera toxin to compensate for the loss of MARTX. These mutations occurring in the same strain indicate that the bacterium interacts differently with the immune system than previous strains.

"Perhaps this results in the bacterium more successfully evading early detection after a person accidentally drinks cholera infected fluids," Satchell said. "Interestingly, these multiple mutations in important proteins that specifically contribute to disease could explain why this strain is causing more severe disease, although the contribution of each mutation to human infection remains to be studied."

Previously published research on the Haiti cholera strain noted the change in the bacterium's DNA and tracked its origin to Nepal, but scientists didn't ask how the changes affected the bacterium's function. In addition, scientists had believed the bacterial strains responsible for the "new wave" of cholera that engulfed Haiti and first began spreading in 2000 were functionally identical to most other strains prevalent in the environment.

Satchell's finding further confirms the strain infecting Haiti likely originated in Nepal, consistent with the conclusion from the whole genome analysis and public health studies. Strains with this unique signature of a cholera toxin with 3 genetic changes coupled with loss of MARTX has spread only in a very defined geographical area including India where it was first detected in 2007. It has spread through Bangladesh, Cameroon, Nepal, and then into Haiti and the Dominican Republic in 2010. Even though other strains are nearly identical and barely distinguishable at the genetic level, only this very small group of isolates share this unique signature, verifying from a functional viewpoint that the strain that moved to Haiti likely originated in Nepal.

"What we discovered is that the bacterial strains responsible for the 'new wave' of cholera are not all functionally identical with minor modification as previously thought, nor are they similar to most other strains prevalent in the environment, but, in fact, the strain with multi-signature toxin gene mutations may instigate a unique pattern of infection accounting for the severity of disease noted during the Haiti cholera outbreak," Satchell said.

[As an introduction to MARTX, the following is the abstract of a review (with the citations removed) written by Dr Satchell (Satchell KJF: MARTX, multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin toxins. Infect Immun 2007; 75(11): 5079-84):

"The repeats-in-toxin (RTX) exoproteins are a diverse collection of proteins exported via type I secretion by Gram-negative bacteria. These proteins include the pore-forming RTX toxins typified by alpha-hemolysin of _E. coli_ and _Bordetella pertussis_ adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) and also secreted enzymes such as metalloproteases and lipases, S-layer proteins, a nodulation signaling factor, and the Fe-regulated FrpC "clip-and-link" toxin of _Neisseria meningitidis_.

In 1999, a new toxin from _Vibrio cholerae_ was discovered that was initially categorized in the RTX toxin family and simply named "the RTX toxin" or VcRtxA. This toxin is produced by nearly all clinical and environmental isolates of _V. cholerae_, including the El Tor O1 strains responsible for the current cholera pandemic plus a broad selection of O139 and non-O1/non-O139 strains. The toxin has been associated with increased epithelial cell damage in a mouse lung infection model and has also been associated with increased virulence in a mouse gut infection model, although its role in intestinal disease is currently unclear. Recently, a related toxin from _V. vulnificus_ has been described and found to be important for virulence in mouse models.

On-going study of the mechanism of action of the _V. cholerae_ toxin in vitro has revealed that it is a totally novel type of toxin with many features that distinguish it from other RTX toxins. In addition, release of genomic sequences from human, marine, and insect pathogens has indicated that the toxins from _V. cholerae_ and _V. vulnificus_ are not unique but rather are the first characterized members of a new family of the RTX exoproteins. Within this new family, the structural properties of the toxins are highly conserved, but the catalytic activities carried are predicted to vary since the toxins are assembled as mosaics of 10 activity domains assorted among the various toxins."

It is interesting that the absence of MARTX in the Haitian cholera strain seems to produce a more virulent strain. Another variant strain described by Nair, et al (1) from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Research in Bangladesh, was obtained from patients with cholera from the Matlab Hospital and they have been often referred to as the Matlab variants, containing characteristics of both El Tor and Classical biotypes.

Formally, the 2 established biotypes can be distinguished from one another by a number of properties including hemolysis of sheep red blood cells, agglutination of chicken red blood cells, the Voges-Proskauer reaction as well as susceptibility to polymyxin B and to biotype-specific viral bacteriophages. Nair, et al, described 3 Matlab types based on the hybrids of these phenotypic traits. A hybrid strain has also been found in Mozambique (2) which had genetic relatedness to the Matlab strains (3). Importantly, the Matlab variants have been shown to have all the necessary genes to initiate a pandemic (3). It is unclear to this moderator whether there is a relationship between the strains described genetically by Satchell and her colleagues and the Matlab variants.
