The Czech Republic recorded the highest number of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases in the EU last year [2018]. In the whole of Europe, only Russia recorded more cases of the potentially deadly disease.

There were 712 recorded TBE cases in the country last year [2018], the highest number since 2011, a Czech member of the International Scientific Working Group on TBE (ISW-TBE) said in a press release on Thursday [23 May 2019].

Only about one-quarter of inhabitants of the Czech Republic are vaccinated against TBE, a low percentage compared to other EU countries. Within the bloc, the 2nd-highest number of TBE cases was recorded in Germany, which has a population 8 times larger.

Encephalitis patients suffer from fever, headache, aching joints, and muscles. It can develop into meningitis.

[Given the large number of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus infection in the Czech Republic last year (2018), it seems curious that the above report makes no mention of preventive measures such as vaccination and avoidance to tick bites that could be taken currently to avoid infection. The TBE virus transmission season is beginning at this time. TBE virus is endemic in the Czech Republic, and cases occur there annually. A 2016 ProMED-mail post indicated that although Central and Eastern Europe countries are endemic for the European subtype of TBE virus and cases occur there yearly, cases have declined significantly in Austria and remain low in Germany, Poland, and Slovakia, while remaining high in recent years in the Czech Republic [see Tick-borne encephalitis - Czech Republic (02): background 20160210.4009410].

WHO has stated that "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious" (https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/).

TBE is a virus infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
