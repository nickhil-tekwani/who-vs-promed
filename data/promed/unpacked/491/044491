Highly drug-resistant gonorrhoea is spreading in the north of England with an outbreak centred in Leeds, sexual health doctors have told the BBC. 1 of the main treatments has become useless against the new strain of the sexually transmitted infection.

12 cases have been confirmed in Leeds and a further 4 have been reported in Macclesfield, Oldham and Scunthorpe. However, there are likely to be more undiagnosed cases.

The strain in this outbreak is able to shrug off the antibiotic azithromycin, which is normally used alongside another drug, ceftriaxone.

Peter Greenhouse, a consultant in sexual health based in Bristol, told the BBC News website: "This azithromycin-highly resistant outbreak is the first that has triggered a national alert. "It doesn't sound like an awful lot of people, but the implication is there's a lot more of this strain out there and we need to stamp it out as quickly as possible. If this becomes the predominant strain in the UK we're in big trouble, so we have to be really meticulous in making sure each of these individuals has all their contacts traced and treated."

The outbreak started in March [2015]. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV says all cases have been in heterosexuals and some have reported sexual partners from across England.

The disease is caused by the bacterium _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_. The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Of those infected, about 1 in 10 heterosexual men and more than 3/4 of women, and men who have sex with men, have no easily recognisable symptoms. But symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods. Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy.

Gonorrhoea is the 2nd most common sexually transmitted infection in England and cases are soaring. The number of infections increased by 19 percent from 29 419 in 2013 to 34 958 the following year [2014]. Dr Mike Gent from Public Health England said in a statement: "We can confirm investigations are under way. Those affected are being treated with an alternative antibiotic, but the resistance to 1st-line treatment remains a concern. The bacteria that cause gonorrhoea are known to mutate and develop new resistance, so we cannot afford to be complacent." He urged people to practise safe sex including the use of condoms.

The outbreak in Leeds adds to growing concern that gonorrhoea is becoming untreatable. In 2011, Japan reported a case of complete resistance to cephalosporin-class antibiotics, which included the main treatment ceftriaxone.

[The news report above tells of 12 cases of gonococcal disease due to a strain that is highly resistant to azithromycin in Leeds and an additional 4 cases have been reported in Macclesfield, Oldham and Scunthorpe in northern England. All cases have been in heterosexuals. However, we are not told the strains' minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of azithromycin or other antibiotics; whether all the strains have a matching genotype; the medical histories (e.g., prior recent antibiotic exposure) and epidemiological links of the affected individuals; or how the individuals were successfully treated. More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Emerging antimicrobial resistance has complicated treatment for gonorrhea. _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, the cause of gonorrhea, has developed resistance successively to sulfonamides, penicillin, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) and the extended-spectrum oral cephalosporin cefixime after each was introduced for treatment of gonorrhea.

Ceftriaxone, an injectable 3rd-generation cephalosporin, is the most effective cephalosporin for treatment of gonorrhea, but the percentage of _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates with elevated MICs to cephalosporins has been rising in the US (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6026a2.htm) and elsewhere. Because of the experience with other microbes that have developed antimicrobial resistance, combination therapy using 2 antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action has been recommended by the U.S. CDC to improve treatment efficacy and potentially delay emergence and spread of resistance to ceftriaxone.

The U.S. CDC recommends dual therapy with ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose for the treatment of gonorrhea. A single 2g dose of azithromycin has been used effectively to treat genitourinary infections caused by susceptible _N. gonorrhoeae_ (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6018a2.htm), but azithromycin monotherapy is not recommended for routine treatment of gonorrhea because of concerns regarding emerging resistance to azithromycin (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/760301).

The CDC defines decreased azithromycin susceptibility as an MIC of at least 2.0 mg/L and the percentage exhibiting decreased susceptibility to azithromycin has remained low in the U.S. (0.2 percent in 2006 to 0.3 percent in 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

Isolates with high MICs to azithromycin have been observed before: in San Diego, California in 2010 in a cluster of cases in men who have sex with men (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6018a2.htm); in England and Wales (Chisholm SA, Neal TJ, Alawattegama AB, Birley HD, Howe RA, Ison CA. Emergence of high-level azithromycin resistance in _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ in England and Wales. J Antimicrob Chemother 2009;64:353--8); and in Argentina (Galarza PG, Alcala B, Salcedo C, et al. Emergence of high level azithromycin-
resistant _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ strain isolated in Argentina. Sex Transm Dis 2009;36:787--8), where strains had azithromycin MICs of at least 8 mg/L.
