1st Bali rabies death from a cat bite
-------------------------------------
The following translation from local media has been provided by the
Bali Animal Welfare Association [BAWA]:

There are still suspected rabid cats
------------------------------------
Buleleng Animal Husbandry were shock by the news of the death a
student in Pemaron Village, Buleleng sub-district as a result of
rabies virus infection acquired from a cat. They didn't expected that
rabies could be transmitted by cats.

Wayan Tjarik, the head of Buleleng Animal Husbandry stated on [Sun 16
May 2010] that they found rabid dogs in Pemaron village and
surroundings. Therefore they had carried out vaccination of dogs in
the village on 3 occasions. And they had managed to cull 70 dogs.
"But yesterday I was shocked when I heard the news that a girl had
died as a result of rabies acquired from a cat," he said. According
to Tjarik, rabies could be spread by cats, as well as from dogs and
monkeys. However rabies deaths originating from cats and monkeys are
rare. Therefore Buleleng Animal husbandry along side with Bali
Province Animal Husbandry will conduct an investigation at Pemaron
village on Monday [17 May 2010].

If the death of the Pemaron villager was caused by a cat, there is a
possibility that other cats are infected by rabies [virus]. The cat
that bit the student was fighting with another cat. The student's
parent killed the cat immediately after the incident. However he is
concerned about his own pet cat, because the [rabid] cat had fought
with his daughter's pet cat. He admitted that there were 4-5 cats in
his house, all very tame. "I don't know whether they are all infected
with rabies." He said. [End of Translation].

It has been recorded officially that three months age a 13-year-old
Junior High School student, residing in Pemaron village, Buleleng
sub-district, died with rabies symptoms. Uniquely, the virus was
contracted from a cat. [While this is a bit confusing, information
from a Jakarta post article on this case mentions that the student
was bitten by the cat approximately 3 months prior to the onset of
her symptoms (see
<http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/17/first-rabies-fatality-buleleng.html).

Cats are relatively few in Bali, compared to dogs, because dogs
monopolize most of the food sources and habitat. However, cats have
their usual unique habitat niche, hunting rodents in places
inaccessible to dogs, and -- unlike dogs -- are commonly allowed
indoors. Most of the cats in Bali could probably be described as
half-tamed ferals, neither greatly fearful of humans nor easily petted.

Removing dogs from a habitat tends to open more territory to cats,
which usually replace dogs at a ratio of about 3 cats for every dog
who is no longer there. However, this phenomenon takes from several
months to a year to develop, and since the pace of dog-killing in
Bali lags behind the dog birth rate, my personal sense of the
situation is that both the dog and cat populations are still just
about what they were when the rabies outbreak began in mid-2008.

About half of the Bali dog population has now been vaccinated,
according to government sources, but most of the visible vaccination
work has been done by the Bali Animal Welfare Association, which
claims more modest numbers. BAWA is close to completing vaccinating
the 60 000-odd dogs of Gianyar regency and plans to move on to do the
same in Bangli regency.

So few cats have been vaccinated so far that the effective
vaccination rate could be considered by me to be just about zero.

The Pemaron Village (Buleleng district) student was the 50th death
reported by Bali media with the name and/or description of victim,
description of symptoms. [See the ProMED-mail post "Rabies, human -
Indonesia (03): (Bali) 20100514.1576" for details of the other 49
rabies victims. - Mod.CP]

This may have actually been the 79th death, counting reports of
deaths not identified by specific details that permit confirmation.
