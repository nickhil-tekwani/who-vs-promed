A student at Dalhousie University in Halifax has died after contracting meningococcal disease. Nova Scotia Public Health confirmed the death Friday [16 Dec 2022], adding that another student is recovering in hospital. Public Health says both students contracted the same strain of the bacteria called serogroup B and lived in the same Shirreff Hall residence.

No other details about the students have been released.

"At this time there is no indication of increased risk to the general public or the Dalhousie University community," said Dr. Cristin Muecke, regional medical officer of health, in a news release. "This form of bacterial meningitis is not spread through the air or casual contact, such as sitting next to or talking with someone who is sick with the disease."

Health officials say there is currently no known connection between the cases, other than both students lived in the same residence, though the spread is still under investigation. According to Public Health, officials have already identified and been in contact with individuals who may have been directly exposed to the infected students.

"According to Public Health guidelines, 2 cases of meningococcal disease with the same serogroup in one location over a short period of time is considered an institutional outbreak," said Nova Scotia Health in the release. "In response, Public Health will be holding vaccination clinics for the students and staff of Shirreff Hall this weekend."

The announcement from Public Health comes one day after parents in Westville were notified that a student at an elementary school received a confirmed diagnosis of "invasive" meningococcal disease. The letter to families noted that Public Health is not currently recommending that students at the Walter Duggan Consolidated School receive any medication or vaccine. Public Health indicated all close contacts of the student have been notified, adding that parents, teachers, and school administrators will be informed. Parents are encouraged to monitor their children for symptoms until midnight on 19 Dec [2022].

The bacteria in meningococcal disease are spread by direct secretions, like saliva or spit, and from the nose and mouth during activities like kissing and sharing food, drinks, eating utensils, and cigarettes.

Public Health warns there is no vaccine that protects against all strains of meningococcal disease. The province's publicly funded vaccine program currently provides meningococcal C vaccine at 12 months of age and quadrivalent meningococcal A, C, Y, W vaccine as part of the Grade 7 school immunization program.

"Currently, the meningococcal B vaccine is not part of the routine publicly funded vaccine program in Nova Scotia but is available to those who are identified as having close contact with a meningococcal case or are at higher risk of meningococcal disease," said Nova Scotia Health.

The outbreak at the Dalhousie University campus also comes one month after a student of Halifax's Saint Mary's University died from meningitis [https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/halifax-university-student-dies-from-suspected-case-of-meningococcal-meningitis-public-health-1.6145618].

[We are told in the news report above of a cluster of 2 confirmed cases of invasive meningococcal disease (i.e., meningococcal meningitis and/or meningococcemia) reported in students at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Both students were infected by serogroup B _Neisseria meningitidis_ and lived in the same residence hall but had no other known epidemiologic link.

In the United States, 95% of cases of invasive meningococcal disease are sporadic, each case unrelated to the other cases; meningococcal outbreaks account for only about 5% of reported cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following:

"All cases of meningococcal disease of the same serogroup should be included in the outbreak case count unless molecular typing indicates that the strain from a case is genetically different than the predominant outbreak strain. In outbreaks with well-defined risk groups, probable cases may be included as outbreak-associated even if they are unable to be confirmed or serogrouped.

"The outbreak threshold for vaccine decision-making should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the following general guidance:
- Organization-based outbreak: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period;
- Community-based outbreak: Multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period."
(https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf)

The news report above tells of another college student at Halifax's Saint Mary's University that died from meningococcal meningitis one month ago. We are not told the serogroup involved in the Saint Mary's University case or any epidemiologic linkage to the Dalhousie cases. Dalhousie and St. Mary's Universities are within 1.5 km [0.9 mi] of each other.

Antibiotics should be recommended for close contacts of the 2 Dalhousie cases to prevent disease. Vaccinating people identified as being at increased risk is done in the setting of an outbreak.

Halifax (pop. 439 819 residents in 2019) is the capital and largest city in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, and the largest city in Atlantic Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia).

More information from knowledgeable sources concerning these cases of invasive meningococcal disease would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
