Push to wipe out stripe rust in NSW wheat
-------------------------------------
New South Wales agronomists and wheat breeders are leading a push to wipe
out stripe rust, so it doesn't affect next season's crop. The state's wheat
growers are dealing with the worst case of stripe rust in history, which is
expected to significantly affect crop yields. Test control strips are being
sprayed with a fungicide in an attempt to reduce spores drifting and
spreading the disease.
Agronomist Bill Adams says safeguards need to be investigated now, to avoid
more crop devastation next season. There are a few new strains of the
fungus following on the Western Australian pathotype that appeared last
year. The disease is certainly going into more tolerant varieties than what
[had been] thought.

[Wheat stripe rust (also known as yellow rust or glume rust) is caused by
_Puccinia striiformis_f. sp. _tritici_ [Ps]. It is a major problem of
wheat grown in cooler climates and at high elevations in Australia. As with
rust diseases in general, Ps reduces plant vigour, limits seed maturing in
adult plants, and is most damaging just before or during flowering. It is
different from other rusts in that it does not have a sexual stage nor does
it require an alternate host to complete its life cycle. The only spore
form on wheat is the urediospore. Ps infects over 18 genera of grasses
including rye and barley in addition to wheat. Of particular significance
is that many perennial grass species can serve as reservoir hosts for Ps,
thus providing a ready supply of inoculum. Crop losses of 40 percent are
not uncommon, and some fields can be totally destroyed. Disease management
utilizes resistant cultivars, control of volunteer wheat and seeding dates,
and applications of recommended chemical fungicide sprays.
