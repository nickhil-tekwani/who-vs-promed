Rabbit hemorrhagic disease [RHD], New Zealand
---------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 15 May 2018 from Dr Tony Zohrab, Policy and Trade Branch, Ministry for Primary Industries, Wellington, New Zealand

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 6 Apr 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 12 May 2018
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
Serotype: RHDV2
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Awatere Valley, Marlborough
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Apr 2018
Outbreak status: resolved 14 May 2018
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
European rabbit: _Oryctolagus cuniculus_ (Leporidae) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: one death adult European rabbit.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: a dead wild rabbit tested as part of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) monitoring was found to be positive for rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2). This is the 1st case of RHDV2 detected in New Zealand. The Czech strain of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 1 has been present in New Zealand since 1997. The Korean or K5 variant of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 1 (RHDV1-K5) was released as a biological control agent in New Zealand in March 2018 (refer to OIE immediate notification dated [on 4 Apr 2018]).

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type/Species / Test / Test date / Result
Manaaki Whenua-Landcare Research, Lincoln, New Zealand (private laboratory) / European rabbit / gene sequencing / 27 Apr 2018 / Positive
Manaaki Whenua-Landcare Research, Lincoln, New Zealand (private laboratory) / European rabbit / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 20 Apr 2018 / Positive
Australian animal health laboratory, Geelong, Australia (regional reference laboratory) / European rabbit / gene sequencing / 12 May 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHDV is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _O. cuniculus_.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes. K5 is a Korean strain of RHDV1 released in Australia and New Zealand for rabbit control. RHDV2 had not been detected in New Zealand before. This strain was identified in a rabbit from Australia in May 2015. RHDV2 (also called RHDVb) was first described in outbreaks in France in 2010, then in Italy and Spain in 2011, and in Portugal from 2012 onwards. The virus is a genetically and antigenically distinct variant of RHDV that is able to partially overcome immunity to classical strains of RHDV. - Mod.PMB
