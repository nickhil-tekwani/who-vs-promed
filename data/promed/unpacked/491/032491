3 farms in far south Georgia, USA ordered eggs or chicks from an Iowa farm that initially showed no signs of avian influenza, but later tested positive. State veterinarian Dr. Robert Cobb says late last week, the USDA [US Department of Agriculture] alerted Georgia and 36 other states of the possibility that the birds had been exposed. Cobb dispatched teams Tuesday [16 Jun 2015] to seize and slaughter those flocks. "We are depopulating all their poultry so that there will be no birds present, no eggs present on any of these premises," says Cobb, "ensuring that just in case any of ours were to have come [into contact] with these poultry that they are no longer here."

The USDA will reimburse the owners with an agreed-upon price which Cobb says is fair. "We have worked out an agreement to pay them for their poultry," says Cobb. Dr. Cobb says as the nation's top poultry producer, Georgia has never had bird flu, and they are working to keep it that way. "It's important that everybody knows that this is not a food safety issue," says Cobb. "Any positive poultry that is identified is destroyed and it does not enter the food chain." He adds that the current strain of the influenza virus causing the outbreak in the Midwest, H5N2, is not infectious to humans.* It's spread by wild waterfowl, so Cobb says anyone who has chickens, ducks, or any poultry should stay away from those wild birds.

*[This is not quite true. Poultry farm workers in Japan in 1996 were found to have H5N2 antibody (see 2006 ProMED archive below) -- but there have been no reports of any other human infections anywhere since then. - Mod.JW

[This is likely the same scenario we saw in Arizona. These may be birds that left the original flock in Iowa that was positive. These birds leaving the flock or origin are called trace outs -- they trace where animals went out from the original flock.

Given the tenacity of this virus, this proactive move may be prudent. - Mod.TG
