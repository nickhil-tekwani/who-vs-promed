More cases of _E. coli_ [O157] have now been confirmed in connection to a dairy farm in Lebanon, CT. The Connecticut Department of Public Health now says that 41 people have been diagnosed with _E. coli_ after visiting the Oak Leaf Dairy Farm in March 2016. The patients range in age from 9 months to 45 years old, with a median age of 5. Of the 41 patients, 8 are adults and the other 34 are under the age of 18. Of those under 18, 22 are under the age of 5.

Of those who were diagnosed with _E. coli_, 10 were hospitalized, and one remains in the hospital. Also, 3 of the hospitalized patients were also determined to have hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a rare but serious illness that affects the kidneys and blood clotting. The one child still hospitalized has HUS.

Besides the Department of Public Health, the Department of Agriculture and the CDC are also investigating the outbreak. The farm is closed as it cooperates with the investigation. So far, evidence from the investigation, which will last several more weeks, indicates that the illnesses were not related to food or other items sold at the farm, such as milk or cheese -- which are both pasteurized before being sold -- caramels, lip balms, soaps, or salves.

Those who visited the farm between 6 and 20 Mar 2016 were at risk, and symptoms were first felt as early as 7 Mar 2016.

[If the foodborne route of transmission is ruled out, then it is likely that direct contact with goats whose coat has been fecally contaminated with the pathogen or from a contaminated environment occurred. A water fountain could also be the source. ProMED continues to wait for additional information.

With an inoculation period longer than most enteric pathogens, as long as 12-14 days, EHEC outbreaks can occur over a longer period but should end after the incubation period is exceeded, in this case 12-14 days after the farm was closed. Secondary household cases, usually from child to child, can prolong the outbreak however. - Mod.LL
