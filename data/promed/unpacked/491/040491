Confirmed rabies cases in Grey-Bruce continue to decline
--------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Natural Resources [MNR] forecasts that cases will
continue to drop for the next 3 to 5 years, the province's timeline
to virtually eliminate the viral disease in Ontario, Canada. A total
of 4 skunks and one fox have tested positive for rabies so far this
year [2009] in Grey-Bruce, according the Grey Bruce Health Unit.
Year-to-year cases fell 66 percent from 2006 to 2008.

In Ontario, confirmed cases fell from 1870 when the MNR introduced a
rabies vaccine baiting program in 1989 to 79 in 2008, a 95.8 percent
decrease. "With this bait and the technology that we're using, we
feel that elimination is a possibility, so we'll work toward a number
of zero," said Dennis Donovan, the MNR's rabies unit co-ordinator.

Bats carrying the virus will continue to fly into Ontario, he said,
but the MNR's goal is to eliminate rabies in terrestrial mammals such
as fox, raccoon and skunk. 2 years without a confirmed case are
required for the World Health Organization to declare the province
"rabies free," Donovan said.

Rabies, which is fatal without treatment, is transmitted by the
saliva of infected animals, especially through bites. Bats, foxes,
raccoons and skunks are the most common transmitters. Each year, an
MNR de Havilland airplane flies over southern Ontario, dropping
khaki-green vaccine baits in rural areas. The sugary baits, which
smell like marshmallows, are devoured by mammals, which become
vaccinated against the virus. About 1.3 million baits will be dropped
in southern Ontario this year, part of a CAD 5.3 million [USD 4 788
000] program to eradicate the virus in the province.

The aircraft will leave a Stratford airfield on 14 Sep 2009 for a
week-long vaccine-drop in the Grey-Bruce region. Areas that have had
confirmed cases of rabies, such as Teeswater and Hepworth, will
receive a higher concentration of bait, Donovan said. A newly
developed bait will be dropped this year that has been proven to
effectively vaccinate fox, skunk and raccoon. Older baits were not
effective in skunks. Karen Sweiger, rabies program manager with the
Grey Bruce Health Unit, said the MNR's baiting program has been one
of the "biggest keys" in the sharp reduction in Ontario's rabies
cases. Public education aimed at encouraging people to vaccinate
their pets and stay away from wild or odd-acting animals have also
contributed, she said.

"It's tremendous, the amount of reduction in the number of rabies
cases we've seen in the area," she said Friday [14 Aug 2009].
Confirmed human cases of rabies in Ontario is extremely rare. Sweiger
said 52 people were vaccinated against the virus, as a precaution,
last year, down from 76 in 2008 [?error in newswire, ?2007, or ?2006
- Mod.MPP]. Post-exposure treatment is administered when a person has
been bitten or has come into contact with the saliva of a potentially
rabid animal that cannot be quarantined. Donovan said despite the
drop in rabies cases, people should continue to keep their pets'
vaccinations up to date and stay clear of wildlife. Rabid animals
exhibit signs such as extreme excitement and aggressiveness and tend
to froth at the mouth and bite anything.

[The following information has been extracted frm the APHIS website
at: <http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ws/rabies/vaccine.html>. Oral rabies
vaccination (ORV) has been under field investigation in the United
States since 1990, in Canada since 1985 and in Europe since 1980.
Currently, there are 15 states distributing oral vaccines for
raccoons in the U.S., while Texas distributes baits for gray fox and
coyote. There have been nearly 48 million doses of Raboral V-RG
distributed in the U.S. and Canada, and 63 million doses have been
dispersed worldwide. Raboral V-RG is currently the only effective
oral vaccine licensed for use in free-ranging raccoons, gray foxes,
and coyotes in the United States. [More recently recombinant
adenovirus vaccines have been developed and tested successfully in
Canada. - Mod.CP]

V-RG is a recombinant vaccine made from a living pox virus vector,
vaccinia (V), that carries the rabies antigen in the form of rabies
glycoprotein (RG). The rabies glycoprotein is the protective sheath
that surrounds the rabies virus and elicits an immune response when
swallowed by raccoons, gray foxes, or coyotes. The vaccine cannot
cause rabies because it contains only the non-infective surface
proteins of the rabies virus, not the viral nuclear material which
would be necessary for the virus to replicate and cause an infection.

The outer bait matrix is made from fishmeal (for raccoons and
coyotes) or dog food (for gray foxes) combined with a polymer that
acts as a binding agent. The vaccine packet, or sachet, resembles a
small catsup package but contains about 1.5 ml of vaccine. The sachet
is inside the bait matrix and waxed into place so it does not fall
out during aerial delivery. As the raccoon, gray fox, or coyote eats
through the outer bait matrix, the inner sachet gets punctured
allowing vaccine to enter the animal's mouth and coat the lymphatic
tissue in the throat. There is an immune response to the rabies
antigen which creates antibodies to fight off the disease. After 2 to
3 weeks the "blueprint" to create rabies antibodies exists in the
animal's immune system which can easily be created should the animal
be exposed to a rabid animal.

Baits are distributed by airplanes in rural areas and by hand in
urban and suburban areas. Airplanes fly in straight lines or
"transects" at about 500 feet above ground while distributing baits.
The bait distribution machine is controlled from the airplane and is
turned off when crossing a road or house to avoid human contact with
the bait. Baiting by hand is done in urban and suburban areas to get
the best chance to vaccinate an animal while decreasing human contact
with baits.
