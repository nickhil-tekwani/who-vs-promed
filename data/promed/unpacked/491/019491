Stonefruit growers in Australia have been warned that the fungal disease brown rot could affect their orchards due to the recent humid weather.

Brown rot affects cherry, peach, apricot, and nectarine crops and costs the Victorian stonefruit industry an average of AUD 19 million [about USD 13.5 million] every year. The disease strikes stonefruit when wet weather occurs during flowering or pre-harvest, reducing fruit set and potential yield.

The Bureau of Meteorology issued a warning to stonefruit growers in the Mallee [SA and VI] and Wimmera [VI] districts, advising that rainfall and high humidity may spark a brown rot outbreak.

[Brown rot caused by fungal species in the genus _Monilinia_ is a major disease of stone and pome fruit and has also been reported to affect grapevine. Symptoms may include blossom blight, twig dieback, and fruit rot (before and after harvest). Disease development is favoured by moist conditions.

The fungi can be spread by mechanical means (including insect activity), contaminated orchard tools and with plant material. They overwinter in mummified fruit on the ground or remaining on trees, or in twig cankers. During the crop cycle, primary infection leads first to blossom and shoot blight, then secondary infection from these sources is the main cause of fruit rot. Early maturing crop varieties are less susceptible. Disease management may include orchard sanitation and fungicide treatments in orchards or post-harvest, but pathogen resistance is emerging in some areas.
