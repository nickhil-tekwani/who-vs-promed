Nature authority seeks permission to shoot stray dogs
-----------------------------------------------------
On instructions from Environmental Protection minister, Gilad Erdan,
the authorities have long refrained from shooting stray dogs that
found their way into parks and nature reserves. But last month [July
2010], the Israel Nature and Parks Authority [INPA] asked the
minister to approve new, interim regulations allowing strays to be
shot under certain circumstances. The ministry said Erdan has yet to
either approve or deny the request.

For years, INPA inspectors habitually shot strays, both to prevent
them from hunting wildlife and out of concern that they might have
rabies. But Erdan ordered this practice stopped. He told the INPA to
set new rules for determining when shooting is necessary, explore
alternative methods for containing the stray population, and take
steps to ensure that no pets that have run away from home end up being shot.

But since the ban on shooting took effect, there have been several
incidents of stray dog packs attacking endangered wildlife, including
one attack on a herd of rare fallow deer in the Jerusalem hills.
Following that attack, the INPA halted its program to reintroduce the
species to the wild -- one of its flagship programs for returning
captive species to nature.

This year [2010] has also seen a substantial rise in the incidence of
rabies [see item 2 and commentary below].

The proposed new regulations would allow authorized INPA inspectors
to shoot stray dogs in the interest of containing rabies in national
parks, nature reserves, and any other open area where wildlife
species are considered at risk. But strays would not be shot unless
their presence poses an immediate, discernible risk to wildlife, and
never within 1 km [0.6 mi] of human habitation.

[The trend observed since 2009, namely a striking increase in
dog-mediated rabies in north-east Israel, has been continuous during
2010. The number of animal rabies cases, during 2009 (whole year) and
2010 (8 months), is almost as high as the figures in 2003, the year
during which implementation of fox-targeted oral vaccination
programme (ORV), earlier implemented on limited and steadily growing
scale, was extended to cover most parts of Israel.

There is, though, significant difference between rabies epidemiology
in 2003 and 2009/2010: while in 2003 (and earlier), the disease was
present in vast parts of the country (map at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2003.html>), involving
predominantly foxes (45, compared to 15 dogs and not a single jackal
during 2003), the 2009/2010 outbreak is practically restricted to
north eastern Israel, bordering Syria and Jordan (2009 map at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2009.html>; 2010 map at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2010.html>), involving
mainly canids (January 2009-August 2010: 46 dogs, 17 jackals, only 3
foxes). Indeed, Syria, Jordan, and other countries in the Middle
East, are long known to be infected by dog-mediated rabies, and do
not apply oral vaccination.

The background to the unfortunate development in NE Israel, where
stray dogs and jackals have become the predominant rabies vectors,
can be explained by the results of investigations carried out by the
Kimron Veterinary Institute during 2004-2007. Rabies virus isolates
from foxes and dogs were found to differ in their molecular
characterization, suggesting 2 distinct separate lineages (see
reference below). The transition from fox-mediated to dog-mediated
rabies, combined with the high prevalence of canine rabies in
neighbouring countries and deficient (in fact, disturbed) control of
stray dogs, is of great concern to public health because of the close
contact between dogs and the human population.

It seems also that the initial success of the ORV led to complacency
regarding vaccination of kept dogs. Jackals, unlike foxes, seem to be
susceptible to the same virus lineage as dogs.

Implementing ORV in a single country within a rabies-stricken region
lacking efficient control systems is liable to difficulties. This was
predicted by experts during the 1990's, indicating the vital need for
coordinated regional effort.
