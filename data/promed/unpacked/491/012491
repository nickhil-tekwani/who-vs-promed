More than 200 people in the United States and Canada have become ill from
salmonella traced to unpasteurized orange juice in the past month, U.S.
health officials said Thursday.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC said there had been 207
confirmed cases of illness since June 19, including 21 that required
hospitalization.
"There have been confirmed cases reported by 15 states and two Canadian
provinces," said Ellen Steinberg, a medical epidemiologist in the foodborne
and diarrheal diseases branch of the CDC's National Center for Infectious
Diseases.
She said researchers were investigating another 91 cases of illness caused
by the same type of salmonella to determine if they were linked to the
unpasteurized orange juice.
Most of the cases were in Oregon, Washington, and California, the CDC said.
The Food and Drug Administration [FDA issued a nationwide health warning on
10
Jul 1999 against drinking frozen and liquid unpasteurized orange juice
distributed under a variety of names by Sun Orchard Inc. of Tempe, Ariz.
Sun Orchard had already recalled the products voluntarily and announced it
now pasteurizes all of its juice products.
The CDC and the FDA said the illnesses were caused by _Salmonella muenchen_,
an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young
children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems.
The CDC estimates that 800 000 to 4 million cases of salmonellosis occur in
the United States every year, resulting in about 500 deaths.
Symptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps that
develop within days of infection and last up to a week. Most people recover
without treatment.
