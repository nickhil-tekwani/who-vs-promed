Tickborne encephalitis outbreak in Estonia linked to raw goat milk,
May-June 2005
--------------------------------------------------
In May and June 2005, 27 cases of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) were
reported to the Estonia Tervisekaitseinspektsioon (Health Protection
Inspectorate). All the cases occurred in 2 administrative territories:
Tallinn city and Harju county. Of the 27 patients was 15 were female and 12
were male, and their ages ranged between 4 and 69 years.

The dates of symptom onset ranged from 9 May to 1 June. 15 patients had
influenza-like symptoms (fever and/or headache); 4 patients reported
vomiting and 8 patients were admitted to hospital with neurological symptoms.

A total of 24 patients were admitted to hospital. All clinical cases were
laboratory confirmed, and no deaths have been reported. None of the
patients had been vaccinated against TBE, and none of them reported being
bitten by ticks before symptom onset.

Based on the results of the descriptive epidemiological investigation, all
cases were associated with consumption of raw (unpasteurised) goat milk
that had been offered to customers to taste at a supermarket in Tallinn on
7 and 8 May 2005 as part of promotion.

Serum specimens of 5 goats from the private breeding farm that supplied the
milk were investigated for TBE virus neutralisation by the virology
department of Smittskyddsinstitutet (the Swedish Institute for Infectious
Disease Control) in Stockholm, Sweden. The results showed that one goat was
clearly positive for TBE infection, and one goat showed borderline
neutralisation.

encephalitis outbreak linked to raw goat milk, Estonia, May -June 2005.

Information about the outbreak was disseminated to ministries of health and
public health institutes throughout Europe via the Early Warning and
Response System (EWRS), in order to seek information on TBE cases in
tourists who may have visited a supermarket in Tallinn and tasted raw goat
milk. No additional cases in other countries have yet been identified.

Other recent outbreaks of tickborne encephalitis associated with the
consumption of raw goat and cow milk notified in Estonia include:
-1990: household outbreak involving 3 family members
-1992: outbreak involving 10 military recruits
-2004: household outbreak involving 3 family members and one guest.

The milkborne route of transmission for TBE infection has been recognised
since at least the 1950s [1-4].

[Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is endemic and a notifiable disease in
Estonia. TBE is also known as spring-summer encephalitis, as risk of
acquiring the disease is greatest from April through August, when _Ixodes
ricinus_, the principal tick vector, is most active. Human infections
follow bites of infected _I. ricinus_ ticks, usually in people who visit or
work in forests, fields, or pastures. Other risk factors include
consumption of unpasteurized dairy products from infected cows, goats, or
sheep. In this report, all the 27 cases (laboratory confirmed) were
associated with consumption of raw (unpasteurized) goat milk alone. No tick
bites were involved. So far no deaths have been reported in this outbreak.
TBE is normally preventable by vaccination. In the current outbreak, none
of the patients had been vaccinated. TBE has a fatality rate of 1 per cent
and serious neurologic sequelae of 30 per cent. - Mod.RY]
