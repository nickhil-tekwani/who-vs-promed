CJD-INFECTED CELL CULTURE MEDIA RECALL
**************************************
[The following is a lightly edited copy of what appeared in late 1996 on
the BIOSAFTY
(sic) list <BIOSAFTY@MITVMA.MIT.EDU>, as stumbled across in the archives
of the
ACDF-L: the Animal Cell Discussion Forum (-List)

> Is anyone aware of a customer notice by Becton Dickinson (Collaborative
> Biomedical Products) that certain lots of their human transferrin
> contains plasma units from a donor who later was diagosed to have
> Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
>
> Becton Dickinson is not recalling the transferrin and is not even
> recommending that the lots not be used. They recommend the application
> of Universal Precautions.
>
> The phone number for technical service at BD is 800-343-2035.
>
> At my insitution we are recommending that reserchers not use the
> indicated lots, that they clean surfaces with a 2.5% bleach solution and
> that they determine if they have already used any of the potentially
> contaminated lots.
>
> I would be interested to know if anyone else is also addressing this.

> Mass General and Brigham & Women's Hospitals in Boston received a recall
from
> Irvine, a media supplier recalling their lots containing the contaminated
> transferrin. The transferrin was supplied to them by Bayer who informed
their
> customers. Irvine has recommended recipients quarantine the media and send a
> notarized claim for refund. Clearly Irvine is far more responsible than
other
> suppliers. We received a list of all customers who got the media and have
> contacted them with the suggestion that they stop using it immediately.

> On the other hand no one knows whether CJD is transmitted through
> physical contact. It seem unlikely. All the evidence indicates that
ingestion

> 2. A general announcement to research laboratories which use media products
> labeled "FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY", (such as the B-D product.). I agree with
