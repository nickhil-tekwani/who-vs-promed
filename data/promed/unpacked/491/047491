The Spot of Garibaldi, Oregon is voluntarily recalling ALL canned salmon and tuna with any codes starting with "OC" because it has the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.

Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, can cause the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double-vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension, and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

All products were sold to consumers from our retail store in Oregon. The last date of distribution of recalled products was September 2015. Affected production codes include any codes starting with "OC". The code can be found on either at the bottom or on top of the can. Recalled products are packaged in metal cans with net weight 6 oz. for salmon or 8 oz. for tuna.

Product Name / Net Weight / Best By Date Range
Spot-On Chinook Salmon / 6 oz. / No
Spot-On Tuna / 8 oz. / No
Spot-On Tuna No Salt / 8 oz. / No
Spot-On Garlic Tuna / 8 oz. / No
Spot-On Jalapeno Tuna / 8 oz. / No
Spot-On Smoked Tuna / 8 oz. / No

There have been no reported cases of illnesses associated with the products to date.

The Spot canned seafood products were made by Skipanon Brand Seafoods LLC, and this voluntary recall was initiated after we were notified that that our products were possibly under-processed. The problem was discovered during an inspection at Skipanon Brand Seafoods LLC by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Consumers who have purchased recalled canned seafood products are urged to destroy or return them to the firm for a full refund.

[This recall is for canned seafood produced by the same manufacturer involved in Botulism - USA (13): canned seafood, risk, recall 20151013.3712452.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
