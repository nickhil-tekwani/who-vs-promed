Georgia sees more anthrax cases
-------------------------------
At least 30 people in Georgia have contracted anthrax this year [2012], prompting authorities to step up safety measures, medical officials said Friday [22 Jun 2012]. Georgia's Center for Infectious Diseases said that by year's end the ex-Soviet nation is expected to roughly match last year's total of 59 cases. That would represent a marked increase from the 28 anthrax cases the Caucasus Mountains country had in 2010.

Naira Gogebashvili, a leading expert of a Tbilisi clinic treating infectious diseases, said some of the patients contracted anthrax due to violations of safety procedures regarding the burial of sick animals. "They should be buried in specially allocated ground, not in accidental places as it often happens," she told The Associated Press.

One of the hospital's patients, AA, a 58-year-old resident of the town of Tsalka in southern Georgia, contracted anthrax while cultivating a potato field. "I rubbed my hand and after several hours I saw that it's covered with sores," he said. "It turned out that a cow that died of anthrax was buried nearby. They conducted a check and found out it was buried not deeply enough."

Most of the cases this year have been registered in eastern Georgia near the border with Azerbaijan, but the infection has spread to other regions as well.

DK, 49, a resident of the village of Lemshveniera in the Gardaban region that borders Azerbaijan, said he got sick after helping a neighbor to [butcher] a dead cow. "We had no idea that the cow had anthrax," he said, showing his arms still covered with sores. He said that authorities quickly vaccinated all cows in the region following several anthrax cases.

[Georgia had 81 human cases in 2011, with one death, and the total human cases this year, as of last week was 41, not 30 as reported by Fox News.

Human cutaneous cases from exposure to contaminated soil is really rare. The problem in this case is that if there is extensive extravasation of blood from a bovine carcass, the surrounding soil can be severely contaminated; the same if the animal has been butchered outside in a field. When the animal's grave is dug and filled, this contaminated soil gets dumped on top of the carcass and thus near the surface, or at the surface if the grave is shallow.

In Soviet days the authorities regularly reported human cutaneous cases from soil but this followed from their mode of criminal investigation after human cases were reported to the authorities. It was illegal to "shade-tree" butcher carcases and could result in prison time if found guilty. So such folk would insist that no animals had died and that they had been innocently hoeing cabbages or picking potatoes when they got infected. - Mod.MHJ
