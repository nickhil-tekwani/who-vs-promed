[Tularemia is largely confined to the northern hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the southern hemisphere.

_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread through contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. Tularemia cases in hares are also more common in the same counties where increased numbers of human cases are reported. A geographical correlation between cases of tularemia in hares and cases in humans has been observed. - Mod.PMB
