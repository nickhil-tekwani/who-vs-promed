An alert has been sounded over an outbreak of a disease said to have
attacked this year's maize seed crop. A Kenya Plant Health Inspection
Service official said the disease, known as gray leaf spot, had affected the
seed crop in the major maize-growing districts, and possibly the commercial
crop as well.
Aldai MP Kiptum Choge claimed that maize seed in the Rift Valley had been
infected, and warned of crop failure in the next season if urgent measures
were not taken by the Ministry of Agriculture. He said farmers were likely
to incur losses if the seeds were not withdrawn, adding that seeds should be
imported from South Africa to avert a food crisis. Many producers, he said,
had resorted to planting untreated maize since seed companies had become
unreliable and the cost of seeds unaffordable.
Participants at the two-day workshop called on the government to fund
research on crop varieties that were high-producing and disease-resistant.
The cost of seeds should also be subsidised, they said.
Rift Valley Provincial Commissioner Francis Baya said of the 1.4 million
bags of maize produced in the country, 500 000 were from Rift Valley.

[According to Ward et al., 1999 Gray leaf spot, a disease of global
importance in maize production. Phytopathology 83:884-895, gray leaf spot
caused by the fungus _Cercospora zeae-maydis_, is one of the most
significant
yield-limiting diseases of maize worldwide. First reported in 1924, it
poses a serious threat to maize production in the major maize-producing
regions of the USA and Africa. It has become pandemic in Africa following
its appearance in Kwazulu Natal, South Africa in 1988. The disease is also
reported to occur in Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Trinidad, Costa Rica, Mexico,
Venezuela, and China.
Disease induction is highly dependent on high humidity, and disease
management is difficult once the pathogen is established. Development of
high-yield, locally adapted gray leaf spot tolerant hybrids is probably the
best way to manage the disease. Gray leaf spot disease is particularly
significant because maize is the principal food staple for the indigenous,
rural populations of Africa, threatening food security in many African
countries. - Mod.DH]
