Sydney and Beijing flu, the two strains of the disease prevalent this
year, appear to be spreading down from Scotland, where doctors began
to notice a sharp rise from mid-November. The latest regional figures
-- issued on Christmas Eve [25 Dec 1998] show there were 113 cases
per 100 000 in the North, 103 per 100 000 in the Midlands and 41 per
100 000 in the South.
Officially there is no flu epidemic until more than 400 cases per
100 000 of the population are confirmed to have the disease in a
given week. Flu levels this year are following a similar pattern to
those in the winter of 1996-97, when they peaked at 230 cases.

This year the level on December 15 was just 28 cases per 100 000 but
by New Year's Eve it had almost quadrupled to 102 per 100 000. The
next set of figures is expected to show a further rise.
Although flu levels are not abnormally high, health trusts are
reporting emergency units at full stretch dealing with an influx of
patients brought in by ambulance. Dr Doug Fleming, who heads the
Royal College of General Practitioners' infectious diseases
monitoring unit in Birmingham, said: 'Hospitals are the wrong place
for flu patients. There is no curative treatment for flu and there is
no point in going to see your doctor let alone going to hospital
unless you have a serious chest disease or are elderly and living on
your own. Going to hospital puts other sick people at risk so it is
an irresponsible and selfish thing to do.'

Perhaps because GPs are only sending the most serious cases to
hospital, patients are short-circuiting their doctors' waiting rooms
and trying to get themselves admitted. This adds to the difficulties
that accident and emergency units are already facing in finding
adequate staff and leads to many really ill people being left for
hours on trolleys.

Widespread outbreaks of flu, packed casualty departments, patients
left on trolleys, and a freezer lorry hired as a mortuary obscured a
UKL 159 million package of innovative schemes, mostly designed to
treat elderly patients at home rather than at overstrained hospitals,
Scenes of chaos caused by Christmas staff shortages [were] compounded
by the three strains of flu sweeping the country. [The Sydney and
Beijing strains of influenza A, and influenza B - Mod.JW]
Flu outbreaks appeared to be spreading south from the West Midlands
and the North-west, where ambulance calls have gone from 550 a day
to more than 1000. Greater Manchester Ambulance Service handled 1500
emergency calls in one day -- more than double the normal figure.

The Association for Influenza Monitoring and Surveillance predicted
that eight out of 10 homes in the Norfolk area will be hit by flu,
colds or coughs in the coming weeks. All non-urgent surgery has been
cancelled, a measure also taken in Cardiff, Swansea and East
Glamorgan, where emergency admissions last week were 50 per cent
above normal.

Medical chiefs confirmed that the outbreak had spread across the West
Midlands and that at one Wolverhampton hospital more than 100 people
waiting for specific treatment were put on stand-by as doctors tried
to cope with flu sufferers.
