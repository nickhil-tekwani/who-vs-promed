A 3-year-old boy was confirmed to have contracted H7N9 avian influenza virus infection in south China's Guangdong Province on Tuesday [5 Nov 2013]. The child, a native of Sichuan Province living in a village in Guangdong's Dongguan City, tested positive for the virus by the Provincial Disease Prevention and Control Center, said a statement issued by the Center.

The boy is receiving treatment at the People's Hospital of Dongguan City, and is in stable condition, the statement said.

This is the 3rd H7N9 avian influenza case reported this autumn in China, following 2 cases in Zhejiang Province on 15 and 23 Oct 2013.

China reported 134 cases by the end of August [2013], with 45 fatalities, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

[This is another concerning report indicating that the H7N9 avian influenza virus has not gone away and that a new epidemic may recur with the onset of winter, in conjunction with the appearance of the non-avian seasonal influenza viruses. Furthermore in the initial avian H7N9 influenza virus epidemic children were rarely affected and then often only with mild or inapparent symptoms. The decline in H7N9 avian influenza virus cases in adults has been attributed, on the basis of convincing evidence, to the closure of urban poultry markets and general restrictions on the trading of live poultry.

The circumstances whereby the 3-year-old boy in Guangdong province became infected are not reported, and further speculation at this stage is unwise. The 2 recent cases in adults in mid-October 2013 occurred in Zhejiang Province and do not appear to be directly related to the Guangdong case on the basis of current information. More detailed information is awaited. - Mod.CP
