19 Children Sickened; One _E. coli_ Case Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------
Waukesha, Wisconsin (AP) - Health officials launched an investigation after
a pupil at an elementary school was infected with _E. coli_ and 19 others
were sickened. Three of the Bethesda Elementary School children remained
hospitalized early Thursday. All the children, ages 5 to 9, had symptoms
similar to those associated with _E. coli_ infections, health officials
said.
No source of the illnesses was immediately determined, said Jeff Landin,
chief of staff to the Waukesha County Executive. Health officials planned
to check the school's lunchroom Thursday and Friday.
One child was confirmed to have contracted _E. coli_; test results were not
yet in for 2 others who were being treated at hospitals. Officials at the
school in this city just west of Milwaukee said they started receiving
calls from parents and hospitals Wednesday. "If any one child is dealing
with _E. coli_ that's a very serious thing ad of course that's a lot of
concern no matter where that's coming from in terms of _E. coli_
contamination," Bethesda Principal Jack Bothwell said.
