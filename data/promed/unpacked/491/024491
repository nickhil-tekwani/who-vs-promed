While most Australians are managing their lives around COVID-19, 2 oyster farmers have left their lives 500 km 311 mi] behind in an attempt to evade a disease known as QX, shorthand for Queensland Unknown.

[R and TR] run East Coast Oyster Nursery in Port Stephens and arrived in Batemans Bay on the [NSW/New South Wales] South coast seeking the safe waters of the Clyde River to establish a new nursery.

The couple has been growing oysters for more than 10 years, and specialise in farming spat -- oyster larvae -- which they sell to oyster farmers across Australia.

Growing spat is a specific task, requiring different equipment and processes to oyster farming. Oyster farmers buy spat which they then grow to maturity and sell on the market as oysters.

[RT] said business was thriving and the business was shipping spat to oyster farms along Australia's east coast. Then QX arrived.

QX is a seasonal disease affecting Sydney rock oysters and, while safe for human consumption, kills the majority of oysters in an infected farm. However, there is a strand of Sydney rock oyster resistant to the disease.

Each year, the disease kills about 30 per cent of resistant oysters on a farm. QX was found among Port Stephens' oyster farms in late August 2021. The waters of Port Stephens were, in an instant, infected waters.

"Everything was quarantined in Port Stephens," [RT] said. "You couldn't sell to outside because you don't want to ship the virus around the state."

[RT] said QX in Port Stephens could potentially decimate the national oyster industry. "If all your product can only stay in Port Stevens, then there's a great vacuum of stock, and that's not a great outcome for the rest of industry," he said.

QX is seasonal and occurs around March. Sydney rock oyster spat takes 3 years to mature to an age where the [the owners of the nursery] are able to sell them to farmers. That means any spat they sell would have to survive 3 years of QX risk.

"30 per cent stacked on 30 per cent each year -- your mortalities really start to build up," [RT] said. "You have to have a lot of product to get a decent crop at the end of it."

The couple started looking elsewhere, for locations outside the quarantine area where they could move their nursery system, remain viable and still supply spat to farmers nationally.

They settled on the Clyde 3 weeks ago, with plans to start a spat nursery entirely from scratch.

The couple is not yet operational, and are hoping to start receiving infant spat from Victoria or Tasmania in the next fortnight. Once the spat arrive, the job becomes incredibly laborious. "It is a 7-day-a-week job," [TR] said. "You have to be watching them and cleaning them every single day."

The nursery will grow spat until they are 4 to 8 millimetres, before shipping them off to farmers. The process takes about 5 months. The couple will have to learn an entirely new environment for growing oysters on the Clyde compared to Port Stephens but are up for the challenge.

Most of the spat grown at their nursery on the Clyde will be shipped up and down the east coast to other farmers; they will send the remaining stock to their farm in Port Stephens, where [RT's] dad continues to farm.

"By shipping them back to Port Stephens they miss that initial hit of QX," [RT] said. "It means 30 per cent less mortalities in the 1st season."

The couple is not sure how long they are committing to the NSW South Coast, but so far have been taken by the area. They enjoy having an office on the banks of the Clyde river, being able to surf after a day's work and join in the community of oyster farmers helping build a thriving industry in Batemans Bay.

[The parasitic protozoan _Marteilia sydneyi_ Phylum Paramyxea) was recognized as the etiological agent of QX disease since the mid-1970's. It is the most pathogenic parasite of the Sydney rock oyster (_Saccostrea glomerata_) in estuaries of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, Australia. Outbreaks have a significant impact on oyster populations, reaching 95% of mortality or more. - Mod.PMB
