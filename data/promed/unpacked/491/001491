Officials with the National Health Commission in China have reported the 1st human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) this year [2019] in Gansu. The male patient, age 82 years, from Jiuquan has been hospitalized and is in serious condition.

Since March 2013, there were a total of 1568 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) reported globally (in the past 6 waves).

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flulike symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g., chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) have also been reported.

The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multiorgan failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza.

The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

[This is the 1st human case of avian influenza A/H7N9 reported in 2019. The epidemiological and risk factors related to this case have not been mentioned in the above report.

The overall risk management recommendations by the WHO are:
- WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. For recommendations on safe trade in animals from countries affected by these influenza viruses, refer to OIE guidance.
- WHO advises that travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces.
- Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.
- Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, especially over the coming winter months. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighboring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. Collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential. As the extent of virus circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiological and virological surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should remain high.
- All human infections caused by a new subtype of influenza virus are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.
- It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories. Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses. - Mod.UBA
