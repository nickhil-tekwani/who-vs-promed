Mysterious disease killing Newfoundland moose
---------------------------------------------
A mysterious disease that has killed a number of moose on
Newfoundland's northern peninsula has left provincial wildlife
experts in that province scratching their heads. It's unclear how
many moose have been lost due to the illness that causes the animals
to literally waste away, become walking skeletons and then die.

Wildlife officials haven't been able to find a cause for a mysterious
disease that is killing moose on Newfoundland's northern peninsula.
But wildlife officials in New Brunswick don't believe the mystery
disease could threaten this province's 26 000 moose. The
approximately 120 000 moose in Newfoundland are descendants of a
handful of moose that were shipped from New Brunswick in the late 1800s.

Dwayne Sabine, an animal biologist with New Brunswick's Fish and
Wildlife division, says until Newfoundland and Labrador officials
pinpoint what is killing the moose there it's hard to identify the
risk. "All wildlife species are susceptible to a variety of
illnesses, parasites, viruses, bacteria and some of them are
transmittable," said Sabine.

The moose that have died 1st suffer from diarrhea and then eat
constantly in a vain attempt to stave off starvation. Newfoundland
officials don't believe the disease can be transmitted to humans.

Chronic wasting disease has similar effects as the unexplained
disease currently affecting the moose in Newfoundland and Labrador.
It was 1st discovered in the mid-1980s in the United States and was
confirmed in a number of western provinces approximately 25 years
later. Deer and elk are the primary targets of the disease.

The Canadian Food and Inspection Agency responded by enacting
restrictions on the transportation of live deer, moose and elk.

"With almost all diseases, there's considered to be very little
concern about bringing back parts of dead animals, meat that a hunter
may bring back," said Sabine. "They're being brought back to be
eaten, they're not likely to be brought into contact with another
live moose somewhere here."

New Brunswick has yet to record any cases of chronic wasting disease
in its deer or moose population.

"We haven't seen a case similar to Newfoundland where you have
multiple animal problems in a single area. We get reports of moose
acting strangely, and our district staff will go out and investigate."
Most often, said Sabine, the cause is brain worm, which is transmitted
between moose and deer.

"They could actually be very different than ours," he said of the
genetic makeup of the Newfoundland moose. "But the flip side of that
is that there are very few wildlife diseases that just affect a very
specific and limited segment of a gene pool. So anything that affects
moose in Newfoundland will almost certainly affect moose anywhere in
North America."

[Chronic Wasting Disease has been found in moose; see ProMED-mail
post 20050930.2865. If it is known the animals develop diarrhea and
then must eat constantly, then hopefully some thorough necropsies
have been done with a complete set of tissues for analysis.

Although the brain worm may be a candidate, as is chronic wasting
disease, it could well be some other disease. We look forward to
having a more authoritative report regarding necropsy findings. - Mod.TG
