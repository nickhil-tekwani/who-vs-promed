The [Andalusian] Ministry of Environment has issued an alert about an
outbreak of sarcoptic mange in Spanish ibex and has initiated
surveillance activities in the provinces of Jaen, Granada, Almeria,
and Malaga.

The ministry has declared a temporary hunting emergency in the area,
a decision that will remain in effect until the end of 2012.

Due to weather conditions this spring [2011], [the incidence] of
sarcoptic mange is higher than in previous years. The Ministry of
Environment has empowered provincial delegates to adopt or promote
preventive measures to eradicate the outbreak, in accordance with the
Andalusian Spanish Ibex Program (Pacam, by its initials in Spanish).

Guidelines for health monitoring have been designed and include
eliminating affected animals in which lesions caused by the disease
are detected, taking samples for analytical research, epidemiological
mapping, improving the habitat, or taking population censuses on a
regular basis, among others.

The Andalusian provinces with stable populations of ibex are Almeria,
Cadiz, Granada, Jaen, and Malaga, and at times they are also seen in
Cordoba and Seville. In total, there are about 34 500 animals.

[Sarcoptic mange, caused by the mite _Sarcoptes scabiei_, is regarded
as the most common cause of mortality in the small fragmented
populations of the highly endangered chamois and Iberian ibex in
mountainous areas across southern Europe.

Spanish ibex can be found in: Luis Leon-Vizcaino, Maria R Ruiz de
