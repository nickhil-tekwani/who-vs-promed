Viet Nam: Human Death Toll Reaches 40
-------------------------------------
Avian influenza has killed another Vietnamese resident and infected 3
more, taking the country's toll to 40 -- half of them killed since
the H5N1 virus returned in December [2004], state-run media said on
Thu 14 Jul 2005. The victim, who was not identified, had the H5
component of the virus and died in a Hanoi hospital last week, the
Tien Phong (Vanguard) newspaper quoted a Health Ministry report as
saying.
It said the report, delivered to a government meeting on Wed 13 Jul
2005, said 3 of 18 patients in the isolation ward of Hanoi's National
Institute for Clinical Research of Tropical Medicine were confirmed
avian influenza cases. 13 others were suspected of being infected
with the virus, while 2 had human influenza. Health Ministry
officials said they could not immediately provide details of the
latest victim nor the new cases.
Tien Phong quoted Trinh Quan Huan, director of the Preventive
Medicine and HIV/AIDS Control Department, as saying there was no
evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus which has
infected more than 60 people since it returned to Viet Nam in
December [2004]. The virus, which arrived in Asia in late 2003, has
also killed 12 Thais and 4 Cambodians. While there have been no new
outbreaks in poultry in recent weeks, the Vietnamese Health Ministry
fears outbreaks could turn into an epidemic in the winter, when the
virus seems to thrive best.

Viet Nam: One of 2 Respiratory Illness Deaths Due to Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------------------------
2 Vietnamese citizens have died from respiratory illness, one of whom
was infected with avian influenza, local newspaper Pioneer reported
on Thursday, quoting Vietnam's Preventive Medicine Department. The 2
people died at the Institute of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi, the
capital city, last week. Specimens from a patient tested positive for
avian influenza virus strain H5, and the testing of the other patient
gave unclear results.
The institute is now treating 18 local people, 3 of whom have been confirmed to
have contracted H5 virus, and the rest are suspected to be infected with [it].
One patient is in need of respiratory assistance.
Since 4 Jun 2005, Viet Nam has reported no new human cases of avian
influenza virus infection. The department confirmed that a total of
60 local people from 23 localities have been infected with avian
influenza since late December 2004, of whom 19 died. The department
also confirmed that there is no evidence of human-to-human
transmission. Experts from the World Health Organization have
recently taken 50 specimens from suspected cases of avian influenza
virus infection among people and poultry for testing in the United
States, Japan and Viet Nam.
Viet Nam will start vaccinating fowl against [avian influenza virus
infection] in northern Nam Dinh province and southern Tien Giang
province on a trial basis in early August 2005, and then do the same
in other localities with high risks of outbreaks in October. The
country has so far this year detected bird flu outbreaks in 35 cities
and provinces nationwide, which have killed or led to the forced
culling of 1.5 million fowl, mainly ducks and chickens.

[The most recent WHO statement (dated 28 Jun 2005) of human cases of
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection for Viet Nam confirmed by
laboratory testing gives the number of cases since 16 Dec 2004 as 60,
18 of whom died. The overall totals for the period since 26 Dec 2003
for Viet Nam are 87 cases and 38 deaths. The above reports record at
least one additional death, as many as 3 additional locally confirmed
cases, and 15 suspected cases of avian influenza. Person-to person
transmission has been discounted, which suggests that exposure to
avian influenza virus infection in Viet Nam is once again extensive.
