Illnesses in 7 more people have been tied by to the consumption of
raw milk from a farm in Sibley County that was implicated in an _E.
coli_ [O157:H7] outbreak earlier in 2010, the Minnesota Department of
Health reported Thursday [28 Oct 2010]. 3 people were infected with a
bacterium called _Campylobacter jejuni_ and the other 4 with a
parasite, _Cryptosporidium parvum_, after drinking raw milk. All 7
reported drinking raw milk, and those who named a source said it was
the Hartmann Dairy Farm, the department said.

Laboratory tests determined the bacterium and parasite in most of the
ill people were genetically identical to samples taken from the farm
this summer. Both result in similar symptoms, including fever,
diarrhea and vomiting. Cryptosporidiosis can be life threatening for
people with weak immune systems.

"We know all these things are carried by cattle and transmitted by
raw milk. It's not unexpected," said Kirk Smith, a foodborne diseases
expert with the health department. "Whatever is in cow poop is going
to wind up in raw milk. It is impossible to produce raw milk without
those kinds of things happening."

Smith said the 7 people were sickened from late July to late August
2010. He said the lag between the illnesses and the department's
report Thursday was due to the time needed for the investigation and
laboratory tests.

The department said it has identified 47 other people who became ill
since 1 Jan 2010, after drinking raw milk from a variety of other
sources throughout the state. Most of those cases have been young
adults or children.

Hartmann's farm was implicated as the source of an outbreak of 8
confirmed E. coli infections in May and June. In response, the
Minnesota Department of Agriculture ordered Hartmann to stop selling
all milk until he remedied the unsanitary conditions on the farm.
Nichole Neeser, who leads the dairy inspection program for the state
Agriculture Department, said the restriction remained in effect
Thursday. Because of an ongoing investigation of the farm, she said
she couldn't comment further.

Also this summer, the department prohibited the sale of specific lots
of meat, cheese and other dairy products from the farm. Hartmann
fought the embargo in Sibley County court. Neeser said arguments
finished in late September 2010 and the judge hasn't yet ruled.

Federal and state regulators have said raw milk carries a risk of
disease because it hasn't been through the germ-destroying
pasteurization process. However, interest in raw milk has been
growing among those who think pasteurization reduces milk's nutritional value.

9 U.S. states allow retail sales of raw milk, while another 19,
including Minnesota, allow only direct sales from farmers to consumers.

[Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella
melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria
monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species,
_Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with raw
milk ingestion.

Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_
Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species,
_Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from
_Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated
with raw milk ingestion.

Other diseases that can be related to unpasteurized milk are
highlighted in these paragraphs extracted from Leedom JM: Milk and
Infectious Diseases in Humans. Clin Infect Dis 2006; 43: 610-5
(<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/507035>) with the
citations renumbered to be consecutive starting from 1:

"In 1996 and 1998, there were 2 episodes involving rabid cows that
occurred in Massachusetts (1). Milk from rabid cows can contain
rabies virus, and transmission via unpasteurized milk is
theoretically possible. Temperatures reached during pasteurization
kill the virus. 80 persons consumed unpasteurized milk that was
collected from the 2 cows, and 9 more had contact with saliva from
the cows. All 89 persons received postexposure rabies prophylaxis,
and no human cases of rabies eventuated. A similar report in Oklahoma
of possible rabies exposure associated with the consumption of raw
milk or cream from a rabid cow was circulated in 2006 (2).

Tickborne encephalitis, a zoonotic arbovirus infection usually
transmitted to humans by the bite of an _Ixodes persulcatus_ or
_Ixodes ricinus_ tick, is endemic to Central Europe, Eastern Europe,
and Russia (3). However, the virus can be found in the milk of cows
and goats with tickborne encephalitis and was reported to be
transmissible to humans by the consumption of unpasteurized milk (4).
A case-control study failed to confirm oral transmission (5).

A diarrhea syndrome (later named Brainerd diarrhea) occurred among
122 residents of Brainerd, Minnesota, during the period December
1983-July 1984 (6). It was characterized by acute onset, marked
urgency, lack of systemic symptoms, failure to respond to
conventional antimicrobial agents, and a long median duration of
illness (median duration, 16.5 months). The syndrome was linked to
consumption of raw milk from a single dairy (6). No etiologic agent
was ever isolated. The outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea stopped when all
of the dairy's output was diverted and pasteurized (6, MT Osterholm,
personal communication).

Subsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were not directly
associated with milk, although cattle had been in the vicinity of an
Illinois well that had its water implicated as a vehicle of
transmission (7). Another outbreak of Brainerd-like diarrhea,
although not associated with raw milk, affected 58 (15 percent) of
394 passengers aboard a cruise ship visiting the Galapagos Islands in
Ecuador (8).
