MALARIA, PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM - GERMANY: ex DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Two travellers returning from the Dominican Republic have been hospitalized in Germany for _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria. Both had returned from the Dominican Republic with a 6-day history of fever. They had sought medical attention before their return and were treated with ciprofloxacin for a suspected bacterial infection.

The Dominican Republic is considered to be a low risk country for malaria (http://tinyurl.com/j326znc). The only country in the region with sustained malaria transmission is Haiti. However, in recent years, there are reports of clusters of malaria cases (see previous ProMED-mail reports on this topic) from the Dominican Republic. Travellers developing a febrile disease during or after a journey to the Dominican Republic should be aware of the possibility of a malaria infection.

[Malaria contracted in the Dominican Republic, despite the risk being low, has been reported on and off over the past 17 years (see ProMED-mail posts below). Punta Cana and La Altagracia especially, have been pointed out as risk areas, but the present report does not indicate the areas visited in the Dominican Republic.

The Dominican Republic borders Haiti, where _P. falciparum_ malaria is endemic, and recruits workers for construction sites from Haiti. Thus, previous outbreaks in the Dominican Republic and also the outbreak in Jamaica have been ascribed to malaria-infected Haitians living in these areas.

Further information from the authorities in the Dominican Republic is welcome, as is more detailed information on the areas visited by the 2 German tourists. - Mod.EP
