A 2nd outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] has been registered in Alabak State [Hunting] Enterprise, Pazardzhik regional governor Stefan Mirev said after a meeting of the Regional Epizootic Commission, Focus Radio - Pazardzhik reported.

Mirev said a sample of a 2nd dead pig found in the Velingrad region on the territory of Alabak State [hunting] Enterprise tested positive. "It is the 2nd outbreak of ASF in the region of Velingrad. At the meeting, we made a thorough analysis and discussed all measures taken by the competent institutions. They are the same as those with the 1st outbreak."

"Today [20 Aug 2019], an order will be issued by the director of the regional forestry department, which will ban access to the infected area. It will prohibit logging, mushroom picking, hiking, and any activities that could spread the infection," Stefan Mirev explained.

[The (English) media report above mentions "a 2nd dead pig" and includes a picture of a domestic pig. This may be erroneous (a translation error?!). Media reports in Bulgarian (for example https://dariknews.bg/regioni/plovdiv/vtoro-ognishte-na-afrikanska-chuma-kraj-velingrad-otmeniat-sybora-na-iundola-2182846) specified "wild boar" and included a corresponding picture. Alabak, in Velingrad, is one of Bulgaria's 39 state game breeding stations.

The above media report in Bulgarian further says: "The infection has been re-discovered in a wild boar found on the territory of Alabak State Hunting. The test sample is positive. An order was issued to declare the new outbreak, as well as preventive measures. One of them is to cancel the Yundola Fair, which has been gathering thousands of people from all over the country every year for decades. Its date for this summer was 25 Aug 2019." According to local press, the authorities have started preventive culling of domestic pigs in the vicinity of the mentioned cases in wild boar.

Velingrad is a town in Pazardzhik Province, Southern Bulgaria, between the provinces Plovdiv (on its east) and Grad Sofija (on its west); in both, cases in wild boar have been officially reported to the OIE; the 2 new outbreaks in Pazardzhik Province have not yet been reported to the OIE.

To view the locations of the ASF cases in wild boar in the 2 neighboring provinces, see OIE's interactive map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=30979.

A summary of the ASF event in Bulgaria, which started on 3 Jul 2019, as of 3 Aug 2019 (most recent available follow-up report, No. 4), follows:

Total outbreaks = 43 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 129 262 / 522 / 496 / 128 766 / 0
Wild boar / not available / 26 / 24 / 2 / 0

Follow-up report No 5 is anticipated.

The recording of new ASF cases in wild boars in the 3 mentioned provinces in southern Bulgaria represents a leap southward towards Bulgaria's border with northern Greece, a country which has thus far remained free of ASF; alertness is warranted. - Mod.AS
