The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the new
estimates Friday [12 Feb 2010]. They represent cases from the time
swine flu [pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus infection] was first
identified in April [2009] through mid-January [2010], the 1st 9
months of the pandemic. The numbers represent increases of about 4
percent from the CDC's last estimates, which covered the 1st 8
months. New swine flu cases peaked in October [2009] but have
declined since and have not been widespread in any state for more than a month.

On Thursday [11 Feb 2010], a World Health Organization (WHO) official
said they will hold an expert meeting later this month to consider
whether the swine flu pandemic's peak has passed. WHO's emergency
committee will give its verdict to U.N. health chief Margaret Chan on
whether the global outbreak has entered a "transition period," the
agency's flu chief Keiji Fukuda said. "This is a period in which we
consider that the pandemic is still continuing," but that the worst
of the outbreak is over, he said. WHO declared swine flu a pandemic
last June [2009], when it announced the virus had reached "phase 6"
on its alert scale, the agency's highest designation. "The post-peak
phase is different from phase 6, but it indicates that there is
ongoing pandemic activity," Fukuda said later in a telephone
interview. "It is a movement toward the post-pandemic period." The
experts will consider what measures governments should take to
continue monitoring and combating the spread of the dis!
ease, he said. "We hope that the worst is over, but you can't
suddenly let down your guard," Fukuda said. He said the exact date of
the meeting had not yet been set.

There have been over 15 000 laboratory confirmed deaths worldwide
since the swine flu outbreak began in North America last spring
[2009]. WHO says the actual death toll is probably much higher, but a
final figure won't be available for 1-2 years. WHO experts will also
examine whether to advise governments and drug companies to include
the swine flu strain in future vaccines for seasonal influenza, a
move Fukuda said was likely given that the [pandemic] H1N1 strain
will continue circulating for some time. Although infections have
declined in the Northern Hemisphere lately, WHO says it is still
receiving reports of new outbreaks elsewhere, including, most
recently, in West Africa.
