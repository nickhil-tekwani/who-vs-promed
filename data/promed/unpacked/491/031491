Equine cases
One new equine case of West Nile virus (WNV) infection was confirmed this
week. The Sussex County, New Jersey, horse is recovering from illness which
included a fever (102 F) and posterior ataxia. WNV infection was confirmed
at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) via WNV-positive
results on a 1:1000 dilution of serum on IgM-capture enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and on a 1:10 dilution of serum on a plaque
reduction neutralization test (PRNT). This brings to 9 the total number of
confirmed equine cases of WNV infection in 2000.

[The poor performance of sentinel chickens has been a subject of adverse
comment previously and their performance does not appear to have improved
with the passage of time. One possible explanation for this phenomenon has
come to me from Dr Aki Oya (Tokyo) via Drs. R.E. Shope & C.H. Calisher. Dr.
Oya has pointed out that in Japan, _Culex_ mosquitoes are attracted mostly
to black or dark birds. Consequently, if White Leghorn chickens are being
employed as sentinels (as seems likely), they are precisely the wrong color
to attract mosquitoes. -Mod.CP
