[After a relatively "quiet" week with no wild poliovirus (WPV) isolates (see section [2] below], a positive environmental sample (ES) was reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal Districts, serving as a recurrent reminder that the WPV1 is still circulating in Pakistan. As for cVDPV2 activity, after a week where there were only 2 countries confirming cVDPV2 activity (Nigeria and Tajikistan, see section [2] below), this past week has 10 countries with cVDPV2 activity. AFP cases were confirmed in 5 countries (Ethiopia, Nigeria, Mali, Sierra Leone, Tajikistan) and positive ES were confirmed in an additional 5 countries (Gambia, Liberia, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal). This was the 1st report of cVDPV2 identification in Mauritania, genetically related to the outbreak in Jigawa.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Sierra Leone - nOPV2
Date: Fri 27 Aug 2021
Source: WHO/AFRO Press Release [edited]
https://www.afro.who.int/news/sierra-leone-safeguards-children-new-vaccine-against-polio


A sub-national polio immunization campaign starts today in Sierra Leone to protect an estimated 520 000 children under 5 years of age using the novel Oral Polio vaccine. The campaign will run for 4 days and will be implemented by national and district teams and frontline health workers that will go house to house in 3 districts -- Tonkolili, Western Area Urban and Western Area Rural districts -- to immunize eligible children.

Between December 2020 and June 2021, the country experienced an outbreak of the circulating Vaccine Derived Poliovirus type 2 or cVDPV2. A total of 34 confirmed cases in children have been recorded in the country. Similar outbreaks have also been reported in 23 countries in the African region. The outbreak has been attributed to a decline in routine vaccination services largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic which also resulted in the decline in population immunity. A coordinated response to the outbreak has led the government and its health sector partners to plan and implement nationwide response interventions including 2 nation-wide supplementary immunization campaigns in May [2021] and July [2021] respectively. The campaigns aimed to immunize all eligible children to interrupt transmission of the virus.

However, findings from Lots Quality Assurance Survey and Independent Monitoring of the campaigns by teams that were recruited and deployed by WHO to evaluate the implementation of the campaigns showed that Tonkolili, Western Area Urban, and Western Area Rural districts consistently failed to meet the threshold of quality implementation of the May [2021] and July [2021] interventions. The poor performance left a significant proportion of children susceptible to Poliovirus infections.

"Such exposure to the risk of infection is avoidable if herd immunity is achieved by ensuring improved vaccination coverage of the target population", says Dr Steven V. Shongwe, WHO Representative in Sierra Leone.

To mitigate the risks, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation with technical and financial support from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) comprising WHO, UNICEF, CDC, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and other partners is implementing the ongoing mop-up campaign to ensure these districts catch up with the other parts of the country and attain herd immunity against polio in the whole country.

Thousands of frontline health workers, community volunteers and supervisors have been trained and deployed to ensure no child is missed in this campaign. The team will administer the novel Oral Polio Vaccine or nOPV to the eligible children. The same vaccine was used in the 2 recent campaigns which made Sierra Leone stand out as one of 4 countries in the world that has rolled out the nOPV. The vaccine has been evaluated to be safe and highly effective in the prevention of poliovirus.

Polio is a debilitating and potentially fatal disease. The virus is highly infectious and has no cure once it affects an individual and can lead to paralysis or even death. Young children are the most vulnerable. However, the disease is totally preventable with safe and effective vaccines, which if given multiple times can protect a child for life.

"Vaccination is one of the primary strategies that has contributed to the gains the world has made in the fight against polio. Collective effort by everyone can keep all children safe from the effects of the disease and can make eradication possible in our life time" Dr Shongwe stated.

In August 2020, Africa was certified wild polio free after more than 3 years of no confirmed case on the continent. However, outbreaks of cVDPV continue to spread in many countries on the continent and other parts of the world. Outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus or cVDPV occur in communities with poor environmental sanitation conditions, decline in population immunity due to suboptimal routine immunization and poor quality supplemental immunization activities.

This week at the 71st WHO Regional Committee for Africa, the 47 governments in the region committed themselves to sustain the gains the continent has made against the wild poliovirus and the eradication of all forms of polio viruses that cause the disease.

[Fingers are crossed that the nOPV2 will interrupt the transmission of the cVDPV2 while not entering the cycle of creating new cVDPV2 lineages due to a more genetically stable attenuated virus in the vaccine. The use of the nOPV2 is currently under an Emergency Use Listing with limited roll out aimed at collecting further information and data analyses on the safety, immunogenicity, and genetic stability of the vaccine (see https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GPEI-cVDPV2-nOPV2-Factsheet-20210312-EN.pdf and https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nOPV2-technical-brief-20201231-EN.pdf). - Mod.MPP]

[4] Africa commits to ending all polio
Date: Thu 26 Aug 2021
Source: WHO AFRO Press release [edited]
https://www.afro.who.int/news/african-countries-commit-ending-all-forms-polio-regional-meeting


Governments from the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region have committed to ending all remaining forms of polio and presented a scorecard to track progress towards the eradication of the virus. The commitments came at a dedicated meeting on polio at the 71st WHO Regional Committee for Africa.

While the African Region was certified free of wild poliovirus one year ago following 4 years without a case, outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) continue to spread. cVDPVs occur in communities where not enough children have received the polio vaccine. Cases increased last year [2020] in part because of disruptions to polio vaccination campaigns caused by COVID-19. Since 2018, 23 countries in the region have experienced outbreaks and more than half of the global 1071 cVDPV cases were recorded in Africa.

"As Chair of the African Union, I am determined to work with other countries to protect the gains of our monumental efforts against polio and finish the job against all forms of this disease in Africa. Only then, we will be able to say we delivered on our promise of a safer, healthier future for all our children," said H.E. Felix Tshisekedi, President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

At the Regional Committee, countries discussed how they will begin implementing the new Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) 2022-2026 Strategy [https://polioeradication.org/gpei-strategy-2022-2026/] that was launched in June [2021] to urgently stop the spread of cVDPVs. The tools and tactics outlined in the Strategy to stop outbreaks include:
-Improving the speed and quality of outbreak response, including through the rapid deployment of surge staff from the WHO Regional Office for Africa to support countries as soon as outbreaks are detected.
-Further integrating polio campaigns with the delivery of essential health services and routine immunization to reach children who have never been vaccinated, help build trust with communities and improve uptake of the polio vaccine.
-Broadening the rollout of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2), a new tool that could more sustainably end outbreaks of type 2 cVDPV, which are the most prevalent. To date, 6 countries in Africa have rolled out the vaccine with close to 40 million children vaccinated and no concerns noted for safety.

"The poliovirus disregards and defies borders. Its presence anywhere in our region is a threat to all countries. Togo is committed to working with our regional partners and acting with the urgency required to implement high quality polio campaigns and protect children across Africa. With collective action, we will defeat all forms of polio," said Hon Professor Moustafa Mijiyawa, Togo's Minister of Health and Public Hygiene and Universal Access to Health Care and the Chairperson of the 71st session of the Regional Committee for Africa.

The scorecard presented at the Regional Committee will track indicators for implementation of timely, high-quality polio outbreak response, readiness to introduce nOPV2 as the new vaccine becomes eligible for broader use, strengthening routine immunization to close immunity gaps, and transitioning polio assets into national health systems in a strategic, phased approach. Ministers committed to regularly reviewing progress together on each of these indicators to ensure collective success in urgently finishing the job on polio and securing a polio-free future for every child across the region.

"Our success in ending wild poliovirus in the region shows what is possible when we work together with urgency. COVID-19 has threatened this triumph as governments worked hard to limit the spread of COVID-19, pausing some campaigns. However, we cannot waver, and with renewed vigour we can overcome the final hurdles that jeopardize our success. We have the know-how, but it must be backed by committed resources to reach all under-vaccinated communities and ensure that all children thrive in a world free of polio. Together, we can help the world achieve polio eradication," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.

Almost 100 million African children have been vaccinated against polio since July 2020, after activities were paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Regional Committee also discussed how to accelerate the transition of polio infrastructure into countries' health systems, so that it can continue to support immunization and disease surveillance once polio is eradicated. The polio programme has a history of supporting the response to emerging health threats in the Region, including Ebola and COVID-19, and half of polio surge staff are currently helping countries with COVID-19 surveillance, contact tracing, and community engagement.

"We need increased political and financial commitment by governments and partners to walk the last mile towards ending all forms of polio," said Dr Tunji Funsho, chair of Rotary's National PolioPlus Committee, Nigeria. "We must reach more children faster and comprehensively to not only curb outbreaks swiftly, but to also scale up vaccination coverage and give children lasting protection against this preventable disease"

[28 countries on the African continent (including the island Republic of Madagascar) have reported cVDPV activity in the past 2 years. There is no longer confirmed WPV1 activity outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The cVDPV activity far exceeds the threat from the wild poliovirus globally. The acknowledgement of this threat is one piece of the battle. Another piece of the battle is overcoming the relative paralysis of the vaccination efforts related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and in areas with civil unrest. This latter challenge -- areas of civil unrest -- exists in both WPV1 affected countries and in many of the African countries. nOPV2 may help some of the challenges with cVDPV2, but not all if the nOPV2 doesn't reach all of the targeted populations. - Mod.MPP]
