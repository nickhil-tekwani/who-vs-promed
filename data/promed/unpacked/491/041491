Re: Mosquito Pools tested for EEE; It was alluded to in previous
correspondence that since the rate of positives were so low they could
actually be false positives.
The St. Tammany Parish Mosquito Abatement District No. 2 has had a total of
546 mosquito pools tested for EEE since May [1999. Collections were taken
from 48 different sites. We had 3 mosquito pools return positive; one for
_Culex salinarius_ collected May 13, and two for _Culex nigripalpus_
collected July 20 and then August 11. It is interesting to note that all 3
of the positives were collected from the same location. All 47 other
locations returned negative. This would lead me to believe that
the mosquito pools were indeed truly positive.
