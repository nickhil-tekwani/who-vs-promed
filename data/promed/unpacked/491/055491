"The current HPAI epidemic season continues with a high number of outbreaks in poultry and non-poultry reported mainly in Europe, but also in Africa, Americas, and Asia over the 5 weeks covered by the report. The predominant subtype noticed in the current epidemic season is subtype H5N1. During the period of interest, more than 5 million poultry birds have died from the disease or have been killed and disposed of due to outbreaks. Notifications in wild birds in multiple countries and regions indicate a possible introduction and spread of the virus through current wild bird migration. The increased number of notifications reflects the annual seasonal trend of HPAI cases. Based on this known pattern, February is known to be the peak of the epidemic season. In this context, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) urges countries to intensify surveillance efforts, implement strict biosecurity measures at farm level to prevent the introduction of the disease, continue timely reporting of avian influenza outbreaks in both poultry and non-poultry species, and maintain the high quality of the information provided to support early detection and rapid response to potential threats to both animal and public health."
