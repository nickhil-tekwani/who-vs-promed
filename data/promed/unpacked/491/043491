The following is a note published in the Saudi Epidemiology Bulletin of
the first quarter of 1996.
A Novel Flavivirus: Makkah Region 1994-1996
--------------------------------------------
Since the identification of Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in
the Western region in 1991, surveillance of viral hemorrhagic fevers
(VHF) has continued to identify patients for whom neither CCHF or dengue
was confirmed. In 1995 a previously unidentified flavivirus was
isolated from a specimen from a patient who died from suspected CCHF in
1994. The Division of Vectorborne Infectious Diseases, Fort Collins
Laboratory, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined the
virus serologically and by partial nucleotide sequence analysis of the
NS5 gene and confirmed that it was a member of the tick borne
encephalitis (TBE) group.
Some of the previously negative serum and blood specimens from 1994 and
1995 from CCHF (4), VHF (17), and dengue (19) surveillance were
re-tested for this virus. A case was defined as any febrile patient
from whom the flavivirus was isolated and had seroconversion for the new
flavivirus antigen without seroreactivity to dengue or CCHF. In
addition to the index case, eight other patients had either virus
isolation (5) or seroconversion (3).
Medical records were complete on eight patients and lacked laboratory
information for one patient who died shortly after admission. All
patients had fever (mean 38.7C, range 37.1-40C) with a mean
duration of 5.6 days. Fever was accompanied (by) chills in four
patients and sweating in two patients. Five patients had hemorrhagic
phenomena including epistaxis (2), echymosis at needle puncture sites
(3), extensive subcutaneous bleeding (1), bloody diarrhea or rectal
bleeding (2), and hematemesis (1). Three patients had a morbilliform
rash. Two patients with hemorrhagic disease also had encephalitis
manifested by convulsions, semi-coma and coma. Both had normal
computerized tomography scans of their brains. Six others had either
unusual irritability or drowsiness. Two patients died. During the
first week after onset of fever all eight patients with laboratory
testing had leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated serum
transaminases and two had elevated serum urea and creatinine. Maximum
abnormalities were reached at the end of first week from onset of
fever.
Additional exposure and demographic information was obtained by
reviewing patients' medical files, interviewing the patients (6), and by
interviewing the relatives or coworkers of patients (1) who had either
died or left the country and could not be interviewed. All patients
were adults with a mean age of 34 years (range 24-55) and eight were
males. Four were Egyptian, three came from the Indian subcontinent, and
two were Saudis. All non-Saudi patients had been in Saudi Arabia for
more than three months before their illness. Onset of illness occurred
either in the spring or fall months of 1994 or 1995. Three patients
lived in Jeddah, five in Makkah and one was a butcher from Bisha. The
Bisha butcher developed fever while attending Hajj on 21 May 1994 and died
without providing the date that he traveled from Bisha to Makkah. Of
the seven non-Saudi patients, six were butchers, and one was a zoo
worker. The Saudi patients were a soldier and a housewife.
The six butchers handled raw meat either through slaughtering (2), or
butchering in butcher shops (2) or kitchens (2). All had daily exposure
to sheep meat. In addition to sheep meat, two handled beef and camel
meat, and histories for three were unavailable. Three were interviewed
directly and reported that they cut their hand frequently while
working. One recalled a deep cut in his foot with a bloody knife one
week before onset of illness. The zoo worker only carried raw meat
(beef or camel) in his bare hands to feed the zoo animals. The
housewife's servants butchered freshly slaughtered sheep carcasses at
her home every week. Once around the time of her onset of illness she
assisted the servants in butchering a sheep carcass. However, she could
not remember whether she had done this before or after her illness. The
Saudi Soldier reported visiting a camel pinfold [sic] one week before his
illness where he drank a large amount of raw camel milk. He denied
slaughtering or butchering meat or having tick bites during the month
before onset of illness.
Among the six patients that were interviewed, ticks were reported at the
work sites of three patients, but not from their residences. Mosquitoes
were reported from both work sites and residences of two patients. Rat
infestations at home or work were not reported by any of the patients.
No patient reported any history of insect bite, blood transfusion,
hospitalization, or contact with patients with a similar diseases two
weeks prior to their illness.
The Department of Agriculture and Municipality in the region were
informed and participated in control measures. Livestock pinfolds in
residential areas were closed. In other legal pinfolds, flooring was
scraped, sterilized, sprayed with Diazenon and covered with new treated
soil. Pre-slaughtering veterinary check up was emphasized, and butchers
and slaughterhouse workers were instructed to apply precautions such as
gloving and booting to reduce skin contact and pericutaneous exposure to
blood. Hospitals and medical departments were informed to report any
suspect VHF or encephalitis.
No other information was sent to medical facilities after this note.

[Many thanks, Dr Ratard, for this comprehensive report. We assume you are
the author of the original article -- if not, we would like to give credit
to the author(s). Visitors to Saudi Arabia should take note that the
greatest risk is butchering your own meat or drinking raw camel milk.
Perhaps Dr Ratard or CDC Fort Collins can inform us whether the virus has
been named? - Mod.JW]
