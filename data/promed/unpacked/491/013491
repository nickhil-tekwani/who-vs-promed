Immediate notification: FMD A, Ref OIE 8266, Israel
---------------------------------------------------
Report Summary.
Disease: Foot and mouth disease
Causal Agent: FMDV
Serotype: A
Clinical Signs: Yes
Reason: New strain of a listed disease
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 12 Jul 2009
Date of Start of Event: 01 Feb 2009
Date of report: 12 Jul 2009
Diagnosis: Suspicion, Clinical, Laboratory (basic), Laboratory
(advanced), Necropsy
Number of reported outbreaks: 14

[The notification includes details of 14 outbreaks; for brevity, here
are their location names and (district), starting date, species
involved and remarks on the affected population, if available. Further
details and a summarising map are accessible at the above URL. - Mod.AS]

1. BET HALEWI (Hasharon). 01 Feb 2009. Cattle.
There are 2 adjacent herds, one of 380 calves and one of 270 heifers.
The outbreak 1st occurred in 40 calves and extended to 20 more. All
the sick animals were detected in the group of calves (which was not
vaccinated due to a mistake), whereas no clinical signs have been seen
in the group of the heifers, which was well vaccinated. The calves
showed signs [such] as salivation and fever.

2. ILUT (Kineret). 11 Feb 2009. Goats and sheep.
Clinical signs were detected in a herd of 10 ewes, 3 rams, 13 lambs
and one goat (male). 4 of them were affected with limping and vesicles
on the feet. The entire herd has been destroyed and buried on the spot.
On 24 February 2009, another affected flock in the same village was
detected. This herd contained 13 ewes, one ram and 17 lambs (total of
31). 4 of them showed clinical signs and were culled.

3. ARBEL (Kineret). 22 Feb 2009. Sheep.
This herd contains 350 ewes and 200 lambs of up to one month old.
Massive death was seen in the lambs, probably due to a problem with
lacking antibody colostrum which was given to them.

4. SHEFAR'AM (Acco). 26 Feb 2009. Cattle, goats.
This herd contains 6 adult cows and 6 calves of 6-8 months. 2 of the
cows showed clinical signs. In the same herd there are also 21 goats
and 21 kids -- none of them showed clinical signs.

5. AR'ARA (Hadera). 07 Mar 2009. Cattle.
Beef cattle. The owner owns 2 herds. One of the herds contains 70 cows
and 35 calves. The 2nd herd contains 26 cows and 10 calves. All the
signs were detected in adult cows in both herds.

6. Grifat - ZARZIR (Yizreel). 08 Mar 2009. Cattle, sheep.
2 outbreaks in the same village. One herd contains calves of 10 months.
The 2nd affected herd contains fattening lambs of 3-5 months old.

7. KEFAR YEHOSHUA (Yizreel). 09 Mar 2009. Cattle, goats.
In this village, 8 premises were affected. In one of the premises, at
the beginning of the outbreak, all the mortality occurred in young
kids. Later, adult goats started to die. This herd contained 940 adult
goats.
Until 3 May 2009, a total of 450 kids and 140 adult goats died. 350
goats were destroyed.

8. BET SHE'ARIM (Yizreel). 26 Mar 2009. Cattle. 7-10-month-old calves.

The herd is a free grazing herd of goats containing 270 animals: 200
[female] goats, 10 males and 60 young. About 60 [female] goats and 5
males showed clinical symptoms. The young were not affected. The main
clinical symptoms were vesicles in mouth and on feet. [This settlement
is situated in the West Bank].

14. DEIR EL ASAD (Acco). 01 Jul 2009. Sheep.
The herd contains 2000 ewe lambs born on the farm. Clinical symptoms
were fever, pneumonia, vesicles on the corona, limping and recumbency.
This outbreak has not been reported previously to the OIE.

Epidemiology

Epidemiological comments: The 2 last outbreaks (KEFAR TAPPUAH and DEIR
EL ASAD) were identified as serotype A in the Kimron Veterinary
Institute (both by PCR and KEFAR TAPPUAH also by Virus Neutralisation
Test). The 1st 12 outbreaks were already notified to the OIE as
serotype O referring to the local laboratory primary results (Ag
detection ELISA). However, these outbreaks were identified as serotype
A (PCR and Ag detection ELISA) by the WRL, Pirbright.

Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

[The availability of the Israeli Veterinary Services' drafted OIE
reports on their Web site is an exemplary expression of transparency.
The above report, already sent to the OIE, is expected to be published
on the 1st working day following the holiday [in France, where OIE is
located] of 14 July. - Mod.AS].

The ME report includes now the following data concerning 5 samples
from the Palestinian Authority Territory, West Bank, of which the
molecular sequencing has been "completed, awaiting report approval:"

Serotype: A.

Received: 02 Jun 2009.

It incudes also the following data pertaining to Israel, of which the
molecular sequencing is "in progress:"

[According to the above official sources, FMDV of serotype A has been
circulating in Israel and in the territory of the Palestinian
authority (West Bank) since the beginning of 2009. Rather likely, the
virus is similar to the FMDV 'serotype A, topotype Asia, strain
Iran-05,' which has been reportedly spreading within the Middle East;
an early publication of the genotyping results of the samples from the
Palestinian territories, reportedly already completed, will be
helpful. It will also help to note the dates and locations of their
samplings.

According to the 2009 Molecular Epidemiology (ME) report of the World
Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD, Pirbright, UK), the FMDV A
Iran-05 strain, against which previous vaccine strains did not provide
satisfactory protection, has been identified during 2009 in Bahrain,
Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, and Turkey. Jordan reported
an outbreak in December 2006.

The exceptionally high mortality in goats in the Israeli outbreak
number 7, which included high milk-yielding Saanen goats, deserves
attention.

Looking at the map of the Middle East, it seems that only one country
has not yet been, reportedly, affected by the new strain, namely
Syria. See at
