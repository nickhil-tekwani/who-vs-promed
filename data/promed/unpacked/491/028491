A case of hantavirus [infection] was confirmed in Concepción del Uruguay
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Concepción del Uruguay Municipal Health Director, Gabriel Barrientos, told LT11 that they had installed a sanitary barrier for a confirmed hantavirus case.

[There is an audio clip in Spanish, translated below]

The case was reported 3 weeks ago, nearly confirmed and a barrier was put in. This was an area propitious for rodents with trash and weeds making the barrier difficult. There are always people infected with hantaviruses and leptospirosis in this area. The rodents move and spread the disease. They need a 2nd test to confirm for hantavirus.

[There is no mention of the hantavirus involved in this case nor how clinically serious the case is. There are 2 hantavirus possibilities for this case: Marciel virus (in the dark bolo mouse, _Bolomys obscurus_); Lechiguana and Central Plata (in central Argentina; in the yellow pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys flavescens_). There is always the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). - Mod.TY
