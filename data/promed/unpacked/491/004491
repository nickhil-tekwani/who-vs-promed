Two outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have been discovered in China's southern province of Guangdong and in south western Tibet Autonomous Region [Xizang].

The Ministry of Agriculture has stated that 88 pigs in Guangdong were found to have been affected by FMD and 13 cattle in Tibet Autonomous Region were found to have FMD symptoms, discovered by farmers.

It has thus been confirmed by the National FMD Reference Laboratory that the animals in Guangdong were infected with [serotype] A foot-and-mouth [disease virus], while in Tibet Autonomous Region the animals had the [serotype] O variety.

A total of 948 pigs in Guangdong province and 37 cattle in Tibet Autonomous Region were culled.
