7 people, 4 adults residing in Batna and 3 children who were found to have symptoms of botulism are under medical supervision at the resuscitation department of the university hospital center (CHU) of Batna, APS learned yesterday, 23 Jun 2015, from the health department.

Some of these patients have consumed cachir [a type of sausage made with spices, couscous and minced poultry, lamb, or beef] and chicken pate, whose origin has been identified and whose samples were sent to the Algiers Pasteur Institute for analysis, said Abdelhafid Seddouk, head of service prevention and management of health, emphasizing that for the time being these cases are only suspected until the analysis is confirmed.

As a precaution, a public appeal was launched on the airwaves of Radio Batna to ask the population to avoid for the time being the consumption of cachir or pate. Botulism (from Latin Botulinus meaning "sausage") is a serious paralytic illness caused by a bacterial neurotoxin, botulinum toxin.

In July 1998, in Setif and its surroundings, a large outbreak of botulism that killed 44 people and hospitalized dozens more, which was traced to cachir.

[Although a single case of botulism can be confused with a variety of other neurological illnesses, clusters of symmetrical cranial nerve palsies followed by symmetrical descending flaccid paralysis are almost always botulism. Most outbreaks are related to homemade food. - Mod.LL
