Assam State health authorities have issued a Japanese encephalitis
outbreak alert following the death of 20 people in the past 2 weeks.
Health authorities in 4 districts in Assam were advised to carry out
blood tests in suspected cases, according to the Secretary of Health
in the state, Dhruba Hojai.
About 150 persons may be suffering from the disease in the district
most affected, according to another health official who wished to
remain anonymous.

[Appropos the earlier ProMED-mail postings on the ongoing JE
vaccination activities, the above newswire highlights that the JE
"season" has begun in India and that cases are being reported. In
prior years there have been thousands of cases of JE annually,
hopefully the newly embarked vaccination campaigns will reduce this
annual disease load. - Mod.MPP]
