Botulism eyed as cause for deaths of spoonbills
-------------------------------------------------
A growing number of the endangered black-faced spoonbills in a
reserve in southern Taiwan died from what is now thought to be
botulism contracted by eating dead fish. As of last night, 37 of the
rare birds that spend their winter in Taiwan had died, while 28 were
still ill. Autopsies performed on 9 of the dead birds showed that
they had not died from exposure to the cold or other natural causes.
Within hours of being injected with a solution made out of samples
taken from the stomachs of the dead birds, 6 laboratory mice died.
Taiwan County Livestock Disease Control Center director Hsien
Yao-ching said the results suggested that the birds may have
contracted botulism after eating dead fish or shrimp.
The director of the county's Department of Agriculture, Chou Ke-jen,
reported that dead fish had been found in 2 hatcheries where the
birds had been. However, between 3 and 5 days will be needed to
determine whether the birds did in fact succumb to botulism. In the
meantime, county authorities are contacting fish farmers in the
region and asking them to clean out their hatcheries. However,
according to National Institute for Animal Health director Lin
Shih-yuh, an investigation is still underway into the cause of the
deaths. The search was made all the more urgent by the fact that the
area where the birds are dying is also the winter home to more than
2/3 of the near-extinct birds.
Lin said that he was concerned that clostridium, a type of pathogen
responsible for gangrene, tetanus and botulism, could be responsible
for the deaths. Bacteria of the genus clostridium kill more wild
birds each year than any other germ. Lin added that incidents
involving the pathogen are not uncommon in Taiwan, although they most
often affect ducks.
Another possible cause being looked into is organic phosphorus
introduced to the birds' habitat in the form of a pesticide or
pollution. Researchers are taking a look at hatcheries in the area to
make sure they haven't been used as outlets for waste water. Another
concern among environmentalists and agriculture officials alike is
that the birds were intentionally targeted. Officials say they have
not ruled out that possibility.
The sanctuary where many black-faced spoonbills make their winter
home, an estuary at the mouth of the Tsengwen River, has in the past
been eyed by local businesses as an ideal site for new production
facilities. In the early '90s, the central government had to overturn
plans to turn the area into an industrial park.
Still, environmentalists helping out with the rescue efforts say they
are puzzled because whatever is killing the black-faced spoonbill is
not affecting other wildlife. For example, birds such as the egret,
which subsists on approximately the same diet as the spoonbill,
should also have eaten dead fish containing the same toxins. However,
there have been no reports in the area of egrets turning up dead.

[The Black-faced Spoonbill (_Platalea minor_) is an endangered bird
species whose known breeding sites are limited to the islands of the
West Sea of Korea and whose wintering sites are at the estuaries of
large rivers and on the seacoasts of Kyushu in Japan, Hong Kong in
China, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Should the suspected botulism
intoxication be confirmed, then some explanation is required for the
alleged species-susceptibility, since egrets are generally regarded
as susceptible to botulism.
