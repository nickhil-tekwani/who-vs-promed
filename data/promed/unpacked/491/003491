In Jakarta, 42 people have died of dengue since the 1st of the year
[2007], and thousands of neighbors in the capital of Indonesia have
been infected during this period, according to the Health Service.
The Jakarta government considers this dengue outbreak to be "an
extraordinary situation," according to the Subdirector of Regional
Health Services, Salimar Salim.
Just in the month of March [2007], 4423 cases have been registered in
Jakarta, compared to 2249 registered during the same period in the
previous year [2006], he added.
Jakarta has not lived through a similar dengue outbreak for 3 years,
when the disease caused 90 deaths in the city, with 20 640
[individuals] infected.
It is hoped that the number of [dengue] infections will decline this
month [April 2007] with the end of the rainy season, which, in
Indonesia, occurs between October and March. Dengue is transmitted by
the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, which is more abundant during this
season, especially in areas where water accumulates.

[ProMED requests again any information available about action taken
for vector mosquito control or about the dengue virus type or types
that are circulating during this outbreak. ProMED thanks Brent
Barrett and A-Lan Banks for sending in similar reports. An article in
the 11 Apr 2007 Jakarta Post, which, unfortunately, is only available
to subscribers, reports that the Jakarta government is considering
legal enforcement to compel citizens to eliminate _Aedes aegypti_
breeding sites in homes. Without an aggressive public education
effort, willing compliance will be difficult to achieve. A map of

In Tacloban City, dengue-carrying mosquitoes have evolved so that
dengue infection is now close to a year-round possibility.
This was the worried claim of the Department of Health (DOH
<http://www.doh.gov.ph/>)
as they announced that the illness has broken seasonal patterns and
that 880 dengue cases were reported in Metro Manila from January to
15 Mar 2007, the highest among 16 regions in the country.
The 2nd highest number of dengue cases was reported in the provinces
of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon. They registered a
record increase from last year's [2006] 216 cases to 457 this year.
National Epidemiology Center Director Enrique Tayag warned that
though there had been no rains, mosquitoes carrying the dengue virus
could be breeding in water containers like basin and drums, thus the
reason for their year-round survival.
All over the country, 3509 cases were reported from January to 15 Mar
2007, of which 32 died, according to DOH figures.
Meanwhile, former Presidential Chief of Staff Mike Defensor has
called on lawmakers to provide funds to support the local development
of anti-dengue vaccine.
Defensor said Congress should provide funds that will enable Filipino
scientists to pursue research and development initiatives to find
solutions for dengue.

Dengue fever cases rise to 17 in Townsville
-----------------------------------------------
Another person in the twin cities of Townsville and Thuringowa in
north Queensland has been confirmed to have dengue fever, taking the
number of cases 17.
The initial outbreak occurred in South Townsville at the end of last
month [March 2007].
The senior medical entomologist at Townsville's Tropical Population
Health Unit says work is continuing in the region to place mosquito
traps and remove potential breeding areas.
Gerhard Ehlers says he is expecting more cases to be confirmed before
the current outbreak is over.

Three deaths and more than 1000 officially registered cases of dengue
so far this year [2007] casts doubts on the Health Ministry's
prevention plan against the disease.
Meanwhile, the numbers point to a highly epidemic dengue situation --
because of climatologic changes -- that will require RD 50 million
[USD 1.55 million] more this year [2007] to monitor.
However, the Health Ministry's Primary Assistance vice-minister and
head of the Program against Dengue, Nelson Rodriguez, defends the
work and affirms that their plan began in January [2007]. He said
that for that reason, they decided to bolster the campaign for the
disease's prevention through the National Day against Dengue or D-day.
The mobilization, to take place on 17 Apr 2007, aims to eliminate
water deposits [breeding sites] of the mosquito that transmits the
dengue virus and to reduce the disease's mortality, which Rodriguez
considers to be very high.
The official said that D-day is officially constituted and is part of
the activities that stress the importance of social participation in
the fight against dengue. Rodriguez said epidemiology authorities,
provincial health directorates, city councils and neighbors
associations work to eliminate the breeding sites of the vector that
carries the dengue virus.
He added that among the measures to be adopted are the training of
all public and private health personnel and the creation of the
Dengue Handling Committee, which consists of grouping the dengue
patients in one same area of the health center to facilitate their monitoring.

Mexican officials are concerned about an alarming rise in dengue
fever, as cases have risen 600 percent in the country since 2001, and
they recently dispatched teams to coastal resorts to spray pesticides
and clear pockets of standing water where mosquitoes multiply. "It is
one of the primordial public health problems the country faces," one
Mexican health official told the AP.
Particularly concerning is an increase in deadly hemorrhagic dengue,
which now accounts for one in 4 cases.

[For ProMED readers who may not be familiar with the USA CDC's
Traveler's Health: Yellow Book, it is a good source of information
for the general public. Although the maps of dengue occurrence are
not current, they do vividly illustrate the worldwide reach of dengue
in tropical and sub-tropical areas around the globe.
The WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that
affects infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The
clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile
illness with rash (although some infants and very young children may
develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume,
and die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] is a potentially deadly complication
that is characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often
with enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory
failure. The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in
temperature accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific
constitutional symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues
for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly
with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF
cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In
severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after
a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of
circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical
state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no
specific treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical
management by experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the
lives of DHF patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy,
mortality may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
