Trichomoniasis is spread in the wild bird population often by well-meaning
people feeding birds. It takes only one badly infected bird to start the
spread of the protozoa parasite to others sharing the same feeding site
and/or water source. Most people, unfortunately, have no idea what this
disease is, how it is spread, or what part they may play in Trichomoniasis'
spread.
Infected birds will continue to attempt to eat seeds or drink water, even
though their throats are often blocked by the parasite, because they are
starving or dying of thirst, in addition to the infection.
The parasite multiplies within the animal, increasing its tumor-like mass
in the bird, while eating the bird's flesh (thus the smell), and usually
chokes off their throats, thus the inability to eat or drink.
When these infected birds regurgitate the seeds, the seeds are covered with
the 'infective ooze' caused by and containing the parasite. Other birds
then ingest these now deadly regurgitated seeds, become infected, and
repeat the same process, thus infecting bird after bird that shares the
same feeder or water source. Any nestlings are also infected with the
disease their parents have.
Any bird that comes in contact with the parasite can get the disease. Often
other wild birds that become infected and die with the disease -- like
doves -- aren't noticed, because they tend to go off and die 'in private,'
under bushes, and other more covered areas.
I just retired as a licensed wildlife rehabilitator, and I have received
woodpeckers, finches, sparrow, doves, hawks, you name it, with Trichomoniasis.
Once Trichomoniasis gets into the wild population, it can spread like
wildfire. Most of the time only doves and pigeons are found, for they tend
to die in the open, whereas other bird species seek cover when ill and
dying; but usually many other species of bird in the same area are also
infected and die.
Unfortunately, there is little public information or warnings regarding
what people can do to help prevent the spread of this disease, or at least
not contribute to it.
I wish all stores selling bird feeders and bird seed were required to
inform people about the disease, and give them an information pamphlet
about how it is spread, and what to do to prevent problems. Local news
media and state governments could also do more to inform the public about
this disease and how to prevent its spread.
At one time, in Tucson, Arizona, the news stations all did at least one
story about the problem every spring, but have not done so for at least 3
years. Local game and fish departments should really be doing more
proactive education and working with the news media to get this information
out.
People are going to feed birds no matter what is said, so it is important
for as many people as possible to know about this disease, its prevention,
and their part in it.
In addition, adult pigeons do die from the disease. Most birds that
contract the disease do die from it, but usually not before they have
spread it to other birds, including their young.
The disease can also spread to any part of the body (though usually stays
in the digestive tract). This protozoa parasite can also be spread through
droppings.
Trichomoniasis has been running rampant in my area (Tucson, Arizona). I've
seen cases all winter, which rarely happens. Usually Trichomoniasis rears
its ugly head in the spring, but this past year, it was ever-present.
I personally do not recommend using bird feeders and water bowls. I
recommend providing a trickling water source, with the water outlet
slightly off the ground (average bird beak height), where water does not
form a stagnant pool, so there is not a 'reservoir' of infected water.
Most birds like to drink water close to the source. The water does not
have to run all the time, but at least twice a day, and strongly enough to
flush away any potential protozoa; the flow soaks quickly into the ground.
If someone is going to provide seed, I recommend spreading the seed out
over a large area, in the sun, and vary the location to some degree daily.
The birds are less densely congregated, so one infected bird has less
chance of infecting other birds. One infected bird using a feeder can
leave the parasite on the feeder seed outlet, so not only are seeds the
bird has regurgitated covered with the parasite, but any bird feeding at
the bird feeder could pick up the disease. Bird feeders can increase the
number of birds infected.
Stores selling bird feeders don't like to hear this, but there is really
more money in selling seed over time anyway. I haven't addressed 'elitist'
feeders, who want to feed certain types of birds, but if they care about
the birds' lives, the feeders must go.
I do not write well, so I am hoping someone with heart and writing skills
might consider writing such an informative pamphlet that could be made
available to anyone, especially the local Game and Fish Departments, and
any type of 'feed stores.' I would be willing to share what I know, and
I'm sure others know more, or could add additional information.
