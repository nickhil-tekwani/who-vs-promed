Introduction
------------
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging threat for public health globally and can be a cause of severe respiratory infection in humans, especially those suffering other ailments. The disease is new to humans and was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia.

Dromedary camels are thought to be a natural reservoir of MERS-CoV and can be a source of infection for humans. Camels are widely spread throughout the world, mainly in arid areas, and serve important economic, livelihood, nutritional and social purposes.

MERS-CoV is transmitted from person to person through close contact, especially in healthcare settings. However, there is currently no evidence of sustained person-to-person spread. Additionally, no vaccine or specific treatment is currently available to prevent MERS-CoV transmission.

To date, 27 countries have reported human cases of MERS-CoV in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. Nevertheless, the majority of cases have so far occurred in Saudi Arabia where according to some studies - MERS-CoV has been circulating in camels since at least 1992. All cases and outbreaks outside of this region can be traced back to someone who travelled from the Middle East.

Dromedary Camels and MERS-CoV: filling knowledge gaps
-----------------------------------------------------
It is thought that MERS-CoV originally evolved from a bat coronavirus and jumped to dromedary camels some time ago. Dromedaries are considered the natural host for MERS-CoV, although it has also been found in alpacas living in close proximity to infected camels.

The challenges of MERS CoV at the human-animal interface can only be met using a One Health approach involving multi-sectoral collaboration, communication and cooperation.

FAO plays a coordinating role to reduce the risk of MERS-CoV at the human-animal interface by working with global partners such as the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The 3 organizations convene joint technical and expert meetings to advance knowledge and guide policy.

FAO monitors regularly the MERS-CoV situation in humans and animals, issues monthly updates, publishes qualitative risk assessments, provides access to information and knowledge, and promotes research development with relevant institutions to address knowledge gaps in the transmission of MERS-CoV in animals and from animals to humans.

Furthermore, FAO assists countries in developing communication strategies to ensure appropriate information reaches the public on MERS-CoV and avoid possible negative impacts on the livestock industry. FAO is currently implementing several projects on MERS -CoV in Africa and Middle East. Cross-sectional and longitudinal surveillance studies are being conducted in 4 countries - Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, and Kenya - at different nodes along the camel value chain including breeding herds, live camel markets, quarantine stations, and slaughterhouses. Camel value chain analyses are also being carried out to characterize the sector.

Approximately 75 laboratory staff in 3 national veterinary laboratories have been trained on MERS-CoV diagnostic testing while 50 field personnel received training in sample collection and transportation, clinical examinations and data collection.

In implementing the MERS-CoV projects, FAO works closely with funding partners (e.g. U.S. Agency for International Development - USAID), national governments, academic institutions, collaborating centers, and producer associations.

More studies are planned to better understand routes of transmission to humans, seasonality factors, and potential animal host species, including wildlife.

In addition, the collation of data that captures the distribution of virus circulation in countries with high camel population densities can offer opportunities to understand human 'spillover' events.

Information from these studies would be important also for identification and evaluation of socioeconomic factors that are associated with risk of MERS-CoV infection in camel populations.

[OIE's Case definition for the reporting of MERS-CoV in camels (as an emerging disease), has been updated in May 2017 (available at http://www.oie.int/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/mers-cov/).

According to the updated text, a dromedary camel may be laboratory confirmed as a positive case by virus isolation or detection of viral nucleic acid. The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confirmed by:
- a positive RT-PCR result on at least 2 specific genomic targets;
- a single positive target with sequencing of a second target;
or
- a single positive target with positive result in a rapid MERS CoV antigen test.

During its meeting of 7-10 Feb 2017, OIE's Biological Standards Commission noted that there was no chapter on MERS CoV in the Terrestrial Manual. As such a chapter would help OIE member countries in the laboratory confirmation of positive cases; the Commission recommended that the OIE ad hoc Group on MERS CoV develop a chapter in consultation with other MERS CoV experts. - Mod.AS
