Ebola Situation Report - 8 Apr 2015
-----------------------------------
Summary
-------
A total of 30 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 5 Apr 2015. This is the lowest weekly total since the 3rd week of May 2014. Case incidence in Guinea decreased to 21, compared with 57 confirmed cases the previous week. Liberia reported no confirmed cases. Sierra Leone reported a 5th consecutive weekly decrease from 25 confirmed cases in the week to 29 Mar 2015 to 9 in the week to 5 Apr 2015.

A total of 6 Guinean prefectures reported at least 1 confirmed case in the week to 5 Apr 2015, compared with 7 the previous week. Affected prefectures were in the western area, around and including the capital, Conakry. In total, 10 prefectures/districts in Guinea and Sierra Leone reported a confirmed case in the week to 5 Apr 2015, compared with 12 the previous week. Of 55 districts in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone that have reported at least one confirmed case of EVD since the start of the outbreak, 35 have not reported a case for over 6 weeks.

In the context of falling case incidence and a receding zone of transmission, treatment capacity exceeds demand in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Accordingly, and with technical guidance from WHO, national authorities in both countries have begun to implement plans for the phased safe decommissioning of surplus facilities. Each country will retain a core capacity of high-quality Ebola treatment centres, strategically located to ensure complete geographic coverage, with additional rapid-response capacity held in reserve.

Response indicators for Guinea continue to present a mixed picture. Of 19 confirmed deaths from EVD in the week to 5 Apr 2015, 7 (37 per cent) were identified post-mortem in the community, compared with 15 of 35 (43 per cent) the previous week. However, 21 unsafe burials were reported over the same period, compared with 20 the previous week. The proportion of confirmed cases that arose among registered contacts decreased slightly, from 53 per cent in the week to 22 March to 48 per cent in week to 29 Mar 2015. Taken together these data indicate that though surveillance is improving, unknown [undetected?] chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks.

In Sierra Leone, cases were reported from 4 western districts: Kambia (2 cases), Port Loko (1 case), Western Area Rural (1 case), and Western Area Urban (5 cases) which includes the capital, Freetown.

Sierra Leone reported 0 cases on 3 days during the week to 5 Apr 2015. The absence of any reported unsafe burials over the same period, the low proportion of all EVD-positive deaths (3 of 32: 9 per cent) that were identified in the community after post-mortem testing, and the low proportion of laboratory samples that tested EVD-positive (10 of 1524: 1 per cent) over the same period strengthen confidence that the downward trend in case incidence will be continued. However, the proportion of cases that arose among registered contacts fell for the 2nd consecutive week to 56 per cent in the week to 29 Mar 2015 (the most recent week for which data are available), suggesting that challenges remain. [This is unclear to me. There must be well over 100 registered contacts, so does this mean more than 56 have tested positive? But there were only 30 confirmed cases in the most recent week reported, see below. - Mod.JW]

The last confirmed case in Liberia died on 27 Mar 2015. Investigations are ongoing to establish the origin of infection. A total of 332 contacts associated with the case are being monitored. Heightened vigilance is being maintained throughout the country. In the week to 29 Mar 2015, 310 laboratory samples were tested for EVD, with no confirmed cases.

There were no new health worker infections in the week to 5 Apr 2015, with the cumulative total remaining at 861 since the start of the outbreak. In accordance with the 45-day reinforcement of emergency measures declared in western Guinea, several private clinics have been closed after EVD cases were treated on the premises.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
There have been a total of 25 515 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1 [tables and figures available at the source URL above]), with over 10 000 reported deaths (outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 21 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 0 in Liberia, and 9 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 5 Apr 2015.

The total number of confirmed and probable cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately three times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are 3-5 times more likely to be affected than are children.

A total of 861 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 499 reported deaths (table 5). -- more

[Before the surge of foreign health-care workers in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, African health workers rushed to serve in health-care facilities, many of which did not provide training for the job, nor did they have barrier-protection equipment.

Speaking of her co-workers, she said, "They started to die, one by one."]

[This article was written by a nurse working with Partners in Health. She brings up very difficult ethical issues being confronted in this outbreak where West Africans and Americans (and Europeans, etc.) are working side by side selflessly towards the same goal, to help with patient care. The distinction between their geographic origin becomes problematic only when they become ill, and different standards of care are applied. There is no easy answer, other than to bring the standard of care in West Africa up to the level in the developed world, and that is difficult. - Mod.LK]
