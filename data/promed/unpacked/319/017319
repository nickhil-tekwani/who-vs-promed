The cholera epidemic in Haiti, which emerged in October 2010, has caused up to today [27 Mar 2013] the deaths of 8053 people, according to the Ministry of Public Health and Population. Director of Epidemiology, Laboratory and Research of the ministry, Roc Magloire, said that in nearly 2.5 years, the number of people infected has amounted to 651 250. Currently, infection levels are high in the departments of Artibonite, North, and Central, the official said to reporters.

After studying new scientific evidence, it is more likely that the source of the outbreak has been a camp of soldiers of the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of Haiti from Nepal, an expert said last October 2012. A doctor from the United States, Daniele Lantagne, hired by the United Nations to study the situation, made the remarks after analysis of the complete genome sequence of the strain of cholera found in this country. Now we know that the strain of cholera in Haiti is an exact match with that of Nepal, she said.

Previous studies indicated that the disease was caused by a microorganism originally from Asia introduced by the above mentioned military.

Of the 10 million inhabitants of Haiti, only 2 per cent have access to drinking water; most of the population lives in unsanitary conditions and uses exposed places like rivers for their needs.

[It is likely that the disease will remain in Haiti for years to come, with case numbers exacerbated by times of flooding. The case fatality rate, using the numbers reported here, is 1.2 percent. - Mod.LL
