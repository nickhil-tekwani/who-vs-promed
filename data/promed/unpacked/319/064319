Re: Unknown illness, giant pandas - China: RFI
----------------------------------------------
At the moment there is a major shortage of bamboo in China. Pandas
are being forced to move form their normal locations in search of
food because at present the bamboo is flowering. This mass movement
could mean that there may be an increased chance of transmission of
disease if the normally solitary animals do meet.

An article outlining the major bamboo shortage, "Dying bamboo forces
migration of China pandas in search of their favorite food" by Henry
Sanderson, is available at
<http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gkQR8YFQNBiRQ4tlXHzZEy7BohPQ>.

[We are grateful to Catherine for her observation and for bringing
the article to our attention.

The article includes, among others, the following:

"Giant pandas are being forced to move from a remote mountainous area
in southwestern China due to food shortages as their staple bamboo
withers.

Most of the pandas' favorite arrow bamboo in a 193 000 square-mile
(500 000 sq km) region of Sichuan province is going through a
once-in-60-year cycle of flowering and dying before regenerating,
said Yang Xuyu, deputy head of the province's Wild Animal
Preservation Station. The pandas are moving to other areas of
Sichuan, which has about 40 reserves of various sizes.

"About 1200 pandas -- 80 percent of the surviving wild population in
China -- live in several mountainous areas of Sichuan." - Mod.AS]
