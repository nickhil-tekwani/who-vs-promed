Avian influenza in Korea (Rep. of)
--------------------
Information received on 24 Dec 2004 from Dr Chang-Seob Kim, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Animal Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry (MAF), Gwacheon:
Date of the report: 24 Dec 2004.
A heightened awareness campaign is being implemented from November 2004 to
February 2005 to prevent reintroduction and resurgence of highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI). As part of this campaign, sero-surveillance focused
on breeding and broiler ducks, considered as major reservoirs and important
risk factors for HPAI, is being conducted both in farms and
slaughterhouses, and virological tests are being carried out on faeces
sampled in migratory birds' habitats.
During this heightened sero-surveillance, avian influenza antibody-positive
samples were detected on 1 Dec 2004 in a breeding duck farm in Kwangju
Province through agar-gel precipitation (AGP) test carried out by the
Kwangju Provincial Veterinary Laboratory.
Following this finding and subsequent pathogenicity test, the National
Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service (NVRQS) identified this case by
23 Dec 2004 as low pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N2, through AGP
test, haemagglutinin inhibition test, neuraminidase inhibition test,
PCR(1), embryo inoculation and haemagglutinin cleavage site sequencing.
The NVRQS identified H5N2 subtype through serological tests and PCR on 22
Dec, and on 23 Dec confirmed low pathogenicity with a weak response in
embryo inoculation test and with the sequence of the amino acid at the
haemagglutinin cleavage site of PQKETK/GLF.
Approximately 13 000 ducks were being raised in this farm and no clinical
signs were found, there was no drop in the egg production rate, nor were
there any deaths.
In view of the fact that this is the 1st detection of H5N2 subtype in the
Republic of Korea, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry implemented
stamping out of the infected flock in accordance with the HPAI contingency
plan, and will further expand sero-surveillance to adjacent farms and
epidemiological contact farms as well as conduct an investigation into the
source of virus.

[It is important to note that this is an H5N2 strain, not the same H5N1
that caused huge economic losses beginning at this time in 2003.
Of course, the identification of a low pathogenicity strain is less
worrisome than a high pathogenicity strain. Previously, such low
pathogenicity strains were not reported to OIE, but in an effort to get
better surveillance on this very important disease, new regulations have
been adopted by OIE. See Mod.AS's comments in Avian influenza - Eastern
Asia (150) below.
Continued surveillance results will be important to ensure that a high
pathogenicity strain doesn't evolve from farms in which detection has not
yet occurred. - Mod.PC]
