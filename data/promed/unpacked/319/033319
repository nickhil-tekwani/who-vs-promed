Emergency Vaccination for FMD Still Not Ready
-----------------------------------------------------
The United Kingdom could not effectively tackle foot and mouth
disease using emergency vaccination if there was an outbreak,
according to a report published by the Royal Society.
The report recognizes that the U.K. government has already done
significant work, but it also identifies problems with the use of
emergency vaccination that urgently need to be resolved. There is
still no validation of the tests used to distinguish animals that
have been infected from those that have not been infected but which
have been vaccinated. There is also still uncertainty over how widely
to vaccinate to ensure an outbreak is contained. The decision process
by which preemptive action, either emergency vaccination or
slaughter, is deployed is also unclear.
The report is a follow-up review to the infectious diseases in
livestock inquiry chaired by Sir Brian Follett FRS and published in
July 2002. It highlights issues and concerns identified in a detailed
review of progress made on the recommendations since its publication.
