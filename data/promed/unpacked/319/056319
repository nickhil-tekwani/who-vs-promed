In Cameroon, 140 people have died of cholera since October 2021, the prime minister announced on Wednesday [25 May 2022], adding that more than 7000 cases have been reported since the resurgence of the disease.

"The updated epidemiological situation since October 2021 shows a total of 7287 notified cases, including 140 deaths," wrote Joseph Dion Ngute in a statement.

As of March [2022], 62 deaths with nearly 2100 cases had been recorded. According to the prime minister, new cases are mostly recorded in Littoral, whose capital is Douala, the economic capital, the West, and the English-speaking Southwest.

A vaccination campaign is planned for early June [2022] in the country, the government announced.

The previous outbreak of cholera killed 66 people in Cameroon between January and August 2020. In early 2021, the WHO estimated that there were 1.3 to 4 million cases of cholera and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths from the disease worldwide each year. "Safe oral cholera vaccines should be used in conjunction with an improved water supply and sanitation to limit cholera outbreaks and promote prevention in known high-risk areas," the UN agency said.

[2] Cholera: Mozambique (Zambezia)

Mozambique on Monday [23 May 2022] declared a cholera outbreak in central Zambezia province, an official confirmed, with no fatalities recorded.

Cholera was last recorded in the province in 2019. "Since the outbreak of acute diarrhoea started in Quelimane city, we have had a cumulative of 47 patients hospitalized," the province director of health services, Oscar Haward, told journalists at a press conference.

In April [2022], neighboring Sofala province recorded 30 cholera cases.

According to the WHO, cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. It remains a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequity and lack of social development.

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
