Best chilli farm threatened by wilt disease
------------------------------------------
The biggest bird's eye chilli farm in the country is being threatened
by the wilt disease. The 25 acre [10 ha] farm cultivated along the
banks of the Volta Lake at Kpando Tokor in the Volta Region will no
longer exist if immediate assistance is not given to the farmers in
the form of floating watering pumps, as the 3 pumping machine
stations have been submerged.

Twenty-five farmers are cultivating an acre [0.4 ha] of farm each
under the Kpando Tokor Irrigation Project. Dr Ben Dadzie, Millennium
Development Authority (MIDA), introduced the farmers to the bird's
eye chilli and educated them on the importance of the produce and the
worldwide demand for it. According to one of the farmers, the
customers came to buy the produce straight from their farms for
export. He said chilli, which had a very high medicinal value, was
also used as pepper spray for self defence.

[Bird's eye chilli is a variety of _Capsicum_ with extremely pungent,
tiny pods. Both bacterial (_Ralstonia solanacearum_) and fungal
(_Fusarium_ and _Verticillium_ species) wilt diseases are known to
cause yield losses of capsicum crops. Disease development and spread
of these pathogens is likely to be favoured by the wet conditions
described above. (For more information on the pathogens see previous
ProMED-mail posts in the archives.)
