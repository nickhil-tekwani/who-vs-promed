Avian diphtheria hits yellow-eyed penguins
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of avian diphtheria has hit southern Otago Peninsula
yellow-eyed penguins. The outbreak comes at a critical stage for chicks
that have recently hatched and is requiring some hands-on care by the
Department of Conservation [DOC].

DOC ranger Mel Young said avian diphtheria seemed to hit the penguins every
2nd year and samples from as many chicks as possible were being sent to
Massey University's wildlife unit for testing. It appeared the chicks
caught a virus and then contracted the diphtheria as a secondary disease.
In the meantime, affected chicks were being given antibiotics and fluids in
an effort to encourage them to eat, as those who died usually suffered from
renal failure or from not eating. "So far so good. We have had some die but
some are responding and are eating and putting on some weight." The next
week or 2 would be critical for the penguins, she said.

Monitoring had found 422 nests from North Otago to the Catlins, with many
chicks now about 1 or 2 weeks old, ranger Young said. Nest numbers were up
in the Catlins and about the same as the past 2 seasons in other sites.

Aside from the diphtheria outbreak, there had been a few "early losses" of
chicks and those bodies had been sent to Massey for necropsy.

A lot of older birds up to 20 years old were still "getting it on" and
birds as young as 2 had joined the breeding population, Ms Young said.

At Sandfly Bay, where there had been concerns about the public impact on
the penguins, nest numbers were up to 10, although 2 had failed.

"Several new birds have entered the breeding population. The measures we
have taken are improving the situation." A lot of juveniles had been seen
on the region's beaches, including one spot that had attracted 12 to 18.
"That is amazing. Hopefully, they'll hang on and get through moult." A pair
of yellow-eyed penguins, an adult and a juvenile, had been visiting
Karitane beach regularly since the end of October [2010]. Historical
reports had noted penguins on the beach, although a bird was killed there
by a dog 2 years ago, she said. "They seem to be settling in, which is very
exciting." The community was keeping a close eye on the birds and it was
hoped they would settle and start breeding there, she said.

DOC would be closing Boulder Beach from 1 Dec 2010 to 28 Feb 2011 to allow
the chicks born there to grow uninterrupted by the public.

[Fowl pox (avian diphtheria, pox, canker) occurs worldwide in all poultry
species and all ages. It is caused by avian pox viruses. Pox viruses are
single, linear, double stranded DNA viruses, which cause chronic disease in
poultry of all species and age.

Mosquito bites and mechanical transmission of virus to lacerated skin or
eye are common routes of viral spread. Wild birds are a reservoir for the
viruses.

Incubation period is from 4-10 days. They are 2 forms of the disease, the
cutaneous (dry) or diphtheritic (wet). Both may be present in the same
flock or animals.

The dry form shows as a pimple or scab on skin (mainly comb, wattles,
eyelids, and other unfeathered portions of the body).

The law (mouth) shows diphtheritic form mucous, yellow lesions, or canker
in mouth, esophagus or trachea. Eye involvement (blindness), off feed,
lower egg production, facial swelling, and an increase in cull can be seen.

Postmortem lesions: canker or false membranes in mouth are seen as slightly
elevated white opaque nodules. Nodules increase in size and coalesce to
yellow, cheesy, and necrotic membranes. Gray or black papular eruption on
unfeathered portions of skin (dry) are due to epithelial hyperplasia.

Head, face, and feet are most commonly affected, but may spread to portions
of the feathered body.

Diagnosis: eliminate bacterial dermatitis. Virus isolation on CAM
(corioallantoic membrane) will produce plaque, which will reveal
intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Gross lesions will reveal inclusion
bodies. Presence of scales on skin and canker in the mouth in the fall of
the year is an important characteristic of the disease.

Prevention: the normal procedure is to vaccinate once in the wing web
between 8-18 weeks of age. In areas with extreme infection pressure,
broilers may be vaccinated at day old. Vaccinate replacement pullets 10-12
weeks (wing web) and again at 16-18 weeks to provide long term immunity.
Examine site of injection 1 week later for vaccine take (scab).

Control mosquitoes with insecticides and by getting rid of all standing
water (pounds, etc), where mosquitoes may breed.

Treatment: broad spectrum antibiotics are helpful to control secondary
bacteria. How practical it is to use broad spectrum antibiotics on penguin
chicks may be questionable. However, if this colony were in more serious
danger, likely some methods of control would attempted.
