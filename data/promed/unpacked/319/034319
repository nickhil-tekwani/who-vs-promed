Potato nematode found in several Khakasian villages
---------------------------------------------------
Rosselkhoznadzor [Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and
Phytosanitary Surveillance] has informed us that patches of
agricultural land have been found infected with golden potato nematode.

The infected area will be put under quarantine. The land has to be
treated with special chemicals after the tops of the potato plants
have been burnt. The export and sale of potatoes from this area will
be banned without a special certificate; however local potatoes can be
used for food locally. Some possibly infected batches of potatoes have
been sent to Krasnoyarsk [neighbouring region] from Ust-Abakanskoe
district.

The same nematode had been found previously in Tashtipskoe district in
September [2009] where currently phytosanitary measures are in place.
Altayskoe and Askizskoe districts will be checked for this nematode in
2010.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and
pale (_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop
losses in potato. They can also infect other solanaceous crops and
weeds, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on potato
include stunting, yellowing, and wilting of leaves as well as a
reduced root system. Damage to the crop varies from small patches of
poor growing plants to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first
occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop.

The nematodes are not greatly influenced by soil type and temperature.
They can survive in soil, in the absence of a host, for up to 20 years
as cysts containing viable eggs. Spread occurs via infected soil,
water, wind, or on plant material. Disease management includes
exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host species, and use of crop
cultivars resistant to specific PCN races. An integrated approach
using these measures as well as nematicides (as fumigants or granular
systemic compounds; likely to be the 'chemicals' mentioned above) can
be used to keep nematode levels below economic thresholds. Both PCNs
have been included on the alert list of the European Plant Protection
Organisation (EPPO).

Golden PCN is widely distributed in the Eurasian area. Pale PCN has
never been reported from Russia or its immediate neighbours. Recent
PCN reports from Russia (see ProMED-mail posts listed below) include
locations well separated by distance and are not likely to be due to
recent spread because PCNs need 6-7 years to build up numbers
sufficient for detection. It may be possible that the infections could
be due to contaminated seed potatoes distributed from a central source
in the past.
