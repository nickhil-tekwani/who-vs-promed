Mumps update: Nova Scotia, Canada
---------------------------
Nova Scotia continues to investigate an outbreak of mumps. There have
been 157 laboratory confirmed or clinical cases reported in 7 of 9
District Health Authorities across the province since the outbreak
began in late Feb 2007. [This represents 37 additional cases since
the last update of 20 Apr 2007. - Mod.LM] The majority of cases (88
percent) have been reported in Capital District Health Authority. The
age range of cases is 6 to 62 with a median age of 21.5 years.
Females represent slightly more than half (56 percent) of all cases.
Public health measures continue to include self-isolation of cases
for a period of 9 days following onset of symptoms. Close household
or intimate contacts have been offered MMR based on their vaccination
history. No decision has been made yet on vaccination strategies to
improve the herd immunity within this population. Isolation and
quarantine guidelines have been developed for health care workers who
are cases or contacts of mumps. Additional information regarding the
outbreak is now on the Nova Scotia Health Promotion and Protection
website:
