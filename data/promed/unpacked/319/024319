South Korea's agriculture ministry said on Wednesday [5 May 2021] that it has confirmed an African swine fever (ASF) [outbreak], marking the first one of the highly contagious and deadly animal disease in 7 months. According to the ministry, pigs at a farm in Gangwon Province were infected with the deadly animal disease, prompting the authorities to cull 401 animals, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. The country also issued a special 48-hour travel ban on livestock-related facilities in Gangwon Province and the surrounding Gyeonggi Province and North Chungcheong Province.

In 2019, ASF swept through pig farms in northern regions covering Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces, prompting authorities to cull about 400 000 pigs nationwide as part of preventive measures. A total of 14 farms were infected.

Although no new ASF cases had been reported from local farms, the virus was prevailing among wild boars, which can potentially infect domestic pigs through contact. More than 780 cases of ASF from wild boars from the border areas, leading the authorities to cull more than 3000 wild boars [see comment below].

ASF does not affect humans but is deadly to pigs. There is currently no vaccine or cure for the disease.

[South Korea confirmed its 1st outbreak of ASF in September 2019. Local authorities have applied severe control measures, including stamping out, quarantine, and a nationwide ban of swill feeding to pigs. This policy has been successful in preventing losses to the local domestic pig farms.

A continuous circulation of the virus is being reported from the wild boar population along the inter-Korean border since early October 2019 (20191004.6710566), leading to the application of eradication measures. The confirmed cases are periodically reported to the OIE.

The ongoing panzootic of ASF started in April 2007 in the Caucasus region. The first foci were discovered in western Georgia, in the vicinity of the Black Sea port-city of Poti. Initial diagnosis attempts, in Georgia, excluded ASF. The virus continued its uncontrolled spread until it was (unofficially) identified on 30 May 2007 in the Agrarian University of Ukraine, Kiev, where PCR tests were successfully applied. Official diagnosis, based upon virus isolation, ELISA, and RT-PCR, was accomplished at the OIE reference laboratory, Pirbright, on 4 Jun 2007, 2 days after arrival of the samples. Later genotyping revealed that the most likely source of the strain was the eastern side of Southern Africa. ASF is regarded endemic in sub-Saharan Africa.

It is assumed that local pigs in Georgia had access to contaminated waste from ships. The delayed diagnosis allowed a wide spread of the virus within Georgia and into other countries in the Caucasus, eventually becoming a panzootic. ASF, against which no vaccine is available, is currently circulating in wild boars and domestic pigs from the Pacific in the east to East-Germany in the west. Luckily, this virus is not zoonotic; its economic impact is huge.

A recent media report informs about ASF's continued spread in the Philippines (https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1139003).

The link to the useful OIE global ASF outbreak map, included in previous postings, could not be detected; the previous links, in ProMED reports, have become inactive. ProMED and subscribers will be grateful for a (revised?) issuance/link.

The most recent issue of the biweekly "ASF Asia and Pacific -- FAO EMPRES Situation Update" was distributed on 29 Apr 2021; it is available at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/Situation_update.html. It included the following information about new measures in South Korea:
"The central ASF management center/MAFRA is enforcing efforts
1) to reduce the number of wild boars by intensive hunting (March-April) along with intensive search for carcasses by increasing hunting teams during hunting season (10 Mar-30 Apr 2021);
2) to ensure biosecurity in farms through fielding joint force by central and local government inspecting facilities of pig farms (national wide, total 5529 households)."

The next issue of the said update will be published on Thu 13 May 2021. - Mod.AS]
