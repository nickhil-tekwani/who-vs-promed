2 million animals in the queue for death
-----------------------------------------
[There is clearly a difference in opinion on the data. However...
As Tony Blair and his deputy, John Prescott, toured the countryside
yesterday, reassuring the public that Britain was getting back to normal,
the astonishing scale emerged of the backlog of animals still to be
slaughtered and disposed of because of the foot and mouth epidemic. The
number has risen steeply to 2 million, half a million more than 5 days ago,
the last time official figures were available. It will take at least
another 6 weeks to clear the backlog as the government gets further and
further behind in coping with the crisis.
The majority of animals waiting to be killed, around 1.6 million, are
urgent welfare cases -- stranded on farms and on hills where their
condition is deteriorating because they cannot be moved to shelter for
lambing or new grass. But worse, from the point of view of controlling the
epidemic, are the 400 000 animals that have been in close contact with the
disease and which are supposed to be killed within 48 hours as a
precaution. Many are still alive for up to a week simply because there is
nowhere to dispose of their carcasses.
There are also 366 000 unburied and decomposing carcasses littering the
countryside in areas which would normally be welcoming tourists at this
time of year. These "carcasses yet to be disposed of" figures were removed
last weekend from the Ministry of Agriculture's website to hide the extent
of the problem.
All infected animals are supposed to be killed within 24 hours and those on
neighboring farms, normally involving 5 times as many animals, within 48
hours -- but this is not happening.
The inability to kill all the livestock that may be affected risks a
resurgence of the disease, Mr Blair has been told by Professor David King,
the government's chief scientist. The emphasis has been on killing infected
animals to stop the disease spreading. Despite the failure to carry out the
firebreak cull on neighboring farms this policy appears to work. Only 33
new cases were identified on Thursday and just 26 by yesterday afternoon,
bringing the total to 1084.
There were signs that the disease is still spreading into the heart of
Britain's national parks and centers of tourism in the Lake District and
Peak District of Derbyshire. In the Lake District several hundred sheep
were found infected west of Penrith near Skiddaw mountain. Vets were last
night also investigating the source of an outbreak of foot and mouth
disease in the Scottish borders, 30 miles from the nearest previously
confirmed outbreak.
