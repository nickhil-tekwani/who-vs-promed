Rift Valley fever in Saudi Arabia: Update, Fri 6 Oct 2000
---------------------------------------------------------
This update is based on reports appearing in the Arab News of 4, 5 and 6
Oct 2000. By this morning [6 Oct 2000 the official death toll has reached
57. On Wed 4 Oct 2000, the death toll was still reported as 52, whereas
yesterday [5 Oct 2000 the number of deaths had risen to 54. Latest reports
give the total of affected persons to be 258, with 8 people recovered and
discharged from hospital.
The 4 Oct 2000 edition of Arab News announced that there was to be a
seminar on Rift Valley fever at Jizan, but no reports of the proceedings
have appeared in the paper, either today or yesterday. However, the Health
Minister, Osama Shubokshi, was quoted as denying that Rift Valley fever
virus had been present in Jizan since 1999. He was responding to a remark
by an unnamed expert in a recent seminar [possibly the seminar in Jzan
that Rift Valley fever virus may have been prevalent in the Kingdom since
early last year.
