HEPATITIS B AND ASESTHETICS (2)
===============================
Educational materials put out by a project that is a joint effort of
Schering-Plough and the American Liver Foundation lists "frequent manicures"
as a risk factor for HBV and/or HCV infection. (I can't recall the name of
the project right now, but they send out posters and pamphlets to us all the
time.) I was curious enough about this when I first saw it to do some
checking, and I could find no studies to support it [the conclusions--Mod.].
Colleagues whose experience in viral hepatitis transmission research predates
my own could not recall any previous discussions of manicure as a potential
mode of transmission.
For HBV, however, manicure/pedicure would be at least a theoretical
source of infection. Both procedures often involve the cutting of cuticles,
which can produce some blood loss. If instruments are not cleaned between
clients, transmission would be possible. It is instructive to visit "nail
shops" which specialize in manicures to see just how this might work.
Manicurists often sit at stations using one set of instruments, and they can
"treat" a large number of clients in a very short time. Given the lower
transmissibility of HCV, I would think it extremely unlikely with this virus.

Another bit of information that might be helpful: Last year sometime
the magazine Consumer Reports did a study of commercial manicures. Among the
standards that they defined for a "good" manicure was that the manicurist did
*not* use scissors or other sharp objects to cut cuticles. I don't recall
whether this was because of concern about transmission of disease or for other
reasons. In their study, however, many of the professional manicurists did
cut cuticles with scissors.
