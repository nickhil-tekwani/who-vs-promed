Re: Case fatality rate vs. mortality
-----------------------------------
All too often I see in your posts that what is a case fatality ratio is dubbed as "mortality." Of course, the error is widespread, even in the scientific literature, e.g. in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.

In our courses on medical statistics, epidemiology, and public health, we teach that flu, malaria, etc. have a much higher mortality than Ebola, SARS, MERS, rabies, etc. All of the latter have higher CFRs than the former. The statement: "The mortality for EBoV in Liberia was 50 percent" implies that there were about one million persons who died in Liberia [in a year] on account of EBoV."

Being more familiar with Italian than with English, I checked with British and American dictionaries, and I got the impression that in English, as it is in Italian, "fatality" and "mortality" have different meanings. So it is in the 5th edition of "A dictionary of epidemiology," edited for the International Epidemiological Association by Miquel Porta, 2008.

Journal editors and referees should insist that authors use the right terms in their papers.

[Professor Urbano is correct. Case fatality refers to the proportion of cases that have died, where as disease mortality refers to the proportion of the overall population that have died from the disease. If one takes MERS-CoV infection as an example: With an estimated population of 28.83 million in 2013 (including estimated foreign workers), as of 23 Nov 2014, with a total of 809 cases of MERS-CoV infected individuals including 346 deaths confirmed by Saudi Arabia, the MERS-CoV case fatality rate in Saudi Arabia is currently 42.8 percent, whereas the overall mortality rate due to MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia is 2.8 per 100 000 population (or 0.0028 percent). - Mod.MPP]
