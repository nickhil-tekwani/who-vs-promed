Officials in Badakhshan province say dozens of people and cattle have
contracted anthrax. Maulvi Fazl Rahman, a member of the Badakhshan
Provincial Council, said on Saturday [13 Sep 2008] the disease had
broken out in several villages of the Yawan district.

Residents and health officials confirmed the spread of the fatal
disease in Yustan, Tayal and Alat villages. Several animals died of
the disease, while some people are under treatment in Badakhshan.

A resident of Alat said 60 people had caught the ailment in his
village alone. He demanded urgent medical aid from government and
humanitarian agencies.

Dr Najla Zarifi, medical superintendent of the Faizabad Civil
Hospital, confirmed receiving dozens of anthrax patients, but she did
not put a figure on them. The disease is not new in Badakhshan, as
people with similar symptoms have been visiting hospitals for the
last 6 months. Zarifi said 2 men from Argo district died of the
[bacterium] last month. She sought immediate aid and medicine from
the central government as well as international health organizations
to prevent further spread of anthrax in the far-flung province.

[Livestock and human anthrax is an ongoing problem in Afghanistan not
made any easier by the fighting, poor communications, and severe
deficiencies in support funding for human medical and veterinary
services and facilities.
