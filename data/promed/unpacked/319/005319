I ran this [set of clinical and laboratory findings for the cases of acute
pulmonary-renal syndrome past GIDEON <http://www.cyinfo.com> and came up
with the following.
Further positive AND negative clinical data would be very useful here.
Assuming that both cases are 1) related; 2) acquired in Saudi Arabia (i.e.,
not the Netherlands); and 3) a single infectious disease, the differential
diagnosis should include:
GIDEON Clinical Summary
+ The patient is an adult
+ Severely ill or requires hospitalization
+ Neutrophilia
- Thrombocytopenia
- Hepatic dysfunction
+ Renal dysfunction
+ Case cluster - common source or factor
Begining of exposure: 14 days prior to admission
End of exposure: 4 days prior to admission
Onset of disease: 3 days prior to admission
Diseases Probability:
Legionellosis 73.8%
Septicemia - bacterial 13.5%
Leptospirosis 12.4%
Influenza
Dengue *
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever **
Typhoid and enteric fever
_Escherichia coli_ diarrhea
Varicella
Malaria ***
Q fever ****
An additional 10 possibilities are given low probability. The Hantaviruses
are in fact clinically compatible, but discounted by GIDEON for lack of
known presence in Saudi Arabia.
Additional notes:
* Dengue was once prevalent. A fatal case of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
was reported in Jeddah in 1969 (possibly introduced). 315 cases (suspected
and confirmed) were registered in 1994, including 2 nonfatal cases of DHF
in Jeddah.
** Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was first reported in Saudi Arabia in
1990 (an outbreak among abattoir workers in Mecca).
- Sporadic cases have been registered in Mecca and elsewhere in the Western
Province, Jeddah and Taif. Serological testing subsequently identified 40
cases (12 fatal) which occurred during 1989 to 1990.
- The local reservoirs are sheep and goats. Ticks present on imported sheep
(particularly from Sudan) have been implicated as the source for infection
in this country.
- Seropositivity rates (1994 to 1996) among imported sheep are 4.1%, goats
3.2%, cattle 0.6% - and 0.8% for persons working with imported livestock.
*** Malaria: _Plasmodium falciparum_ accounts for 80% to 90% of cases.
Chloroquine-resistant _P. falciparum_ IS reported among expatriates (as of
1997, from Pakistan and Sudan). Rare instances of autochthonous
chloroquine-resistant _P. falciparum_ have been reported.
- Disease risk exists year-round in the southwest, except southern Asir,
Jeddah, Mecca, Medina and Taif. 52% of cases are reported from Gizan, 31%
from Asir and 17% from the western region. Transmission is highest in the
south and southwest, during and following the rainy months.
- 15,167 cases were reported in 1982; 17,956 in 1983; 11,091 in 1984;
16,242 in 1985; 12,975 in 1986; 17,650 in 1987 (94% _P. falciparum_); 9,797
in 1988; 6,475 in 1989; 15,666 in 1990. 9,962 cases were reported in 1991;
19,623 in 1992 (of these, approximately 1,300 were imported); 18,380
(320/100,000) in 1993 - 74% of these autochthonous and 85% due to _P.
falciparum_; 10,032 in 1994 (true number estimated at 75,000 with 150
deaths); 18,751 in 1995; 21.007 in 1996; 20,631 in 1997.
- At least 5 Anophelene vectors are active, including _An. stephensi_ in
Eastern Province, and _An. arabiensis_ along Red Sea coast and southwestern
tip. The principal vectors are _Anopheles sergentii_, throughout the
country; _An. pharoensis_ (on the west coast); and _An. pulcherrimus_, _An.
gluviatilis_ and _An. stephensi_ in the northeast.
**** Q-fever: During the late 1960s, 8.4% of persons over 5 years of age
were seropositive (Riyadh).
- The disease is known to occur livestock, and in Arabian oryx (_Oryx
leucoryx_).

[Many thanks to Dr. Berger who is a regular contributor to ProMED-mail. His
extraordinary program, GIDEON, is well know to our subscribers for
regularly providing the type of detailed epidemiologic data to ProMED-mail
that is present in Dr. Berger's communication, above. It should also be
noted, as in this report, that GIDEON is able to provide a list of
infectious diseases that are compatible with the clinical and epidemiologic
picture in descending order of probability on the basis of the database and
the use of Bayesian analysis. - Man. Ed. DS

The Associate Infectious and Parasitic Disease Knowledge base suggests a
differential of Hantavirus infection, meningococcal infection and
_Legionella_ infection for the diseases known to occur in Saudi Arabia. We
have insufficient data on another disease caused by Fakeev Virus (Saudi
Mystery Disease), therefore we can not rule this disease in or out.

[We look forward to additional contributions from individuals who have
access to databases of infectious diseases. We would be interested in
finding out more about the knowledge base to which Dr. Ronald refers. -
