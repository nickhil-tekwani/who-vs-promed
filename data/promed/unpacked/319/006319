A second toxin-producing bacterium was detected on a valve at a Snow Brand
Milk Products Co. plant in Osaka whose low-fat and calcium-enriched milk
products have caused widespread food poisoning in western Japan, Osaka city
officials said Friday.
Snow Brand officials detected the _Bacillus cereus_ on the valve at its
Miyakojima Ward plant on 29 Jun 2000, two days before the company held a
news conference to say the valve had been found contaminated with
_Staphylococcus aureus_. The company did not mention the discovery of
_Bacillus cereus_ [at that time.

[Some strains of _Bacillus cereus_ produce emetic and enterotoxins that can
be responsible for foodborne outbreaks, and this threat is well known in
the dairy industry because of the frequent presence of _B. cereus_ spores
in pre-pasteurization dairy products. A Canadian study suggests that most
_B. cereus_ contaminants of pasteurized milk are the progeny of germinated
spores that were present prior to pasteurization rather than contaminants
introduced during the processing of milk products (1). Strains capable of
producing toxins at low temperatures have been identified (2). This article
does not indicate that the foodborne outbreak associated with dairy
products in Osaka was caused by _B. cereus_, but we have not seen data
confirming the toxin as of staphylococcal origin either. It sounds as if
some careful microbiological analysis will be required to fully understand
this Japanese outbreak.
