[The current epizootic of NCD in Israel reportedly started on 29 Sep
2011. Until 1 Jan 2012 (follow-up report no. 6), 27 foci have been
reported throughout the country; see, with map, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11071.

The current epizootic was preceded by an epizootic which reportedly
started on 14 Dec 2010 and was declared "resolved" on 28 Jul 2011 with
84 officially reported foci accumulated during its course (see, with
an interactive map, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10057).

Infected poultry flocks are culled according to the official stamping
out policy and legal stipulations (figures of destroyed birds are of
7-digits, compensations accordingly).

For the English translation of Israel's Animal Disease Regulations
(Newcastle Disease), 1970 (revised 2000), which prescribe also
compulsory vaccinations, please go to

Is this situation indicative of failure of the vaccines applied, of
their application performance, or due to other reasons? - Mod.AS]
