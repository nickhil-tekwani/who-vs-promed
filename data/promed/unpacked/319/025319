Somalia hadn't had a case of polio for nearly 6 years. But in the past few months, the virus has come back. Now the East African country has the worst polio outbreak anywhere in the world.

20 new cases of polio were reported this week in Somalia by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. That brings the total number of cases in the Horn of Africa to 73. The rest of the world combined has tallied only 59 cases so far this year [2013].

Health workers are worried that the virus could gain a foothold in the Horn of Africa and jeopardize the multibillion-dollar effort to wipe out the virus worldwide. The last time polio struck Somalia, the virus spread across the Horn of Africa into Yemen and eventually over into Southeast Asia.

Until this recent outbreak, global efforts to eradicate polio appeared to be making remarkable progress. Last year [2012], the number of children paralyzed by polio hit a record low at 223. This year [2013], it was looking like there were going to be even fewer cases. The last significant pockets of the virus appeared to be isolated in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. Then in May [2013], a 2 year old girl in Mogadishu became the 1st confirmed case of polio in Somalia in more than 6 years.

The number of polio cases in Somalia is increasing by the day, says Dr Nasir Yusuf, who leads UNICEF's immunization efforts in eastern and southern Africa. Part of the problem, he says, is that the majority of children in Somalia have never been immunized against polio. "We have an outbreak in a population that has been quite vulnerable for quite some time," Yusuf says. Somalia has the 2nd worst rate of polio vaccination in the world after Equatorial Guinea, according to the World Health Organization.

In response to the current outbreak, there have been 5 emergency polio immunization campaigns in Somalia since May [2013]. The Somali government directs the campaigns, but it doesn't control or have access to vast swaths of the country. Some of the most recent polio cases have occurred in areas that are considered off limits to vaccination teams.

Underscoring the lack of security in the region even for health workers, 2 health workers with Medecins Sans Frontieres [Doctors Without Borders] were freed this week after having been held hostage in Somalia for almost 2 years. The women had been working in the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya, where 8 new polio cases were reported in May [2013].

The current outbreak is forcing governments throughout the region, including parts of the Middle East, to launch supplemental vaccination drives, Yusuf says, because polio is capable of spreading quickly. "A week after the virus was reported in south central Somalia, one of the viruses got into the Somali refugee camp in the most eastern part of Kenya," he says. "So that tells you how fast this virus made it."

Editor's note:
According to WHO, the 1st polio case in the outbreak actually occurred [30 Apr 2013], in Kenya. Then the 2nd case was confirmed [9 May 2013] in Somalia. Either way, the outbreak spanned a vast geographic area quickly.

The virus reproduces inside the human gut, and many people carry it but show no symptoms. This give the virus the opportunity to travel long distances inside people and then get shed into the environment through feces. WHO traced the poliovirus in Somalia to one in West Africa. Nigeria is the only place there where polio is still endemic.

Before these cases in the Horn of Africa, the end of the multibillion-dollar effort appeared to be in sight. The Somali outbreak is now forcing UNICEF, WHO and other international agencies to dedicate vast resources to boost polio vaccination coverage throughout East Africa and parts of the Middle East. Those are resources that can't be used to attack the virus in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria, which appeared, until now, to be the last few places where polio had a foothold.

Data in WHO as of 17 Jul 2012 for 2012 data and 16 Jul 2013 for 2013 data.

Highlights: Polio this week - As of 17 Jul 2013
- The outbreak in the Horn of Africa is expanding, with 21 newly-reported cases (one from Kenya, 20 from Somalia). In Somalia, 2 immunization campaigns have been conducted since the most recent case occurred. Outbreak response activities are continuing, and planning and approaches continue to be strengthened.
- Update on WPV in environmental samples in Israel: WPV1 has now been isolated in 30 sewage samples from 10 sampling sites in Israel. The samples were collected between February and June 2013. All viruses have been detected in sewage only; no cases of paralytic polio have been reported. Health authorities in Israel are continuing to conduct a full epidemiological and public health investigation. The Government of Israel is planning supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with OPV to boost mucosal immunity levels to rapidly interrupt virus circulation.

Afghanistan
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 3. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013] (WPV1 from Nangarhar).
- All 3 WPV cases this year [2013] were reported from the Eastern Region, with links to both WPV1 in 2013 from neighbouring areas of Pakistan and WPV1 in 2012 from Afghanistan. In the high-risk Southern Region, no WPV cases have been reported since November 2012.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).

Nigeria
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 35. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [18 Jun 2013] (WPV1 from Bauchi).
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [24 Nov 2012] (from Kebbi).

Pakistan
- Three new WPV cases were reported in the past week (WPV1s from Khyber Agency and North Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas - FATA, and in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa - KP), bringing the total number of WPV cases for 2013 to 21. The case from Peshawar is the most recent WPV in the country, and had onset of paralysis on [30 Jun 2013].
- No new cVDVP2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 5. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [8 May 2013] (from Gadap town, greater Karachi, Sindh).
- FATA is the major WPV1 reservoir in Pakistan at the moment. Bara in Khyber Agency is particularly affected. This outbreak is threatening progress achieved elsewhere in the country and in neighbouring Afghanistan.
- In 2011 and 2012, Bara was the epicentre of a major outbreak which also spread to other areas.
- The new case in North Waziristan is particularly concerning, as it is in an area where immunizations have been suspended by local leaders since last June [2012]. Immunizations in neighbouring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak. North Waziristan is also affected by cVDPV2 cases.
- Confirmation of these latest cases underscores the risk ongoing polio transmission (be it due to WPV or cVDPV) in the country continues to pose to children everywhere, and in particular to children living in areas where access has not been possible for extended periods of time.

Central Africa: Chad and Cameroon
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
- In Cameroon, one new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 to 2. This latest case had onset of paralysis on [27 May 2013], from Extreme-Nord. The 1st case had onset of paralysis on [9 May 2013], also from Extreme-Nord.

Horn of Africa
- 21 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week (one from Dadaab, Kenya, and 20 from Somalia), bringing the total number of WPV1 cases in the region to 73 (65 WPV1s from Somalia and 8 WPV1s from Kenya). The most recent case in the region had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2013] (the newly-reported case from Kenya).
- In Somalia, 2 immunization campaigns have been conducted since the most recent case occurred.
- Some of the new cases are from inaccessible areas of south-central Somalia. More than 600 000 children are particularly vulnerable to polio in this area. Vaccination posts are being set up in areas bordering inaccessible areas to immunize all populations entering/leaving such areas (including targeting older age groups). Assessments of high-risk areas and populations continue to be conducted, including mapping chronic conflict-areas and major population movement routes. Local-level access negotiations have intensified to increase access to populations in inaccessible areas.
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa continues to be implemented. In Somalia, campaigns were held on [1-6 Jul 2013]. Planning is underway for NIDs during Ramadan on [21-24 Jul 2013]. Specific radio messages are being developed with the involvement of the Ministry of Religious Affairs.
- In Kenya, activities were conducted on [1-10 Jul 2013], with the next campaigns planned for August [2013]. In Ethiopia, activities were held on [5-9 Jul 2013] to be followed by the next round in August [2013]. In Yemen, the next campaigns are planned for late August [2013].

West Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].

[Since the last update (data from 10 Jul 2013), the total number of cases has increased by 24 cases, from 108 to 132, with 20 additional cases reported in Somalia, 3 cases in Afghanistan (all identified in the preceding week), and one case in Kenya. Of concern is the number of newly identified cases in Somalia, 20 in the past week, and 20 in the week preceding (see prior ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis update (14): Israel, environmental samples, global 20130715.1826123). The fact that these cases have occurred in areas that are not accessible (due to security risks) is of significant concern, as it hinders effective control measures now as well as prevention of future outbreaks and ultimate interruption of WPV circulation in the area.

The continued occurrence of CVDPV cases (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus), most recently in Cameroon, is an indicator of low vaccination coverages, and highlights concerns regarding the risk of introduction of WPV into countries where there are cVDPV cases.
