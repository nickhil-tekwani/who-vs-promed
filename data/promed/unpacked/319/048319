The CDC is helping Arizona and Mexico health authorities investigate
a diarrhea outbreak. It started back in May 2011.

"We've seen some increases in our campylobacter infections, which is
a real fancy name for a diarrheal kind of infection," said Becky
Brooks, director of the Yuma County Public Health Services District.
"It causes diarrhea, sometimes abdominal pain, and fever."

Brooks said there have been 36 cases in Yuma County in the past 2
months. Normally, there are 28 cases in an entire year. 15 cases also
are being studied in the northern Mexican state of Sonora which
borders Arizona. 6 of the Yuma cases have developed into
Guillain-Barre syndrome, which, Brooks said, "is relatively rare."

"It is a condition that can sometimes lead to paralysis in
individuals."

Officials have not determined how the outbreak started or whether it
originated in Arizona or Mexico. "We don't know that part of it,"
Brooks said. "We are just now finding out all the cases and if there's
any kind of connection. We really don't have a source yet. That's what
we're working toward." She said there's no sign the infection has
spread to other Arizona counties.

[This posting confirms what was previously suggested in an earlier
posting, that _Campylobacter jejuni_ was the etiology of the diarrheal
disease, which in some cases culminated in Guillain-Barre syndrome. -
