Turkey: Number of Suspected Bird Flu Cases Now 32
--------------------------------------------------
The number of suspected avian influenza cases in humans in Turkey has
reached at least 32. And the World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed that
at least two patients, a brother and a sister who died, had tested positive
for avian influenza virus infection.
A British laboratory has found that the two teenagers who died earlier this
week had contracted avian influenza and WHO spokeswoman Christine McNab in
Geneva said scientists were closing in on identifying that the virus as the
deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus. "If it's confirmed, these
would be the first human cases outside China and Southeast Asia," McNab
said on Friday [6 Jan 2006] The H5N1 avian influenza virus has already
killed more than 70 [currently 74] people in East Asia since 2003.
[Scientists] are closely monitoring the H5N1 virus for fear it could mutate
into a form easily passed among humans and spark a pandemic.
[The Turkish] Health Minister Recep Akdag, who was to travel to Van with a
six-member delegation from WHO on Saturday, said Turkish authorities did
not believe the disease had passed from human to human. "There is no
suspicion, for the time being," he said. Birds in Turkey, Romania, Russia
and Croatia have recently tested positive for [the H5N1 virus].
An 11-year-old girl died on Friday [6 Jan 2006] of suspected bird flu in
eastern Turkey days after her teenage brother and sister succumbed to the
disease. Their doctor said they probably contracted the illness by playing
with dead chickens. The British lab also confirmed that another child had
tested positive for avian influenza virus infection, said a Turkish health
ministry official.

Turkey: Children Died Because They Entered Hen House First
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Professor Mehmet Doganay, the Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease
Department Head at Erciyes University, announced that the children were
affected by avian influenza virus first because they entered the hen houses
in the region.
Elaborating the reasons behind the three deaths of the children, Doganay
told children living in villages enter hen houses and that increases the
death ratio among children as they become infected by the bird flu virus.
"People living in Agri have a few chickens and the hen houses are small.
Children enter these hen houses and get infected by the virus."
[Presumably adults do not normally enter these hen houses and children are
responsible for their maintenance. This could be a reason for the mortality
in children. - Mod.CP]

Turkey: Family Who Ate Sick Chicken Being Checked For Avian Influenza
---------------------------------------------------------------------
DIYARBAKIR: Four members of a Turkish family who fell ill after eating a
sick chicken were in hospital on Saturday [7 Jan 2006], shortly after three
children from another family in eastern Turkey died of avian influenza
virus infection, an official said. A poultry trader, his wife and two
children, from the southeastern city Sanliurfa bordering Syria, felt sick
after cutting and eating a sick chicken on Friday [6 Jan 2006], and
were transferred to a nearby hospital. "The family had eaten a sick
chicken but we cannot say at the moment that they have avian influenza. We
have put them in the emergency room, and they are in quarantine," said
Professor Fatma Sirmatel from Harran University Hospital.

Turkey: Two More Turkish Children Confirmed With Avian Influenza
----------------------------------------------------------------
GENEVA The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Saturday [7 Jan 2006]
that it had confirmed that two children hospitalised in Turkey had
contracted the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu, a spokeswoman said. She said
the children, a 5-year-old and an 8-year-old, were from the same region
where three other children died from avian influenza this week. She
declined to give any further details.

[The number of confirmed and suspected human cases of H5N1 avian influenza
virus infection is escalating. The total of confirmed cases appears to be
five (all children) and at least another 32 cases are suspected. As stated
previously the situation in Turkey appears to be qualitatively different
from that in East Asia in terms of the number of cases reported in relation
to the population at risk, the mortality in children, and the simultaneous
appearance of suspected cases over a wide area. It may be that as suggested
above that mortality in children is a consequence of the practise in remote
localities in Turkey of rearing domestic fowl in small hen houses only
accessible to children, and that this circumstance does not necessarily
signify a change in virulence or transmissibility of the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. - Mod.CP]
