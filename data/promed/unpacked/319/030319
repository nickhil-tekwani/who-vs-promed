Danish authorities fail to find source of _Salmonella_
------------------------------------------------------
The Danish authorities have reportedly been unable to find the source(s) of
a 7-month long outbreak of salmonellosis [caused by] the type
bovis-morbificans.
The illness, which causes diarrhoea, fever and aching joints has affected
both elderly people and younger children. Statens Veterinaere
Serumlaboratorium (the state veterinary serum laboratory) has not been able
to locate the source despite interviews with patients, reported Politiken,
a Danish newspaper.
