3 persons have already died from tick-borne encephalitis [TBE] in the Sverdlovsk region [oblast]. All of them were retirees who were not vaccinated and did not receive preventive treatment with anti-TBE immunoglobulin.

They were a 71-year-old woman from the settlement of Zarechny, a 74-year-old man from the village of Uralsky and a 55-year-old woman from the town of Uralsk. The last victim did not notice a tick bite [on her skin] -- "forest factor."

In the territory of the Sverdlovsk region alone 41/200 000 people were registered affected by feeding ticks (991.2 per 100 000 population), which is more than 1.5 times higher compared to the same period last year [2013] and 37.7 percent higher than the average long-term rate.

Among the victims, only about 10 000 people were vaccinated against tick-borne viral encephalitis, and 27 000 persons got preventive treatment with immunoglobulin, in Sverdlovsk.

Among children aged up to 17 years, more than 6500 were registered who suffered from tick bites; among them, only 36.5 percent had a history of a full course of vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis. Cases of feeding ticks were registered in 67 municipalities in the Sverdlovsk region.

Currently in hospitals 656 cases were registered with a preliminary diagnosis of tick-borne viral encephalitis (105 laboratory-confirmed cases); the incidence rate is 15.8 per 100 000 population, which is 1.5 times higher compared to the same period last year [2013].

On 25 Aug [2014], 595 000 people were vaccinated against tick-borne viral encephalitis; that is 43.4 per cent of the planned goal, and 7.5 per cent higher than the same period of last year [2013]. In the Sverdlovsk region, with acaricide [application] proceeding in territories that were carried out on more than 7300 hectares (91.0 per cent of the planned [area]).

[For the same period of the last year [2013] in the Sverdlovsk region, 121 laboratory-confirmed cases of tick-borne encephalitis were registered, including 5 deaths. All fatal cases occurred in unvaccinated seniors. - Mod.NP]

[Given the abundance of feeding ticks in the general area, additional cases can be expected. Mod.CP noted, "Tick-borne encephalitis is now a vaccine preventable disease. It is caused by closely related but distinct flaviviruses. 3 subtypes are recognised by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy: a far-eastern subtype, a Siberian subtype, and a European subtype. The Siberian subtype is associated with Russian spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted predominantly by the tick _Ixodes persulcatus_ (see image at http://www.planktonik.com/museum/images/insects/0205dani01.jpg), whereas the European subtype causes central European encephalitis and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_ (see image at http://www.biopix.com/photos/ixodes-ricinus-00078.jpg). The former causes the more serious disease, with mortality that can reach 25 per cent, whereas mortality in the case of the latter seldom reaches 5 per cent. Effective vaccines are now available against each subtype.
