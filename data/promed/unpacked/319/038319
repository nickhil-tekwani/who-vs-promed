Update on vaccine-derived polioviruses -- worldwide, Jan 2006--Aug 2007
-----------------------------------------------
In 1988, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate poliomyelitis
worldwide. Subsequently, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative of the
World Health Organization (WHO) reduced the global incidence of polio
associated with wild polioviruses (WPVs) from an estimated 350 000 cases in
1988 to 1998 reported cases in 2006 and reduced the number of countries
that have never succeeded in interrupting WPV transmission to 4
(Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan) (1). However, because
vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) can produce polio outbreaks in areas
with low rates of Sabin oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) coverage and can
replicate for years in immunodeficient persons, enhanced strategies are
needed to limit emergence of VDPVs and stop all use of OPV once WPV
transmission is eliminated (2,3). This report updates a summary of VDPV
activity published in 2006 (3) and describes VDPVs detected during January
2006--August 2007.
Properties of VDPVs
-------------------
VDPVs can cause paralytic polio in humans and the potential for sustained
circulation of poliovirus. VDPVs resemble WPVs biologically (3) and differ
from the majority of Sabin vaccine-related poliovirus isolates by having
genetic properties consistent with prolonged replication or transmission.
Because poliovirus genomes evolve at a rate of about 1 per cent per year,
Sabin vaccine-related isolates that differ from the corresponding OPV
strain by more than 1 per cent of nucleotide positions (usually determined
by sequencing the genomic region encoding the major viral surface protein,
VP1) are estimated to have replicated for at least one year after
administration of an OPV dose. This is substantially longer than the normal
period of vaccine virus replication of 4-6 weeks.
Poliovirus isolates can be distinguished by their 3 serotypes: type 1, type
2, and type 3. Isolates also can be divided into 3 categories, based on the
extent of VP1 nucleotide sequence divergence from the corresponding Sabin
OPV strain: 1) Sabin vaccine-like viruses (less than 1 per cent divergent),
2) VDPVs (1 to 15 per cent divergent), and 3) WPVs (more than 15 per cent
divergent) (4). VDPVs are further categorized as 1) circulating VDPVs
(cVDPVs), which emerge in areas with inadequate OPV coverage; 2)
immunodeficient-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs), which are isolated from persons
with primary immunodeficiencies who have prolonged VDPV infections after
exposure to OPV; and 3) ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), which are either clinical
isolates from persons with no known immunodeficiency or environmental
isolates whose ultimate source has not been identified (3).
Circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs)
--------------------------
Cambodia. In Phnom Penh, a 2nd case associated with a type 3 cVDPV was
detected in January 2006 (the 1st was in November 2005) (ref 3). In
response, 3 high-coverage supplementary immunization activity (SIA*) rounds
were conducted in March, April, and May 2006 in areas where persons are at
high risk for infection.
Nigeria. During [1 Jan 2006-17 Aug 2007], a total of 69 polio cases
associated with type 2 cVDPV were detected in 9 northern states of Nigeria
in children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) [figure and table at URL
link above].** An additional 24 type 2 case isolates with 0.5 to 1.0 per
cent VP1 divergence from the Sabin type 2 OPV strain and belonging to the
same lineages as the cVDPV isolates were detected in 8 of the 9 northern
states. At least 46 (49 per cent) of the cVDPV isolates and closely related
isolates were from Kano state, which has been a major reservoir for WPV
type 1 (WPV1) and type 3 (WPV3) circulation (5). Phylogenetic analysis
based on sequences of the complete capsid region (2643 nucleotides)
revealed at least 7 distinct cVDPV genetic lineages, suggesting independent
emergence of multiple cVDPV transmission chains in 2005 and 2006.
VDPV circulation has been limited to the northern Nigerian states, where
WPV circulation occurred during 2006-2007 (5). Individual lineages
generally have been geographically restricted, with spread mostly limited
to neighboring states. Circulation of 5 separate chains of transmission
continued at least into July 2007, and 48 of the cVDPV isolates and closely
related isolates were from 2007 cases [figure at URL link above]. The most
recent VDPV case was reported in a person with onset of paralysis [17 Aug
2007]. Two AFP cases associated with 2 distinct type 2 VDPV lineages from
Nigeria were reported in border communities in Niger in June and October 2006.
SIAs have been conducted throughout 2006 and 2007 using 3 different vaccine
preparations. In states with both VDPV and WPV cases, SIA rounds using
trivalent OPV (tOPV) were conducted during [11-14 Feb 2006 and 16-24 Nov
2006], and during [25-28 Jan 2007], [1-4 March 2007], and [1-4 Sep 2007].
SIA rounds using monovalent OPV type 1 (mOPV1)*** were conducted in
affected states during [11-14 Mar 2006], [27-30 May 2006], [29 Jun-3 Jul
2006], and [7-11 Sep 2006], and during [29 Mar-1 Apr 2007] and [23-26 Jun
2007]. Administration of mOPV3 was conducted in affected states during
[28-31 Jul 2007].
Myanmar. Four cases of polio associated with a type 1 cVDPV were detected
in Myanmar (in Mandalay, [19 Apr 2006]; Yangon, [2 May 2007]; Kayin, [11
Jun 2007]; and Bago East, [21 July 2007]). Case isolates differed from the
Sabin type 1 OPV strain at 1.5 percent-2.2 percent of VP1 positions,
consistent with up to 2 years of circulation of the cVDPV, beginning as
early as mid-2005. Seven contacts of the 1st polio patient, from 2 adjacent
townships, also were infected with the cVDPV. In response to the cVDPV
outbreak, 2 rounds of SIAs were conducted in 2006 in townships in close
proximity to the 1st case. SIAs with mOPV1 were conducted in 17 townships
in 5 states during [2-5 Sep 2007], followed by nationwide SIAs with mOPV1
in November and December [planned for November and December of 2007?].
Immunodeficient-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs)
-----------------------------------------
China. In Anhui Province, a child with X-linked agammaglobulinemia who
received 3 OPV doses in fall 2003 was previously reported with onset of
paralysis in August 2005 (3). Serial stool specimens taken from the child
from Oct 2005 to Feb 2006 were positive for type 2 and 3 iVDPVs. Treatment
with intravenous immunoglobulin did not clear the infections, and the child
died from severe pneumonia in April 2006. Tests determined that none of 12
contacts were excreting poliovirus.
Iran. In Iran, the detection of AFP cases associated with VDPVs was
followed up by detailed clinical investigations. Type 2 iVDPVs with
self-limiting clinical courses had been detected previously in 1995 and
2005 (3). During 2006-2007, 3 immunodeficient AFP patients were excreting
iVDPVs; 2 of the patients, both with severe combined immunodeficiency,
died. The 3rd patient, who had X-linked agammaglobulinemia, was infected
with a type 3 iVDPV and stopped excreting poliovirus after December 2006.
Tests determined that none of 21 contacts of the 3 patients were excreting
poliovirus.
Syria. Syria has detected and investigated VDPVs since 2001 (3). In 2006,
humoral and cell-mediated immunodeficiency was diagnosed in an AFP patient,
and stool specimens collected 4-8 days after onset of paralysis were
positive for type 2 iVDPV. Tests determined that none of 5 contacts were
excreting poliovirus.
Kuwait and Egypt. An Egyptian child with severe combined immunodeficiency
residing in Kuwait was determined to be excreting type 3 iVDPV. A 2nd
immunodeficient child in Egypt was infected with a different type 3 iVDPV
and died.
Ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs)
------------------------
China. In June 2006, a type 1 aVDPV was isolated from an immunocompetent
AFP patient and 7 close contacts in rural Guangxi Province. Sequence
diversity among the isolates was consistent with localized VDPV circulation
[see Table at URL link provided above]. A type 3 aVDPV was isolated from a
healthy patient in Shanghai in August 2006; subsequent stool specimens were
negative. In addition, type 1 aVDPV was isolated from a child with AFP in
Shanxi Province in 2007.
Israel. Environmental monitoring for polioviruses was implemented by Israel
after its 1987-1988 outbreak of WPV1. Monitoring sewage samples from the
Tel Aviv area (sampling populations of about 350 000 and 10 000) has
yielded 2 groups of type 2 aVDPVs. The 1st group was detected initially in
1998, and 6 more highly divergent representatives (about 14 per cent VP1
divergence from the Sabin type 2 OPV strain) were detected during
2006-2007; the most recent positive sample was collected on [23 Jul 2007]
(6). The 2nd group is less divergent from the Sabin type 2 OPV strain
(about 7 per cent) and is defined by 7 2006 isolates; the most recent
positive sample was collected on [ 12 Dec 2006]. Despite follow-up
investigations, no source for these VDPVs has been identified. Genetic
properties of the isolates (highly diverse antigenic structures and absence
of vaccine/nonvaccine recombination) are more similar to iVDPVs than to
cVDPVs (6).

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
The close integration of AFP surveillance with detailed poliovirus
characterization by the Global Polio Laboratory Network (3) has led to
detection of VDPVs in more diverse settings and identification of key
biologic and genetic properties of VDPVs. Further understanding through
laboratory findings will be vital to improving strategies for managing risk
factors associated with emergence of VDPVs (7).
The Nigerian cVDPVs and related isolates detected during 2006-2007 differ
from previously described cVDPVs by the absence of antigenic changes
detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screening (3). Temporal and
geographic clustering of vaccine-related type 2 poliovirus isolates in
northern Nigeria prompted further laboratory investigations. To close this
gap in laboratory detection of VDPVs, new molecular reagents and methods
based on real-time polymerase chain reaction have been developed (8).
Testing of the new molecular methods has been accelerated, which should
increase substantially the sensitivity of laboratory screening for all
VDPVs, especially type 2 VDPVs. Multiple Nigerian type 2 polioviruses in
the recent outbreak had less than one percent VP1 divergence but shared
distinctive nucleotide substitution patterns and recombination sites with
the recognized cVDPVs, which indicated their epidemiologic role; all were
associated with paralytic illness.
cVDPVs detected in 2006-2007 provide further evidence that the key risk
factor for spread of VDPVs is low vaccination coverage (3,4). In Nigeria in
2005, 15 to 50 per cent of children aged less than 5 years with cVDPVs, in
7 of the 9 states, had not received an OPV dose. This was reduced to 6 to
30 per cent by the end of 2006 (5,9) through steadily improving SIAs (5).
The low rates of routine tOPV coverage combined with the finding of
multiple independent cocirculating cVDPV lineages in much of northern
Nigeria suggest that conditions favorable for type 2 cVDPV emergence and
spread existed in multiple locations in that part of the country. In Niger,
routine tOPV coverage has been greater (89 per cent) than in Nigeria (39
per cent), and the 2006-2007 SIAs administered tOPV, which limited further
VDPV transmission. In Myanmar, high rates of routine OPV coverage also
appear to have limited cVDPV circulation, with cases reported only in
low-coverage communities. Experience suggests that cVDPV outbreaks can be
terminated if high OPV coverage can be achieved during follow-up SIAs (3).
Outbreaks can be prevented by maintaining high polio vaccination coverage
through routine vaccination and SIAs.
The 1st detections of iVDPVs and all of the long-term iVDPV chronic
infections (greater than 3 years) detected to date were in countries with
high-income economies**** (such as Japan and countries in Western Europe
and North America) (3). More recent reports of iVDPVs have come from
countries with middle-income economies such as Argentina, Kazakhstan,
Thailand, Iran, and Syria (3), with no evidence of chronic infections or
spread of VDPVs to household or community contacts. Repeated detection of
iVDPVs in varied settings underscores the continuing risks for iVDPV
emergence as long as OPV is used. Unlike cVDPVs, which can be prevented
from emerging by high rates of OPV coverage, iVDPVs potentially can arise
any time a person with a primary immunodeficiency is exposed to OPV, either
as an OPV recipient or as a contact of a recipient. The only way to prevent
new iVDPV is to stop OPV use.
The environmental aVDPV isolates from Israel, as with those previously
isolated from sewage in Estonia (type 3) and Slovakia (type 2) (3), likely
are iVDPVs, based on their genetic and antigenic properties, and might have
resulted in limited transmission to close contacts. However, measures to
identify infected persons have been unsuccessful, and the possibility
exists that the VDPV infections were asymptomatic.
Continued cVDPV outbreaks, emergence and detection of iVDPVs in certain
persons with B-cell immunodeficiencies, and detection of aVDPVs in diverse
settings underscore the risks associated with continuing use of OPV after
WPV has been eradicated. However, until that time, OPV must be used at high
rates of coverage to interrupt WPV transmission and prevent the spread of
VDPVs, particularly in countries with low-income economies, high population
densities, poor sanitation, and tropical climates. Although chronic iVDPV
infections are rare, no effective means exist for clearing such infections
(10). Consequently, while working to interrupt all remaining WPV
transmission, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative also must continue to
reduce the risk for VDPV emergence and transmission by strengthening
routine vaccination in under-performing countries,***** developing
strategies to clear iVDPV infections with new antiviral drugs (10), and
refining strategies for stopping all OPV use after global eradication of
WPVs (2,7).

greater immunity to their respective poliovirus types than that provided by
the same number of doses of tOPV. Because the type 2 component of tOPV is
highly immunogenic, an mOPV2 formulation is unnecessary, leaving polio
programs to maximize their immunization activities against the type 1 and
type 3 serotypes.

[Whether to post on the occurrence and discussions surrounding the current
situation related to cVDPVs has been a bit of a dilemma for this moderator.
When the above MMWR (and concurrent WHO WER publication) article appeared,
the initial thoughts were that this was a somewhat more complicated,
esoteric issue that perhaps was not of interest to the majority of
ProMED-mail subscribers and should therefore not be covered on ProMED-mail.
But, since poliomyelitis is a vaccine-preventable disease that is currently
under the eradication microscope, and the implications of the findings
covered in the above article have been overly hyped by the general media
with alarmist headlines such as: "Faulty vaccine causes 69 polio cases in
Nigeria: WHO", "Polio outbreak in Nigeria sparked by vaccine, experts say";
and quotes from experts such as "This vaccine is the most effective tool we
have against the virus, but it's like fighting fire with fire"; and
conclusions such as "Now, health officials' decision to keep quiet about
the outbreak linked to the vaccine for so long -- WHO and CDC have known
about the Nigerian outbreak since last year -- may look suspicious" have
definitely pushed this moderator to post the original article with some
comments and interpretations.
The 1st important reality comment is that, unfortunately, no vaccine is
perfect. The process of formulating vaccine recommendations includes a
weighing of the risk benefit equation regarding the use of a vaccine; what
is the risk of using the vaccine when compared with the risk of not using
the vaccine (the benefits obtained in terms of reductions in morbidity and
mortality due to the disease the vaccine prevents). In the case of polio,
the risk of not using any polio vaccine is that between 1 in 50 to 1 in
1000 (an average of 1 in 200) people who are infected with the wild
poliovirus (WPV) will have serious neurologic illness/paralysis associated
with the infection. At present, there are an estimated 250-500 cases of
vaccine associated polio globally (refs 7 and 8 below). Hence, when
compared with the global load of WPV associated disease (572 cases during
the period 1 Jan 2007 through 10 Oct 2007, 1997 cases reported in 2006),
vaccine still causes fewer cases than WPV.
But, in the case of polio, there are 2 effective vaccines available. For
both logistic and economic reasons, the live attenuated OPV has been the
vaccine of choice for the polio eradication effort. A cost-efficacy
analysis of switching to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in countries
that have interrupted wild virus circulation suggests that many of the
countries cannot afford it. In an interesting study comparing the costs of
IPV and OPV, (ref 9 below), Liu and colleagues calculated that a switch
from OPV to IPV in developing countries would lead to an increase in total
annual cost of USD 317 million with an average increase of USD 2.91 per
child. They further estimated that in developing countries, a switch from
OPV to IPV would lead to a cost of USD 1 million to prevent each case of
vaccine associated paralytic polio. In high income countries that had high
vaccination coverages and interrupted transmission of the WPV, the risk
benefit analysis led to the conclusion that the vaccine (OPV) caused more
cases than it prevented, and the cumulative costs of the vaccine associated
paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) outweighed the incremental cost of switching
to the IPV.
Of note, the very same property of OPV that is creating problems (the
transmissibility of the vaccine virus from a vaccinee to a contact of the
vaccinee and resulting in a case of VAPP) is one of the desired advantages
of the vaccine. A switch to IPV would remove the advantage of flooding the
environment with the vaccine virus (the attenuated very-low-neurovirulence
virus) to further assist in the interruption of transmission of wild
poliovirus when introduced, as well as to "vaccinate" individuals who may
not have directly taken the vaccine themselves.
Another important comment/observation this moderator has is wondering
whether this really is a "new" phenomenon (the cVDPVs) that is emerging and
increasing in terms of the magnitude of the problem or whether this is a
case of "seek and ye shall find," and, in the wake of the disruption of the
vaccination activities in Nigeria due to political/religious
constraints/rumors, with the resumption of vaccination and eradication
activities, northern Nigeria has been under a microscope, and more cases
are being identified. One suspects that there is in fact an element of
"seek and ye shall find" playing into this. Surveillance activities have
been improving, and as the overall case load of paralytic poliomyelitis
decreases, the likelihood of identifying "aberrant" cases increases.
It took the USA about 20 years of debating before the switch from OPV to
IPV was made. That being said, it is probably important to remind folks
that smallpox was eradicated using a significantly less than optimal/less
than safe vaccine. But, that was in an era when fewer immunocompromised
individuals survived for a long enough period to continue shedding vaccine
virus into the general environment around them; again, a very complex
issue, with very complex alternative solutions.
