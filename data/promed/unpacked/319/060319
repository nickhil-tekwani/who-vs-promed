The highest animal rabies incidence for the last 5 years in Bryansk
has been registered in 2010. The incidence has increased 3.5 times
compared to 2009. Humans also [were exposed to] rabid animals. The
majority of incidents involved hunters because of wild animal attacks;
however domestic animal bites were not uncommon. The most recent
animal attack involved a squirrel which bit 2 hunters. Surveillance
authorities reported about 255 laboratory confirmed animal cases in 29
territories of Bryansk oblast. The majority of cases (75 percent) were
in foxes and raccoon dogs. 9.8 percent of cases were cats, 5.5 percent
dogs, and 3.9 percent cattle. The specialists are pointing out the
necessity of having a shelter for stray animals.

Interestingly, the number of people applying for medical help after
animal bites did not increase since 2009. 4281 people have applied for
medical help due to animal bites, including 250 due to domestic animal
bites.
