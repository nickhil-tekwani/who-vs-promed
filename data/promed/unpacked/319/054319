Equine disease potentially exposed at showgrounds
-------------------------------------------------
The reportable equine disease, strangles, has potentially been
identified at Australia's largest horse facility, the Australian
Equine Livestock and Events Centre [AELEC] in Tamworth. Strangles is
highly-infectious, causing throat abscesses, high temperatures and
coughing.

It is understood the exposed animal from Queensland was en route to a
show in Sydney when it stopped at the old Tamworth Showgrounds,
coming into contact with animals due to compete in the Miniature
Horse National Show.

General manager of Tamworth Regional Council, Glen Inglis, says the
event will go ahead and owners have been contacted. "It's been
indicated that potentially 48 horses may have been in contact with
that particular horse. They're known and they'll be housed in a
separate stable block at AELEC, to have some separation between them
and the other horses," he said. "Any horses showing any symptoms may
be refused entry."

The affected horse has since returned to a property in Queensland,
which has been quarantined by the Queensland Department of Primary
Industries (DPI). The New South Wales DPI has also been notified of
the potential strangles exposure.

Director of Public Affairs, Brett Fifield, says everything is under
control. "Strangles is a notifiable disease which means we will
investigate to ensure that this disease doesn't affect large numbers
of horses and we'll try and keep it at a very small level," he said.

"At this stage, there's no evidence that it has spread and we're very
confident that we've been informed very quickly and now we have our
vets at the showground to see if there's any cases showing there."

[This seems like a large number of animals exposed. It clearly
demonstrates how incubating diseases can so easily migrate, which is
why biosecurity and cleanliness of the environment is so very important.

Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of Equidae
characterized by abscesses of the lymphoid tissue of the upper
respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_,
is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses,
donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive, capsulated beta-hemolytic
Lancefield group C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a
primary pathogen.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of
infection is fever (103-106F [39.4-41.1C]). Within 24-48 hours of the
initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of
strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge,
depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy [swollen lymph nodes
under the jaw].

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that
initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide
temporary clinical improvement of fever and depression, but ultimately
prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses.
Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea,
dysphagia[breathing and eating problems], prolonged high fever, and
severe lethargy/anorexia.

Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (less
than or equal to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort
abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment
is that it causes failure to mount a protective immune response,
rendering horses highly susceptible to infection after cessation of
therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin is
the antibiotic of choice.

Clinically affected horses should be physically separated from the
herd and cared for by separate caregivers. Most horses continue to
shed _S. equi_ for approximately one month following recovery.

There are several different vaccines on the market, registered for use
within Australia.

How many equines did it come into contact with at the show in Sydney,
and back home in Queensland? According to Acha PN & Szyfres B (1994)
Zoonoses and communicable disease common to man and animals, PAHO
Scientific Pub, No.503, _S.equi_ is sporadic and rare in humans.
