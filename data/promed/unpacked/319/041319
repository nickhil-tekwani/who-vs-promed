Update: Shigella Outbreak in San Diego County
----------------------------------------
The County of San Diego has announced 4 new shigella cases associated with an ongoing outbreak, bringing the total to 35 confirmed and 3 probable cases among people experiencing homelessness.

The continuing investigation shows onset of illness dates between [16 Aug and 8 Nov 2021], with the 4 new cases occurring between [28 Oct and 8 Nov 2021]. The 38 cases in this outbreak represent 11% of the 333 total cases reported to date [12 Nov 2021] in San Diego County.

The cases are all among individuals experiencing homelessness, with the majority at multiple locations in central San Diego. No source of the outbreak has currently been identified.

The County is working closely with the City of San Diego to:
- Prevent any future potential exposure sites.
- Promote good hygienic precautions among homeless service providers and food providers.
- Connect ill individuals to treatment and housing.

Other steps have included:
- Relocation of 32 currently deployed handwashing stations to areas frequented by homeless individuals.
- Placement of 16 new handwashing stations, with the most recent station placed in the Sports Arena area. Evaluation of additional need is ongoing.
- Increased cleaning of portable and permanent public bathrooms.
- Evaluated potential placements of new portable restrooms and have determined feasible sites in Downtown, Pacific Beach and Rolando Village.
- Increased sidewalk sanitization from twice weekly to 7 days per week for the time being. Frequency will be continually assessed.
- Notification by the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality about the outbreak -- and precautions -- to food facilities in the downtown, Mission Valley and Hillcrest areas, charitable feeding operators, the California Restaurant Association, Downtown San Diego Partnership, Regional Task Force on Homelessness and Gaslamp Quarter Association.
- Public health nurses conducting outreach at shelters.
- Homeless Outreach Teams offering shelter resources and distributing weekly 1000 hygiene kits with shigella information to persons experiencing homelessness.
- Creation of County Public Health shigella website with outbreak information.

Shigellosis is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or person to person. Those at increased risk include young children (especially those in daycare), people who are experiencing homelessness, travelers to locations with poor sanitation and men who have sex with men. In 2020, a total of 240 shigellosis cases were reported in San Diego County residents while the 426 cases reported in 2019 was the highest since 1995.

Typical symptoms of shigellosis include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps. While most people will recover fully without antimicrobial treatment, some individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease and may need further treatment. People with symptoms that resemble shigellosis should contact their medical care provider. The provider may order stool testing to help with the diagnosis.

Strategies to avoid getting or spreading shigellosis include frequent hand washing and not preparing food while ill with diarrhea.

[This cluster parallels the beginning of the hepatitis A epidemic occurring in many states in the USA which began in the homeless in San Diego county (Hepatitis A - USA (46): (CA) fatal 20171017.5386460).

Shigella was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea). - Mod.LL
