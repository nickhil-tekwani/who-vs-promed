Federal prison officials say over 300 inmates were sickened by
salmonellosis at a northeastern Pennsylvania prison in June 2011. The
Bureau of Prisons on Fri 15 Jul 2011, said that 320 inmates and 4
staff were sickened at the USA Penitentiary-Canaan in Waymart in an
outbreak linked to chicken fajitas served there in June 2011.

State health department spokeswoman Christine Cronkright had
initially said more than 500 inmates and staff were sickened, but now
says the prison bureau's numbers are likely more accurate. The state
health department had also said the prison's kitchen was closed, but
federal prison officials say it reopened Wed 13 Jul 2011, after
passing an inspection.

A spokesman at the prison about 135 miles [217 km] north of
Philadelphia says he's trying to gather more information on the
situation.

[A fajita commonly refers to any grilled meat served on a flour or
corn tortilla. Popular meats include chicken, pork, shrimp, and all
cuts of beef. In restaurants, the meat is often cooked with onions and
bell peppers. Popular condiments are shredded lettuce, sour cream,
guacamole, salsa, cheese, and tomato. It is not stated in the posting
what the vehicle for salmonellosis or what the serotype of _S.
enterica_ was found.

Institutional food, whether in a school, a prison, or place of
business, remains a common way to produce substantial outbreaks of
bacterial enteric diseases such as salmonellosis and
campylobacteriosis as well as hepatitis A and viral gastroenteritis. -
