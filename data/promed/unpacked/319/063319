A Kern County [California] apple-packing plant has been linked to a deadly _Listeria_ outbreak. Bidart Bros., based in Bakersfield, has recalled all of its Granny Smith and Gala apple shipments from its Shafter facility this past year [2014]. The apples can be sold under the brand names "Big B" and "Granny's Best," and they can also be sold under other brand names or no brand at all. Consumers are urged to ask retailers if the apples were supplied by Bidart Bros. Friday [9 Jan 2015], the company confirmed they are closed for the season, but noted the last shipment of apples this past year was sent out on [2 Dec 2014].

The fruit has been linked to a _Listeria_ infection found in prepackaged caramel apples. The apples were coated by another company off site, but the _Listeria_ was found on the apple's production line, connecting the illness to the Bidart's Shafter plant.

The bacteria may have caused up to 6 deaths and 31 additional illnesses reported across 11 states.

Kern County Environmental Health director Donna Fenton warns that [listeriosis] is a very serious disease and that the apples may still be in stores. "It can cause pregnant women to miscarry, so it's a very serious food-borne illness," said Fenton. "_Listeria_ is a colder-loving bacteria, so it tends to be on things that you wouldn't suspect, like apples or caramel apples."

The disease can contaminate other food in your refrigerator, so consumers who may have purchased the fruit are urged to sanitize the walls and shelves of their refrigerators, cutting boards and counter tops.

The Food and Drug Administration is still gathering the list of the specific store locations the apples might have been shipped to, but Fenton confirmed the fruit was sold at various Albertsons, Stater Bros. and Sprouts grocery stores across the nation.

[The outbreak caused by 2 genotypically distinct strains of _Listeria_ linked to eating caramel apples has now involved 37 cases, including 6 deaths, in 11 US states. In addition, 2 Canadians have also developed listeriosis caused by _Listeria_ with the same genotype as one of the US outbreak strains. No illnesses were said to be associated with uncoated apples or caramel candy, or with caramel apples that were not prepackaged, according to the CDC. All the companies involved obtained some of their apples from the same apple supplier headquartered in Bakersfield, California (Bidart Bros.). The news report above says that _Listeria_ has been isolated from the apple's production line at Bidart's Shafter plant. The news report does not say if the genotype of the Shafter plant's isolate matches that of the clinical isolates.

Shafter, with a population of 16 988 in 2010, is a city in Kern County, California, United States, and is located 18 miles (29 km) west-northwest of the city of Bakersfield (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafter,_California). A map of California showing the location of Shafter can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shafter,+CA/@35.4698815,-119.2021354,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x80ea456137d02c27:0x7dfb5ad9f7a37c73.
