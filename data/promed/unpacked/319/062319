Health authorities say they are seriously concerned about a disease outbreak in the Kimberley, in northwest Western Australia, that can result in long-term kidney complications. There have been 89 Kimberley cases of a disease known as acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) since late 2013.

It occurs mostly in children, about 2 weeks after a skin or throat infection, and can lead to inflammation of the kidneys.

Senior public health nurse at Population Health, Ashley Eastwood, said the only way to prevent it is to wash with soap daily, cover sores, wash bed linen weekly, and not share towels.

"Most of the time the condition will be self-limiting but there's now evidence that it's a precursor for the kidney disease that we see in Aboriginal people later in life, so it's a condition we're very concerned about," she said.

"Primarily in children aged 2 to 9 years and nearly all of those people have required hospitalisation, so it's a really concerning disease and particularly as we know it contributes to chronic kidney disease which has a terrible burden for people in the Kimberley."

[Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) results from an antecedent infection of the skin or pharyngitis caused by certain strains (called nephritogenic) of beta-hemolytic streptococci. Usually Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), _Streptococcus pyogenes_, are involved, but a Group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus, specifically _S. zooepidemicus_, has also caused recent epidemics of APSGN (http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/19/10/1855.full).

APSGN in the tropics is much more commonly associated with a preceding streptococcal skin infection than pharyngitis and the risk of APSGN is higher for some M types of GABHS when associated with skin infections rather than pharyngitis. APSGN most commonly occurs in under-developed countries among school-aged children living in poor, crowded, unhygienic conditions. These children commonly have skin sores, which may be often related to scabies, that become secondarily infected with GABHS (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1440-0960.2000.00417.x/abstract).

APSGN is characterized by the sudden appearance of edema, hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension. Many who have mild disease or are asymptomatic go unreported, unless screened for microscopic hematuria; thus, the actual incidence of the disease may not be known. The course and short-term prognosis for APSGN is almost always favorable in children, but some may have time-related urinary abnormalities, hypertension and reduction in renal function if followed many years later. A study from Australia found that APSGN in childhood can add to the burden of chronic kidney disease in Indigenous (Aboriginal) communities (http://www.nature.com/ki/journal/v81/n10/full/ki2011478a.html).

Prophylactic antibiotic treatment is used to arrest community-wide outbreaks of APSGN. Either benzathine penicillin G (BPG) has been given to all children to reduce GABHS carriage, or targeted BPG treatment has been given to children with skin sores or to household contacts of APSGN cases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10223684).

APSGN has been a continuing problem in remote Indigenous communities in Australia at incidence rates comparable to or even higher than those estimated in developing countries, with periodic large outbreaks across multiple communities (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3183781/, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21976576). Multiple M types have been isolated from cases of APSGN, including some types not previously recognized to be nephritogenic. Indigenous children aged 5-8 years have the highest APSGN attack rates and GABHS-infected skin sores in these children are common (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1754.1995.tb00795.x/abstract).

Kimberley, one of the 9 regions of Western Australia, is in the northern part of Western Australia, bordered on the west by the Indian Ocean, on the north by the Timor Sea, on the south by the Great Sandy and Tanami Deserts, and on the east by the Northern Territory; approximately 40 percent of the region's population is of Aboriginal descent (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberley_(Western_Australia)). - Mod.ML]
