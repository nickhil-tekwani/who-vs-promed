Surveillance of West Nile virus disease, Tel Aviv district, Israel,
2005 to 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: Kopel E, Amitai Z, Bin H, et al]

Introduction
------------
West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquitoborne arbovirus of the family
_Flaviviridae_. Numerous avian species serve as the amplifying hosts.
These include, migratory birds, such as the white storks which travel
across Israel each autumn, as well as urban species, such as the
common house sparrows. Transmission to humans mainly occurs by
mosquito vectors, principally by mosquitoes of the genus _Culex_,
during their active period, usually between mid-summer and early
autumn. WNV has rapidly expanded in both the eastern and western
hemispheres in the past 2 decades (1,2).

Human West Nile fever, caused by laboratory-confirmed WNV infection,
was reported in Israel for the 1st time in the early 1950s, with
several outbreaks in that decade, and an additional outbreak in 1980
(3). The largest outbreak (439 serologically-confirmed cases with 29
deaths) of human WNV infection in Israel occurred in 2000, with a 73
per cent rate of neuroinvasive disease in hospitalised patients (3,4).
Following this outbreak, a national surveillance system was
established for humans and mosquitoes (5) and since 2001 WNV infection
is notifiable in Israel. The surveillance system detects new cases of
human WNV infections and characterises viral genotypes. The system is
based on initial notifications of probable or confirmed cases of WNV
infection by the Central Virology Laboratory (CVL) and on the
subsequent epidemiological investigations of these patients by the
local district health offices.

Summary
-------
We present the findings of a 6-year surveillance period (2005-2010)
of human West Nile virus (WNV) infection in Tel Aviv district, Israel.
Initial notifications of positively identified patients received from
the Central Virology Laboratory were followed by epidemiological
investigations of the local district health office. During 2005-2010,
104 patients, 79 with WNV neuroinvasive and 25 with WNV
non-neuroinvasive disease were reported. The median age of the
patients with a neuroinvasive disease was 74 years (range: 15-95
years) and 53 of such patients had encephalitis, 14 had acute flaccid
paralysis, and 12 had meningitis. The case-fatality rate in these
patients was 8 per cent. The average annual incidence of neuroinvasive
disease during 2005-2010 was 1.08 per 100 000 population. The
incidence declined by 86 per cent steadily between 2005 and 2009 (p
for trend=0.005), but increased more than 6-fold in 2010. Elderly (65
years or older) men, comprising 25 patients of whom 24 were
chronically-ill, had the highest incidence of WNV encephalitis (p less
than 0.001).

These findings are concordant with previous data, at the national
level, published in Israel and the United States. Notably, the
percentage of previously healthy patients, who developed a
neuroinvasive disease was the highest (37 per cent, p=0.001) in the
surveillance period in 2010.

[West Nile virus has been identified periodically for over 60 years
in clinical human and equine cases and in mosquitoes and birds in
Israel. The report above provides an interesting summary of human
clinical cases during a 6 year period.
