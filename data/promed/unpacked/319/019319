Looking at the various postings about anthrax in the Western province of
Zambia, I wonder whether it is not a little too easy to state that Secheke
District (20040925.2645) is an area of well-recognised enzootic/endemic
anthrax risk.
In the 1980s I was District Veterinary officer in Sesheke district, where
the present outbreak took place. In those days anthrax certainly was not a
common finding in the district. The previous posting from 2002 reports an
outbreak in the Simungoma/Maondo area, while the present report says
Mwandi/Magondo. There is a distance of some 40 kilometres between these 2
sites, and there have not been reports on Sesheke District in the meantime.
In the Central Barotse Plain and the Mongu and Kaoma Districts, some 250 to
400 kilometres northwest of Sesheke, several outbreaks have occurred since
the early 1990s. There one can probably say that the disease is of endemic
significance. Could it be that the fairly recent emergence of the disease
in this area -- and hence the relative ignorance of the local population --
has caused the large number of deaths and cases of disease?
Another link I think should be looked into is the possible role played by
the Chobe National Park outbreak in Botswana reported over the last few
weeks. It was said to have spilled over into Namibia (i.e. Caprivi Strip),
directly bordering Sesheke. It is well-known that there are family ties
across the border, so transfers of meat (bush meat?) over considerable
distances should probably not be ruled out (although that would contradict
the fact that cattle in the area are involved).
In short, I have the feeling that there may be more to this matter than
just the idea that the disease is endemic; other factors may be relevant
for the control of the outbreak and long-term prevention.

Yes, certain environmental, climatic, or population factors appear to be
ideal for anthrax in southern Africa this year.
To date, Kruger has been spared, and we have not detected any cases in
spite of heightened surveillance. The wet season is due to kick in within
about the next 6 weeks, and should result in a major reduction or cessation
of new cases in the currently affected areas of Zimbabwe, Botswana, and
Namibia.
