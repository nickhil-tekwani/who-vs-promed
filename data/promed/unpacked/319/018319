YERSINIOSIS - BUFFALO, NY, USA
===============================
NY State Epidemiology Program staff have been working with
Erie Co Health Dept investigating an outbreak of yersiniosis
(Y. enterocolitica 0:3 IXb) involving 13 infants between Nov.1995
and present. All cases have occurred in African-American infants
residing in the same neighborhood in downtown Buffalo. Interviews with
family reveal that most handled chitterlings (chitlins - pork intestine)
in the days before the infants became ill. We have also cultured
Y. enterocolitica 0:3 from several chitterling samples. During
a similar outbreak in the same neighborhood last year we conducted
a case control study which also implicated chitterlings (p=.003; RR=17).
The infants are obviously not eating the chitterlings but are
being exposed via cross contamination from hands to baby bottle. On
interview 4/5 admitted that the baby's bottle was in the sink at
the same time the chitterlings were being rinsed. Different stores
and suppliers are involved. Chitterlings are sold raw-frozen, raw-
unfrozen, or precooked-frozen in 5 or 10lb plastic buckets with
snap lids. They do in fact have the standard USDA safe food handling
label printed on the top.
CDC and Georgia Dept of Health investigated a chitterling-associated
yersiniosis outbreak also in African-Amer. infants in 1988 in Atlanta's
downtown (Lee, LA et al JID 1991; 163:660-663).
Our control measures have included a press release
to warn consumers, notification of health care providers in Buffalo,
contact with community church leaders and distribution of a
safe food handling notice specifically on chitterling preparation
to the meat markets in the affected area. Physicians and laboratories
should consider yersinia in the differential diagnosis of children with
febrile diarrhea. Labs in areas where yersiniosis is occasionally
found should either routinely screen for it (CIN or MacConkey media)
on all stools or test only if negative for more common enteric
pathogens (salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, E. coli 0157). (The
latter is more cost effective.)
Chitterlings are generally eaten around the
winter holiday period from Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year. Sales
of chitterlings dramatically decline thereafter. We are planning
an aggressive newsmedia, pamplet campaign Nov.1, 1996 to focus
attention. Best solution is to advise use of precooked product but
it is 3 times as expensive.
