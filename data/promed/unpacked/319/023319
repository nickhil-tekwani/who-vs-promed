Poliomyelitis in Chad, 7 Feb 2007
-------------------------------------
On 23 Jan 2007, the Ministry of Health in Chad confirmed one new
polio case (type 3). It is the 1st polio case in Chad since December
2005. A 2-year-old girl from N'Djamena had developed paralysis on 26
Nov 2006. Genetic sequencing of the isolated poliovirus indicates
that it is related to poliovirus circulating in northern Nigeria.

In response to the confirmation of polio, the Ministry of Health
conducted a nationwide mass-immunization campaign on 25-28 Jan 2007,
immunizing nearly 2.5 million children under the age of 5 years. The
next polio immunization campaign in the country is scheduled for
24-26 Feb 2007.

Sequencing of the recent Cameroon case (a type 1 with onset of
paralysis on 6 Dec 2007) indicates that [it is] genetically linked to
poliovirus currently circulating in northern Nigeria.

An immunization response in Cameroon is currently being finalized.

Seven new cases were reported in the past week from northern states.
Nigeria's most recent case had onset of paralysis on 17 Dec [2006].

Preparations are ongoing for the next scheduled Immunization Plus
Days (IPDs), to be held in northern states on 1-4 Mar 2007 using
monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1).

[Given the recent confirmation of a wild poliovirus (WPV) type 3
poliovirus in Chad genetically similar to those circulating in
Nigeria (see section [1] above), one wonders if there is the need for
a follow-up immunization activity using vaccine containing poliovirus
type 3. - Mod.MPP]

Six new cases were reported in the past week from 2006, from Uttar
Pradesh and Bihar states.

Additionally, the 1st case for 2007 was reported, a type 1 from Bihar
state, with onset of paralysis on 5 Jan [2007]. It is India's most recent case.

The next National Immunization Days (NIDs) will be held on 11-17 Feb [2007].

Two new cases for 2007 were reported in the past week, from northern
Sindh and North West Frontier Province (NWFP). The cases, both type
3, had onset of paralysis on 9 Jan [2007] and 16 Jan [2007],
respectively. The latter is Pakistan's most recent case.

On 25 Jan [2007], a national polio consultation was convened in
follow up to the Technical Consultation on Polio Eradication in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, held on 6-7 Dec [2006], in Muscat, Oman.
The national consultation highlighted an urgent need for increased
political commitment and accountability for polio eradication activities.

Pakistan's next SNIDs [Sub-National Immunization Days] will be held
on 20-23 Feb [2007].

[With the confirmation of new cases in both Chad and Cameroon
genetically similar to WPV type 1 and type 3 found circulating in
Nigeria, it is apparent that the polio situation in Nigeria continues
to be a threat as a source of "exportation" of WPV. (This moderator
was tempted to qualify this comment with "a source of exportation of
WPV in the region, but one remembers that there had been
reintroduction of the WPV into Indonesia in 2005 with a virus that
was genetically similar to that circulating in Nigeria). Likewise,
the continued circulation of WPV in India continues to be a threat as
a source of "exportation" of WPV, not only within its region, but
also outside, remembering that the recent WPV activity in Angola was
associated with WPV genetically similar to that circulating in India.

A review of the WPV activity worldwide by country seen on the Polio
Eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf> shows
other countries that had importations of the WPV (with viruses
genetically traceable to those circulating in Nigeria and India).
Countries with dates of onset of most recent WPV identification in
December and November 2006 include: Somalia (December 2006), Angola
(November 2006), Kenya (November 2006), Ethiopia (November 2006) and
Bangladesh (November 2006). In addition, Afghanistan, a country still
considered to be endemic for WPV circulation, had the date of onset
of the most recent case identified in December 2006. Given the
challenges in communication in a number of these countries, one would
not be surprised if additional more recent cases were identified in
the coming weeks. - Mod.MPP]
