Third person shows exposure to anthrax
--------------------------------------
BOCA RATON, Florida (CNN) -- A third employee in a tabloid publishing
building in Boca Raton, Florida, has tested positive for exposure to the
anthrax bacteria, federal and state officials announced Wednesday. The
unidentified 35-year-old woman is being treated and is not expected to
develop the potentially deadly disease, Florida Health Secretary John
Agwunobi said. One man has died of the disease, and a second tested
positive for exposure to it.
The FBI said the investigation is now a criminal probe, but authorities
said there is no evidence linking the outbreak to the September 11
terrorist attacks. "We have not made any premature conclusions," said
Acting U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis. "My job is to review the evidence, is to
investigate, to review every piece of evidence and, quite frankly, it would
be inappropriate for me to draw any premature conclusions about the case at
this point."
A supermarket tabloid photo editor died of inhalation anthrax on Friday. A
mailroom employee at the American Media building in Boca Raton tested
positive for exposure to the bacteria. Earlier this week, hospital
officials said the mailroom employee, 73, had shown no clinical symptoms of
the bacterium. Investigators have said the men were exposed to the same
strain of anthrax. The mailroom employee was interviewed by FBI agents from
his hospital bed at Cedars Medical Center of Miami as authorities continue
to try to piece together how the anthrax got into the AMI building, which
houses the offices of such tabloids as The Sun and The National Enquirer.
FBI special agent Judy Orihuela said FBI agents want to learn more from the
73-year-old, who has worked at AMI for 12 years. "We're talking to him
about his contact with [the deceased editor, his mail distribution
procedures, his daily routine," Orihuela said.
The step-granddaughter of the mailroom employee confirmed that FBI agents
interviewed her grandfather and that he and the deceased man knew each
other. "He knew him very well," she said, and added that her
step-grandfather was moved out of the intensive care unit Wednesday.
Earlier Wednesday, a Florida health official said preliminary results from
environmental tests at the Boca Raton building indicate no traces of the
anthrax bacteria except those found on the computer keyboard of the man who
died of the disease. Florida Department of Health spokesman Frank Penela
stressed that the testing -- conducted, according to sources, at Northern
Arizona University at Flagstaff -- is not complete. Health officials said
no traces of anthrax were found at the deceased editor's home in Lantana,
Florida. Tests at other places he visited, such as grocery stores,
restaurants and parks, have also turned up negative.
Officials said the family of the deceased man will no longer have to take
antibiotics.
Law enforcement sources told CNN the anthrax found in Florida seems to have
been identified as the Ames strain of anthrax. The Ames strain was
discovered in the early 1950s by Ames, Iowa, researchers, who found it in
the tissue of a dead animal. In the 50 years since then, the strain has
been distributed to researchers all over the world and used to make anthrax
vaccines.

Third Person Exposed to Anthrax in Florida
------------------------------------------
BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Federal authorities said Wednesday that a third
person has been exposed to anthrax and the case has become the subject of a
criminal investigation. The woman is also an employee of American Media and
a nasal swab taken from her tested positive, officials said. The
35-year-old woman, whose name wasn't released, has been hospitalized and is
being treated with antibiotics. Her condition was not immediately known.
"There is another individual that has tested positive for presence of the
virus [sic," U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis at a news conference that included
officials with the FBI, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
the state health department
The woman [is one of more than 1000 people who have been tested by health
officials for presence of the dangerous bacterium. Most have recently been
inside the AMI building.
Preliminary testing at federal labs on the anthrax that killed [the editor
has found a possible match to a strain connected to an Iowa lab, a law
enforcement official said Wednesday. The official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said further testing to definitively make the match could take
several days. FBI investigators, donning white moon suits and gas masks,
spent a third day collecting evidence in the newspaper offices of the two
men, whose exposure to anthrax has prompted heightened fear of bioterrorism
across the country. The search has turned up no further sign of anthrax in
the office of the deceased editor since traces were discovered on his
computer keyboard.
Pharmacists in Boca Raton said their supply of the antibiotic Cipro was
running dangerously thin -- or in some cases, out -- as worried residents
asked their doctors to fill out prescriptions.
The Palm Beach County Health Department ordered the building closed for 30
days on Wednesday, said Boca Raton Fire Department Lt. Frank Montilli.
Health officials have emphasized that there is no public health threat.
Anthrax tests at the home of the deceased editor were negative, said Dr.
Jean Malecki, director of the Palm Beach Health Department.

BOCA RATON, Fla., Oct. 10 - Federal officials announced tonight that a
third person in South Florida had tested positive for exposure to anthrax
and said forcefully that their efforts had become a criminal investigation.
The latest exposed is a 35-year-old woman who works in the same building
where two other people were exposed, one of whom died last week. The
officials said they found traces of anthrax in the woman's nasal passage
and that she was taking antibiotics. The officials withheld the woman's
identity, saying they were doing so at her request.
Dr. John Agwunobi, Secretary for the Florida Department of Health said that
health officials had so far tested nasal passages of 700 people and found
only one that tested positive for anthrax. The authorities said the woman
did not exhibit the flu-like symptoms associated with anthrax
contamination. "She is on antibiotics and we will be working very closely
with her," Dr. Agwunobi said.

[This third case appears to be in the same class as the 73-year-old
mailroom worker, having spores in her nasal cavity. At this time she
appears to have been otherwise unaffected by their presence. Obviously
whatever facts she can provide will help better identify how and when the
spores entered the building. This is reminiscent of a more innocent
situation recounted to me many years ago by Dr. Davis at the Guildford
Public Health Laboratory in England of being able to swab some 500 spores
from the noses of workers in bone meal plants and their not being affected.
