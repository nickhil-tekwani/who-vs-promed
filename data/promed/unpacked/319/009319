Children the main victims of epidemic
-------------------------------------
The dengue epidemic has claimed 7 lives in 4 weeks. But what is
really troubling the authorities is that 4 of them are children and
that the upcoming school holidays may present further opportunities
for _Aedes_ mosquitoes to breed on school grounds. Health Minister
Datuk Dr Chua Soi Lek said: "My concern is the upcoming long school
holidays due to the festive season." He reasoned that, during this
period, there may not be any upkeep of school grounds, and this could
result in more breeding areas. "When the children return, they may
become victims," he told reporters after presenting Hazard Analysis
and Critical Control Point (HACCP) and Halal certificates to Sime
Oleander Sdn Bhd. "I am concerned for the lives of children. Parents
must also play an important role in not only helping [to] keep the
schools clean but also their houses and immediate surroundings," he
said.
He warned Malaysians that the dengue epidemic was not over despite
the drop in the number of people suffering from the disease. "The
decrease could be due to the concerted effort by all to search and
destroy _Aedes_ breeding grounds," he added.
Since 1 Jan 2005, more than 3500 people, mostly children and workers,
have been hospitalized with suspected dengue fever.

Sarawak reports 12 dengue cases
---------------------------------
12 dengue cases have been detected in Sarawak so far this year

Although dengue was endemic in Sarawak, there was no outbreak last

Bintulu, it said.
Last year [2005], 141 dengue fever cases were confirmed from 586
clinical cases that occurred sporadically, especially in urban
districts. There were 58 cases in Kuching, 24 in Bintulu, 19 in Miri
and 2 in Sibu, it added.

Dengue death: Putrajaya Hospital to prepare report
-----------------------------------------------
The Putrajaya Hospital is preparing a report for the Health Ministry
on the death of a 5-year-old girl who died of dengue here on
Wednesday [26 Jan 2005]. Hospital Director Dr. Nagindar Singh
declined to comment on her death today [29 Jan 2005], apart from
saying that a report was being prepared for the Health Ministry. He
added that he had been directed not to divulge any information to the
media.
The girl was last Friday [21 Jan 2005] rushed to the Putrajaya Health
Clinic, when her father realized that she had all the early symptoms
of dengue but was told that it was nothing more than a normal fever.
And it wasn't long before her condition deteriorated, and she
developed severe headaches, myalgias (muscle aches), arthralgias
(joint pain) and nausea.
According to her mother, her daughter might have been infected when
she went to her grandmother's house in Selayang [Selangor State]
recently.
Meanwhile, the Putrajaya Health Clinic clarified that the girl was
not from Putrajaya but Puchong [Selangor State]. A spokesman for the
clinic said she was brought to the clinic, as it was probably the
nearest to their house. She was one of the 5 patients who have died
of dengue fever.
On the same day, an 8-year-old student from Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman
Tuanku Jaafar 2 in Seremban [Negeri Sembilan State], died at the
Seremban Hospital after being admitted to the Emergency Unit last
Sunday [23 Jan 2005].

Dengue targets youths, kids
---------------------------
Students made up nearly 30 percent of the 1500 suspected dengue cases
over the 1st 3 weeks of the year [2005]. About 53 percent of 621
confirmed cases last year [2004] comprised children and youths under
24. This has prompted the Health Ministry to increase checks on
_Aedes_ mosquito breeding grounds in schools, parliamentary secretary
to the Health Ministry Lee Kah Choon said today [24 Jan 2005].
Lee said the ministry and health departments had conducted fogging
and gotong-royong programs to clean up schools. "Parents can also
play their part by encouraging their children to use mosquito
repellent," he said.
A total of 33 203 suspected dengue cases were reported last year
[2004]. Lee said Penang's northeast district recorded the highest
number of suspected dengue cases over the 1st 3 weeks of the year
[2005]. During the 1st week, the State recorded 70 suspected cases,
73 in the 2nd week and 60 in the 3rd week. Of the 1st week's 70
suspected cases, 30 were subsequently confirmed; 21 cases in the 2nd
week and 14 in the 3rd week.

Boy is 1st fatal dengue case this year [2005]
-----------------------------------------------
In what could be the 1st fatal dengue case this year [2005], a
10-year-old pupil has died in the KK Women's and Children's Hospital
[Singapore] from the mosquito-borne disease.
The Health Ministry [Singapore] would confirm on Friday [28 Jan 2005]
night only that there was a dengue-related death, but it is
understood that the victim is a boy who succumbed last Friday [21 Jan
2005].
He would be the 10th casualty of dengue here [Singapore] since 2003.
It is not known where the boy contracted the virus. His school, which
is believed to be in the north of the island, has written a letter to
parents to assure them that steps have been taken to prevent an
outbreak.
On Monday [24 Jan 2005], Environment and Water Resources Ministry
officers inspected the school and found no mosquito breeding areas,
the school's letter said. The school was also fogged last Saturday
[22 Jan 2005].
The death comes during a period when dengue infections in Singapore
are running high. For the 1st 3 weeks of this year [2005], there have
already been 29 dengue hemorrhagic fever cases, 21 more than in the
same period last year [2004].

The number of dengue fever cases in Jakarta jumped from 263 cases on
Tuesday [18 Jan 2005] to 400 cases on Saturday [22 Jan 2005], an
official said.
The Jakarta health agency spokesman, Evy Zelfino, said on Saturday
[22 Jan 2005] that the total number of cases since December [2004]
was 835, while 2 patients have died. "The number of dengue fever
cases always increases in the rainy season. After the floods in the
coming weeks, the figure can jump to an alarming level, because the
standing water is a breeding place for the [mosquitoes]," she told
The Jakarta Post. Evy explained that it is in the pattern of the
disease that it increases every December to March when Jakarta is
heavily inundated with water.
The health agency recorded around 18 000 cases of dengue from
December 2003 to March 2004, with about 82 deaths, mostly children.
The highest number of cases occurred in February and March, in which
over 5000 people contracted the disease.
The agency's data also showed that during the same period, dengue
cases in Greater Jakarta hit a high of 15 360 in 1998, 3998 in 1999,
8729 in 2000, 8820 in 2001, and 5750 in 2002.
