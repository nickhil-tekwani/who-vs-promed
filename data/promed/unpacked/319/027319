Inquiry into salmonella outbreak
--------------------------------
Health experts are banding together to trace the source of a rare form of
salmonellosis that has affected dozens of people throughout Britain. In
August 2003 so far, there have been 39 confirmed cases of _Salmonella
bareilly_.
There are 17 confirmed and 3 suspected cases in Scotland, while 22 have
been confirmed in England and Wales, plus 3 suspected cases. One elderly
woman may even have died as a result of the infection.
Experts believe the fact that cases are appearing throughout Britain means
there could be a common source. Health authorities affected are said to be
working together to locate the origin of the bug, but at this stage they do
not know whether it is food-borne.
The investigation is being led by the Scottish Centre for Infection and
Environmental Health (SCIEH) in collaboration with the The Food Standards
Agency.
On Mon 25 Aug 2003 it was announced that there had been 31 cases of the
rare form of salmonella, but this figure rose by 8 on Tue 26 Aug after
details of the outbreak were revealed.
There are more than 2500 types of salmonella, and Scotland usually has
around 1500 confirmed cases every year. This latest outbreak is described
as "unusual" in that there were only 2 cases of _Salmonella bareilly_
reported in 2002 and only one during 2001. Dr John Cowden, chairman of the
investigation team, said: "This form of salmonella is rare but no more
serious than other types."
The NHS board areas in Scotland with confirmed cases:
Lothian (5)
Grampian (3)
Greater Glasgow (2)
Lanarkshire (1)
Ayrshire and Arran (1)
Fife (1)
Tayside (1)
_Salmonella bareilly_ may have been a contributory factor in the death of
one elderly woman, but all other cases are either fully recovered or are
recovering at home.
"We are trying to establish common links between those confirmed cases to
try to establish whether there is a single source causing this
outbreak." Dr Cowden added: "While we cannot give out any specific advice
to the public of how to avoid coming into contact with this type of
salmonella, I can advise that salmonella is usually spread by undercooked
food or poor hygiene. Taking care while preparing food and hand washing
are effective defenses. Meanwhile, our investigations continue."
NHS regions in England and Wales with confirmed cases:
North East (2)
Yorkshire and Humber (1)
East Midlands (2)
West Midlands (2)
Wales (4)
Eastern (1)
South West (2)
London (1)
South East (2)

[_S. bareilly_ (Bareilly_ is a city in Uttar Pradesh, India) has primarily
been reported in Europe and Asia (including India and Sri Lanka). It has
been isolated from such diverse sources as raw chickens in Belfast,
Northern Ireland, UK (1) and toads in India (2). It has been reported to
cause infection in horses (3) as well as humans. One human outbreak in Sri
Lanka occurred in a nursery for premature infants and was linked to water
contamination (4).
