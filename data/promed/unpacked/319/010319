About 20 people, including gewog [village block] livestock agents and villagers in Jamkhar, Trashiyangtse, are taking anti-rabies vaccine, after they handled the carcass of a jersey cow that was suspected to have died from rabies on Sun 12 Aug 2012. Some of them had also consumed milk from the same cow.

Regional livestock development centre in Khangma, Trashigang, through a rapid test of the brain sample, confirmed "mild positive rabies" as the cause of the cow's death. "The samples will also be sent to the National Centre for Animal Health in Serbithang for polymerised chain reaction tests to further confirm the positivity of the tests," the centre's programme director, Dr Tshering Dorji, said.

Trashiyangtse's dzongkhag [district] livestock officer, Toula Dukpa, said the disease has been contained with the carcass buried safely, after treating it with phenol, lime, and bleaching powder. "Surrounding areas and bedding used for the carcass were also burnt to contain the spread of the disease to both animals and humans," he said. Dogs in the neighbourhood were also given post exposure treatment as control measure. He said that there was no outbreak of rabies in Jamkhar. "It's suspected that the cow was bought from Dewathang and carried the disease to Jamkhar," he said.

People have been alerted to report to the nearest renewable natural resources centre on the death of cattle from similar symptoms. No transmission to human or new cases of rabies have been reported in the gewog after the incident.

[Rabies is endemic in Bhutan. All species of animals can transmit the virus to humans and other animals, but the efficiency of transmission varies with the host species and the form of rabies. Animals with the furious form of rabies are more likely to disseminate rabies than animals with the paralytic form. Carnivores are also more efficient vectors, in general, than herbivores. Herbivore-to-herbivore transmission is uncommon. In humans, the incubation period is a few days to several years. Most cases become apparent after 1 to 3 months. In one study, about 4-10 per cent of cases had an incubation period of 6 months or more.

The rabies virus is readily transmitted between mammals, whether they are the same or different species. This virus is usually spread in the saliva, when an infected animal bites another. Less often, an animal or person is infected by contact with infectious saliva or neurological tissues, through mucous membranes, or breaks in the skin. The rabies virus is not transmitted through intact skin. Aerosol transmission has been documented in special circumstances, such as in laboratories and bat caves with an unusually high density of aerosolized, viable virus particles.

Rabies viruses have been transmitted by ingestion in experimentally infected animals, and there is anecdotal evidence of transmission in milk to a lamb and a human infant. In 2 incidents investigated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people who drank unpasteurized milk from rabid cows were given post exposure prophylaxis. Pasteurized milk and cooked meat are not expected to pose a risk of infection, as the rabies virus is inactivated by heat; however, as a precaution, the US National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians recommends against consuming tissues and milk from rabid animals.

The Trashiyangtse District is one of the 20 dzongkhags (districts) comprising Bhutan. It was created in 1992 when the Trashiyangtse district was split off from Trashigang District. Trashiyangtse covers an area of 1437.9 sq km (555.2 sq mi). The district seat is Trashiyangtse. The interactive HealthMap of Bhutan can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/36GM. - Mod.CP]
