Docs Using Net as Disease Detector
--------------------------------------------
The Canadian government is developing a system to monitor the Internet --
often abuzz with newbies passing on warnings about bogus computer viruses --
for clues to potential real-life disease outbreaks.
The health surveillance system will become the <http://www.who.ch/> World
Health Organization's key defense against deadly epidemics, plagues, and
natural disasters when it is launched in May, said Dr. Rudi Nowak, director
of the early-warning project for Health Canada, the country's federal health
department.
"The critical element [for infectious disease outbreaks] is time," he said.
"We want to narrow the window of time between when [an outbreak] happens and
when people get that information. The sooner it's picked up, the sooner
governments and agencies can get an outbreak under control. The Internet
helps us do that."
The technology will collect a wide variety of data from around the world,
detect the impact of health risks, and make the information available
instantly on-line.
The system will use search-engine technology designed by Ontario-based
<http://www.opentext.com/> Open Text Corp. to continuously scan the Web, news
wires, public health e-mail systems, and even local on-line newspapers around
the world looking for information on various infectious diseases.
"Our spider technology can crawl a million [Web] pages a day, index the
information and make it available for searching so it's the most up to date
on the Web," said Abe Kleinberg, senior vice president of marketing for Open
Text. "And you can train it to crawl particular sites with certain
characteristics."
So unlike general search engines that cast their nets far and wide, this
system will be highly discerning. It will provide only the most current
public health information from reliable sources, Nowak said.
"We're fine-tuning the system so that we weed out sources that aren't
providing us good information," he said. "Out of the mass of information,
the system will siphon out what's meaningful, extract the intelligence, make
sure the information is properly validated and shared with (public health)
experts here and at WHO."
When an urgent alarm is sounded by the system, the information will be
transmitted simultaneously to scientists at Health Canada in Ottawa and the
Geneva-based World Health Organization, which works with governments to
identify global health risks and co-ordinates international responses. The
international health agency already has a low-tech global monitoring system
in place that relies on workers in various regions around the world to
report any communicable disease threats.
But the phone and fax communication system has proven slow and ineffective,
said Nowak. "The system now operates in a passive mode because someone has
to send a fax or call when something is happening. And with different time
zones and communication problems, that sometimes doesn't happen very well."
For example, it took months before the global community learned of outbreaks
such as India's plague in 1994 and Zaire's Ebola tragedy a year later.
Although the first report of avian flu in Hong Kong was filed last May, the
investigation dragged on for several months. Since many infectious diseases
such as influenza and Ebola can kill within days or weeks, those delays can
be deadly, said Nowak.
Dr. Stephen Corber, a Washington, DC-based disease-prevention expert with
the global agency, said the Canadian system will not only get disease
reports out faster -- it could also help publicize outbreaks that are buried
by local government officials afraid of scaring off tourism dollars.
"We always have to go with the authority of the local health department when
we release outbreak warnings," he said. "But when the information is coming
from outside the country, it is harder [for local government officials] to
say there isn't a problem. If it publicized that a country has an outbreak
on the Internet, whether it's confirmed or not, people won't visit. So that
creates a new pressure for countries to respond."
Over the past two decades alone, at least 29 new infectious diseases have
emerged worldwide, including HIV, Ebola fever, and Legionnaire's disease.
Meanwhile, older diseases such as tuberculosis, dengue fever, and diphtheria
have returned with new potency.
And the potential for epidemics to spread is also increasing along with the
rapidly deteriorating state of water and sanitation services in overcrowded
cities and a dramatic increase in international travel, which allows
diseases to spread across borders and oceans in a matter of hours.
"We can contract a disease abroad and bring it back to expose friends and
family overnight," said Nowak. "This system will attempt to find that
information and get it to the public in a systematic, continuous way that's
never been done before."

[Dr Nowak provided the interviewer with at least two facts that did
not get reported in the final story above. One is that the project
is called GPHIN, for Global Public Health Intelligence, and another
is that I am consulting on the project, and the results of the system
will be measured against ProMED-mail for timeliness and coverage, since
they consider us the gold standard. - Mod.JW]
