The West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis outbreak continues to wane in the
Northeast with the onset of cooler temperatures and continued
vector-control operations. This report updates the progress of the ongoing
investigation. Since the last published update (1 ), five additional
domestic human cases and one international case have been identified. As of
October 19, 56 (31 confirmed and 25 probable) cases of WNV infection have
been identified, including seven deaths [Figure not reproduced. - Mod CHC].
The date of onset of the latest cases was September 22. The international
case was a Canadian citizen who had visited the New York City (NYC) area in
late August who had onset of fatal encephalitis on September 5. Active
surveillance for human encephalitis cases in Connecticut and New Jersey has
not detected any WNV cases.
Surveillance for WNV in mosquitoes and birds continues. As of October 19,
11 pools collected during September 12-October 4 of _Culex_ spp.
mosquitoes, positive for WNV, have been identified from NYC and Nassau and
Suffolk counties. Pools of _Culex_ spp. and _Aedes vexans_ mosquitoes
collected during early to mid-September in Hudson County, New Jersey,
tested positive for WNV by reverse transcriptase poly-merase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). Birds that tested positive for WNV now have been identified by
RT-PCR on postmortem brain tissue from New York (NYC boroughs of Bronx,
Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island; and Nassau, Orange,
Rockland, Saratoga, Suffolk, and Westchester counties), New Jersey (Bergen,
Burlington, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic,
Somerset, Union, and Warren counties), and
Connecticut (Fairfield County). In addition, postmortem brain tissue from
birds from Fairfield and New Haven counties, Connecticut, have been
reported as positive in culture for WNV by the Connecticut Department of
Health. Although most WNV-positive birds have been American crows,
infections also have been confirmed in other native species, including the
ring-billed gull, yellow-billed cuckoo, rock dove, sandhill crane, fish
crow, blue jay, bald eagle, laughing gull, black-crowned night heron,
mallard, American robin, red-tailed hawk, and broad-winged hawk.
Laboratory studies conducted at CDC have identified the etiologic agent
responsible for the human arboviral encephalitis outbreak in the NYC area
as WNV. Confirmation of the genetic identity as WNV has been performed
independently by collaborators at the United States Army Medical Research
Institute for Infectious Diseases. WNV-specific gene sequences have been
amplified by RT-PCR performed on RNA extracted from autopsy specimens (six
case-patients). Sequences of genome fragments of WNV isolated from dead
birds and mosquitoes are identical to gene sequences from the human autopsy
specimens. Antigenic mapping of these isolates has been performed using a
panel of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) developed by CDC or provided by
collaborators at the University of Queensland, Australia. These envelope
(E)-glycoprotein specific Mabs, capable of distinguishing WN, Kunjin, and
St. Louis encephalitis viruses, confirmed the sequence identification of
these isolates as WNV.

MMWR Editorial Note:
The dates of onset of illness for laboratory-positive cases of WNV
infection suggest that the outbreak peaked in late August. There have been
no recognized cases of WNV infection with an onset date after September 22.
WNV encephalitis has an incubation period of 5-15 days. The latest cases
occurred outside NYC in Nassau and Westchester counties, which implemented
mosquito-control measures later than NYC. Collectively, these data suggest
that control measures, combined with cooler temperatures, have been
effective in reducing the transmission cycle in nature and limiting further
illnesses in humans. However, it is important to continue to recommend
personal protective measures during outdoor activity at dusk and at night
until the onset of cold weather in the affected areas (1).
The identification of WNV in birds from Orange and Saratoga counties, New
York City, and Burlington County, New Jersey, may represent an extension
northward and southward of the known area of natural transmission between
birds and mosquitoes, but for this to be the case, either demonstration of
WNV in vector mosquito populations or demonstration of neutralizing
antibodies against WNV in resident birds is needed because these birds may
have been infected elsewhere. The current known geographic distribution of
infected dead birds is in counties surrounding the western half of Long
Island Sound.
Serum samples collected from migrant and resident birds in several states
will be analyzed for antibody to WNV. States included in this survey are
New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, and Florida. Collaborators in this survey include university
ornithologists, state wildlife biologists, and state health departments. In
addition, wildlife and health officials in all mid-Atlantic and
southeastern states have been alerted to investigate reports of unusual
clusters of dead birds.
All state epidemiologists have been informed of the characteristics of this
outbreak and encouraged to enhance surveillance for cases of human
encephalitis. Monitoring of mosquitoes and birds has been increased in
several states with existing vector-control programs. Training to institute
programs for arbovirus and mosquito vector surveillance will be offered to
states without programs, beginning with Atlantic coast states. In addition,
the emerging infections sentinel networks coordinated by the Infectious
Diseases Society of America (IDSA EIN) and the International Society of
Travel Medicine (GeoSentinel) are assisting case-finding efforts to define
the extent of the outbreak in the United States.
A previous publication indicated that the New York virus was more closely
related to Kunjin virus (2). Data in this report based on phylogenetic
analysis comparing published E-glycoprotein sequences from WNVs and other
flaviviruses, including Kunjin, St. Louis encephalitis, and Japanese
encephalitis indicate that the New York virus is WN. Complete genome
sequencing of multiple WNV isolates is in progress.

[Whether this virus entered the U.S. in a tick on a hurricane-blown bird,
in an illegally imported bird, or by other means is an important question
yet to be answered. Tedious work will be required to answer those
questions. When the complete sequence is available, it may be possible to
pinpoint the source (origin) of this virus. Let us hope so. - Mod.CHC]
