Hepatitis A outbreak in an Indian medical college -- comment
------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hepatitis A in a medical college is not only distressing news but also disappointing [see ProMED-mail Hepatitis A - India: (Delhi) medical college 20140202.2248684]. India has transitioned from hyper-endemic state with no outbreaks to outbreaks in many places, since about the beginning of this century. One of the earliest and best reported outbreaks was in another medical college, Kottaym, Kerala in 2003, as reported by Arankalle VA et al [Arankalle VA, Sarada Devi KL, Lole KS, et al: Molecular characterization of hepatitis A virus from a large outbreak from Kerala, India. Indian J Med Res 2006; 123(6): 760-9; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16885597]

Hepatitis A is prevented by immunisation. The vaccine is completely safe. The inactivated virus vaccine is more expensive than the live virus vaccine made in China and licensed in India. Virtually every one gets hepatitis A infection, with increasing frequency of disease, and even outbreaks, in India, on account of the age shift of 1st infection from pre-school age to adolescents and adults.

In both outbreaks in the 2 medical colleges no one seems to have considered immunisation to control the outbreak. There is no excuse for not vaccinating medical and nursing students at the time of entry, either after antibody screening (to save on vaccines in those already immune) or without it (for simplifying the process).
