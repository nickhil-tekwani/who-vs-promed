Bird flu discovered in southern S Korea
---------------------------------------
A case of bird flu has been discovered at a duck farm in south western
South Korea, just 3 days after an outbreak was confirmed at a chicken farm
in the same region, the government said on Saturday [5 Apr 2008]. The
Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said preliminary
tests conducted on ducks that died earlier in the week at the farm in
Jeongeup, about 250 km [155 miles] south west of Seoul, turned up positive
for the H5N1 bird flu virus.

Of the 10 000 ducks on the farm, half have died since Monday [31 Mar 2008].
The farm is located 27 km [16.7 miles] away from a chicken farm that was
hit by avian influenza earlier this week.

The ministry said that further tests will be needed to determine if the
virus is a low or high virulent strain of bird flu. The quarantine official
said that the remaining ducks raised on the farm were in the process of
being culled and buried, with all poultry livestock within a 10-km
[6.2-mile] radius of the farm restricted from being transported.

The last time a virulent strain of the bird flu was reported in the country
was in March 2007. There have been several cases of mild strains discovered
in the past few months.

S Korea probing bird flu outbreak
---------------------------------
The South Korean government said on Friday [4 Apr 2008] that it is trying
to determine the cause of an outbreak of bird flu at a poultry farm in the
south west coast of the country.

The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said blood
samples of the infected birds from the farm, located 260 km [161.5 miles]
south of Seoul, and those from 11 foreign workers from China, Vietnam and
Mongolia have been taken for analysis. It said quarantine officials are
also collecting blood samples from migratory birds at a nearby river, where
a duck was found to be carrying an antibody to the H5N1 virus late last
year [2007].

"The test will help determine the exact sub-type of the H5N1 virus that
killed the chickens at the egg-laying farm," said Kim Chang-seob, the
ministry's chief veterinary officer. He said quarantine officials who took
part in culling birds at the Gimje farm will also be tested to make certain
they were not inadvertently affected.

"At present, it is impossible to say how the birds were infected," the
expert said. He added that it may take a few days to know the exact
sub-strain of the latest avian influenza outbreak.

In the 2003-2004 and 2006-2007 outbreaks, the H5N1 viruses were determined
to have been the northern strain. Most of the human deaths that occurred
were linked to another virulent strain that broke out in South East Asia.
All outbreaks in the past occurred in the winter months, from November to
March.

Kim said that Seoul has already reported the outbreak to the World
Organization for Animal Health. "We expect that chicken meat sales will be
halted, but have received notice that countries like Taiwan and Japan will
not ban the import of canned chicken with ginseng soup," the official said.

The quarantine official, meanwhile, said that 151 000 chickens raised on
the farm were in the process of being culled and buried to prevent
secondary infections. In addition, he said 270 000 birds within a 500 metre
[1640 foot] radius of the farm will be destroyed, along with the eggs produced.

The government expects to pay compensation totaling 4.8 billion won (USD
4.92 million) for the birds and eggs destroyed. "Compared to the past, the
quick reporting by the owner of the farm has probably helped prevent the
spread of the virus, which is usually transmitted by people and vehicles,"
Kim said. A small number of birds started dying from 29 Mar 2008, with the
report being made on 1 Apr 2008 after large numbers of birds started to die.

The ministry, meanwhile, said it is in the process of determining the cause
of the sudden deaths of birds at a duck farm in Jeongeup, south of Gimje in
North Jeolla Province.

Of the 10 000 ducks on the farm, half have died since Monday [31 Mar 2008],
with quarantine official conducting tests on the dead birds. [In the
meantime, the tests turned up positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus; see
