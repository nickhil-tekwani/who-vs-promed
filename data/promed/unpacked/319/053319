Thank you for your continued interest in the rabies situation in Israel. I
hereby enclose for you some additional information about the genetic
identification of the virus strains in the last three (human) rabies cases
that occurred in Israel. All the three cases were diagnosed antemortem from
saliva using the nested RT/PCR method performed by Dr. Dan David of the
Kimron Veterinary Institute, and confirmed by the Pasteur Institute (first
case) and the CDC rabies laboratory (the last two cases). The genetic
analysis made in Israel by Dr. Dan David was based on nucleotide sequences
of 328 bp from the C' of [the nucleoprotein gene.
The nucleotide sequences of rabies virus isolates from human and foxes
showed 100% identity. The rabies virus variant strain from the first case
was characterized in the Pasteur Institute by Dr. Herve Bourry. He wrote
that "According to the primers that worked on isolates, it should be a
Lyssavirus of genotype 1 related to what is already known from the strains
circulating in Israel." The other 2 isolates were sent recently to the CDC
laboratory for confirmation of genetic analysis. Rabies has never been
diagnosed in bats and rats in Israel in several small-scale surveys and in
routine diagnostic cases conducted in recent years.
In conclusion, based on this current data, we did not think that we are
facing a new or different form of rabies.
With regard to the source of the infection, the victims did not recall any
possible route other than a bite (first case) and scratches (last 2 cases)
inflicted by unseen and unknown nocturnal animals. Possibilities include
carnivores known to have contracted rabies in the past such as stray cats,
stone martens (_Martes foina_) or badgers (_Meles meles_).
