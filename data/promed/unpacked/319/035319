The abstract from the paper by Michael H. Cassin, Anna M. Lammerding, Ewen
C.D. Todd, William Ross, R.Stephen McColl raises some important issues with
respect to our understanding of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC).
Although I haven't read the paper itself, it is plain to see from the
abstract that the authors are not aware of the very low infective dose
(often <10 cfu's) of EHEC.
The authors' hypothetical mitigation strategy proposed that refrigeration
would reduce the average risk of illness by 80%, yet it is hard to
reconcile this in the light of an apparent absence of a relationship of
risk with infective dose. (In investigations of outbreaks, the numbers of
organisms in the incriminated foods has been consistently extremely low).
Absence of refrigeration has not played a significant role in reported
outbreaks. It should also be noted that refrigeration could be
counterproductive in some situations such as with fermented sausage; the
infective dose would be preserved and the pH and water content would be
maintained for optimum EHEC survival.
In addition, the focus on EHEC O157:H7 perpetuated by Cassin et al. shows a
failure to recognise the important role of non-O157:H7 EHEC in human
disease. My colleague Karl Bettelheim and I have demonstrated multiple
EHEC infections occurred in most cases of HUS during the Adelaide epidemic,
and a trend for complications (Chronic renal failure, infarcts, etc.) was
shown [mean of 12.5 strains compared with 7.8 strains for uncomplicated
disease.
Multiple strain infection is not surprising given the fact that multiple
STEC are present in the animals from which the contaminated meat comes. It
would seem improbable that O157:H7 would rise above its cousins and form a
"pure" contaminating population ready to strike the susceptible host as a
single infecting agent! In the same way we commonly observe several
strains of Salmonella from a single source simultaneously infecting
patients.
We review the whole issue of how outbreaks have been microbiologically
investigated and demonstrate that in the vast majority of outbreaks only
O157:H7 has been sought. The role of non-O157 EHEC is placed into proper
perspective. The review is soon to be published in J Med Microbiol.

[I haven't read the paper myself yet, so I will limit my comments to noting
that this kind of comment is what makes risk assessment an attractive tool.
One of the least understood but most important benefits of a comprehensive
risk assessment is to focus our attention on areas of importance which have
yet to be addressed. I don't know if the paper's author's address this
issue until I read it or at least talk to them. It is important to
remember that risk assessment is an iterative process so that if Dr.
Goldwater's data hasn't been included in the initial quantitative risk
assessment, it can be easily included in the next iteration. At this point,
I suggest three things: first, we all read the paper, next, I see if the
authors can shed some light on how and why they handled infective dose and
multiple strain infection issues in the way they did and finally we
congratulate Cassin et al. for moving the E. coli O157:H7 risk assessment
dialogue along. - Mod.PC
