The Hanoi Preventive Medicine Centre announced an additional 6 Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases during the past week in the city, bringing the total to 9, according to local media.

Deputy Head of Hanoi's Health Department Hoang Duc Hanh asked the city's Preventive Medicine Centre to step up monitoring at hospitals and in communities, to diagnose infectious cases and take action to localize and stamp out the outbreak.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. About 68 000 clinical cases are reported annually. It usually occurs in rural or agricultural areas, often associated with rice farming.

JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Culex_ species mosquitoes, particularly _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_.

Most JE virus infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately 1 in 250 infections results in severe disease characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and death. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 30 percent among those with disease symptoms.

There is a protective vaccine against Japanese encephalitis virus.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis occur sporadically in Viet Nam. South East Asia, including Viet Nam, is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The _Culex_ mosquito vectors of the virus often have extensive breeding areas such as rice fields, making vector control difficult. In JE virus-endemic areas, birds, especially ardeids (herons and relatives), are reservoir hosts of the virus. Pigs can serve as amplifying hosts. Vaccination is an effective way to prevent JEV infection, but no mention is made of recent vaccination campaigns in high risk areas. An 8 Aug 2014 report stated that in preventing JE, the National Extended Vaccination Program and the local Health Department had decided to vaccinate all the children under 15 that had yet to receive vaccination against JEV (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140807.2669178). - Mod.TY
