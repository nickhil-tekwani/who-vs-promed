It would be useful to get a more definitive report on this outbreak,
especially concerning the degree of confidence in this diagnosis.
The recent outbreak of HPAI in East Asia has resulted in
unprecedented mortality in ducks, with deaths occurring after
disease for 2 to 3 days. With HPAI some concomitant mortalities in
in-contact chickens would have been expected, but there is no
comment about this important ecological observation.
If there is not a definitive epidemiological or laboratory diagnosis,
then the animal health service in Bangladesh should be supported
in some way to quickly resolve the situation, because of the
potential impact of HPAI on food security and livelihoods of the
poorest people in the country.

[Laurence Gleeson's valid observation and his request for a
definitive report deserve to be addressed, not only by the
Bangladeshi animal-health authorities, but also by the international
organisations engaged in the control of the current HPAI panzootic.
