Rust found in commercial soybean field in Baldwin County, AL
-----------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust (ASR) was observed in a 60-acre commercial soybean
field in Baldwin County, AL on 12 Jul 2005. The field is
approximately 1 mile northeast of the soybean sentinel plots that
were observed to have rust on 28 Jun and whose rust has progressed in
the meantime.
According to Ed Sikora of Auburn University, ASR incidence within the
field was estimated at 20 percent, with low disease severity. The
field is estimated to be at the R4-R5 stage.
Sikora said that the field was sprayed with Stratego fungicide on 26
Jun, 2 days before it was detected at extremely low levels of ASR in
our sentinel plots.
Sikora said that ASR has progressed in our sentinel plots. On 28 Jun,
ASR symptoms were found on one plant in each of the 2 sentinel plots
(planted side-by-side about 1 month apart). On 19 Jul, the older of
the 2 plots had 100 percent disease incidence, and the younger plot
had 75 percent incidence. No ASR was found on kudzu patches in the
area, including patches located approximately half-way between the
sentinel plots and the commercial field. Last week, he scouted 3
commercial soybean fields within 10 miles of the positive sentinel
plot; all 3 fields were at the V2 growth stage but no ASR was
detected.
Soybeans are typically planted in late May or June in this county,
Sikora said. The commercial field where ASR was detected is uncommon
as far as its advanced growth stage for this area.
Growers in Alabama were told to consider spraying if the crop was
between R1 and R6. Crops between bloom (R1) stage and pod fill (R6)
stage should consider applying a premix or tank mix of a strobilurin
and triazole-type fungicide. An application at the R3 growth stage,
regardless if rust is reported in the immediate area, would provide
about 3 weeks protection against ASR as well as reduce damage from
Cercospora blight and frog-eye leaf spot.

[The 1st discovery of ASR in commercially grown soybeans in Alabama this season
was recorded in Baldwin County, AL, on 12 Jul 2005. The field is mature for the
area -- already at R4-R5 -- and had been treated with a fungicide 2 weeks prior
to the finding. There are 8 growth stages for soybean: R1(1 flower at any
node); R2 (flower at node immediately below the node with a completely unrolled
leaf); R3 (pod is 1/2 cm long at 1 of the 4 uppermost nodes with a completely
unrolled leaf); R4 (pod is 2 cm long at 1 of the 4 uppermost nodes with a
completely unrolled leaf); R5 (seeds beginning to develop [can be felt by
squeezing or at least 1/8 inch long]) at 1 of the 4 uppermost nodes with a
completely unrolled leaf); R6 (pod containing a green seed that fills the pod
cavity at 1 of the 4 uppermost nodes with a completely unrolled leaf); R7 (Pods
yellowing [1 normal pod on the main stem that has reached its mature pod color -
brown or tan]); and R8 (95 percent of the pods have reached their mature pod
color, approximately 5 to 10 days prior to harvest).
Control of ASR can be accomplished through utilization of fungicides and
avoidance of very susceptible cultivars. Partial resistance or tolerance may be
the most effective resistance strategies, especially when combined with stacked
single genes or single genes with broad resistance.
