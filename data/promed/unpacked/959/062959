[The official press release published by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) of Belgium addressing the 1st outbreak of ASF since 1985, is available at: http://www.afsca.be/businesssectors/animalproduction/animalhealth/africanswinefever/#news.

"On [13 Sep 2018], African swine fever (ASF) virus was confirmed for the 1st time since 1985 in 4 wild boars in the municipality Etalle (province of Luxembourg).

In this region very few domestic pigs are kept. There are no outbreaks in domestic swine.

Taking into account the definitions included in Chapter 15.1.3 of the OIE Code, Belgium currently still has a free status for domestic and captive wild pigs. Attestation of the CVO [in English http://www.afsca.be/businesssectors/animalproduction/animalhealth/africanswinefever/_documents/2018-09-13_attestation_CVO_EN.pdf; in French http://www.afsca.be/businesssectors/animalproduction/animalhealth/africanswinefever/_documents/2018-09-13_attestation_CVO_FR.pdf].

An infected area is established [see map 1 at http://www.afsca.be/_pictures/users/pccb/2018-09-14_infectedzonemap_v1.jpg and map 2 at http://www.afsca.be/_pictures/users/pccb/2018-09-14_infectedzonemap_v2.jpg] -- dated 14 Sep 2018].

All measures provided in Article 15 of European Directive 2002/60/EC will be applied.

Besides these measures, the FASFC started an epidemiological investigation to identify the cause of the ASF virus introduction.

The certification conditions laid down in the relevant protocols concluded between Belgium and the non-EU countries (3rd countries) will be scrupulously respected.

Weekly follow-up reports will be sent to the OIE, according to the procedure, and published on our website."

The information below comes from a special announcement by the University of Minnesota's Swine Health Information Center (SHIC) dated 13 Sep 2018. The full document and references are available at: https://www.swinehealth.org/special-announcement-asf-belgium/.

"In 2017, Belgium exported USD 1.4 billion of pork, making it the 8th largest pork exporter by country, and it is unclear how trade within the European Union will be affected. Following the report, the French Minister of Agriculture called for "an adequate response given the considerable economic interests at stake for the French agri-food chain" and warned about the impact of the Belgian outbreak, calling on officials to stop the disease from spreading across the border.

"ASF has been spreading through Eastern Europe, mostly associated with transmission through wild boars, a population that has been growing in Europe over the last decade. This new outbreak represents the expansion of the disease, for the first time during the current pandemic, into Western Europe. This is also the first time ASF has been diagnosed in Belgium since 1985, when 12 farms were infected and 60 farms (34 041 animals) were eliminated. A recent modeling exercise on the potential spread of ASF in Belgium suggested that, in most of the cases, the disease would be controlled before any spread; however, if ASF virus was introduced into commercial farms, the median number of infected farms was predicted to be 6.

"This new outbreak may represent a new change in the epidemiologic situation of ASF worldwide, suggesting that the disease may have reached pandemic proportions. "Pandemic" is a term that refers to "an outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area", which seems appropriate in this case, considering ASF expansion across Europe, and over considerable distances in China over the last year, in addition to the sustained occurrence of outbreaks in Africa and Russia." - Mod.CRD
