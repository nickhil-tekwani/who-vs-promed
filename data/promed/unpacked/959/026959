Citrus is the only crop relative to other major pome or stone fruits which
contains not one or two highly destructive diseases, but perhaps seven or
eight which could severely cripple or even destroy the citrus industry of
any country. There is the well known tristeza of sweet on sour orange or
the stem pitting forms of tristeza such as the severe Capao Bonito, Peru or
the Australian stem pitting strains of CTV which are very destructive and
can and have destroyed the citrus industry (Peru). There is Witches' broom
of limes in Oman; the Asian or South African greening disease; the new
citrus variegated chlorosis disease in Brazil now destroying much of the
industry in the northern part of the country. There is the new Turkish
citrus chlorotic dwarf; the citrus badnavirus mosaic disease in India;
transmissible psorosis in Argentina or Uruguay, citrus canker as occurred
in the Maldive islands; exocortis as occurred under warm conditions in
Belize with a change of rootstock due to the threat of CTV.
In addition, new diseases are continually occurring. All of this argues
strongly for a program of mandatory certification for citrus.
I feel that we live in a fools paradise if we believe that our citrus
industry is immune to getting any of these diseases and if we persist in
the belief that it can't happen to us. It truly can! Sadly, we do have the
technology to detect and eliminate these diseases in our propagative
budwood. The major problem is political! How to convince the authorities of
what lies ahead if they do not properly fund. I firmly believe that for
each dollar invested in a program of certification, one thousand dollars
can be earned or saved by preventing these or other diseases from eating
away at our citrus industries.
