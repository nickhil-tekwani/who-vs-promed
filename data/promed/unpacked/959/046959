On 5 Aug 2008, the National Reference Laboratory of Salmonella (NRLS) noted
an increase in the number of isolates of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype
Kedougou. As of 22 Aug 2008, 29 isolates have been reported during 2008,
which is 10 times more than the average number of isolates identified by
the NRLS during 2002-2007. All isolates have a typical, indistinguishable
pulse field pattern (SALKEDXB-1, Spanish code) and are fully sensitive to
the standard suite of antimicrobials.

Of the 29 patients with _S._ Kedougou, 12 were male; 23 patients were
younger than one year while the remaining 6 were aged between 7 and 76
years. From the available information we know that one of the adult
patients is the father of an infant infected with _S._ Kedougou.

In the context of this outbreak we defined a case as an infant younger than
one year old with clinical symptoms compatible with a salmonella infection
and an isolate of _S._ Kedougou from stools, blood, or urine, since 1 Jan
2008. As of 22 Aug 2008, 23 cases fulfilling the case definition were
identified with the onset of symptoms between 4 Feb 2008 and 28 Jul 2008
(Figure [For figure, see source URL - Mod.LL])

To date, 19 of these cases have been investigated. The children live in 7
different regions throughout Spain. The parents of all 19 infants reported
feeding them with powdered formula milk of the same brand in the week
before onset of symptoms. The main symptoms were diarrhea (100 per cent),
fever (32 per cent), nausea (21 per cent), and vomiting (21 per cent). 6
cases were hospitalized.

A matched case control study was carried out by the Surveillance National
Network, and included 10 cases and 36 controls. The study showed that
illness was significantly associated with the consumption of a particular
brand of formula milk for infants (chi-square=26.03; df=1; P less than 0.0001).

These preliminary results strongly suggest that the infant formula milk was
the source of the outbreak. On 26 Mar 2008, based on the preliminary
results of the epidemiological investigation, and as a precautionary
measure, the Spanish food safety authorities recalled 5 batches of formula
milk produced under the incriminated brand. These batches had only been
distributed in Spain.

An urgent inquiry was posted trough the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (ECDC) to the European Network of Food and
Waterborne Diseases (former ENTER-net) on 7 Aug 2008. From the responses
received until 22 Aug 2008 it seems that no country had detected an
increase in _S._ Kedougou isolates. Although the infant formula milk has
only been distributed in Spain, an alert to the Rapid Alert System for Food
and Feed (RASFF) (number 2008.1034) was sent on 27 Aug 2008 by the Spanish
Food Safety Agency.

_S._ Kedougou is one of approximately 2000 _Salmonella_ serotypes that can
cause illness in humans but it is rarely reported in Spain. On average, 3
isolates per year were identified by the NRLS between 2002 and 2007. We
have found only 2 outbreaks of _S._ Kedougou described in literature, one
associated with salami (1), the other with jam and turkey meat (2). We are
not aware of any outbreak of _S._ Kedougou caused by the consumption of
infant formula milk. However, other serotypes of _Salmonella_ have been
associated with outbreaks linked to infant formula milk (3-12), one of them
in our country (3,4).
