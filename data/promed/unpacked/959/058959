Deadly, grisly rabies still threat in Lowcountry
------------------------------------------------
Earlier this month (November 2008) a red fox appeared from the
shadows of a gated Dunes West neighborhood and reminded a community
of an ancient disease that still lurks. Rabies can transform a
typically wary wild animal into a creature hellbent on spreading
disease. The virus ravages the nervous system and destroys the brain.
It can make animals furious, flaring aggression centers in the brain
and pumping bodies with adrenaline. At the other end of the spectrum,
rabies can freeze skittish creatures into a stupor, paralyzed and drooling.

On 3 Nov 2008 a red fox -- normally a timid species about the size of
a large cat -- chased down and bit a 9-year-old boy who was on his
way to catch the morning bus. Jeff Davis, a neighbor, ran outside and
called the boy into the Davises' house. When Davis and several others
went out on the raised porch, the fox screamed and snarled below,
then burst up the stairs and into the house. The fox latched onto
Davis' foot and bit him too, before Davis pulled the animal from his
foot and threw it into his office. There, the animal churned,
throwing itself against the windows before falling asleep on a dog
bed, where animal control snared it.

The rabies virus is shaped like a bullet and kills with greater
accuracy than its lead counterpart. Rabies is nearly 100 percent
fatal if left untreated before symptoms arise. Infected animals
usually die within 6 to 10 days of developing symptoms. By the time
an animal is visibly sick, enough virus exists for the disease to be
transmitted through saliva. A total of 13 animals in Charleston
County have tested positive for rabies in 2008, half of last year's
total of 26. Statewide, 162 animals were confirmed rabid in 2007.

In humans, the progression of rabies is not as well defined, said
Kathryn Arden, medical director for the South Carolina Department of
Health and Environmental Control [DHEC] Region 7, which includes
Berkeley, Charleston and Dorchester counties. The onset usually
begins with a tingling sensation at the site of the bite, Arden said.
Neurological symptoms follow, including headaches and poor balance.
Walking and talking are affected. Hallucinations, fear of water and
paralysis also can occur. Once symptoms begin, death is quick, Arden
said. The brain swells against the skull, inflamed and infected. The
last human rabies death in the state occurred in 1959, Arden said.

News broke this month that a 15-year-old boy from Brazil, who
contracted rabies from the bite of a vampire bat, is recovering after
doctors used a novel treatment developed at Children's Hospital of
Wisconsin [For details and an discussion of this case, see ProMED-
mail post: "Rabies, human survival, bat - Brazil: (Pernambuco)
20081114.3599"]. The protocol was developed in 2004 when a team of
doctors saved the life of a Fond du Lac teenager, who at the time was
the only known person to have survived rabies without having been vaccinated.

Now, a total of 3 children, including a Colombian girl, have survived
following close versions of the same treatment: A regimen of drug
therapies and a medically induced coma to protect the brain while the
virus attacked the body. Previously, the only other 5 people known to
have survived rabies after symptoms appeared either were vaccinated
in advance or received vaccine afterward. Of those 5 people, 4 ended
up with persistent movement difficulties.

Immediately following the attack, Jeff Davis and the boy began
inoculations, which are nearly 100 percent effective in preventing
rabies [if administered prior to the development of symptoms -
Mod.CP]. The 1st shot consists of immune globulin and a dose of
vaccine, followed by 4 more vaccinations. Immune globulin is a blood
product created from a healthy person who has been vaccinated against
rabies. This shot is given at the site of exposure, if it's known,
and the rest of the injections are given in an arm. Human rabies
vaccinations currently are paid for by DHEC to all state residents,
but that is likely to change soon with budget pressures, Arden said.
In the future, South Carolina will likely follow most other states,
which offer the shots free only to those who can't afford them. About
400 South Carolinians undergo preventive treatment for rabies
annually, said Sue Ferguson with DHEC.

[In 2008 21 confirmed rabid animals were identified in the South
Carolina counties of Berkeley, Dorchester and Charleston: 16
raccoons, 2 bats, 2 foxes and 1 cat. This incident appears to be the
1st report of human exposure to a rabid fox. The 2 people bitten by
the rabid animal have received post-exposure treatment and are not at
risk of developing disease. The newspaper article states that
possibly up to 7 people have recovered in situations where treatment
has been delayed till after development of symptoms. In a review of
the literature Wilde at al. (Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2008
Oct;102(10):979-82) concluded that rabies is not an invariably fatal
disease but (in addition to the Fond du Lac teenager) identified only
2 survivors with good neurological status in nearly 40 years. Both
had neutralizing antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid at or shortly
after presentation, but the usual diagnostic tests for rabies were
negative, a unique finding. It is highly probable that these 2
children managed to mount an unusually effective early immune
response to the infection that contributed to, or was responsible
for, recovery. The situation regarding the Brazilian boy bitten by a
vampire bat, referred to above, may be similar but has still to be
fully evaluated.
