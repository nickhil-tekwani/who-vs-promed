The incidence of hepatitis [A] virus infection has increased markedly
in Moscow. An increasing number of cases of hepatitis A and acute
intestinal infections are being observed. According to the medical
authorities, there have been more than 930 cases in the 1st 3 months
of 2010. This is 2-fold greater than for the same period last year
[2009]. The overall incidence of acute intestinal infections has
increased by almost 50 percent.

The regional Rospotrebnadzor [the Russian equivalent of a Public
Health Service] has attributed this situation to poor quality
tap-water. This is also cited by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
as the most frequent source of hepatitis A virus infection and other
intestinal infections.

According to Gennady Onishchenko [Russian Chief Public Health
Inspector], transmission by water is related to the poor state of
maintenance of the public water supply and violation of regulations
for supply of water for domestic use. Such a situation has been
prevalent for some time elsewhere in Russia, in the Khabarovsk Krai,
the Republic of Dagestan, and the Ryazan Oblast. Now, an outbreak of
hepatitis A virus infection is affecting the city of Moscow.

Hepatitis A is a viral liver infection that can result in mild or
severe illness. Hepatitis A virus is resistant to a range of
environmental conditions, including heat exposure and [some]
disinfectants. Formerly, hepatitis was known as infectious hepatitis,
epidemic hepatitis, infectious jaundice, and epidemic jaundice.

[Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person is
exposed to contaminated food and drink. The disease is closely
associated with poor sanitation, a lack of personal hygiene and poor
quality urban water supplies. The symptoms of hepatitis A virus
infection range from mild to severe and can include fever, malaise,
loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort,
dark-colored urine and jaundice. Not everyone who is infected will
have all or any of these symptoms. Adults have signs and symptoms of
illness more often than children, and the severity of disease and
mortality increases in older age groups.

Several hepatitis A vaccines are available internationally. All are
similar in terms of how well they protect people from the virus and
their side-effects. Nearly 100 percent of people will develop
protective levels of antibodies to the virus within one month after a
single dose of the vaccine. Even after virus exposure, one dose of
the vaccine within 2 weeks of contact with the virus has protective effects.

Visitors to Moscow should ensure they have been vaccinated or that
they avoid consumption of untreated tap water.
