At 8 pm on 29 Mar 2010, the Jingyuan County Animal Disease Prevention
and Control [Center] received a report from the Dawan Township
Veterinary Station saying that swine deaths had occurred for unknown
reasons on Zhuzhule Farm in Dongzhuang Village, requesting assistance
with diagnosis.

The Jingyuan County Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center
quickly sent officers and technical personnel to the scene. Based on
epidemiological survey, clinical symptoms, and etiological
investigation, anthrax was confirmed. The site was closed off and
other response measures taken. 101 swine on Zhuzhule Farm were culled
and safely disposed of, and the area was strictly closed off and
disinfected.

[Our thanks to Dan for finding this report.

Ningxia is a very small province in mountainous country in
north-central China. Pigs rarely get anthrax on their own, as they
have a measure of resistance. The number affected (101) and the time
of year (spring, not summer) suggest that this is the result of some
contaminated feed fed to these pigs on this pig farm. Pigs will get
infected from scavenging carcasses, usually dead sheep or cattle --
it is not unknown for them to be fed carcasses tossed into the pen --
but it is the wrong time of year for sheep/cattle cases. If one large
pig farm is affected, there will be others fed from the same batch of
feed. The feed will have been contaminated from having inadequately
sterilised bone meal added to it from rendered dead stock, probably
further east in China. We have seen this also in Central Russia and
elsewhere.
