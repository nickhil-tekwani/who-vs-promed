Two cases of foot-and-mouth disease have been discovered in the western
Saudi port city of Yanbu, an agriculture ministry official said yesterday.
"Two calves infected with the foot-and-mouth disease have been discovered in
Yanbu and a commission, headed by Interior Minister Prince Nayef, has been
formed to prevent the disease spreading," the official told AFP. The origin
of the 2 calves was not given. The commission will include the ministers
of agriculture, health, trade, economy and municipal affairs, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, Kuwait said
yesterday it was free from foot-and-mouth disease and had taken tough
measures to prevent its spread in the Gulf Arab state. "Thank God until now
we do not have any report of foot-and-mouth cases and this is due to the
precautions taken in Kuwait," Wafaa Shehab, public relations director at the
Public Authority for Agriculture and Fish (PAAF), told [news reporters.

[ProMED-mail is extremely grateful to Dr. Badrinath for sending this
information. We further compliment him for reaching beyond his usual
patients and paying close attention to an epidemic in another species. Of
course, epidemics in animal populations always exert a human toll as can be
seen clearly in the UK these days. We would be grateful to hear from
anyone in the Gulf who has knowledge of FMD events there. - Mod.PC
