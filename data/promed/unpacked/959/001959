In response to your request for information on the posting "HENDRA
VIRUS, HUMAN, EQUINE - AUSTRALIA (QUEENSLAND)" (Archive number
20070830.2851; published date 30 August 2007), please note the following:
There are no current cases of Hendra virus infection in horses in Queensland.
Extensive surveillance of the horse population in Queensland for
Hendra virus indicates that the virus does not circulate in the horse
population: approximately 4400 horses have been tested in Queensland
with negative results.
The natural host of Hendra virus are considered to be megachiropteran
fruit bats (genus _Pteropus_); disease in horses appears to be a rare
spillover event, but is expected that sporadic cases will continue to
occur in horses. Since its initial identification in 1994, Hendra
virus is routinely investigated in cases of severe respiratory
disease in horses. The disease is notifiable throughout Australia.

[ProMED thanks Dr Bernoth for this authoritative response. If
anybody has information about the autopsy results on the horse and
the diagnosis of the sick trainer, we would still be interested to
know. - Mod,JW]
