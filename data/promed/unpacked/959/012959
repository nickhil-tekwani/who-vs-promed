A government official says 4 Indonesians have died of bird flu,
bringing the death toll in the country hardest hit by the disease to
119. Bayu Krisnamurthi, chief of the National Bird Flu Commission,
said on Tuesday [3 Mar 2009] the victims died in January and February
[2009] and were all believed to have been infected by sick chickens.

Indonesia has been worst affected by bird flu since it started
ravaging Asian poultry stocks in late 2003, accounting for nearly
half the 256 human fatalities tallied worldwide. It used to announce
deaths immediately, but has come under fire in recent months for
keeping quiet about new cases.

Krisnamurthi would only say of the latest deaths that 2 were brothers
from Bogor and that the others died in Surabaya and Bekasi, all
cities on Java island.

[As of Wed 4 Mar 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) gives the
cumulative number of cases of avian influenza in Indonesia since 2003
as 141 and the number of fatalities as 115. The WHO Timeline
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_09_02_23.pdf>
has recorded no human cases of avian influenza in Indonesia during
2009 so far. Official confirmation of the cases described in the
above AP report (and details of their matching to the several
suspected cases recorded recently in ProMED-mail) is awaited.
