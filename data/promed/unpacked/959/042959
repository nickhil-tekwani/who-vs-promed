Confirmation of CCHF virus infection
------------------------------------
The results of the suspected CCHF [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever]
outbreak investigation in the South of Kazakhstan have now become
available [see ProMED-mail Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Kazakhstan:
(SK) 20090715.2529]. To recapitulate, in the city of Turkestan in
early July [4 Jul 2009] a mother died after delivery as a result of
hemorrhage and her newborn child did not survive. 3 doctors who
operated on her died afterwards. A week later, physicians were still
asserting that these 5 did not die ass a result of infectious
disease. However, now they accept that the cause was CCHF virus
infection. Subsequently there has been no spread on infection beyond
this group.

Two days after the deaths of these individuals the head of the local
department of Health was dismissed and the head of the obstetric
hospital resigned. The doctors caring for the 5 cases were exonerated.

The source of the outbreak was the mother but nobody could explain
how she became infected.

[This report clarifies the details of the recent CCHF incident in
South Kazakhstan. Unfortunately, the outbreak investigation was
unable to determine how the mother became infected. Probably, there
was a tick bite, not noticed or recalled. - Corr.VM]
