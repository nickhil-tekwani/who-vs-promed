The Government has ordered importers of 4 containers loaded with chicken
products to re-ship them to their point of origin in an effort to prevent
the dreaded bird flu from spreading into the country. The Coast Provincial
Veterinary officials impounded the 4 containers at the port of Mombasa.
Coast Provincial Veterinary Services director, Mr George Makalo, said the
Government would prevail upon the importers of the chicken products to
re-ship them back to their point of origin. Speaking to The Standard on
Sunday, Makalo said 2 of the containers imported from Egypt were impounded
by the Veterinary Department and port police in November in 2006. Police
impounded the remaining 2 containers imported from Malaysia and Thailand
during December 2006.
The veterinary official said the containers should be reshipped to Egypt,
Malaysia and Thailand, as they might expose Kenya to the risk of the
contagious flu. Police guarded the containers round the clock, he said.
Stringent measures had been put in place to ensure that chicken products
imported from countries affected by bird flu were not released to the local
market. Makalo warned local importers against violating a 1999 Government
ban on importation of chicken products from affected by the bird flu.

Togo has destroyed more than 3000 frozen chickens of suspect origin for
fear of introducing the devastating bird-flu virus into the West African
country, announced officials on Friday.
"These chickens have no health certificates and they have been outside the
control of health inspectors, since the vehicle that carried them was
seized in the city of Lome," Togolese agricultural minister Yves Madow
Nagou said on national television, announcing the destruction that took
place on Thursday.
Togo has banned since October 2006 the import of live chickens and their
products coming from countries afflicted with the deadly H5N1 strain of the
virus.
Lome has also reinforced inspections on poultry coming from countries still
untouched by the virus and crafted a national plan to fight against bird
flu. Epidemiologists have warned that H5N1 strain could trigger a global
pandemic if it were to mutate and become easily transmitted between humans.
Experts are particularly fearful of the virus' potential effects in Africa,
among other possible hot spots.
