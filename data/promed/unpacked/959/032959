Fresh outbreak of Lassa fever claims 2 lives in Nigeria
-------------------------------------------------------
Ebonyi State in eastern Nigeria on Monday [4 Feb 2013] confirmed a fresh outbreak of Lassa fever, saying that 2 people had died from the disease and 4 others were on the danger list. The permanent secretary in the state ministry of health, Hyacinth Oteh, announced the development while receiving the health emergency response team from the Federal Ministry of Health. Oteh said the outbreak of the disease was reported on 1 Feb 2013 and confirmed that 2 of the 6 patients infected with the disease had died while the other 4 were critical.

He regretted the absence of a virology laboratory in the state to aid early diagnosis and treatment of the disease, adding that some deaths had been recorded earlier when the disease was first reported in the state in 2005. The permanent secretary advocated for the establishment of a virology laboratory in each of the geo-political zones to help contain the spread of the disease through early diagnosis and treatment. He said medical doctors and other health workers involved in the fight against the disease should emphasize contact tracing in order to isolate people identified with the disease. According to him, the state government had commenced an enlightenment campaign on the resurgence of the disease and the need for members of the public to protect themselves.

Jerry Kehinde, the leader of the team, said 9 states, including Ebonyi, had been identified as Lassa fever prone and maintained that the Federal Ministry of Health was doing everything to contain the spread. He said the virus was being spread by a specie of rats known as [_Mastomys natalensis_]. He said the states affected were those ravaged by the 2012 flood disaster and warned the people to avoid contacts with rats. Kehinde said the team would identify the source of the infection and create public awareness about it.

[In the countries of central Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe multi-system disease. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever.

Lassa fever virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic. The reservoir of Lassa fever virus is a rodent known as the multimammate rat of the genus __Mastomys_. These rodents produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannahs and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. In addition, _Mastomys_ generally readily colonize human homes. Lassa fever may also spread through person-to-person contact. A case of nosocomial infection of a doctor in Ebonyi state was recorded last year [Lassa fever - Nigeria: (EB) nosocomial 20120119.1015405]. This type of transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with virus in the blood, tissue, secretions, or excretions of an individual infected with the Lassa fever virus.
