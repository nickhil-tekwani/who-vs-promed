100 cows slaughtered as TB hits Cumbrian farm
---------------------------------------------
Cumbrian farmers are on high alert after 100 animals tested positive
for tuberculosis (TB). 80 dairy cows on the farm near Penrith have
already been slaughtered and a further 20 are to be slaughtered next
week.

Spokeswoman from the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency
(AHVLA), Caroline Ling, said the agency was notified of the outbreak
when the farmer had 4 of his calves tested last month.

"Bovine TB outbreaks in Cumbria are very rare and there are serious
implications for the cattle owner," she said. "We're pursuing
epidemiological investigations to find where it has come from and
where it has gone to. We're working really hard to locate the source
of infection. We'll do everything we need to find the source of this
disease and that is a priority." She said the farm is running a closed
herd of 500 and there have not been any movements of animals off or
onto the farm recently.

NFU Cumbria county chairman Robert Craig said the outbreak had come
as a huge blow. "This is terrible news for this farming family, and
will come as a shock to farmers across the county and beyond," he
said. "It is important that we wait to hear from Animal Health the
findings of a contiguous test which is currently taking place and
which may provide some clues as to how a closed herd in Cumbria came
to be infected. I would urge everyone to place it in context with what
is happening in other areas of the country. The North West does not
have a problem with TB in its cattle; this type of herd breakdown is
extremely rare."

England farmers 'live with' bovine TB slaughters
------------------------------------------------
Last year [2010], a total of 24 899 cattle in England tested positive
for bovine tuberculosis (TB). All were slaughtered, in line with
government policy in place because the bovine bacterium can also cause
human TB.

In 2009, 25 557 cows had to be slaughtered, under the bovine TB
control measures. The West and South West are the worst affected parts
of England.

In one of the latest outbreaks on a farm near Penrith, Cumbria, 80
cows were slaughtered and a further 20, also classed as reactors, were
due to be killed.

The government pays compensation to farmers whose cattle have been
slaughtered to control the disease, ranging from BP 132 [USD 220] to
BP 1665 [USD 2780] per animal, depending on its age and type.

A total of BP 63m [USD 93 290 400] was spent dealing with bovine TB
in 2009/10 and the government said it recognised the disease had a
"devastating effect on many farm businesses and families."

Last year, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) began a public consultation on tackling the disease. The
result will soon be published. In the government consultation, the
National Farmers' Union (NFU) has backed a proposal to curb the
disease by licensing farmers to tackle TB on their land by killing
badgers or vaccinating them. Ministers have said this was also their
"preferred approach."

However, badger culls have been passionately opposed by a range of
animal welfare groups who say research has found no link between the
species and bovine TB. The Badger Trust says that government research
over decades "had yet to determine how badgers infect cattle" and
insisted that instead the badgers "very often" caught the disease from
cows. Meanwhile, some scientists say a badger cull could make the
problem worse because it could cause badgers to roam further.

A DEFRA spokesman said no decision on badger control had yet been
taken. "We received a large number of responses to the public
consultation which will be considering carefully in order to make the
best decision," he said. "We will announce our decision as soon as
possible as part of a comprehensive and balanced TB eradication
programme for England."

[The identity of the bacterium in the Cumbrian outbreak (likely to be
_Mycobacterium bovis_), as well as the results of the epidemiological
investigation into its route of introduction into the affected farm,
are anticipated with interest.

Badger source is the most likely one, but other potential sources of
infection in Cumbria should not be excluded. According to previously
posted information (archived 20100522.1703), the disease has been
detected in wild boars, as well as in cats, dogs, domestic pigs and
camelids. Those deserve to be taken into consideration in addition to
badgers. - Mod.AS
