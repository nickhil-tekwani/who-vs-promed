WHY I SUBSCRIBE TO ProMED-mail: C.J. PETERS
*******************************************
[see: Welcome to ProMED-mail's InterNet-A-Thon 990215202812]
Date: Thu, 14 Jan 1999
From: C. J. Peters, M.D. <cjp0@cdc.gov>

When [ProMED-mail] first came out, I found it to be a pain in the
neck.
There were a lot of postings that would have been more appropriately
resolved by a visit to the library and a lot of input from persons
with little or no expertise that just contributed to the general
noise level. Although advertised as not definitive, I found persons
accepting information from the service as accurate without knowing
the basis for reporting or any of the many caveats that had to be
applied to the material posted.
>From my personal perspective, I was often requested to comment by one
person or another and felt that I had no business airing information
that was more appropriately released by a foreign or state
government, nor did I wish to make any comments that could be
construed as CDC policy. (The only submissions I have made, with the
exception of comments on certain errors of fact, have been designed
to fall outside the area of my branch's expertise for this particular
reason).
Over the months, I have noted a change in my attitude. I find the
number of interesting new things that I have heard about more than
justify any carping that I may have had about the postings. I value
the information on plant and non-human animal diseases particularly.
These areas often do not receive the attention they deserve. Not
only do we all share the same planet and have interactions for that
simple reason, but the driving forces behind emerging pathogens are
often the same or, if different, instructive. The timely postings on
BSE were a case in point for me.
Furthermore, I think the level of editing has improved markedly.
There are still some media-like reports but increasingly they are
used just to get the ball rolling. The moderators exert a
light-handed effort to move the direction of the discussion to truly
new things or to elucidate murky areas. Errors of fact or fanciful
interpretations are addressed by gingerly worded comments by the
moderators or by posting more accurate information. I think you all
deserve congratulations for the way you have shaped the program.
ProMED-mail serves as a valuable information service for myself and
others and in addition raises our consciousness of the importance of
emerging infections. The increasing knowledge of specific infectious
problems serves to permit more timely international recognition of
important diseases. I would encourage you to continue personally
because the utility of the service depends on the quality of the
moderators. Degradation of the quality of ProMED-mail would be an
important loss.
