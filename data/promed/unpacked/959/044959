ACUTE FEBRILE ILLNESS, HORSES - ICELAND: REQUEST FOR INFO
*********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Gumundur Petursson <gpet@rhi.hi.is>

During the last couple of weeks an acute febrile illness of horses has
spread rapidly in the Icelandic horses (ponies) in the greater Reykjavik
area. There are remarkably few clinical symptoms except for high fever (up
to 41Â°C), loss of appetite and lassitude. Leucopenia has also been
observed. The disease seems to run its course in 2-4 days. The incubation
period is apparently 2-10 days. There are practically no respiratory
symptoms. In some horses constipation followed by diarrhea is seen. The
veterinary authorities have stopped all export of Icelandic horses for the
time being.
Any suggestions as to the possible etiology of this epizootic and specific
tests to be carried out in order to obtain a quick diagnosis would be
welcome.

[Except for the absence of laminitis and this being the wrong time of year,
this seems a bit like the way Potomac Horse Fever, caused by _Ehrlichia
risticii_, showed up in the United States in the late 1970s. With the
popularity of Icelandic ponies these days, I'm sure the world horse owning
community appreciates the export ban. Please send any suggestion directly
to Dr. Petursson. - Mod.PC]
