Dengue fever update - 2005
-----------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today
[13 Jan 2005] confirmed an imported case of dengue fever and urged the
public to guard against the disease.
Case details are as follows:
Age: 32
Sex: Female
Place of residence: Sham Tseng
Date of Onset: 24 Dec 2004
Symptoms: Fever, generalized rash
Present Condition: Admitted to Baptist Hospital in stable condition
Travel History: Traveled to Malaysia and Australia in December [2004]
before onset of symptoms. [The dengue fever outbreak in Townsville, north
Australia, was officially declared over in the 1st week of September 2004,
after no new cases were reported for the previous 3 months; see ref. (28)
below. Ref. 2005 (01) below reports a dengue alert for Selangor & Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia. - Mod.JW]
Cumulative Total in 2005: 1
* imported: 1
* local: 0
It is essential that people stay alert to the threat of dengue fever and
help in the reduction of mosquito breeding. To avoid mosquito bites:
- Put all used cans and bottles into dustbins with covers;
- Change water for plants at least once a week, leaving no water in the
saucers underneath flower pots;
- Cover tightly all water containers, wells and water storage tanks; and
- Keep all drains free from blockage.
Travelers should take the following preventive measures:
- Wear long-sleeved tops and trousers;
- Use insect repellent over the exposed parts of the body; and
- Use mosquito screens or nets when rooms are not air-conditioned.
Anyone feeling unwell after returning from their trip should consult a
doctor as soon as possible and provide details of their travel to the doctor.

Malaysia
----------
Malaysia's Health Minister, Chua Soi Lek, announced a doubling in dengue
cases last month [December 2004], from an average of 450 a week to about
1000, with the increase especially noticeable in the modern capital Kuala
Lumpur. 12 people have died from dengue fever since November [2004].
Abandoned building projects and construction sites, found to be the main
dengue culprits in Malaysia, will be targeted in a clean-up campaign to be
launched in the capital in an effort to stamp out the menace. Chua said
owners of a total of 14 186 premises had been fined and 59 people brought
to court last year [2004], after mosquitoes were found breeding in their
compounds.
[The ministry issued an alert for the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and Selangor
state on 2 Jan 2005; see ref. 2005 (01) below. - Mod.JW]
Singapore
----------
Singaporean authorities recorded more than 8500 dengue cases in 2004, a
10-year high and almost double the number in 2003. Starting next month
[February 2005], the city-state plans to impose fines on homeowners found
with mosquitoes breeding on their premises. Private homes, rather than
construction sites, are the main breeding grounds of mosquitoes in
Singapore, and 1st-time offenders will be fined the equivalent of 60 US
dollars, and double that for the next offence.
Most Singaporeans live in apartment buildings, but many families keep
potted plants and other receptacles in which mosquitoes can breed.
Penalties for construction sites where mosquitoes are found breeding are
much stiffer and can include up to 6 months in jail for those responsible.

70 cases of dengue detected in Penang
-----------------------------------------
Health authorities here have detected 70 dengue cases over the last 2
weeks. State Health, Welfare and Caring Society committee chairman P. K.
Subbaiyah, however, stressed that the increasing number of cases was not
due to the recent tsunami. "From past records, there is usually a sudden
surge in dengue cases every 4 years. This is a normal occurrence here and
has nothing to do with the tsunami," he told a press conference here
yesterday [13 Jan 2005].
Subbaiyah said the reported cases came from all over Penang island,
including Sungai Gelugor and Taman Bukit Jambul, the Penang Prison and the
Bandar Baru Air Itam police quarters. Whenever 2 or more cases are reported
in a particular area, surveillance and preventive measures would
immediately be intensified, he said.
At the end of last year [2004], a total of 1767 cases were reported,
compared to 733 cases in 2003.
"An area with suspected dengue cases will be fogged within 24 hours and
again after 7 days," he said.

361 dengue deaths recorded over last 6 years
-----------------------------------------------
A total of 361 people died of dengue fever out of 130 673 cases reported
since 1999, Health Ministry Disease Control Division Director Dr. Ramlee
Rahmat said Friday [14 Jan 2005]. He said the total did not include the
latest death reported in the 2nd week of this year [2005]. Of the last 6
years, 2002 recorded the highest number of dengue cases and deaths (99), he
told reporters here Friday.
Based on Health Ministry statistics,
- a total of 37 deaths were recorded in 1999 from 10 146 cases reported,
- 45 died in 2000 (7146),
- 50 people in 2001 (16 368),
- 99 in 2002 from (32 767),
- 72 in 2003 (31 043)
- 58 in 2004 (33 203).
He said the number deaths and cases reported in Malaysia remained at a low
level compared with several neighbors, including Thailand and Singapore.
The tourism sector need not worry, as the ministry was constantly
monitoring the situation, he said. He added that the disease could be
contained if everyone played their part, including continuously destroying
larvae breeding areas.

[University] undergraduates and schoolchildren are the most susceptible to
dengue fever, because they are active when Aedes mosquitoes feed. Some 53
percent of the 11 621 confirmed cases of dengue fever and dengue
hemorrhagic fever [DHF] last year [2004] were children and youths up to the
age of 24, said the Health Ministry's Communicable Disease Control Division.
Of these 6199 children and youths, roughly three-quarters were those aged
between 10 and 24 years. There were 33 025 suspected dengue cases last year
[2004].
Dr. Ramlee Rahmat, a director of the division, said a health ministry study
found students with dengue fever were bitten on university campuses and
during indoor and outdoor recreational activities. School children could
have been bitten in school buses and other vehicles, or, in school. They
could have also been bitten in the evening during outdoor activities and
when returning home from school, he added. "We are seriously concerned over
children becoming victims. School bus operators have been asked to use
aerosol insecticide before picking up children in the morning and school
managements to destroy all Aedes mosquito breeding grounds," Dr. Ramlee
said. The same goes for students in institutions of higher learning. Just 2
days ago, Health Minister Datuk Dr Chua Soi Lek said that schools were a
major breeding ground for Aedes mosquitoes, having been left empty during
the long school holidays.
Ramlee warned that fogging to kill mosquitoes was limited in its
effectiveness against the outbreak, giving "a false sense of security."
Larvae would still develop into adult mosquitoes, which would lengthen the
dengue outbreak. "Fogging is only a stop-gap measure to prevent more people
in one area from being victims of the disease," he said. So far, mosquitoes
have not become resistant to the chemicals used for fogging. However,
fogging should be closely supervised by health officials to ensure that it
is not haphazard, which could eventually lead to resistance, he added.
The week of 2-8 Jan 2005 saw a slight drop of 2.6 percent in the number of
suspected cases reported overall, to 1049 from 1077 the previous week.
However, the number of cases could rise again if proper measures, such as
destroying breeding grounds, were not taken, Dr. Ramlee said. Selangor
remained the state with the highest number of cases, which rose for the
period to 501 from 469 the previous week.
Penang, Johor, Pahang and Kedah [states] also saw more cases, while in
Kuala Lumpur and Perak, the number of cases fell substantially. Cases in
Penang rose to 70 from 62, Johor to 78 from 58, Pahang to 40 from 31, and
Kedah to 27 from 20. Cases in Kuala Lumpur dropped about 17 percent to 207
from 249, while in Perak, they fell to 12 from 82. Putrajaya has seen 8
cases so far this year [2005], against a total of 213 cases last year.
[A] 6-year-old is the 1st victim to succumb to the disease [die] this year
[2005]. Last year [2004] saw 58 deaths reported.
In checks by authorities, construction sites topped the list of areas found
with mosquito breeding grounds, followed by factories and vacant land. Dr.
Ramlee said the World Health Organization representative for Malaysia,
Singapore and Brunei has been in touch about the outbreak. "I informed him
Malaysia was taking the risk management approach. We want people, including
tourists, to know that we are taking all measures to keep the situation
under control. "Malaysia is still safe for tourists," Dr. Ramlee stressed.
