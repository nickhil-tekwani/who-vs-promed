This summer 6 people in the New York City metropolitan area have died
of the food-related illness listeriosis, according to city health
officials, who have issued warnings to the elderly, pregnant women,
and those with weakened immune systems, advising them to avoid soft
cheeses and deli meats.
While 4 of the deaths were in New Jersey, 2 were in New York City. In
all, as many as 44 people in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
have been among the dozens infected by the outbreak in the Northeast
and Midwest, with 8 of those cases in New York City.
Listeriosis is caused by _Listeria monocytogenes_, a species of
bacteria sometimes found in raw foods, including uncooked meat and
unpasteurized milk.
"This particular bacteria, unlike others, grows in cold
temperatures," said Richard McGarvey, a spokesman for the
Pennsylvania Department of Health. "So naturally what you tell people
is if they're going to eat meats, heat it up first."
The people who died had weakened immune systems, officials said,
which placed them at high risk. New York City Health Department
officials said 20 percent of those who have compromised immune
systems typically die if they contract listeriosis.
While the source of the illness is unknown, this summer's outbreak
was first identified in Pennsylvania [see ProMED posting
20020901.5205 -Mod.LL], where 4 elderly people have died from the
disease. It has also been found in Connecticut, Maryland, and
Michigan. DNA testing has shown that the bacteria in the cases in
New York City was the same strain as that in the Pennsylvania cases.
New Jersey health officials have reported 4 listeria-related deaths
among elderly people [see ProMED posting 20020915.5323 -Mod.LL], but
laboratory tests have not determined whether those deaths are tied to
the Pennsylvania cases.
Eating listeria-contaminated food results in flulike symptoms, which
may not show up for 10 weeks, including fever, muscle aches, and
diarrhea in otherwise healthy people. Pregnant women are at
particular risk; they are 20 times more likely to contract
listeriosis.
To prevent outbreaks of the disease, health officials advised washing
and cooking food thoroughly and keeping uncooked meats apart from
vegetables and other foods. They urged those at high risk for
contracting listeriosis, including pregnant women and the elderly, to
avoid hot dogs and luncheon meats or to reheat such meat until it is
"steaming hot." They also advised avoiding soft cheeses, including
feta and Brie, which are made with unpasteurized milk and can contain
the listeria bacteria.
Although the bacteria should be killed during processing by food
manufacturers, it has been found to survive in some ready-to-eat
meats. In New York City, recent outbreaks have been linked to hot
dogs, turkey meat, and refrigerated pate. In May 2002, a Bronx meat
packing firm recalled 77 000 pounds of hot dogs and bologna that
might have been contaminated with the organism.

[The FDA issued this release on 13 Sep 2002 regarding this multistate outbreak:
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Food Safety
Inspection Service (FSIS) are advising the public of a recent
increase in cases of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in Pennsylvania and
monitoring for possible increases in adjacent states. Contaminated
food products can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant
women, serious and sometimes fatal infections in newborns, frail or
elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy
individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever,
severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
The specific food associated with the increased incidence of illness
has not been identified. For this reason, FDA and FSIS are issuing
this advisory as it continues to work closely with CDC and the states
to identify the source of contamination. However, because of the
number of cases and serious illness caused by _Listeria
monocytogenes_, FDA and FSIS are providing the following information
and advice to consumers:
People at risk for listeriosis and their family members or
individuals preparing food for them should take the following
precautions:
Do not eat hot dogs and luncheon meats, unless they are reheated
until steaming hot.
Do not eat soft cheeses such as Feta, Brie and Camembert cheeses,
blue-veined cheeses, and Mexican-style cheeses such as "queso blanco
fresco."
Do not eat refrigerated pates or meat spreads. Canned or shelf-stable
pates and meat spreads may be eaten.
Do not eat refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is contained in a
cooked dish, such as a casserole. Refrigerated smoked seafood, such
as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod, tuna or mackerel, is most often
labeled as "nova-style," "lox," "kippered," "smoked," or "jerky." The
fish is found in the refrigerator section or sold at deli counters of
grocery stores and delicatessens. Canned or shelf-stable smoked
seafood may be eaten.
Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat foods that contain
unpasteurized milk.
Consumers experiencing the symptoms described above or concerned with
exposure should contact their physician immediately."
