The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collaborating with public health officials in many states and the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections. Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of the bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

A total of 16 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium have been reported from 5 states. The number of ill people identified in each state with the outbreak strain is as follows: Arizona (1), Illinois (2), Iowa (1), Michigan (9), and Wisconsin (3).

Among 16 persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 9 Dec 2012 to 7 Jan 2013. Ill persons range in age from 2 years to 87 years, with a median age of 48 years. 43 percent of ill persons are female. Among 13 persons with available information, 7 (53 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Preliminary results of antibiotic susceptibility testing indicate that this strain of _S._ Typhimurium is susceptible to commonly prescribed antibiotics. This PFGE pattern has rarely been seen before in PulseNet and in the past typically caused 0-1 case per month.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that ground beef produced by Jouni Meats, Inc. and Gab Halal Foods are likely sources of this outbreak of _S._ Typhimurium infections.

Initial investigations focused on 6 ill persons in Michigan and one ill person in Arizona who reported eating at the same restaurant before their illness began. All 7 of these ill persons reported eating raw ground beef kibbeh (a dish typically made of finely ground red meat, usually beef, minced onions, and bulghur wheat) at this restaurant before becoming ill. Investigations are ongoing to determine if the additional 9 ill persons may be linked to the recalled products.

The CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. The FSIS is continuing to work closely with the CDC and state partners during this investigation. The CDC will update the public on the progress of this investigation as information becomes available.

[Kibbeh or kibbe (also kubbeh or kubbi) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh) is an Arab dish made of bulgur or rice and chopped meat. The best-known variety is a torpedo-shaped fried croquette stuffed with minced beef or lamb. Other types of kibbeh may be shaped into balls or patties, and baked or cooked in broth. It is a popular dish in Levantine cuisine. It is widespread in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Egypt (where it is called koubeiba), Cyprus (where they are called koupes), Israel, the Palestinian Territories, the Arabian Peninsula, and several Latin American nations which received part of the Syrian and Lebanese diaspora during the early 20th century, such as Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras and Mexico. It can also be eaten raw. - Mod.LL
