LIQUID NITROGEN, VIRUS TRANSMISSION RISKS: REQUEST FOR INFO

From: Alan Julian <juliana@mqm.govt.nz>

I have had an enquiry from a medical centre about the risks of spreading
viral diseases through the use of liquid nitrogen to remove cutaneous
warts, verrucas or benign skin tumours.
Specifically they were concerned about papilloma virus[es] and HIV.
I believe that the instruments used for freezing these masses could
contaminate the liquid nitrogen. Single use swabs that are frozen in the
liquid nitrogen then used would prevent this but maybe multiple use
instruments are used.

I seek information on guidelines for this practice.

[If anyone has specific information about this potential risk, please
contact Dr. Julian directly. Epidemiologic studies of transmission of such
viruses would take many years. Meanwhile, it makes sense to not dip
instruments or swabs in viruses and then use them prior to sterilization
(which does not mean heating them a bit). -Mod.CHC]
