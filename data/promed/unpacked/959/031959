South Korea confirmed its first case of monkeypox infection on Wednesday [22 Jun 2022] out of 2 suspected cases. A South Korean national who arrived here from Germany on Tuesday afternoon [21 Jun 2022] was confirmed to be infected with the virus, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).

The patient developed headache on Saturday [18 Jun 2022] and showed symptoms, including mild fever, sore throat, asthenia, fatigue and skin lesions, on arrival. The South Korean voluntarily reported to the health authorities and was admitted to the Incheon Medical Center in Incheon, west of the capital Seoul.

Another suspected patient, a foreigner who arrived here on Monday [20 Jun 2022], tested positive for chickenpox, not monkeypox. After developing a sore throat and skin lesions from Sunday [19 Jun 2022], the foreigner visited a hospital in Busan, about 450 km south east of Seoul, on Tuesday [21 Jun 2022] and was admitted to the hospital for treatment.

The health authorities raised the risk level of monkeypox from "attention" to "caution" to contain the virus spread through cooperation among ministries. South Korea has designated monkeypox as a 2nd-degree infectious disease in its 4-tier system. In the 2nd-degree category are 22 contagious diseases, including COVID-19.

The Ministry of Health (MoH) has confirmed an imported case of monkeypox here. The patient is a 42 year old British man who works as a flight attendant and was in Singapore between last Wednesday and last Friday (15-17 Jun 2022) and again on Sunday [19 Jun 2022] as he flew in and out of the country, said the MoH on Tuesday night [21 Jun 2022].

He tested positive for monkeypox on Monday [20 Jun 2022] and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His condition is stable, said the MoH, adding that contact tracing is ongoing. Thirteen close contacts had been identified as of Tuesday [21 Jun 2022]. All close contacts will be placed on quarantine for 21 days since their last contact with the patient. The 2 low-risk contacts have also been placed on phone surveillance, said the MoH.

Those under phone surveillance will receive daily phone calls during a 21-day period to monitor for any onset of symptoms. If they are suspected of being infected, they will immediately be taken to the NCID for further evaluation and isolation to prevent further transmission.

This is the 1st imported monkeypox infection detected in Singapore since 2019, when a Nigerian man tested positive. The MoH also said on [6 Jun 2022] that a traveller who transited through Singapore to Australia the week before had tested positive for monkeypox.

Giving more details about the latest imported case, the MoH said the man developed a headache on [14 Jun 2022] and a fever 2 days later [16 Jun 2022]. These symptoms subsequently resolved, but he then developed rashes on his skin on Sunday [19 Jun 2022]. He sought medical attention via teleconsultation that night and was taken to the NCID the next day [20 Jun 2022] for further assessment.

The MoH said contact tracing is ongoing for the affected flights and for the duration of his stay in Singapore. "During this period, he had largely remained in his hotel room, except to visit a massage establishment and eat at 3 food establishments on [16 Jun 2022].

"In general, the risk of transmission to visitors at these locations is low, as data has shown that monkeypox transmits through close physical or prolonged contact. All 4 locations visited by the case are undergoing cleaning and disinfection," said the ministry. It urged members of the public, especially travellers, to be vigilant and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene, including washing their hands frequently after going to the toilet or when their hands are soiled. The MoH [advised] that [people] should seek immediate medical attention if they develop any disease symptoms -- such as the sudden onset of high fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash -- that are compatible with monkeypox, and they should inform their doctor of their recent travel history.

Chile added its 2nd case of monkeypox on Monday [20 Jun 2022] in a person who traveled to Europe, 3 days after the 1st infection was confirmed, according to the Ministry of Health. The virus was detected through PCR analysis in an adult person from the La Araucan√≠a region, 600 kilometers [373 mi] south of Santiago, who had traveled to Europe in the last 3 weeks.

As with the first registered case, "the person is in good health, without complications and is serving a period of isolation," officials reported from the ministry.

Last Friday [17 Jun 2022], the infection of a young adult from the Metropolitan Region, in which the capital is located, was confirmed. The case also had a history of a trip to Europe and presented with spots and scabs on the skin.

A further 219 cases of monkeypox have been detected in the UK, bringing the nationwide total to 793. In new data released on Tuesday [21 Jun 2022], the UK Health Security (UKHSA) said 99% of infections were among men; just 5 women have so far been infected with the viral disease.

The majority of UK cases are also among London residents (498 of 624 with reported home address), UKHSA added. The median age of confirmed infections is 37. Of the UK's 793 cases, 766 are in England, 18 are in Scotland, 6 in Wales and 3 in Northern Ireland.

It comes as scientists warned that the spread of monkeypox in Britain has yet to be halted. "At the moment there is no clear evidence that the current epidemic is coming under control," Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, told The Guardian.

UKHSA said the outbreak has mainly been in gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men without documented history of travel to endemic countries. Previous infections in the UK had been either imported from countries where monkeypox is endemic or contacts with documented epidemiological links to imported cases. Between 2018 and 2021, there were 7 cases of monkeypox detected in the UK.

UKHSA will now release the latest monkeypox case updates twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays.

[A 21 Jun 2022 report from the UK Government indicated the monkeypox vaccination policy as presented in a strategy published the same day by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). It recommends that some gay and bisexual men at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox should be offered vaccines to help control the recent outbreak of the virus. In response, the UKHSA vaccination strategy recommends offering the smallpox vaccine Imvanex, which is shown to be effective against monkeypox, to men considered to be at higher risk of exposure.

An individual's eligibility would depend on a number of factors but would be similar to the criteria used to assess those eligible for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) -- but applied regardless of HIV status. The strategy states that a clinician may advise vaccination for someone who, for example, has multiple partners, participates in group sex or attends 'sex on premises' venues.
