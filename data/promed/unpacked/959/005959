An outbreak of cholera has killed at least 9 people in South Africa"s
eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal and the disease is likely to spread in
the region, health officials said on Wednesday. KwaZulu-Natal health
department director (programme development) Colin MacKenzie said 928 cases
of cholera had been registered since the first case was reported 4 to 5
weeks ago and the health department had started a massive awareness
programme to contain its spread. "There has been a disturbing new
development in the last 3 days in that a number of cases have been
identified in an area approximately 80 km (50 miles) from the original
site," MacKenzie told Reuters.
The cases were largely concentrated in areas near South Africa"s east
coast, where a number of game reserves attract hundreds of tourists every
year. MacKenzie said the epidemic was unlikely to spread to the tourist
sites as they had piped safe water but there were fears it might spread
into other rural areas which had no access to safe water. Cholera, which
kills by causing diarrhoea so severe that victims die of shock from loss of
fluids, is contracted via contaminated water. MacKenzie said his department
had not yet managed to identify the source of the outbreak in the province,
but health authorities suspected it might have originated from neighbouring
Mozambique which had an outbreak of the disease following floods which hit
the country earlier this year.
