[In Spanish, translated & summarized by Mod.JW


The number of confirmed cases of YF is now 4, including 2 deaths.
This is the result of testing the 35 samples of suspect cases from
Yapacani from last week; 4 of those cases are being retested and the
rest were negative.

One of the newly confirmed cases was a 4-year-old girl from Santa Fe
who died last Saturday. The other is an adult from San Juan de
Yapacani who is under care.

Samples from 3 more suspect cases were sent from Yapacani hospital
last Saturday for testing. One of those cases, a 52-year-old male, is
thought to have contracted the disease between Guabira & Portachuelo.
Another, a 42-year-old male, has been admitted to the Japanese
hospital in Santa Cruz [the district capital -- I sincerely hope he is
being kept under a mosquito net, else there is a risk of him starting an
urban outbreak. - Mod JW.

In response, the whole population of Yapacani, San Juan & San Carlos
are being immunized, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated
before, doctors are being informed about how to treat YF, and house
spraying with insecticide has started in Yapacani, San Carlos & Santa
Fe. Control teams will also visit Buenavista.

The authorities are asking that patients not be moved from one hospital
to another for fear of spreading the outbreak [by infecting local
mosquitoes.
