No mention was made in this notice of the strain of rabies virus with which
the raccoon was infected. The Northeast US, like all regions of the
continent, has certain endemic wildlife reservoir-based strains of rabies.
New England enjoys the bat, fox, skunk raccoon strains, and while theses
strains tend to occur in the species for which they are named, they are not
restricted to infection in these hosts. Rabid raccoons in the Midwest, for
example, are usually victims of bat or skunk strains since we (as yet) do
not have raccoon strain (thanks to the dedicated, resourceful and hard
working public servants in Ohio).
I understand cases of raccoon strain rabies have been on the decline in
Maine in recent years. If this raccoon was a victim of the raccoon strain
it may be of greater significance than if it were one of the other endemic
strains, particularly when the relatively northern location within the
state is considered.
Is strain typing being conducted?

[Steve makes a good point and he is quite correct in stating there are
different strains in different regions. I do not know if strain typing is
being considered. If anyone in a place of authority could tell us which
strain was involved in the raccoon we would appreciate your help. - Mod.TG
