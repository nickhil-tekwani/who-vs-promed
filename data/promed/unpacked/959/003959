[Poland's most recent follow-up report on ASF, No. 128, was submitted to the OIE on 5 Oct 2016, reporting 2 new cases in wild boars in the northeastern province of Podlaskie, bordering Bealarus (see, with interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=21157).

The current (6 Oct 2016) report seems to refer to a new outbreak on a domestic pig farm; confirmation, in an official report, is anticipated.

ASF is continuing its spread in other European countries. The most recent follow-up reports have been submitted from Russia and Lithuania (in parentheses, date submitted):

- Russia (7 Oct 2016): http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=21138
- Lithuania (6 Oct 2016): http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=21163

OIE maps showing all reported ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs and wild boars worldwide since 1 Jan 2016 -- updated on 7 Oct 2016 -- are referred to at http://tinyurl.com/hv2us2d (click on the cluster of interest, zoom-in).

Moldova reported, on 4 Oct 2016, its 1st cases in domestic pigs (see 20161004.4535950); this means an increasing threat to Romania, on its west.

Subscribers may wish to visit the recent (4-5 Oct 2016) EU presentations on ASF in Estonia, Latvia and Poland, available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/health/regulatory_committee/presentations_en.htm#20161004.
