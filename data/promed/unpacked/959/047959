Iraq: avian influenza situation - WHO update 4
----------------------------------------------
A WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom has verified H5N1
avian influenza as the cause of death of a 39 year old Iraqi man,
previously announced by the Ministry of Health [and identified as the uncle
of the 1st case; a 15 year old girl in the Kurdistan region - Mod.CP].
This brings the number of laboratory-confirmed cases in Iraq, listed in the
WHO cumulative table, to 2 [and the global total to 174 - Mod.CP]. Both
cases were fatal. [Bringing the global total of deaths to 94. - Mod.CP].
Virus has been isolated from these samples, and genetic sequencing is
presently under way.
The UK laboratory is also conducting tests on samples taken from additional
cases under investigation from the northern province of Sulaimaniyah and
the southern provinces of Basra and Missan.
Diagnostic testing was initially delayed by problems encountered in the
shipment of samples from Iraq. Most of these problems have now been solved.
To date, poultry outbreaks of H5 avian influenza have been confirmed in
Sulaimaniyah and Missan provinces. Both outbreaks are thought to have begun
in mid-January [2006].

[The precise identity of the additional cases now undergoing testing at the
WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom is unclear. These
samples are stated to have originated from cases in the northern province
of Sulaimaniyah and the southern provinces of Basra and Missan, whereas the
most recent information relayed from the Iraqi Ministry of Health (see:
Avian influenza, human - worldwide (18): Iraq 20060301.0653) states that 3
suspected cases from Baghdad and one from the town of Kefry, in Dayala, are
under test. This suggests that the virus may be present throughout
northern, central, and southern Iraq. - Mod.CP]
