A La Plata County man has tested positive for plague, the 1st
confirmed case of human plague since the summer of 2005, when 2 cases
were reported in the county, the San Juan Basin Health Department
said Tue, 18 Jul 2006.
The man has been treated at a hospital and has been released and is
recovering, said Lynn Westberg, director of San Juan Basin Health.
During the past 30 years, there have been 49 reported cases of plague
in humans in Colorado. Human c s in the USA occurs mostly in rural
areas, with an average of 10 to 15 cases each year nationwide.
In Southwest Colorado, 7 animals -- including squirrels, household
cats, and prairie dogs -- have tested positive for plague this
summer, according to a news release from the health department. "This
year particularly, there seems to be a lot of plague, and it is
widespread throughout the county and region," Westberg said.
Cats become infected from flea bites or by direct contact with
infected rodents. Plague-infected cats will generally have a history
of roaming freely in rural or semi-rural areas, and their owners
often report that the felines are known hunters. Infected cats
frequently exhibit swelling and sores around the mouth, head and neck
and appear ill. Pet owners should seek veterinary care for such
animals. Because domestic cats can carry infected fleas into the
home, it is important to consult a veterinarian for information about
flea control for pets, health experts say.

[The manifestations of plague in this man were not stated, but it is
most likely that this was bubonic plague. A map of Colorado showing
