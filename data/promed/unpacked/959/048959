TICK PARALYSIS, ALBATROSS & PETRELS - NEW ZEALAND: REQUEST FOR INFO
===================================================================

URGENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.
During the current breeding season the populations of Northern Royal
albatross
(_Diomedea sanfordi_) have been suffering slightly more than their usual
collection of troubles. This is a very small population of albatrosses
nesting
on the New Zealand mainland.
A major infestation of ticks (probably _Ixoides eudyptitus_) has killed at
least 2% of the breeding population at one of the major breeding islands in
the
Chatham Islands over a period of 2 months. Probable cause is 'ascending
motor
paralysis' which starts at the feet and works up over a period of a week to
10
days. While this has been seen in small isolated pockets before, this
season it
seems to be present in epidemic proportions. Also affecting Northern Giant
petrels (_Macronectes halli_), both chicks and adults which breed with the
albatrosses on the same island, but not obvious in the Northern Bullers
Mollymawk which also breeds there.
I would be interested in hearing of any similar events which have occurred
in
Procellariformes before and an indication of any causes or effects which
have
been seen in other species.
[Human tick paralysis is cured instantly by simply removing the tick(s).
Acaricides should NOT be used, because as long as the tick remains
attached,
the paralysis continues. Australia has developed a tick vaccine for
livestock, but I don't know if it has been tested on avians, and obviously
it should be carefully dose tested in albatross before widespread use.
See:
Tick vaccine for cattle (04) 970204104952. Mod. JW]
[I found a website which indicates that tick paralysis from _Ixodes
holocylcus_ occurs fairly frequently in pet animals in Australia. Treatment
consists of tick removal, sedation, administration of hyperimmune serum and
supportive treatment. None of this may be feasible in this situation but
here's the website created by Robert Wylie - a the veterinarian, who
appears
to extensive experience with treating tick paralysis. He is at Ulladulla
veterinary hospital, http://www.peg.apc.org/^ullavet/tickhtml. .-Mod. pc]
