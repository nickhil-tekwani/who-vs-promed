Status of rural anthrax in Argentina in 2017
--------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The annual assessment of bovine anthrax outbreaks and the isolation of its causing agent, _Bacillus anthracis_, are confirmed by comparing epidemiological data from several current scenarios, some of them permanently monitored in the last 40 years.

1. Assessment area of rural anthrax in the province of Buenos Aires (1977-2017): (Over the surveillance period of 40 years) this is the 1st time there were no anthrax outbreaks (in this anthrax control and surveillance area.) Samples from the 30 districts of this province were voluntarily sent by private vets. The results were 463 isolations of _Bacillus anthracis_ with an annual percentage distribution of 11 percent for the term 1977-2017, the highest was 18 percent during the term 1977-1981 and the lowest was 5 percent in 2007-2011.

2. Alert zone and response, district of Azul (2004-2017): there have not been bovine anthrax outbreaks since 2013 or sick people as to this matter. It was created by decree no. 661-04 of the municipality of Azul. There is a historic record of 67 anthrax outbreaks, which originated in 20 human alerts and 21 vet alerts. 1 999 692 bovines have been simultaneously vaccinated, foot and mouth disease - carbuncle, since 2004 and without any technical inconvenience recorded.

3. Isolations made in other [veterinary diagnostic labs] (2006-2017): 5 veterinary diagnostic labs of the province of Buenos Aires and La Pampa assessed a total of 61 samples (applying similar diagnostic methodology) and isolated 1 strain of _Bacillus anthracis_ with an annual percentage distribution of 1.6 percent. [The other Buenos Aires veterinary laboratories were in Bahia Blanca, Tandil, Rauch, and Balcarce. Rauch had the single livestock isolate. The other negative veterinary laboratory is in Santa Rosa, La Pampa. - Mod.MHJ]

4. Districts of the province of Buenos Aires involved in carbuncle outbreaks: the historical annual average occurrence was of 13 outbreaks in 9 districts of the province of Buenos Aires during the term 2005-2017.

5. Production of anti-anthrax vaccine for vet use: 19 036 415 million doses were manufactured with a decrease of 4 million doses compared to those produced in 2006. This situation puts future programmes of rural anthrax control in Argentina at risk.

6. Mandatory bovine vaccination: 3 areas of mandatory anti-anthrax vaccination were tried to be assessed:
a. Province of Buenos Aires: there was no information in the month of April.
b. Province of Santa Fe: there was no information.
c. Alert zone and response (district of Azul, province of Buenos Aires): 224 381 bovines were vaccinated, 73 percent of its "susceptible population", 53 000 less bovines than in 2016.

7. Cases of human anthrax countrywide: 4 cases of skin anthrax countrywide: 3 in the province of Santa Fe and 1 in the province of Buenos Aires. [Presumably associated with the livestock outbreak in Rauch. - Mod.MHJ]

Conclusion
----------
Items 1,2, and 3 of the systematized assessment of this report showed a significant decrease in bovine anthrax outbreaks. There is a systemic apathy in provinces with mandatory vaccination programmes, which might affect the future of an efficient control of this zoonosis. The efficient intervention of the health authority on focal points, the proper elimination of carcasses, and the annual vaccination of susceptible categories are the only tools to the control thereof as a preventive measure and the protection of legally protected interests, human health, and cattle health as the source of production of this stock breeding country.

[The Argentinians are to be truly congratulated on this very significant reduction in anthrax incidence. Yes, they had an outbreak in Rauch in 2017 and had one earlier this year (2018) in the municipality of Paraje Muñoz, Laprida county, in a herd that had not been vaccinated in spite of the compulsory livestock vaccination in place in Buenos Aires province. Welcome to the reality of anthrax eradication. Until the estancia owners realise that procrastination is not the answer we will see the occasional outbreak until universal vaccination is in place, when the disease will be silent. But the good news is that we are in sight of seeing livestock anthrax being eradicated from the province of Buenos Aires and hopefully the other provinces will take note of this major achievement of a very serious reduction. - Mod.MHJ
