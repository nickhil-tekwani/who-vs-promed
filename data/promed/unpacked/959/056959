An _E. coli_ outbreak that may have sickened more than 50 people who
ate at an Ontario Harvey's restaurant will grow in the coming days,
health officials warned yesterday [15 Oct 2008] as they scrambled to
determine the source of the contamination and who else may be at risk.

14 people were confirmed to have fallen ill from _E. coli_ O157:H7
bacteria after eating at a North Bay Harvey's franchise. Another 38
illnesses linked to the same restaurant are under investigation to
determine whether they are the result of _E. coli_ contamination. But
health officials fear that number could climb significantly because
it can take several days for people to feel ill after coming in
contact with _E. coli_. In addition, people who are ill could
unwittingly infect family members and friends.

A total of 19 people have been hospitalized since the outbreak began
on the weekend [11-12 Oct 2008]. 9 remained in hospital yesterday [15
Oct 2008], but none have been admitted to the intensive care unit.
The people affected range in age from 9 to 84.

North Bay's health unit ordered the Harvey's restaurant on Algonquin
Avenue to close this week once officials realized everyone who had
fallen ill had eaten there. It's unclear how long it will remain
closed, said Rick McNabb, president of Harvey's Canada. "We need to
determine exactly what happened here before we even consider opening
the restaurant," Mr McNabb said. "This is obviously a tough situation."

While all of the cases of illness have been linked to one restaurant,
it is possible the outbreak is part of a larger problem that could
affect people in other communities, said Doug Powell, associate
professor of food safety at Kansas State University. For instance, a
product such as lettuce, which is usually shipped to food retailers
across a large area, could be the source of contamination.

"Just because it's a Harvey's, you can't assume it's the hamburger,"
Prof Powell said. "It could be a fresh product, something that's not
cooked and it could be distributed to other places."

[The scope and source of this outbreak are still to be defined. With
the initial site identified being a fast food restaurant, it is
indeed likely that other ones will be affected. As noted in the
posting, ground beef is always a suspect but fresh produce,
especially if bagged, should also be high on this list. Many
outbreaks such as this one involve Canada's southern neighbor, the
USA, as well.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank "David Fisman"
<david.fisman@gmail.com> for submitting a similar article on this
outbreak. Dr. Fisman raised the concept that it would be interesting
if this outbreak ended up being associated with the current ongoing
outbreak of E.coli in college students in Michigan associated with
packaged lettuce (see E. coli O157, university students - USA (06):
California lettuce 20081015.3266). - Mod.MPP]
