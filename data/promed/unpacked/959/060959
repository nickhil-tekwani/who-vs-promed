After studying unusual skin lesions seen in 2 orphaned sea otter pups, University of Florida [UF] scientists and their collaborators have identified a previously unknown poxvirus in the infected animals.

"To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of a poxvirus in a mustelid, the group of mammals including otters, mink, badgers, and related species," said James Wellehan, an assistant professor at the UF College of Veterinary Medicine who specializes in virology and zoological medicine.

Members of the poxvirus family cause significant disease affecting both animal and human populations, and the emergence of smallpox in humans became a global pandemic.

The scientists say the potential for transmission of this particular poxvirus to humans is unclear. Although no pox infections have been reported in humans exposed to sea otters, the scientists advise wearing protective clothes and gloves when handling these animals, either in the wild or in rehabilitation settings.

The otter pups came from 2 geographically and genetically distinct populations -- one in Alaska and one in California -- so the researchers say the virus must be geographically widespread. Both otters were undergoing rehabilitation at the time the skin lesions were noted and subsequently tested. [Or one could have been the index case and infected the other. - Mod.JW]

DNA testing revealed that viral gene sequences from both animals were identical, and that it represents a virus that had never been identified, according to findings that now appear online in the Journal of Wildlife Diseases.

UF researchers found the virus poses a threat to the otters because the lesions it causes interfere with the animals' hair coat, impeding their natural ability to survive in water.

"When you look at a Steller's sea cow, which is now extinct, a whale or a seal, they all have significant blubber layers," Wellehan said. "But what keeps sea otters alive in the cold water is their hair coat. Anything affecting their hair coat, with its incredible density of fur, is a huge problem for them."

Researchers need to do additional studies to determine the source of the virus, how it was transmitted to the otters, its potential for transmission to humans and its biological significance. "Understanding the diversity, ecology, and evolution of medically important groups of viruses is crucial to prediction and monitoring," Wellehan said.

Other collaborators on the research team included Thomas B Waltzek, an assistant professor of infectious diseases and co-director of UF's Aquatic Animal Health program, Alaska SeaLife Center, Monterey Bay Aquarium, Northwest ZooPath, and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

J Wildl Dis. 2014; available at http://www.jwildlifedis.org/doi/abs/10.7589/2013-08-217.

The abstract reads:
"Small superficially ulcerated skin lesions were observed between October 2009 and September 2011 during captive care of 2 orphaned sea otter pups: one northern (_Enhydra lutris kenyoni_) in Alaska and one southern (_Enhydra lutris nereis_) in California. Inclusions consistent with poxviral infection were diagnosed by histopathology in both cases. Virions consistent with poxvirus virions were seen on electron microscopy in the northern sea otter, and the virus was successfully propagated in cell culture. DNA extraction, pan-chordopoxviral PCR amplification, and sequencing of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene revealed that both cases were caused by a novel AT-rich poxvirus. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses found that the virus is divergent from other known poxviruses at a level consistent with a novel genus. These cases were self-limiting and did not appear to be associated with systemic illness. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of a poxvirus in a mustelid species. The source of this virus, mode of transmission, zoonotic potential, and biological significance are undetermined."

The _Poxviridae_ are large DNA viruses that replicate in the host cytoplasm. The subfamily _Chordopoxvirinae_ infects diverse range of taxa. Little is known about poxvirus infecting carnivores. Some viruses in the genus _Orthopoxvirus_ infect raccoons, skunks, and other carnivores, and some _Parapoxvirus_ infect cats and pinnipeds.
