---------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Rice yellow mottle virus_ (RYMV) of the genus _Sobemovirus_ is a
major biotic constraint to rice (_Oryza sativa_) production in
Africa. First reported in Kenya during 1966, RYMV was later found in
most countries in Africa where rice is grown. In countries in
westernmost Africa (The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, and
Senegal), plants with leaf yellowing and mottling symptoms were
observed, but RYMV was never isolated. Rice is the staple food in The Gambia.

In 2006, 4 samples were collected from local rice varieties in the
Kuntaur Region in the center of The Gambia. Mechanical inoculation
with leaf extracts from all samples caused typical yellow mottle
symptoms on susceptible rice varieties. RYMV was detected in the 4
samples collected by ELISA [enzyme linked immunosorbent assay]. The
720-nucleotide coat protein gene was amplified for each isolate by
reverse-transcriptase-PCR [polymerase chain reaction]. The RT-PCR
products were directly sequenced and then compared with a pool of
RYMV coat protein sequences from West African isolates. Phylogenetic
reconstruction indicated that the isolates from The Gambia formed a
monophyletic group with over 97 percent nucleotide identity, and are
closely related to isolates of other countries in West Africa
(Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, and Sierra-Leone) with 91
to 94 percent identity.

Detection of RYMV in The Gambia indicates that RYMV is present in
westernmost Africa, which is referred to as the 'rice belt' of
Africa, and shows that RYMV is widely distributed from eastern Africa
(Tanzania) to the western part of the continent.

[_Rice yellow mottle virus_ (RYMV, genus _Sobemovirus_, not yet
assigned to family or order) was originally confined to one district
of Kenya. However, large-scale rice irrigation projects lead to build
up and wide dissemination of the virus and its vectors in sub-Saharan
Africa. It is now the most serious pathogen of irrigated and lowland
rainfed rice in West and Central Africa, and losses of up to 100
percent have been reported.

Besides rice, the virus also affects a number of other grass species.
Symptoms include stunting, reduced tillering, mottling and yellowish
streaking of the leaves, delayed flowering or incomplete emergence of
the panicles and, in extreme cases, death of plants. RYMV is spread
by a number of insect vectors, mainly by several species of beetles
(for example _Chaetocnema pulla_). It does not appear to be seed
transmitted in rice, but it can be spread by mechanical means, which
is thought to account for much of its spread in the field. For
example, a severe increase of RYMV incidence was noted in areas that
switched rice cultivation methods from direct seeding to
transplanting of seedlings. The virus survives in crop residues, and
volunteer rice and grassy weeds serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease
management includes cultural practices as well as control of vectors
and reservoir hosts.

The virus is highly variable, and different strains may have
different levels of virulence. RYMV isolates originating in closely
related agro-ecological zones show variability in the coat protein.
As a consequence, very few rice varieties resistant or tolerant to
RYMV are known. Resistance breeding programmes are in progress at the
Africa Rice Centre (WARDA), one of the research centres of the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
