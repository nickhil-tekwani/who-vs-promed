Strategy for the "meningitis belt"

Re: the Hajj. There normally are about 2 million pilgrims. Saudi Arabia
requires vaccination certificates of all pilgrims, and vaccination [will also
be done] at port of entry. Saudi Arabia stocks 3 million doses of
meningococcal meningitis vaccine A and C.
These measures are due to large outbreaks in subsaharan Africa in 1996,
mainly in five countries with an estimated caseload of 250,000 cases and
25,000 deaths. Highest caseload was in Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Niger.
Countries and private individuals/agencies have bought large stocks of
vaccine, so that during the epidemic season 1997 (January - May) there are
few stocks of vaccine available worldwide.
WHO/IFRC/UNICEF/MSF launched a joint international appeal in February, 1997
for 14 million doses of vaccine to be kept as emergency stock. An
International Coordination Group (ICG) in Geneva deals with allocation of
vaccine, epidemic information, etc. WHO has been appointed secretary of this
interagency mechanism.
Focal points: Dr. Maria Santamaria WHO/HQ, Dr. Wahdan WHO/EMRO,
Dr. Barakamfitiye WHO/AFRO, Dr. Kreysler/ IFRC, Geneva [International
Federation of Red Cross & Red Crescent Societies], Dr.Martin UNICEF Geneva,
Dr. Henkens MSF/Brussels [Medecins sans Frontieres].
Main vaccine suppliers are Pasteur Merieux, McKline Beecham and Zagreb.
Total required doses for annual epidemic control are estimated at 60-80
million doses, which outstrips vastly present production capacity.
