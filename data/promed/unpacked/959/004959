Recent outbreaks of largemouth bass virus (LMBV) on 5 Texas reservoirs and
on lakes in 4 other Southern states have biologists curious as to where
else the disease may have spread beneath the Lone Star. Biologists are
seeking help from local fishermen and angling groups to make this
determination.
According to a release from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD)
officials this summer will conduct studies on 49 of the state's most
popular reservoirs along 13 major river drainages to determine if LMBV is
present and to what extent. In addition, they'll be looking for clues as to
what starts the outbreaks and how it might be prevented.
Collected bass will be individually weighed, measured, labeled and frozen
for prompt forwarding to the laboratory. Other information regarding
weather, aquatic vegetation present in each lake, and water quality will be
gathered simultaneously by field personnel. Ultimately, the sample fish
will be tested for LMBV at the A.E. Woods State Fish Hatchery in San Marcos.
"We want to emphasize it is not necessary to sacrifice large, trophy-size
bass for this study," said TPWD Regional Fisheries Director Dave Terre.
"We're launching this study to see if this virus is present anywhere else
in Texas," said Phil Durocher, TPWD's director of inland fisheries.
Biologists don't know how long LMBV has been in Texas waters, what triggers
its deadly effect on largemouth bass, or whether it might impact other
species. Patterns revealed by preliminary research, however, indicate the
disease is restricted only to largemouths and extreme high temperatures
could be a catalyst.
TPWD has a reputation among wildlife and fisheries agencies around the
nation for producing some of the best and most reliable scientific data
useful in the management of natural resources. The department's enlistment
of help from Texas bass fishermen for this particular study indicates the
sense of urgency with which it is approaching this situation.
Terre and Durocher encouraged members of bass fishing clubs who are
interested in providing assistance gathering fish for the LMBV study to
contact an area TPWD office or call toll-free 800-792-1112, then follow the
prompts to get inland fisheries information.
