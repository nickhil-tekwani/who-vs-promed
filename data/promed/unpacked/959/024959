A total of 18 people, including 4 children, are being treated for rabies after a family in Coventry [Rhode Island] took a rabid raccoon into their home. The family found the baby raccoon on 29 May 2013 lying on John Franklin Road, in a rural section of town by the Scituate [Rhode Island] line.

"I was shocked to hear that someone would actually take that and put it in their house as a pet," said a neighbor.

The Department of Environmental Management [DEM] later picked up the animal, and tests on it have come back positive for rabies.

Of the individuals who came in contact with the raccoon, 9 are from Rhode Island and 2 are from Connecticut.

DEM says finding rabies in wildlife is common and is one of the reasons they prohibit people from possessing native wildlife.

Signs are now posted on residents' doors reminding them to have their pets vaccinated and warning them to stay away from wild animals, no matter how harmless they look.

"I wouldn't be letting any animals in my house. I have enough trouble keeping the animals out," said another neighbor.

Anyone who could have come in contact with the raccoon in that area should contact the Rhode Island Department of Health's Division of Infectious Diseases at 401-222-2577 for evaluation.

There have been no human cases of rabies in Rhode Island since 1940.

[Rabies can occur in any mammal of any age. There are few animals that seem more resistant, but the raccoon does not fall into that category. Rabies is common in raccoons, skunks, and in some areas, coyotes and foxes.

Protection for yourself and your pets is important and vaccinating your pets provides such protection.

Most rabies exposures are posted in the ProMED-mail rabies update series, but with 18 people exposed, it was deemed reasonable to post this now. This is a large number of people and demonstrates how easily people can become exposed to such a "wildlife" pet.
