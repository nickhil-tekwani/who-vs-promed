NEWCASTLE DISEASE - SWEDEN & DENMARK (2)

Just a small comment to this:
Vaccination against ND in poultry (Gallus gallus) is practically
forbidden in Sweden. No grand parents, parents or commercial stock
are vaccinated. All racing pidgeons, however, are vaccinated with
an inactivated (killed) vaccine.
Imports of live birds to Sweden are severely resticted, partly by
the government and partly by a volountary programme which started
after Sweden joined the EEC.
When birds are imported (eggs/dayold grand parents for layers,
broilers or turkeys) they are put in quarantine, blood sampled and
tested for ND and a number of other diseases, such as EDS76 and
TRT/SHS. Flocks that turn out to be serologically positive are culled.
In spite of all these precautions it is still possible for any wild
birds, such as ducks, geese or crows, to fly in from Denmark, Germany
or more distant countries whithout filling in a single form...
Sincerely
Lotta Ekstrand
