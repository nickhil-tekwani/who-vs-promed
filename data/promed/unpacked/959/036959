Researchers at the consumer group Public Citizen said Botox should
carry a black box warning. They reviewed adverse event reports
submitted to the FDA and found 16 deaths have been reported. The
manufacturer of Botox said these risks are already listed on the drug
label. Botox is famous for smoothing facial wrinkles but has also
been approved for treating rigid neck muscles.
Researchers at the consumer group Public Citizen said the botulinum
toxin spreads inside the body causing serious problems. The report
detailed cases of muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing or
aspiration pneumonia, a serious condition caused by breathing a
foreign material into the lungs.
Officials at Allergan, Solstice and the FDA could not immediately be
reached for comment.

Botulinum toxin is one of several proteins produced by the bacterium,
_Clostridium botulinum_. Botulinum toxin acts by blocking the
transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, causing those muscles to
relax resulting in a loss of muscle control. In the case of food
poisoning from botulinum toxin, in which the toxin spreads widely
around the body, early symptoms include dry mouth, difficulty
swallowing, slurred speech, drooping eyelids, and muscle weakness.
Subsequent paralysis of respiratory muscles can lead to death.
In the case of injected therapeutic or cosmetic use of botulinum
toxin, if the product spreads from the injection site to another area
of the body, this loss of muscle control can be similarly harmful.
For example, when muscle control to the esophagus is lost
(dysphagia), one loses the ability to control swallowing; food and
drink can then accidentally reflux and be aspirated into the
respiratory tract and lungs, causing a serious complication,
aspiration pneumonia, and occasionally lead to death.
Botulinum toxins are classified as distinct serotypes, A-G, with
different potencies but the same mechanism of action. Types A and B
have been developed commercially for use as drugs. In the USA, there
are 2 approved products: Botox (Allergan), which is Type A, and
Myobloc (Solstice Neurosciences), which is Type B.
The 2 broad indications for the use of botulinum toxins are
therapeutic and cosmetic. FDA-approved therapeutic uses include
cervical dystonia (contractions of the neck and/or shoulder muscles
that cannot be controlled), strabismus (crossed eyes), blepharospasm
(spasmodic blinking of the eyes), and primary axillary hyperhydrosis
(excessive underarm sweating; Botox only). Botox has one approved
cosmetic use (Myobloc has none), and that is for temporary
improvement of glabellar lines (wrinkles between the eyebrows). Most
cosmetic use of botulinum toxin is unapproved by the FDA and is
therefore considered off-label.

Chronology of European cautions; Information for physicians (EU,
USA); Information for patients (EU, USA)
Pre-approval evidence of dysphagia
---------------------------------
Pre-approval clinical studies provide ample proof that botulinum
toxin can cause dysphagia. In the analysis below, we have generally
restricted ourselves to randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) with
placebo controls.
Therapeutic uses
----------------
Significant rates of dysphagia were documented in the Medical
Officer's clinical reviews of both Myobloc (October 1999)(12) and
Botox therapeutic (November 1999)(13). In most studies, patients had
previously been exposed to botulinum toxin. Since those with previous
adverse events would presumably be less likely to enroll in
subsequent trials, the incidence of dysphagia may be underestimated.
Botox: There was only one RCT for Botox therapeutic that was
placebo-controlled (Study 140). The rates of dysphagia were 7 percent
vs. 4 percent (treated vs. placebo). Severity grades were only
provided for the 6 cases in the treated group: 3 moderate and 3 mild
cases of dysphagia (14).
Myobloc: The 3 RCTs for Myobloc consisted of one Phase II
range-finding study (Study 009) and 2 Phase III trials (Studies 301
and 302). The only difference between Studies 301 and 302 was that
subjects in the former had cervical dystonia symptoms that were still
responsive to Botox, while those in Study 302 had ceased to respond
to Botox. The data below summarize the incidence of dysphagia in all
placebo-controlled trials of this product, based on only one dose.
(Doses of Botox and Myobloc cannot be compared directly, as they are
different botulinum toxins.)
Incidence of dysphagia in all Myobloc placebo-controlled studies (15)
Dosage / number of patients / percent dysphagia
Placebo dose / 123 / 2 percent
Less than 2500 U / 92 / 9 percent
2500-7500 U / 67 / 10 percent
7500-10 000 U / 106 / 25 percent
A summary of the severity of dysphagia for all Myobloc-exposed
patients, both those in placebo-controlled and open-label studies, is
shown below.
Severity of dysphagia in all Myobloc studies (n=531)(16). All toxin
treated subjects = 29 percent with dysphagia
19 percent of all therapy - mild dysphagia
8 percent of all therapy - moderate dysphagia
1 percent of all therapy - severe dysphagia
Although these trials were small and consisted only of a single dose,
the results have a consistency that lends them added weight. The
Medical Officer noted that dysphagia was consistently the 2nd most
common adverse event after dry mouth and "...the most common
important adverse effect of Botox treatments for cervical dystonia
reported in the medical literature (17)." While not having as high an
incidence of serious cases as dry mouth, serious dysphagia cases "can
be more medically risky" and "even moderate grade events in these 2
categories have been responsible for patients discontinuing
repetitive injections...(18)."
Cosmetic uses
-------------
The Botox cosmetic reviews found the incidence of muscle weakness in
treated patients in 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials to be one
percent and 3 percent. There were no cases of muscle weakness in the
placebo groups and no cases of dysphagia in either the treated or
placebo groups (19).
Thus, dysphagia was a common adverse event in the clinical trials
conducted prior to approval and occurred in a dose-related fashion.
Although most cases were mild, some severe cases did occur.
FDA analysis of adverse events
------------------------------
FDA subsequently highlighted the dangers of botulinum toxin in a
published 2005 analysis of adverse events covering the period from
1989 to May 2003 (20). These adverse event data add to the clinical
trial information, because severe cases of dysphagia were not common
in the clinical trials, and the adverse event data would tend to
include more severe cases of dysphagia. The adverse event data also
emphasize that, although dysphagia was more common in therapeutic
than cosmetic clinical trials (presumably due to higher doses and,
for many indications, greater proximity to the esophagus), cosmetic
cases have been reported, and some have been serious.
Therapeutic use: The FDA analysis found 406 adverse event reports
related to therapeutic use, 217 of which met the FDA's definition of
serious. There were 26 reports of serious adverse events involving
dysphagia (including one death due to aspiration pneumonia) and 13
reports of non-serious dysphagia.
Cosmetic use: There were 36 serious reports related to cosmetic use,
including 2 reports of dysphagia, but no deaths. There were, in
addition, 995 non-serious reports for cosmetic use, the most frequent
of which was "lack of intended effect" (63 percent). Four of the
non-serious reports were for dysphagia. The agency also noted that
"numerous departures from FDA-approved recommendations for drug use,
dilution, handling, site of injection, and storage were noted in
these AE [adverse event] reports."
Public Citizen analysis of adverse events
-----------------------------------------
We have done our own analysis using the FDA adverse event database
for cases submitted to the agency by drug manufacturers between 1 Nov
1997 and 31 Dec 2006. We searched the database using the terms
"botox", "botulinum" and "myobloc" as Primary Suspect drugs and did
not restrict the search by Indication for drug use. We excluded cases
marked "foreign" (21). (The EU analysis included all international
reports.) The initial search included all Preferred Terms (the
medical description of the adverse event), but in the principle
analyses, we restricted the Preferred Terms to "dysphagia", "pneumon"
and "aspir" (22). The latter categories were combined in the data
presentation below. The search included Outcomes, but we provide
specific information only about deaths and hospitalizations. Cases
that were associated with both death and hospitalization were coded
as deaths. Those that included the Preferred Term "suicide" were
excluded from the list of deaths. We looked separately at the adverse
events associated with Botox cosmetic use and the 3 Preferred Terms
by searching on the Indication "skin" (which yielded "skin wrinkling"
and "skin cosmetic procedure").
We found 658 cases of adverse events for all Preferred Terms, of
which 180 (27 percent) were associated with aspiration, dysphagia, or
pneumonia. Of these 180, 106 had an indication listed: 18 cosmetic
only and 87 non-cosmetic only. 87 of the cases associated with these
3 Preferred Terms were hospitalized, and 16 died (including 4
children less than 18 years of age). Table 1 presents the cases
broken down by Preferred Term and Outcome, while Table 2 contains a
description of the 16 deaths, one of which was associated with cosmetic use.

82 / F / Dysphagia & pneumonia & aspiration Muscle spasm / Botox
82 / M / Dysphagia & aspiration / Drooling / Botox
85 / M / Dysphagia & pneumonia aspiration / Muscle spasticity / Botox
It should be noted that these data come from voluntary reports
submitted to the FDA which have been estimated to represent
approximately 10 percent of the actual occurrences. Additional limits
to our data include: causality cannot be proved, other Preferred
Terms may exist that might increase our counts, some fields such as
Outcome are not consistently filled in, and reports from individual
consumers were not included.
Actions requested
-----------------
To facilitate the spread of this information, warning letters have
been sent to physicians in the UK and Germany, but no such letters
have been issued in the USA. Of the 3 pharmaceutical companies that
market botulinum toxin in the EU (Allergan, Solstice Neurosciences,
and Ipsen), the 1st 2 also market botulinum toxin in the USA. These
companies risk losing patients if they make known the risks
delineated in the EU warning letters and will not do so unless forced
(as they were in Europe); only the FDA can ensure that these letters
are issued.
As noted in this petition, the information currently provided to both
USA patients and physicians is deficient compared to that in the EU.
The current information must be updated to consistently emphasize
that distant spread is possible, that fatal cases have occurred and
that the cosmetic form of botulinum toxin also carries dangers of
dysphagia and aspiration. Unfortunately, even the EU warning is not
in a black box, which is where such important warnings belong.
Public Citizen has often noted that labeling changes are rarely
effective in altering physician behavior (23-25). It is for this
reason that we are also requesting the warning letter.
In addition to physicians, patients have a right to be fully informed
about these products, particularly when much of the products' use is
for cosmetic purposes, and the risk-benefit calculation is more
tenuous. The inadequate information for patients is now buried in the
USA physician labeling. In the EU, it is at least a free-standing
document. Patients should therefore be alerted through mandatory
FDA-approved Medication Guides to be dispensed by the physician when
the drug is injected into the patient.
Failure to immediately take these actions is likely to result in more
preventable serious adverse reactions and deaths from these products.
