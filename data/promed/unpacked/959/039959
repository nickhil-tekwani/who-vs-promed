FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, BOVINE - BRAZIL: PARANA, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

About 600 head of cattle that should have been killed [and destroyed]
to eliminate the focus of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in Parana had
already been [slaughtered and placed] in a cold storage room, before
confirmation of the illness by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the
meat was already in the domestic market. The transport from the farm
to the cold storage room was authorized by the SEAB (Secretariat of
Agriculture and Provisions of Parana).
This information comes from Andres Carioba, the proprietor and
manager of the Cachoeira Farm in Sao Sebastiao da Amoreira (367 km
north of Curitiba). He addressed the SEAB yesterday, in Curitiba, at
a meeting of the CONESA (the State Advisory Council State for Farming
Health) where it was decided that the 1800 prohibited animals at the
property would be slaughtered since the confirmation of the focus, on
6 Dec [2005].
By 17 votes to 1 with 5 abstentions, the council confirmed what was
expected: the State farming and food industry authorized SEAB to cull
the animals and destroy the carcasses at the Cachoeira farm.
The majority argument was in favor of the reestablishment of
international trade in Brazilian bovine meat in 6 months. This is
also what the Ministry of Agriculture hoped, that Parana would adhere
to OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) guidelines with respect
to commerce of meat coming from FMD-infected areas.
Carioba entered a judicial writ of prevention against the slaughter
and affirmed that there was no authorization for Animal Sanitary
Surveillance to enter the property in order "to kill healthy
cattle." Since the confirmation of the 1st cases of FMD in Mato
Grosso do Sul, at the end of September [2005], the Carioba family
property had not recorded a single death of an animal with clinical
signs of FMD.
The revelation of the proprietor whose cattle had already been
processed into commercially saleable meat -- slaughtered at Frigomax
de Arapongas (PR) -- occurred when journalists asked why the
ministry, upon announcing the focus [of FMD], said that it had 2202
animals on the farm, while the SEAB and the farmer spoke about 1800
head of cattle.
He said that from 17 Oct to 6 Dec [2005] (when the focus of FMD in
Parana was confirmed), the Cacoeira farm had designated 500-600 head
of cattle for commercial slaughter. "I don't know with exactitude."
He said that the animals had been transported by road from the farm
to the cold storage room in a truck with a sealed trunk and that
personnel from the Federal and State Agriculture [ministries]
accompanied the transport. "I asked for and received authorization to
sell [this meat], and this meat was [designated for commercial sale]
with the seal of SIF (Federal Inspection Service). The rest of you
have asked for the Secretary of Agriculture."
The Director General of SEAB, Newton Pohl Ribas, tried to justify the
authorization, saying that during the transport, the Cachoeira farm
"did not have a focus (of FMD) nor were its cattle under inquiry."
One condition placed by OIE was that they would return in 6 months to
certify the area free from FMD with vaccination and that all the
breeding [stock] affected on the property should be slaughtered.
The Director General of SEAB said that the slaughter was confirmed
yesterday and is still ongoing, before CONESA conducts an evaluation
to indemnify the Cachoeira farm. The estimated amount of the damage
to the farmer alone is 1.37 million Brazilian reals [USD 602
000]. The slaughter must be completed within 8 to 10 days.
