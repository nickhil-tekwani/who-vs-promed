Nebraska: Hepatitis C Outbreak at Clinic in Fremont
---------------------------------------------------
LINCOLN: At least 81 people treated at a Nebraska cancer clinic have tested
positive for hepatitis C virus in an outbreak that may have been caused by
a contaminated vial of medicine, health officials said on Tue 19 Nov 2002.
Dr. Tom Safranek, the state epidemiologist, said poor medical practices at
Dr. Tahir Javed's clinic in Fremont may be to blame. The patients, who were
suffering from cancer or blood disorders, were treated at the clinic in
2000 and 2001. Just before it shut down last month, the clinic advised 612
patients to get tested and nearly 500 did.
It is possible that a clinic worker used a syringe to administer medicine
to a patient who had hepatitis C, then drew more medicine from the same
vial for the patient with the same syringe, Safranek said. Doing that would
contaminate the rest of the medicine in the vial, and infect other patients
given the drug, he said. Medical charts are being examined, and current and
past employees of the clinic are being questioned by state health
officials. Javed left the United States in July and returned to his native
Pakistan to attend to his ailing mother, Safranek said.
State health officials were notified of the problem in September by an
Omaha doctor who had two patients with hepatitis C who also were patients
at Javed's clinic. In all, 485 people sought tests after receiving letters
from the clinic. Of the others, some chose not to be tested, others may
have been tested by their own doctors, and others died.
The state said it was not aware of any deaths among the patients with
hepatitis C. Doctors said they do not know what effect the virus would have
on the clinic's already ailing patients. Hepatitis C is a viral infection
of the liver and the most common bloodborne infection in the United States.
People who have been infected may experience fatigue, loss of appetite and
yellowing of the skin. The virus can eventually lead to cirrhosis or cancer
of the liver.
Health officials are confident no other patients have to be contacted
because of changes made at the clinic in 2001, Safranek said, declining to
elaborate. In Oklahoma, a hepatitis C outbreak that infected more than 50
people this year was blamed on a nurse anesthetist who told health
officials he reused needles and syringes.

Number of Clinic-based Hepatitis C Cases in Fremont Announced
-------------------------------------------------------------
LINCLON: The Nebraska Health and Human Services System (HHSS) today
announced the number of people treated at a Fremont oncology clinic who
tested positive for hepatitis C. Of the 612 patients of Dr. Tahir Javed's
oncology clinic who received letters advising them to be tested, 485 chose
to be tested for the virus, and of these, 81 tested positive. The letters
were issued as part of an investigation which began when several cases of
hepatitis C were reported from the Fremont area. Health officials found the
most likely link to be care given at Dr. Javed's clinic, said Dr. Tom
Safranek, state epidemiologist with HHSS. The clinic is no longer in
operation. The letters were sent in mid-October to patients who were
treated at the clinic between 1 Mar 2000 and 31 Dec 2001. HHSS offered a
testing clinic in Fremont 17 October 2002 through 1 November 2002.
Hepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver and the most common
bloodborne infection in the country. The virus causes no symptoms in most
cases and the majority of carriers do not know they are infected. Infected
individuals may experience fatigue, loss of appetite and yellowing of the
skin. The virus affects the liver and can eventually lead to cirrhosis or
cancer of the liver.
Possible routes of transmission are being investigated, Safranek said. The
illness is spread through blood and bodily fluids. It can be transmitted
through intravenous lines or injections if proper infection control
practices are not followed. The virus is not transmitted by casual contact.
Hepatitis C can be treated with a drug called interferon, alone or in
combination with the drug ribavirin. Genotype 3A of hepatitis C, which is
what these patients have, shows a favorable response to treatment,
according to Safranek. Patients of the clinic who haven't yet been tested
should contact their physician or call the Health and Human Services System
at (402) 471-9252. Blood tests are needed to confirm the presence of the virus.

[The apparent attack rate of 17 percent (81 cases out of 485 tested) is
high and suggests that unsafe injection practices were occurring over a
period of time rather than a single time. It is unlikely that 81 patients
received medications from the same vial on the same day. More information
on the findings of the epidemiologic investigation when available would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
