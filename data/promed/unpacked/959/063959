The Farmer's Son in Auchtertool has recalled batches of haggis, black pudding, and white pudding over concerns about the company's procedures to control the bacterium which causes botulism. Customers have been advised not to eat these products and to return them to where they were bought. However, The Farmer's Son reassured the public that no botulism had been detected in any products.

The Food Standards Agency said: "The Farmer's Son is recalling various products because of concerns over the company's procedures in place to control _Clostridium botulinum_. The bacteria can produce botulinum toxin, which causes serious food poisoning and has the potential to be fatal. A product recall notice issued by the firm said: "No botulism has been found," and customers were being asked to return the products "as a precautionary measure."

The company added: "We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused."

Batches of haggis bungs and 4-slice packs with use-by dates up to 10 Jan 2018 are affected. Black and white pudding packs with use-by dates up to January 2018 are also being recalled. The Food Standards Agency said anyone who has bought the products should not eat them and return them to the shop where they were purchased.

Haggis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggis) is a savoury pudding containing sheep's pluck (heart, liver and lungs) minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, traditionally encased in the animal's stomach though now often in an artificial casing instead. According to the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique: "Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavor." It is believed that food similar to haggis (though not so named) -- perishable offal quickly cooked inside an animal's stomach, all conveniently available after a hunt -- was eaten from ancient times. Although the name "hagws" or "hagese" was 1st used in England c. 1430, the dish came to be considered traditionally Scottish, even the national dish, as a result of Scots poet Robert Burns' poem Address to a Haggis of 1787. Haggis is traditionally served with "neeps and tatties," boiled and mashed separately, and a dram (a glass of Scotch whisky), especially as the main course of a Burns supper.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
