A Fairfield Township resident was [bitten] by a stray cat living on the property, that tested positive for the rabies virus, soon followed by the cat biting an animal control officer. Upon the positive rabies confirmation on the cat, the resident received the post-exposure vaccinations. The animal control officer who trapped the stray cat and was bitten received a booster vaccination. The officer has been working to trap the other stray cats on the same property since the incident last week.

"The Cumberland County Health Department would like to remind residents that stray and wild animals can carry the rabies virus, and it is important to contact your local animal control officer if you see them on your property," said Megan Sheppard, health officer of the Cumberland County Department of Health.

Rabies is a viral disease of mammals that is most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal. [In the US], the virus is mainly found in wild skunks, raccoons, cats, or bats. Without appropriate treatment, the rabies virus can be fatal. Animals that have been infected with the virus can appear unstable with a wobbly walk, foam at the mouth, or excessively drool saliva. Wild animals may also appear unafraid of humans or show unusually aggressive behavior.

If you believe you or your pet have been exposed to rabies, it is important to immediately notify the health department so that prompt care can be given. If your pet was exposed, contact your veterinarian immediately; it can be difficult to properly care for a pet's wound without coming into contact with the virus, and you should always allow the veterinarian to handle as much of the wound care as is possible.

Vaccination is key in protecting your pet from the rabies virus. For humans, it is important to teach children never to approach a wild animal. Always contact an animal control officer if you have stray or wild animals on your property. Contact your local veterinarian's office to schedule your pet's vaccination; the health department holds rabies clinics during the spring months. If you have questions or would like more information on the rabies virus or vaccine, please contact the Cumberland County Department of Health at (856) 327-7602 or visit http://www.ccdoh.org.

[All in all sound advice, both for the occasionally exposed person and the professionally exposed. Animal control officers and veterinarians need to keep their rabies vaccinations up to date, and get your titres checked.
