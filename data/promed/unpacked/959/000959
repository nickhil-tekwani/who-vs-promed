An outside committee established to investigate the high death rate of
Japanese macaques at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University has
announced that the cause is believed to be a virus contracted from
crab-eating macaques also kept at the facility.

The virus is known as "Saru Retrovirus-4" (monkey retrovirus-4), or SRV-4
[but see Mod. CP's comment on the meaning of the acronym SRV. - Mod.AS],
and is spread naturally in crab-eating macaques. There are no known cases
of SRV-4 spreading to humans, and such spreading is considered highly unlikely.

According to the committee's announcement, in 2001 and 2002, there were 6
Japanese macaques at the institute that died after showing symptoms of
bleeding from the nasal mucous membranes, and there were 44 that died from
2008 until September of this year [2010]. The death tally includes macaques
that were put down to end their suffering.

The committee discovered the SRV-4 virus in the blood of the macaques after
gene analysis. One of the virus's characteristic signs is said to be a
sharp drop in blood platelets.

The institution had kept the Japanese macaques and crab-eating macaques in
adjoining cages in the same room several times in the past during
experiments or treatment, and the committee expressed their view that the
Japanese macaques were infected during these encounters.

Currently, there are 39 Japanese macaques in quarantine, 8 of which are
confirmed to have the virus.

[On 9 Jul 2010, the Japanese daily "broadsheet" newspaper Chunichi Shimbun
published an article on a "mysterious disease", which had caused the deaths
of 44 macaque monkeys ("Snow Monkey,"_Macaca fuscata_) between 2001 and
2010 in the Primate Research Institute (PRI) of the Kyoto University,
Inuyama city, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. According to data provided to the
newspaper by PRI, the disease was recorded in 2 phases: during Phase 1
(July 2001 to July 2002), 7 monkeys showed symptoms, of which 6 died.
During phase 2 (March 2008 to April 2010), 39 monkeys showed symptoms, of
which 38 died.

The clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, pallor and nasal
haemorrhaging. More specifically, the following haematological signs were
described: bleeding in internal organs, bleeding mucous membrane of nose,
subcutaneous ecchymosis, dark brown muddy feces, and especially, almost no
platelets in the blood of most fatal cases.

Autopsies revealed bleeding in the lungs and intestines. More detailed
pathological and histopathological findings would have been helpful.
Subscribers may help by translating such, if included, from the paper
"Information of hemorrhagic syndrome of Japanese macaques (provisional
designation)" (Primate Research 2010; 26: 69-71), available in Japanese at
<http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/psj/26/1/_contents/>.

According to information provided later by the institute (see Nature 2010;
466: 302-3, 13 Jul and ProMED-mail archive 20100717.2387), none of the
other primates at the institute, which housed more than 1200 animals from
13 species, including chimpanzees, marmosets and crab-eating macaques,
contracted the syndrome. Reportedly, the humans who handled the monkeys did
not show symptoms. PRI director Tetsuro Matsuzawa said, during a press
conference held on 7 Jul 2010, that the institute held the view that "the
haemorrhagic syndrome is due to a species-specific pathogen of the Japanese
monkeys." The continued investigations were said to include analysis of the
2 surviving infected Japanese macaques and screening the 790 remaining ones
for viruses and bacteria.

The current information, indicating the identification of SRV-4 as the
suggested causative pathogen, may provide the anticipated solution to the
enigma but requires more detail; have experimental infection trials been
carried out or contemplated?

It would also help to note whether simian hemorrhagic fever [SHF], a
disease caused by an arterivirus, has been excluded (see CJ Peters' comment
in archived 20100718.2403). - Mod.AS

SRV-4 (Simian retrovirus type 4) has been isolated from cynomolgus monkeys
in California an Texas as we as in Japan and the complete genome sequence
is available. It has been concluded that the repeated occurrence of SRV-4
in cynomolgus monkeys in different areas of the world and over a period of
25 years suggest that this species is the natural host of SRV-4 (see: Zao
CL, et al. The complete genome and genetic characteristics of SRV-4
isolated from cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Virology 2010 Sep
30;405(2):390-6). The factors responsible for the pathogenicity of this
virus in the colony of cynomolgus monkeys at the Primate Research Institute
of Kyoto University remain to be determined. - Mod.CP]
