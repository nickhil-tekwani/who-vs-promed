Four new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in Guinea, bringing the total number to 258 [lab confirmed] in the west African nation, the country's health authorities said on Friday [20 Jun 2014]. There were 3 new cases in Guekedou and one in Boffa. At the same time, 2 people died from the disease in Telemele, and one died in the Boffa region.

Due to the continued spread of the disease, health authorities have launched sensitization campaigns to urge the population to wash their hands as a way of preventing contamination by ebolavirus.

Statistics showed that since January [2014], there have been 258 EVD [confirmed] cases reported across the country, of which 160 have died. The southern region that borders Liberia and Sierra Leone has been the epicenter of the epidemic, with 139 cases and 102 deaths.

Abstract
-------
Sierra Leone in West Africa is in a Lassa fever-hyperendemic region that also includes Guinea and Liberia. Each year, suspected Lassa fever cases result in submission of 500-700 samples to the Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory in eastern Sierra Leone. Generally, only 30-40 percent of samples tested are positive for Lassa virus (LASV) antigen and/or LASV-specific IgM; thus, 60-70 percent of these patients have acute diseases of unknown origin. To investigate what other arthropod-borne and hemorrhagic fever viral diseases might cause serious illness in this region and mimic Lassa fever, we tested patient serum samples that were negative for malaria parasites and LASV. Using IgM-capture ELISAs, we evaluated samples for antibodies to arthropod-borne and other hemorrhagic fever viruses. Approximately 25 percent of LASV-negative patients had IgM to dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, chikungunya, ***Ebola [EBOV, Ebola-Zaire], and ***Marburg [MBGV] viruses but not to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus [my asterisks - Mod.JW].

Results
-------
We tested serum samples from 253 patients submitted to the Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory during 2006-2008 for IgM to the arthropod-borne and hemorrhagic fever viruses of interest (Table 2 in source) ... Antibody prevalence to the hemorrhagic fever viruses, EBOV and MBGV, were 8.6 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. ...

Because the samples submitted to the Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory were from patients with acute illness, IgM-capture ELISAs were used to detect the earliest antibody elicited in response to viral infection. We found evidence of IgM for ... the filoviruses EBOV and MBGV (Table 2 in source). ...

PRNT [plaque reduction neutralization test] is the laboratory standard for immunologic assays. It measures in vitro virus neutralization and is the most virus-specific serologic test to confirm immunologic test results. ... PRNT results for the ebolaviruses clearly indicated that most resulted from EBOV infections (Table 4 in source). We found evidence that SUDV [Ebola-Sudan] was responsible for one infection but no evidence for TAFV [Ebola-Tai Forest (Cote d'Ivoire)] infection, the only ebolavirus isolated in West Africa. In the ebolavirus PRNTs, we did not include the newest discovered ebolavirus, Bundibugyo virus [from Uganda], which cross-reacts with EBOV in immunoassays. Ebolavirus infections in Sierra Leone might be the result of Bundibugyo virus or an ebolavirus genetic variant and not EBOV.

Discussion
-------
The filoviruses represented the largest group of patient samples that reacted in our study. This finding was surprising because no filovirus has been reported in the region or in West Africa other than the initial isolation of TAFV in Cote d'Ivoire. These serologic results provide evidence that ebolaviruses are circulating and infecting humans in West Africa. All of the ebolavirus-reactive samples demonstrated only IgM and no evidence of IgG, suggesting acute infection. PRNT results indicated that the infecting virus was most closely related to EBOV, except for one SUDV-reactive patient sample. This finding was unexpected because our assumption was that any ebolavirus would more likely be TAFV, the only species described in West Africa. Although the serum samples were able to neutralize EBOV only at a low level (1:40 dilution), it is possible that the virus is an EBOV genetic variant. This presumptive diagnosis of EBOV infection extends the ebolavirus geographic region to Sierra Leone and the surrounding region.

Tomori O1, Fabiyi A, Sorungbe A, Smith A, McCormick JB. Viral hemorrhagic fever antibodies in Nigerian populations. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1988 Mar;38(2):407-10. PMID: 3128130.


Abstract
--------
Using the immunofluorescence test, a serosurvey for antibodies to 5 viral agents associated with hemorrhagic febrile infections was conducted with 1677 human sera from different parts of Nigeria.

Antibodies to Ebola and Marburg viruses were detected in 30 and 29 sera, respectively. ... Sera positive for Marburg were positive in combination with Lassa, Ebola, or Rift Valley fever viruses. Antibodies to Lassa and Rift Valley fever viruses were found in all locations in Nigeria, whereas Ebola and Marburg antibodies were found mainly in the northern savanna zones of Benue and Gongola, but not in the rain forest area of Ondo.

On testing 30 EBO virus (Sudan) strain-positive sera against the EBO virus (Zaire) strain, only 22 were found to have antibody titers greater than or equal to 10 [commonly accepted at the time as positive - Mod.JW]. In general, antibody titers against EBO virus (Sudan) were higher than against EBO virus (Zaire).

[The date of collection of the sera is not given in the full text, but given the publication date of 1988, it seems reasonable to deduce that they were collected in an earlier year. There are 2 notable observations in the paper: The reservoir of ebolavirus is thought to be a forest mammal, yet human seropositives were found mainly in the savanna; and the stronger reactions were to the Sudan ebolavirus, yet the current West African strain has been typed as closest to the Zaire strain.

There seems to have been serological evidence of ebolaviruses in West Africa in years past, detected by researchers in Nigeria and the USA. - Mod.JW
