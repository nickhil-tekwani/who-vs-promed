Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 9 Dec 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 29 Dec 2020
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Maedi-visna virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Cordillera, Ciervo Cua, San Bernardino, Cordillera
Date of start of the outbreak: 9 Dec 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Sheep / 139 / 3 / 0 / 3 / 0

Affected population: the health certificate to authorise the export of sheep requires that the animals come with a negative result for maedi-visna. In this process, the diagnosis made by the Central Laboratory of SENACSA resulted in three sheep positive for the disease. At the time of sampling they did not present clinical signs.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Sheep / 2.16 / 0 / 0 / 2.16
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; selective killing and disposal; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Service of Quality and Animal Health (SENACSA) (national laboratory) / Sheep / competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) / 29 Jan 2020 / positive
National Service of Quality and Animal Health (SENACSA) (national laboratory) / Sheep / indirect ELISA / 29 Jan 2020 / positive

["Maedi-visna and caprine arthritis and encephalitis are economically important viral diseases that affect sheep and goats. These diseases are caused by a group of lentiviruses called the small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs). SRLVs include maedi-visna virus (MVV), which mainly occurs in sheep, and caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), mainly found in goats, as well as other SRLV variants and recombinant viruses. The causative viruses infect their hosts for life, most often subclinically; however, some animals develop one of several progressive, untreatable disease syndromes. The major syndromes in sheep are dyspnea (maedi) or neurological signs (visna), which are both eventually fatal. Adult goats generally develop chronic progressive arthritis, while encephalomyelitis is seen in kids. Other syndromes (such as outbreaks of arthritis in sheep) are also reported occasionally, and mastitis occurs in both species. Additional economic losses may occur due to marketing and export restrictions, premature culling and/or poor milk production. Economic losses can vary considerably between flocks."

"There is no evidence that humans are susceptible to any SRLVs."
