This year's first fatality from West Nile virus announced
----------------------------------------
The first fatal case of West Nile virus was announced in Israel on Mon, 23
Sep 2002. The victim, an 83-year-old man from Kiryat Gat, died some 2 weeks
ago at Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon.
This summer, 8 people have been treated for the virus, most of them
suffering light symptoms and some not even requiring hospitalization.
The virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes who have sucked infected
blood from wild birds, is usually not serious. However, it can be fatal to
the elderly or people with defective immune systems. Last year saw 41
cases, among which 2 people died. However, 2 years ago, there were some 400
cases that resulted in 29 deaths.
According to Dr. Emilia Anis, the Health Ministry's deputy director of
epidemiology, there is no known treatment for the virus, but the symptoms
-- fever, joint pains and weakness -- can be treated. The best way to
prevent the disease, she said, is to take measures to keep mosquitoes out
of the house.
To this end, the Environment Ministry and its Jordanian counterpart signed
an agreement last month to combat the spread of West Nile virus by joint
efforts to locate and destroy mosquito hatching grounds.
Mosquitoes carrying the virus have been found in numerous parts of the
country, including the Jezreel Valley, the northern Negev and the Dead Sea
region.
Recently, the Health Ministry also discovered a diurnal strain of mosquito
that carries the disease, in the areas around Ketura (in the Arava) and
Ma'agan Michael. Previously, it had been thought that only nocturnal
mosquitoes transmitted the infection.

[The sharp drop of WNV cases during the current season compared to the 2
previous ones, in 2000 and 2001, is indeed striking. Comments, ideas will
be welcomed.
The recently discovered diurnal mosquito is _Aedes caspius_ . The MOH has
now issued new guidelines advising inhabitants of the relevant locations to
take the appropriate preventive measures during the day as well - Mod.AS]
