Lettuce was the likely cause of an _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak that sickened 94 people eating at a southwest Valley Federico's Mexican Food restaurant, according to a report released this week by the Maricopa County [Arizona] Department of Public Health. The outbreak occurred between 18 and 31 Jul 2013 at the Federico's, on W. Camelback Road near Litchfield Park [see ProMED archive E. coli EHEC - USA (24): (AZ) restaurant, O157 20130821.1892336 and earlier refs. below]. According to the report, the specific source of the bacterial exposure is uncertain, but lettuce is the most likely culprit.

"The lettuce could have been contaminated in the field from manure, or (from) contaminated irrigation water, during processing, transport, handling, or through improper storage," the report states. "Improper lettuce washing and preparation at the restaurant may have contributed to the spread of disease. The restaurant corrected these processes and complied with all other recommendations and no new cases were identified, effectively ending the outbreak."

Midwest Beef, the Phoenix-based supplier that provides meat and produce to the restaurant, also delivers food to other Federico's locations in Phoenix [Arizona], as well as to other eateries in the Valley, the report says. However, no confirmed cases of illness were recorded at other local restaurants. That could mean that the source of the _E. coli_ exposure occurred at the restaurant from an ill food handler, although no employee illnesses were reported at the restaurant during July 2013, the report says.

Narrowing to the exact cause is difficult. The report notes other possibilities could include cross-contamination from another contaminated food source at the restaurant, such as beef, or the restaurant could have received a small, highly contaminated batch of lettuce that did not go to any other facility. After the outbreak occurred, company officials disposed of products at that location and hired a hygienic-specialist company to clean the restaurant, one of 20 Valley Federico's.

2 children developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a life-threatening complication from an _E. coli_ infection that can cause kidney failure. Of the 94 people who got sick, 24 were children.

Findings from the county Health Department study were shared with Federico's to guide future prevention efforts. Federico's implemented recommendations for lettuce handling and storage, as well as hand washing, to minimize the risk of _E. coli_ contamination.

[As what was discussed initially, the fact that cases only occurred at one location suggests that the contamination issue occurred at the location and not from the distributor. The total number of cases ended at 92, 77 more than the initial report of 15.
