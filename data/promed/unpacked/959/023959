BSE research update: Australia
--------------------------------
The Department of Primary Industries in Queensland is seeking nervous cows
acting strangely. Department veterinary officer Janet Berry says the cows
will be examined in a bid to prove Australia is free of the deadly mad cow
disease.
She is urging graziers to assist and says the late cattle mustering season
is a problem for researchers who require a quota of 25 sick cattle. The
researchers are looking for very specific neurological signs associated
with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. There are other diseases affecting
the neurological system, but the abnormal gaits and behaviours are what the
researchers are seeking.

UK finds BSE cow born after August 1996
-----------------------------------------
Britain announced a cow born after measures were introduced to eradicate
mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) had been found to
have BSE.
"An animal born on August 25, 1996 was confirmed as a BSE case on June 27
this year," Agriculture Minister Nick Brown told parliament.
"The date is significant because it is after August 1, 1996, when extra
control measures on animal feed, containing mammalian meat and bone
meal...had been implemented."
"Experts have always foreseen a few cases of BSE could be confirmed in
animals born after August 1, 1996," he said. "There is no risk to food
safety as a result of this case."
A European Union-wide export ban on British beef was imposed in March 1996
at the height of the crisis over BSE after Britain admitted there was a
link with a new variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD) has so
far killed more than 50 people.
Brown said there had been no chance of the cow being exported as beef under
the Date-Based Export Scheme because it was too old and its mother had been
slaughtered in November 1996, less than 3 months after the animal concerned
was born. The scheme allows only deboned beef from animals aged between 6
and 30 months to be sold abroad.
An assessment last year on behalf of SEAC (the Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee) assumed by the end of 2000, up to 19 cases born after
August 1996 might be identified, Brown said. "This is the first and only
case so far."

The discovery of a case of BSE in a cow born after the feed ban was
tightened in August 1996 is not yet a cause for alarm. Only if tens or
hundreds of such cases appeared would scientists have to revise their view
of how BSE is transmitted. Nor does the case have any real implications for
the duration of the BSE epidemic because the likelihood of such cases was
already factored into the figures.
Two possibilities are transmission of the disease to the calf from its
mother or the contamination of feed on the farm where the calf was born a
few weeks after the regulations were tightened on 1 Aug 1996. The calf was
born on 25 Aug, so the possibility contaminated feed was stored and used
after the ban will have to be investigated. A more likely explanation is
maternal transmission. Roy Anderson, then of Oxford University, told the
BSE Inquiry he believed virtually all cases of BSE occurring after
1994-1995 were attributable to maternal transmission.
The extent of such transmission is not known, because a Ministry of
Agriculture experiment to measure it was poorly designed. The 7-year
experiment compared the calves of cows not suffering from BSE with those of
cows having suffered with BSE. Calves in the control group were fed with
infected feed, so it was impossible to distinguish between maternal
transmission and the possibility calves from susceptible mothers might be
more susceptible to BSE.
It is not known whether the mother of the infected cow had BSE.
There is another possibility, although much less likely, some cases may
come from contaminated pastures. The idea has been put forward by Alan
Dickenson, the founding director of the Neuropathogenesis Unit in
Edinburgh, where BSE research is done. He believes cow pats from infected
cows could contaminate pastures and pass on the disease from animal to
animal. There is some evidence this can happen in scrapie, the related
disease in sheep.

Four Herds Killed As France Reports New BSE Cases
--------------------------------------------------
Four herds of cattle were destroyed in France after the discovery of 2 new
cases of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE), the Farm
Ministry said. These cases brought to 23 the number of BSE cases reported
in France this year. France now looks set to exceed the 30 cases discovered
in 1999. One hundred and three cases of BSE have been reported in France
since the epidemic was first detected in 1991.
The ministry said in a statement the infected animals were dairy cows born
in Oct 1993 in the Ille-et-Villaine region and in Aug 1994 in the Vendee.
Both animals were destroyed, in accordance with French law, as were 4 herds
in which the cattle had lived. In all, 296 animals were slaughtered.
The ministry began testing 48 000 French cattle for BSE in a bid to measure
the extent of the epidemic among its 21 million cattle.
France remains locked in a legal battle with the European Commission over
its refusal to lift a ban on imports of British beef because of fears it is
not entirely free from BSE.
