[1] Omicron spread in the US
[A]

The 1st person in the US with the new variant got sick at home in Minnesota, days after attending an anime convention in Manhattan.

"I'm essentially patient zero," Peter McGinn said -- the 1st person in the United States found to have contracted the new omicron variant of the coronavirus.

McGinn, a 30-year-old health-care analyst from Minneapolis, may never know how he caught the virus. The test that showed he had it came back 10 days after he had attended an anime convention in Manhattan that became so chaotic that another person who was there described it as "Penn Station during rush hour."

By the time McGinn found out he had been infected, the virus had once again outrun the public health system. It typically takes between 4 and 8 days from the time a sample is swabbed to identify which variant caused the infection. With such a lag, public health experts said it was unrealistic to try to untangle precisely who had infected whom, considering that some 53 000 people had attended the convention at the Javits Center.

Still, New York City health officials have sent tens of thousands of emails and text messages to convention attendees, urging them to get tested.

As many as 4 of my colleagues -- Joseph Goldstein, Julie Bosman, Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura, and Roni Caryn Rabin -- write that much remains unknown about omicron, including how deadly it is or how much protection COVID-19 vaccines provide against it. But there is a troublingly familiar drumbeat, with epidemiologists once again talking about flattening curves, wearing masks, and practicing social distancing.

Nationally, several dozen cases of the omicron variant have been identified in at least 17 states. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on the ABC News program "This Week" that the caseload is "likely to rise."

It is possible that the anime convention contributed little to the spread of omicron. Of the roughly 30 people McGinn recalls socializing with in New York City, about half have since tested positive for the coronavirus, he said.

None of the states where they live has announced that they have the omicron variant. But on [Sat 4 Dec 2021], Connecticut officials said that a man in his 60s from their state became sick with the omicron variant in late November [2021], days after a family member had returned from attending the anime convention.

Dr. Ted Long, who oversees New York City's Test and Trace Corps, said he was aware of 5 New York City residents who attended the convention and had tested positive. But he did not know whether they had been infected with the new omicron variant or the delta variant, which is infecting some 1500 people a day and driving a new surge of cases in the city. The organizers of the convention said McGinn might have contracted omicron elsewhere.

McGinn's experience illustrates the difficulties of contact tracing. He flew into La Guardia Airport on [18 Nov 2021], a Thursday, excited to link up with other anime fans and soak up New York. He stayed with 2 friends in an Airbnb rental in Hell's Kitchen and sang karaoke that [Sat 20 Nov 2021] night. During the day, he attended the convention.

One of the artists said she felt safe from COVID-19 at first, with many attendees wearing masks, as the convention required. Her worries grew as the crowds did. She watched as masks came off while people ate, chatted with friends, or found an empty corner to take a nap.

McGinn went home to Minnesota and felt unusually tired. He attributed a slight cough to asthma. Then he heard from a friend at the convention who lived in North Carolina and had just tested positive for COVID-19. On [Tue 23 Nov 2021], he took an at-home test. The result was positive. He also went to a large testing site for a PCR test.

Other friends who had attended the convention, all vaccinated, told him that they, too, had been infected.

By [Wed 1 Dec 2021], Minnesota health officials were convinced that a batch of samples they had analyzed for mutations included their 1st case of omicron. A case investigator, Kathy Como-Sabetti, called McGinn to learn whom he might have exposed to the new variant. McGinn told her about the anime convention.

"I kind of went, 'Wow, well, this changes our story,' " Como-Sabetti said. Minnesota officials immediately called the New York City Health Department with the bad news.

Though the delta (B1617.2) variant is still the dominant strain in the United States, omicron (B.1.1.529) could overtake it in the future if it proves more transmissible.

So far, US experts are displaying cautious optimism that omicron may cause more mild illness than delta or the original strain.

"Though it's too early to really make any definitive statements about it, thus far, it does not look like there's a great degree of severity to it," said Antony Fauci, MD, the White House's top medical advisor, yesterday [Sun 5 Dec 2021] on CNN.

Yesterday [Sun 5 Dec 2021], the nation recorded 109 822 cases, including 1178 deaths. The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 121 534, with 1321 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker.

The Upper Midwest remains a hot spot, with 747 Iowans hospitalized with COVID-19, the highest number seen in the state this year [2021], according to Iowa Public Radio.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker shows that 60.0% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 71.1% have received at least one dose, and 23.6% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose.

[2] Women in global health network: medical PPE
Date: Thu 25 Nov 2021
Source: SciDev.net [edited]
https://www.scidev.net/global/news/medical-ppe-unfit-for-women-on-covid-19-frontlines/


Less than one in 5 female frontline health workers say protective clothing fits them properly, according to a survey from the Women in Global Health network.

Just 14% of women surveyed globally reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) did what the name suggests: provided them protection from infection.

The report published last week (19 Nov [2021]) documents gendered challenges around PPE in the health sector. Surveying 892 women from more than 50 countries, it reveals pervasive inequities in PPE access, fit, and design.

PPE is primarily designed for men and often fails to protect women, research has shown. While 70% of the world's health and care workers are women, they fill just 25% of senior leadership roles.

"Women are 90% of nurses and have been the vast majority of healthcare workers in patient-facing roles in the pandemic," the Women in Global Health (WGH) report says. "Therefore, if medical PPE is not fit for women, it is not fit for the majority of the health workforce."

According to the report, PPE of all types is too big for women, including respirators, gloves, and gowns. Poorly fitting masks were highlighted as particularly problematic.

"Ill-fitting masks not only fail to protect women but also cause suffering," said the report, noting that commonly cited efforts to modify masks for a better fit caused sores and bruising.

Healthcare workers from non-Caucasian populations faced additional challenges with mask fit due to diverse face shapes. One female health worker told researchers: "Most South and South-East Asian female staff have failed mask fit tests due to our smaller-than-average faces."

Menstruation was another challenge for women wearing PPE. Compounded by the fact that PPE coveralls cannot be removed when using the toilet without being discarded, menstruating women reported stress, anxiety, and health impacts such as rashes and infections from wearing sanitary pads for too long.

For women in low- and middle-income countries, where global shortages and the affordability of PPE restricted supply, women reported having to make tough decisions about whether they could use the toilet.

"With the risks of contamination and the shortage of PPE supply, you really have to think twice about taking it off," said one nurse from Zambia. "I knew there was a chance that I would not get more PPE again if I decided to go to the bathroom during my shift."

Rachel Thompson, policy and research associate at WGH and lead author on the report, said that disparities in PPE had been known for some time, but COVID-19 pushed the issue into the spotlight.

"During the pandemic, health workers have had to wear PPE for the full duration of shifts, for months at a time. Issues with poor fit and design can no longer be ignored," she told SciDev.Net.

With the World Health Organization predicting a global shortfall of 18 million health workers by 2030, mostly in low- and lower-middle income countries, the provision of adequate PPE could prove crucial for staff retention and supporting those who remain.

"PPE matters to women health workers. It's important for their safety but also for morale and a symbol that they are valued and being protected," Thompson said.

WGH has used the report to call on governments, employers, and development bodies, such as the WHO, to develop and adhere to essential standards for gender-appropriate PPE. The network has also appealed for the elevation of women to senior health leadership roles, where they can influence PPE-procurement decisions.

Rosemary Morgan, an associate scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who specialises in gender, intersectionality, and health systems research, says inequities in PPE are just part of a bigger need for more gender-responsive healthcare systems.

"COVID-19 has shone a light on inequalities that have always been there and have been exacerbated, and has drawn attention to issues related to sex and gender that we've never seen before," Morgan said. "This is a wakeup call to build healthcare systems that are inclusive and protective of healthcare workers before we get to the next crisis point."

[3] South Africa hotspots
Date: Mon 6 Dec 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/12/report-south-africas-omicron-hot-spot-spurs-cautious-optimism


A report on hospital admissions in South Africa's worst-affected omicron (B.1.1.529) COVID-19 variant district -- Tshwane near Pretoria -- sheds light on clinical patterns, offering some optimism, but with the caveat that the information portrays only the 1st 2 weeks of the surge.

Meanwhile, some scientists who are assessing transmission data say case counts could dwarf the delta (B1617.2) variant, which even in the face of milder disease would still overburden healthcare systems. The worries about the more transmissible variant come amid reports of super spreader events in Norway and Denmark.

In a 4 Dec [2021] report from the South Africa Medical Research Council, scientists detailed clinical findings and data from a hospital complex in Tshwane where the country's omicron outbreak began. It covers 14 Nov through 29 Nov [2021]. Since then, South Africa has reported an exponential increase in cases.

For 76% of patients, COVID-19 was an incidental finding, meaning many were admitted for other conditions but were tested because of hospital policy. Admitted patients were younger than in previous waves, with nearly 80% below 50 years. The report authors noted that 57% of people over age 60 have been vaccinated in Gauteng province. Children under age 10 made up 19% of the omicron cases.

Only 2 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), compared with 63 in "high care" and slightly more than 100 in general wards. The ICU rate is lower than in earlier waves. Only 21% were treated with oxygen, also lower than in earlier surges.

Ten patients died, 5 of them people ages 60 and older. One child died, but the cause of death wasn't related to COVID-19. At 6.6%, the death rate was lower than the 23% seen for hospitalized South Africans in earlier waves.

Of 38 patients in COVID-19 wards, 24 were unvaccinated, 6 were vaccinated, and 8 had an unknown status. And, of 9 patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia, 8 (including one child) were unvaccinated.

In urging caution about interpreting the early data, the authors wrote, "The clinical profile of admitted patients could change significantly over the next 2 weeks, by which time we can draw conclusions about the severity of disease with greater precision." [See ProMED post on report from SAMRC (South African Medical Research Council) in COVID-19 update (419): omicron patient profile, acquired RNA, Cook Islands, global, archive no. 20211206.8700110.]

Anthony Fauci, MD, White House, chief medical advisor, yesterday [Sun 5 Dec 2021] told CNN that the South African clinical findings are encouraging, but he added that it's too early to make definitive statements. [https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/12/05/fauci-full-12-5.cnn]

On CBS "Face the Nation" yesterday [5 Dec 2021], Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, COVID-19 technical lead for the World Health Organization (WHO), said it might take weeks to understand if some patients with omicron go on to develop severe disease. Even if large numbers of people have mild disease, however, some people will still need hospitalization, she added. [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-maria-van-kerkhove-on-face-the-nation-december-5-2021/]

"More hospitalizations could mean more deaths, and we don't want to see that happen on top of an already difficult situation with delta circulating globally," she said. "Our message to governments is don't wait to act. Everything that we need to do for delta will benefit omicron no matter how this variant unfolds."

Fauci, who said South African officials have been very good about being transparent, said omicron clearly has an advantage in South Africa. The country was at a low COVID-19 level and had a nearly vertical spike that was almost exclusively due to omicron.

In a 4 Dec [2021] Twitter thread, Trevor Bedford, PhD, a computational biologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, said methods that factor in case counts and genetic sequences suggests that an early estimate of omicron's effective reproduction value (Rt) is between 3 and 3.5, which is much higher than the initial Rt for delta in South Africa and the United States, which was 1.5.

Bedford said Rt estimates will become more precise in the coming days. If the higher Rt plays out, the world could see higher case counts for omicron than for delta. He added that the size of the wave will depend on the susceptible population.

As experts weigh the latest scientific findings and projections, they're also keeping an eye on reports of community transmission, with a few countries reporting omicron-related super-spreader events.

Norwegian officials are investigating an outbreak tied to a 26 Nov [2021] Christmas party in Oslo that, with at least half of the 120 participants infected, may be the largest omicron outbreak outside of South Africa. In Denmark, health officials are investigating a super-spreading event among high school students, where 150 attended a party and 55 contracted COVID-19, of which 53 had the omicron variant.

More global COVID headlines:
- Namibian scientists said they have detected omicron in 18 of 19 samples sequenced between 11 Nov and 26 Nov [2021], suggesting that the variant is prevalent there. [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-namibia/namibia-detects-omicron-coronavirus-variant-in-18-of-19-samples-idUSKBN2IL14V]
- More countries reported their 1st omicron cases, including Russia, Argentina, and Latvia. Also, countries that have already reported the variant reported several more cases, with the United Kingdom reporting 90 new cases today [6 Dec 2021], lifting its total to 336.
- Protests in Europe over COVID restrictions flared over the weekend, with demonstrations in Belgium and Luxembourg turning violent.
- Two hippos at a Belgian zoo that were tested after keepers noticed runny nose symptoms tested positive for COVID-19, apparently the 1st detection involving the species. [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/two-hippos-belgian-zoo-test-positive-covid-19-2021-12-04/]
- The global totals today rose to 266 317 458 cases and 5 260 929 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/]
