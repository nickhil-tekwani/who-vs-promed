----------------------------------------------------------
Could these events be due to a single or combination toxidrome? It
seems like the onset and effects were relatively rapid. There are
cases of respiratory failure and rhabdomyolysis with a mushroom called
_Tricholoma equestre_ and _Ticholoma_ species appear to have worldwide
distribution, however I can find no references for whether this or
similar potentially toxic mushroom species are found in Thailand.

(For example of such poisoning see:
Acute poisoning with Tricholoma equestre. Anand JS, Chwaluk P, Sut M.
Przegl Lek. 2009;66(6):339-40).

[While this may seem an unlikely explanation for the so far
unresolved deaths in Chiang Mai, Leslie Jabine informs us that
apparently roadside stalls selling mushrooms are popular in Thailand
at certain seasons and indeed that a website is offering North
Thailand Mushroom Tours: see
http://teakdoor.com/farming-and-gardening-in-thailand/21366-mushrooms-in-thailand.html.

Chiang Mai in northern Thailand can be located using the
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Thailand available at
