Communication from the OIE Central Bureau dated 6 Oct 2000:
As a result of information transmitted by Dr Oscar Alejandro Bruni,
Delegate of Argentina to the OIE, in recent weeks on the subject of foot
and mouth disease (FMD) (see Disease Information, 13 [37, 163, dated 22
Sep 2000), the OIE sent a mission to Argentina to clarify the FMD situation
in that country. The mission comprised 3 experts (a European, a North
American and a representative of PANAFTOSA(1)). The work of the mission was
organized in close collaboration with Professor E. J. Gimeno, Coordinator
of the OIE Regional Representation for the Americas.
Briefly, the conclusions of the mission, presented to the OIE Foot and
Mouth Disease and Other Epizootics Commission on 28 Sep 2000, were that an
isolated incursion of infected animals had occurred and the appropriate
control measures were taken by the Veterinary Administration of Argentina.
The experts recommended the decision taken by the OIE to recognize
Argentina as an FMD free country should not be revoked. They also made
recommendations on methods of improving FMD surveillance and border control
in Argentina.
The Foot and Mouth Disease and Other Epizootics Commission adopted these
recommendations and decided Argentina should remain on the list, drawn up
by the OIE, of FMD free countries where vaccination is not practiced. The
Commission has requested Argentina to continue to provide the OIE with
epidemiological information relating to this incident.
