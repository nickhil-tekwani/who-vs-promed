Hepatitis E spreads to West Nile
--------------------------------
Hepatitis E, a deadly disease that is causing havoc in the northern
district of Kitgum [see ProMED-mail Hepatitis E virus - Uganda
20080304.0894] has now spread to the West Nile region. Health minister
Stephen Mallinga told journalists that hepatitis E, which was reported in
the 4 parishes of Madi, Opei Sub-county in Kitgum late last year [2007],
has now spread to Yumbe District in West Nile and 4 other sub-counties in
Kitgum District.

Dr Mallinga was on Friday [9 May 2008] giving an update of the action taken
by the Ministry of Health to control hepatitis E. "During the last 2
months, Adravu Sub-county in Yumbe District has also reported cases among
the Sudanese refugees, but fortunately, no more cases have been reported in
the district," Dr Mallinga said.

Yumbe District health officer Alfred Yayi told Daily Monitor on Friday [10
May 2008] that so far 23 cases have been reported in Yumbe out of which 4
died. Dr Yayi said all the cases were from a refugee camp where about 10
000 refugees from South Sudan are living. He said the United Nations high
commissioner for refugees in collaboration with the International Committee
of the Red Cross have started repatriating the refugees. Dr Yayi said so
far about 3000 refugees have been repatriated and that the district, the
Ministry of Health, and other partners are sensitising the residents on
good sanitation practices to contain the disease.

Since last October [2007], a viral disease that WHO says has no cure, has
been killing people in near the frontier with Sudan. Dr Mallinga said the
number of hepatitis E cases has increased from 1109 last month [April 2008]
to 1262 and that 25 people have died. About 81 per cent of the deaths have
occurred among pregnant women. Pregnant women are at a higher risk of dying
than other people because during pregnancy, the blood volume in the body
increases by over 40 per cent and weakens the immune system, which makes
mothers susceptible to any illnesses including minor diseases.

Dr Mallinga said the weekly trends indicate that the number of cases
continues to go up due to increased contamination of water during the rainy
season. He said during the past week, 156 new cases have been reported, and
one person died.

Hepatitis E is a viral disease transmitted through eating or drinking water
or food contaminated with faeces. Some of its symptoms include fever, dark
yellow urine, and yellow eyes. The transmission is similar to that of other
diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera and dysentery. It is very common in
areas with low latrine coverage, inadequate safe water, and poor personal
hygiene. Dr Mallinga said water testing in the affected areas has revealed
that 32 per cent of wells are contaminated with human waste. At the
household level, 75 per cent of the household clay pots used to store and
collect water are contaminated. He said communities are being mobilised
through public education meetings, home visits, and radio talk shows among
others. More pit latrines and safe water sources have been constructed so
that people can stop using contaminated water.

Dr Mallinga also said the Health Ministry has remitted an additional
funding of UGX 25 million (about USD 15 000) to Kitgum to help the district
cope with the limited number of staff in health facilities. The Ministry is
providing families with jerricans, which cannot easily be contaminated.
Investigations done by the Ministry of Health have revealed that
communities using pots to store drinking water are at a higher risk of
getting infection.

[Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is
transmitted in much the same way as other enteric viruses. Hepatitis E
outbreaks have occurred worldwide in recent years. The signs and symptoms
of HEV infection are loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, discoloured urine,
jaundice, and abdominal pain. There is, however, no chronic (long term)
infection. Hepatitis E is more severe among pregnant women, especially in
the 3rd trimester. HEV is found in the faeces of people and animals with
hepatitis E. HEV is spread by eating or drinking contaminated food or
water. Transmission from person to person may occur.

It seems likely in view of the deficiencies in basic sanitation pertaining
in rural Uganda that other enteric agents in addition to HEV are
contributing to the epidemic situation described above.
