A rise in the incidence of diphtheria has been observed in
Chelyabinsk. 35 people have been reported with the disease since the
beginning of 2004.
In March 2004, the first fatal case was reported in a child, whose
parents did not come in time to seek medical care. According to
"Uralinformburo," the chief physician of the state center on
epidemiological diseases, Vyacheslav Alexandrov, acknowledged the
rise, but commented that it was expected, because the last mass
vaccination for diphtheria was in the 1990s, and the vaccine is known
to work for 10 years.
Since April 2004, mass vaccination from diphtheria will start in the
capital of Southern Ural. 12 000 doses of vaccine were bought by the
government. First, all children will be vaccinated. However, the
above-mentioned amount is far from sufficient. According to
physicians' calculations, 170 000 people must be vaccinated.

[The city is a major center for industry, culture, and science in the
southern Urals. It is located on the eastern slopes of the Urals
along the Miass river. Indeed, routine boosters for diphtheria
(given as Td) should be given at 10-year intervals, assuming a full
primary series, to maintain immunity, especially to fatal disease. It
would be useful to know the age and vaccination information on the
cases. - Mod.LL]
