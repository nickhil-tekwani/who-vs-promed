Fish in Lake DuBay found dead from virus
----------------------------------------
Thousands of black crappies on Lake DuBay and the Stevens Point
Flowage are dead of a virus and wildlife officials are trying to
figure out why the disease is affecting just one species.

Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) biologists and
fisheries technicians learned of the fish kill on 25 Apr 2011, and
determined that the cause appears to be a virus primarily affecting 3
year old black crappies.

"(If it was a widespread problem) other fish would be dying," DNR
fisheries biologist Tom Meronek said. "This is just limited to
crappies. We've seen cases on other bodies of water (in Wisconsin).
This might be a similar virus."

The signs are not consistent with viral hemorrhagic septicemia, or
VHS, a virus that has sickened or killed large numbers of fish in the
Great Lakes, according to the DNR. Wisconsin has mandated in recent
years that all water must be drained from boats to prevent the spread
of VHS and other viruses and diseases.

Live fish were taken from both bodies of water for testing, Meronek
said. It will be several weeks before the DNR Fish Health Lab in
Madison has results. The sickened fish aren't likely to bite anglers'
hooks, Meronek said. They likely will have lesions or look sick, and
he doesn't advise eating them.

In Lake DuBay, the kill has been widespread and has covered many
areas of the water with concentrations of dead fish, particularly
along Seagull Drive in the town of Knowlton and extending south.

In the Stevens Point Flowage, fish were reported dying Sunday [1 May
2011]. The fish kill there also is widespread and affects crappie aged
3 to 4 years. Biologists also are trying to determine why some of the
fish have a fungus on their dorsal fins.

Du Bay Property Owners Association's Kevin Coleman was not aware of
the fish kill when asked on Thursday [5 May 2011] by a reporter.
Coleman said he saw a number of dead fish last weekend during a
fishing tournament, but the fish were small and he did not think the
fish were crappies. "I didn't think much of it at the time," he said.
Coleman said he already had plans to meet next week with association
board members and plans to discuss the fish kill with them.

[A fungus on the dorsal fin, and only on 3-4 year old crappie is very
odd. Koi herpes virus is a virus that affects specifically carp or
members of the genus _Cyprinus_. However, crappie are not part of this
genus. While any virus may mutate, this seems unlikely; but perhaps
testing will yield more specific information.

The article does not tell us how large the fish kill is, but if was
not that noticeable to some, it may not be a big kill, yet. We look
forward to more information regarding the testing of this unusual
disease in these fish.
