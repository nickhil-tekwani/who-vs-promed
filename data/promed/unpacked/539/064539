First report of the occurrence of _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _niveum_ race
2 in commercial watermelon production areas of Maryland and Delaware. XG
Zhou, University of Maryland, Lower Eastern Shore Research and Education
Center, Salisbury 21801; and KL Everts, address as Zhou, and University of
Delaware, Georgetown 19947. Plant Dis 2001; 85: 1291, 2001; published
online as D-2001-1015-02N, 2001. Accepted for publication 21 September 2001.
Resistance to race 1 of _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _niveum_ [Fon (EF Sm.)
WC Snyder & HN Hans) is the most widely used tool for management of
Fusarium wilt of watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_ (Thunb.) Matsum. and
Nakai). However, this resistance is ineffective against the more aggressive
Fon ... race 2.
Race 2 was first identified in Israel in 1973 (2) and was subsequently
reported in Texas (1981), Oklahoma (1988), and Florida (1989) (1). From
July through September 2000 in Maryland and Delaware, 123 isolates of Fon
...were collected from wilted plants or plants with vascular discoloration
from commercial production fields with moderate to severe wilt severity.
Race determination was performed in the greenhouse on [5 race-differential
cultivars. Differential cvs. Sugar Baby, Crimson Sweet, Charleston Gray,
Allsweet, and Dixielee range from susceptible to highly resistant (in the
order listed) to race 1, but all are susceptible to race 2.
Seeds were planted in pots containing pasteurized vermiculite and peat moss
(2:3 mixture) growth medium infested with 1 x 105 conidia per g of growth
medium. Conidia were harvested from 5- to 6-day-old cultures of Fon ...
grown in a liquid mineral salts medium (2). Control pots were treated with
water or diluted liquid medium. Pots were maintained in a greenhouse at 19
to 28 degrees C.
[3 replicate pots containing [7 plants each were used for each
isolate-cultivar combination. Race 0 obtained from BD Bruton (USDA-ARS,
Lane, OK), and races 1 and 2 obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA) were included in the tests for comparative purposes.
[11 isolates from Maryland and [3 ... from Delaware consistently caused
60 to 100 per cent wilt or mortality of all cultivars, with a mean of more
than 75 per cent wilt. Percentage wilt of cvs. Sugar Baby and Dixielee to
races 0, 1, and 2, and the 14 isolates from Maryland and Delaware was 78,
76, 100, and 95 to 100 per cent and 0, 14, 59, and 63 to 93 per cent,
respectively. All control plants remained healthy.
In each of the [3 replicated tests, these 14 isolates caused an equal or
greater incidence of wilt as the reference race 2 isolate, and cvs.
Dixielee and Allsweet were susceptible to these isolates. [These isolates
were identified as Fon ... race 2.
This is the first report of Fon ...race 2 occurring in Maryland and Delaware.

[According to research scientists at the United States Department of
Agriculture Agricultural Research Service, Lane, OK, Fusarium wilt severely
limits production of watermelon. There are 3 races worldwide. Cultivars
with no resistance genes are affected by race 0. Highly resistant
cultivars, in conjunction with crop rotation, provide good control of race
1, the predominant race in most watermelon production areas. There is no
acceptable level of resistance to race 2 in commercial watermelon
cultivars. Seedless watermelon cultivars are generally very susceptible to
Fusarium wilt. Increased emphasis on seedless watermelon production is
likely to result in Fusarium wilt becoming a limiting disease in that crop.
