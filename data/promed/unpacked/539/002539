It is of great concern that this epidemic continues to be ignored by public
health services nationally and globally. I hope that this call by the WHO
is met with commitment and allocated resources to fight this epidemic.
Epidemiology: There is suggested to be greater than 200 million HCV+
[hepatitis C positive people globally and estimates vary per country. What
is certainly known in Europe is the prevalence in injecting drug users
(IDUs) approaches 60-80% in many countries.
UK 250,000-500,000? (1997)
Japan 2.8 million (1994)
USA 4 million (8-10,000 deaths p.a.) (1996)
France - >600,000 (1996)
Russia (Kaliningrad 1996) 82% of HIV+ co-infected with HCV
China 40% of paid blood donors (1% of volunteer donors) (1997)
Egypt 16% of blood donors (1995)
Italy (Naples) 1.9% of general population (1994)
Pakistan 9% of blood donors (1996)
Vancouver [Canada - 90% in Injecting Drug Users (1998)
HCV is now the main contributory cause of liver transplant in the USA, and
the mortality rate is set to triple within the next 10-15 years, possibly
overtaking AIDS related deaths.
I also wonder if anyone has considered the impact of the dual epidemics of
HCV and HIV in many countries (e.g., Kaliningrad 1996, 86% HIV+ co infected
with HCV). Many European and Asian countries are seeing continued expansion
of HIV/HCV in injecting drug users. The possible implications of this are
increased progression to liver disease and the possibly increased
infectivity of HIV/HCV+ individuals for HCV.
Is it time for the wider community to see HIV as part of a complex matrix
of infections (whether opportunistic or not), such as HCV, HBV, TB,
leishmaniasis, etc? My concern is that not only will we not see the issues
of single epidemics, but completely miss the implications of dual epidemics.

As a public health professional there seems to be a gap in the information
getting out to the public about hepatitis. Most people I've talked to were
unaware that there are other forms besides A and B, and believe that the
inoculations against A and B are all they need. This is definitely
something that needs to be addressed in considering future STD education
programs.

[This is what comes of poor taxonomy. No wonder people are confused, these
viruses are not even in the same family. Considerable efforts are needed
in the area of public education. - Mod.CHC
