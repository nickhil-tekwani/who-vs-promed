Multistate Outbreak of Salmonella Infections Linked to Coconut Tree Brand Frozen Shredded Coconut
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA investigated a multistate outbreak of Salmonella infections.

Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting was performed on _Salmonella_bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.

As of 12 Feb 2018, 27 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:- (26 people) or _Salmonella_ Newport (1 person) were reported from 9 states. An ill person infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:- was also reported from Canada.

States / Case Count
California / 10
Colorado / 1
Connecticut / 1
Massachusetts / 2
New Jersey / 1
New York / 1
Oklahoma / 1
Pennsylvania / 5
Washington / 5
Total / 27


WGS showed that isolates from people infected with _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:- were closely related genetically. This close genetic relationship means that people in this outbreak were more likely to share a common source of infection.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 9 Jan 2017, to 4 Nov 2017. Ill people ranged in age from 1 to 82 years, with a median age of 15. Among ill people, 19 (70%) are male. 6 people (29%) reported being hospitalized. No deaths were reported. WGS analysis did not identify any predicted antimicrobial resistance in isolates from 15 ill people. Standard antimicrobial resistance testing methods were used by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory on clinical isolates from 3 ill people in this outbreak. These isolates were not resistant to any antibiotics tested.

Investigation of the Outbreak
--------------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicated that Coconut Tree Brand Frozen Shredded Coconut was the likely source of this multistate outbreak. This outbreak appears to be over. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. 10 (63%) of 16 people interviewed reported eating or maybe eating coconut. Of these 10 people, 8 (80%) reported having an Asian-style dessert drink that contained frozen shredded coconut.

Throughout the outbreak investigation, state and local health officials collected different food items from restaurants where ill people consumed Asian-style dessert drinks. In November 2017, laboratory testing of a sample from coconut milk made in one restaurant in New York did not identify the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:-, but did identify a strain of _Salmonella_ Newport. This sample was from coconut milk made with Coconut Tree Brand frozen Shredded Coconut, as well as other ingredients. WGS showed that the _S._ Newport isolated from the coconut milk was closely related genetically to a _S._ Newport isolate from an ill person from Massachusetts who had consumed an Asian-style dessert drink.

In December 2017, officials in Massachusetts collected food items from a restaurant where that ill person had consumed Asian-style dessert drinks. One sample from frozen shredded coconut identified a strain of _Salmonella_ that was new to the PulseNet database and has not been previously linked to any illnesses. This sample was from an unopened package of Coconut Tree Brand Frozen Shredded Coconut. As a result, on 3 Jan 2018, Evershing International Trading Company recalled all Coconut Tree Brand Frozen Shredded Coconut. The recalled product was packaged in 16-ounce plastic bags.

Officials in Massachusetts returned to the restaurant and collected more Coconut Tree Brand frozen Shredded Coconut in January 2018. These samples were from unopened packages of Coconut Tree Brand frozen Shredded Coconut already subject to recall. On 12 Jan laboratory testing of these samples identified the outbreak strain and another strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:-, as well as several other types of _Salmonella_ bacteria, including _S._ Javiana, _S._ Rissen, and _S._ Thompson. WGS showed that the additional strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:- isolated from the frozen shredded coconut was closely related genetically to _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:- isolated from 2 ill people.

The frozen shredded coconut linked to this outbreak was used as an ingredient in Asian-style dessert drinks served at restaurants. The product was also sold in grocery stores and markets in several states. Frozen shredded coconut can last for several months if kept frozen and may still be in retail stores or in people's homes.

CDC recommends that retailers not sell, restaurants not serve, and consumers not eat recalled Coconut Tree Brand frozen Shredded Coconut. This outbreak appears to be over. However, consumers unaware of the recall could continue to eat the product and get sick.

[_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5] 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case b:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.
