As a manner of discussion, given the case fatality numbers described, if a
similar case scenario was to evolve in a herd of cattle in the US it is
unlikely that infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus would be considered
the primary inciting agent. Several years ago we had fairly similar cattle
(dairy) herd respiratory disease outbreaks (which still occur but to a
lesser degree, at least in this part of the US (south central-NYS).
IN MY OPINION--.Based on clinical course, clinical presentation and
isolation of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), it was concluded
the primary agent was most likely BRSV. In hindsight, with what we
currently understand about BVD virus, I would not be surprised if some of
the outbreaks we dealt with were also complicated by BVD (Bovine Viral
Diarrhea) virus infection that was either preexisting or introduced into
the herd through herd additions.
