[1] Pakistan, Balochistan vaccination challenges - media report

The dream of eradicating polio from Balochistan remained unfulfilled in the year 2017 as well. Despite Balochistan having run 13 polio eradication drives during the year 2017, cases of polio were reported in the province with the administration claiming that none of the 3 children had been administered polio drops during any of the polio eradicating campaigns.

The cases in Qila Abdullah, Zhob and Chaman were reported after refusal of the parents of the said children to administer them polio drops. According to polio workers, such families pose great challenges for them during the campaigns.

During the year 2017, 13 polio eradication drives were run in 32 districts of the province. Over 3000 parents refused to administer polio drops to their children. DHO Quetta Dr. Sher Ahmed believes that refusal of parents to administer polio drops to their children as well as families coming from across the border were major reasons for the emergence of polio cases.

According to a report by Quetta Emergency Centre, polio virus has also been found in sewage. Experts say that if children are administered polio drops regularly, it increases their immunity protecting them from this life-long crippling disease.

[Well, it seems I was overly optimistic with my statement in the last update when I wrote: "It appears as though the cVDPV transmissions associated with outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been interrupted with no new cases identified in either location in the past 3 months (but caution must be exerted in this presumption at present, as poliovirus can be excreted for over 6 weeks)." Unfortunately there appears to be continued circulation of the cVDPV2 in Tanganika province. The previous case reported from Tanganika province had a date of onset of 14 Sep 2017 , approximately 2 months prior to the newly reported cases in today's update. Other cases had previously been reported from Haut Lomami province and Maniema province.

As for Pakistan, the newly confirmed case in this week's report had been reported as an advanced notification in last week's update. Information on environmental sampling results in both Pakistan and Afghanistan were not mentioned in the weekly summary.

In addition, no newly confirmed cases of cVDPV2 were reported from Syria this week.
