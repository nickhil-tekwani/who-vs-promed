A student at the University of Maryland has died after suffering from a strain of the adenovirus, school health officials said.

The school learned that a student was sick with the illness on [1 Nov 2018] David McBride, the director of the university's health center, said in a statement released [Tue 20 Nov 2018].

Since then, 5 more students have been diagnosed with the adenovirus. On [Mon 19 Nov 2018], the health center learned that one of the specimens they sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) was confirmed to be type 7 of the illness.

The same strain of the adenovirus was found to be at the center of a viral outbreak at a rehabilitation center in Wanaque, New Jersey, that has killed 11 children.

The college student who died from the common virus was identified by The Baltimore Sun as 18-year-old [OP]. She had reportedly been sick throughout the fall semester, starting with a cough that led to pneumonia.

[OP's] immune system was weakened because she was taking medicine for Crohn's disease, her father told the news outlet, but questioned if the university could've done more to prevent his daughter's death.

The school said in their statement that "vigilance is extremely important" to those who take medication that weakens their immune system. "It is vitally important not to ignore these symptoms and visit a physician within 48 hours of developing symptoms," the statement read.

The adenovirus -- of which there are more than 50 strains -- is a common virus that poses little risk for healthy people, but can cause different types of illnesses, depending on the strain. It can cause a mild cold or flu symptoms, and some strains also cause diarrhea and pinkeye.

Type 7, along with types 3 and 4, according to the CDC, is among the most potent types. It sometimes causes more serious respiratory illnesses, especially among those with weak immune systems.

Over the past decade, severe illness and death from type 7 adenovirus have been reported in the United States, according to the CDC, but it's unclear how many have died from it.

A University of Maryland student has died following complications stemming from an adenovirus infection, which in extreme cases can be deadly.

[OP], an 18-year-old freshman at the university, died on [Sun 18 Nov 2018] from adenovirus-related complications, according to school officials cited by ABC News. Adenoviruses typically have mild symptoms, such as sore throat, but for people with compromised immunity, they can cause pneumonia or other complications and be fatal.

[OP] was being treated for Crohn's disease, an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, when she contracted the virus, her father told ABC affiliate WJLA.

[IP], the woman's father, expressed concern that the school did not alert students earlier about several reports of adenovirus infections on campus. He said his daughter was only tested for the disease after finding out that other students had been diagnosed.

"I was told there were 2 students with the virus when I called to figure out what my daughter had, which means they knew it before my daughter," [IP] told WJLA. "It is the worst nightmare that a family or certainly a parent can have to endure."

The man is speaking out about the circumstances of his daughter's death in hopes that the information might help others better cope with the threat of adenovirus-related afflictions.

"We don't want any other kids to have this happen to them and God knows we don't want any other parents to have this unimaginable grief that we have," [IP] told Fox5.

[Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are an important cause of respiratory infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, most often known as the common cold and symptoms often include sore throat, bronchitis, and diarrhea. Most people don't know they have adenovirus because physicians rarely test when a patient comes to them with a cold. HAdVs continue to provide clinical challenges pertaining to diagnostics and treatment. The growing number of HAdV types identified by genomic analysis, as well as the improved understanding of the sites of viral persistence and reactivation, requires continuous adaptions of diagnostic approaches to facilitate timely detection and monitoring of HAdV infections.

Although the clinical course of HAdV associated illness is usually mild and self-limiting, infections may cause local outbreaks with severe courses, occasionally leading to a lethal outcome even in immunocompetent individuals. However, adenoviruses play a particularly important role in patients with strongly impaired immune responses, in whom viral disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality, as highlighted for the fatal case in the report above.

In view of the clinical relevance of life-threatening HAdV diseases in the immunocompromised setting, there is an indication to test using molecular diagnostic methods with an urgent need to explore for effective treatment modalities without major side effects. - Mod.UBA
