Teams from the National Health Foundation (FUNASA) are conducting
investigations in the Norte Pioneiro in Parana [state], near the
municipality of Ribeirao Claro, to investigate the death of a group
of monkeys. The initial suspicions are that the animals were victims
of yellow fever, and technicians are collecting samples of
_Haemagogus_ mosquitoes, [the vector] responsible for [the sylvan
(jungle) cycle of] transmission of the disease [virus].

The State Secretariat of Health is advising the population not to
take yellow fever vaccine, since a vaccination campaign was done in
1999, and a new dose could cause reactions. Cases of yellow fever
have not been recorded in Norte Pioneiro in Parana for 23 years.

states of Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul. - Mod.LJS]

[If concern about adverse reaction is the basis on which the state
health authorities recommend against yellow fever [YF] vaccination,
no information to substantiate occurrence or risk of these reactions
is presented in this report, nor are adverse reactions to repeat YF
vaccinations recognized internationally as a risk. We have been
unable to find any recent reports in the Brazilian press of such
reactions. If the last YF vaccination campaign was in 1999,
individuals who received the vaccine are now reaching the 10-year
limit of vaccine efficacy, and should be revaccinated, as should
those in the area who have never been vaccinated, should YF virus
prove to be present in the area. The previous 23-year absence of YF
cases is no guarantee that the virus has not reappeared in monkeys
there. Determination the presence of YF virus in vector mosquitoes
in this area is urgent, to asses the risk of YF virus infection in
people in the area.
