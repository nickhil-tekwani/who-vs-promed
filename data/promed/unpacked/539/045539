The affair of the ibex (_Capra ibex_) in the Bargy massif is back on the table. A Haute-Savoie [Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes] prefectural decree authorizes the slaughter of up to 170 ibexes in the whole massif, in particular attacking the "young females".

This news has caused a massive reaction from activist associations and environmentalists, who, since 2012, have been fighting to protect these animals, and in particular the uninfected ones. A petition is circulating to have the decree annulled and a collective of associations has taken legal action.

Although committed to ensuring that the protected animals remain unscathed, the heads of associations and activists agree on an authorization to slaughter at the bedside of the animal when the latter is contaminated with brucellosis. "There is a test, an in situ control, which is used with a drop of blood. In 15 minutes, they know if the animal is _Brucella_ positive or not. _Brucella_-negative ibexes are marked with ear tags and sometimes with a GPS collar to recognize them and know that they have already been checked. Positive animals that have brucella antibodies are euthanized on site by a veterinarian," explains Jean-Pierre Crouzat, in charge of the dossier for France Nature Environment for more than 10 years.

The prefecture decided otherwise, although the regulatory public consultation of 21 days collected 84% of unfavorable opinions from citizens. During May and June [2022], shooting ibexes will be authorized in the Bargy massif, "with a view to establishing a healthy nucleus."

To understand this radical decision for a protected and non-huntable species, according to Jean-Pierre Crouzat it is necessary to go back to 1999. "France was declared free of bovine brucellosis in 2005 after the last case registered in 1999. Before this year [2022], there were stables affected by brucellosis, also called Malta fever when it infects a human. Systematically, herds of cattle were slaughtered." A brucellosis-free country, therefore, ensures international and transnational trade in cattle and milk. "This also applies to the raw milk sector, if a cattle farm is affected by brucellosis and they make raw milk, milk, and cheese, then all the production must be eliminated. This is detrimental to the entire sector," specifies Jean-Pierre Crouzat.

Contacted by National Geographic, Bernard Mogenet, the president of the Fédération des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles des Savoie [Federation of Savoy Agricultural Operators' Unions] (FDSEA), was unable to respond to us at the time of publication of this article. He had let our colleagues from France Bleu know that he supported the slaughter decision while wishing to strengthen control of the evolution of this bacterium. "This decree has the merit of existing. [...] Now we have to act quickly before going up to the mountain pastures." Bernard Mogenet had also specified that the groups of healthy animals would have to be slaughtered if a case were to be detected among them.

Humans can be infected by the bacteria by ingesting contaminated products, such as fresh cheeses made from raw milk. A ripened cheese can, after a certain time, see the bacteria destroyed. In humans, Malta fever results in a cyclic fever, serious but not fatal, accompanied by great fatigue, muscle pain and which can cause miscarriages in the event of pregnancy. She was treated with antibiotics.

"The _Brucella melitensis_ strain, that of goats, chamois, and ibexes on the Bargy and the _B. abortus_ strain, affect cattle but also sheep and goats." In _Brucella_-positive ibexes, as well as the whole Bovidae family, brucellosis has 3 consequences. The appearance of polyarthritis, as well as swelling of the testicles in males, and spontaneous abortions in females. According to scientific studies, the results of the injection of a vaccine in wild animals do not seem conclusive. Too little accustomed to vaccines, these wild animals develop side effects that are too substantial.

"Tests have shown that sheep and goats can be treated with the rev-1 vaccine," says Jean-Pierre Crouzat. He adds that to date, there are no more symptomatic animals on the massif, the latter having been slaughtered a long time ago. "The ibexes on the massif are losing their health! They breed well. [...] Hence the fact that we protest against an indiscriminate slaughter which, in the years 2013 and 2015, destroyed the social hierarchy of the ibexes. [...] We are opposed to emblematic, protected, vigorous animals being slaughtered when we know how to capture them", although the capture is more restrictive than a mass slaughter, recognizes the spokesperson.

The slaughter is very controversial, as it was in 2013 and 2015. Although Malta fever represents a danger for humans and brucellosis is easily transmitted through fluids and the sexual tract, especially in females who live together with their young, the associations value a very low prevalence rate. "Since 2015, there have been captures. Thanks to sampling and statistics, the scientists propose a range of around 4% of positive ibexes in the heart zone [...] and around 0% on the outskirts of the Bargy massif. Out of the 370, 400 ibexes, there is therefore approximately 1 infected ibex for 20 healthy ibexes," confirms Jean-Pierre Crouzat.

Ariane Ambrosini, from the legal department of the ASPAS [Association for the Protection of Wildlife] organization, agrees with the opinion of the Council for the Protection of Nature and ANSES [National Food Safety Agency] in recommending in particular more in-depth research on the "biosecurity measures to be implemented", but also on the mode of contamination which today remains very vague. The spokesperson for the NGO for the defense of wild animals wishes to see an "adaptive management" of the selective slaughter of animals that tested positive. Ariane Ambrosini concludes by specifying that this would allow, according to the scientists "to lead to the extinction of the disease within the wild population."

The legal challenge to overturn the decree will take place this week.

[The Alpine ibex (_Capra ibex_) population from the Bargy area in France has undergone a major outbreak of brucellosis caused by _Brucella melitensis_. European wild ungulates were seen as dead-end hosts for this bacterium, and all previous outbreaks of brucellosis in wild populations disappeared spontaneously. The situation in Bargy is different and alarming since the disease has affected an unprecedented high proportion of the ibexes (38% in 2013). Brucellosis persisted at high levels in the following years despite intense culling of animals which led to the removal of 40% of the population.

Managing disease in wildlife can be extremely challenging. Culling wildlife as a control measure can lead to both decreases and increases in disease incidence. There is a need for detailed information about the wildlife-disease system involved, to finely tune the culling intensity, coverage, and duration needed to reduce disease incidence without driving hosts to extinction (see https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2018.0901).

The Alpine ibex is a species of wild goat that lives in the mountains of the European Alps. The species is currently listed as of least concern by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) but went through a population bottleneck. By the early 1800s, less than 100 animals survived in a single population in the Italian Gran Paradiso mountain massif. This has led to very low genetic diversity across populations.
