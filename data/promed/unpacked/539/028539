Meningococcal infection in the Balearic Isles

The Public Health Laboratory Service, UK comments that the current
meningococcal season is one of the highest reported in the United
Kingdom. It started earlier than usual and the incidence was still
quite high during May. The majority of cases were diagnosed
meningococcal meningitis Group B but there has been a shift towards
more Group C and an upward shift in the age distribution of cases.

Therefore, the cases in Mallorca probably reflect the epidemiology
in England quite well.

The Spanish authorities have instituted appropriate control
measures in Mallorca including information, surveillance and
antibiotic therapy. The tourist population in Mallorca is also
informed to seek medical advice immediately in case symptoms
appear.
