EC Ban on East African Fresh Fish Imports: Violation of International Law?
The recent EC ban on the importation of fresh fishery products from East
Africa raises the following international legal questions: (1) is the ban
in violation of the International Health Regulations (IHR), and (2) is the
ban in violation of the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement)?
International Health Regulations
Under the IHR, which are binding international law, the measures provided
in the IHR to respond to disease outbreaks in other WHO member states 'are
the maximum measures' applicable to international traffic, which a State
may require for the protection of its territory against the diseases
subject to the Regulations (IHR, art. 23). The IHR specifically apply to
cholera outbreaks (IHR, art. 1) and establish the maximum measures that a
WHO member state may apply to goods coming from a country suffering from a
cholera outbreak (IHR, arts. 61-64). The IHR do not provide for WHO member
states to ban the importation of products from countries suffering from a
cholera outbreak. The WHO has long maintained that "trade restrictions
between countries or different areas within a country do not prevent the
spread of cholera" (WHO Guidelines for Cholera Control, para. 7.3.3.).
Although a theoretical risk exists that cholera can be transmitted through
raw seafood, the "WHO has not documented a significant outbreak of cholera
resulting from commercially imported food" (WHO Guidelines for Cholera
Control, Box 12). WHO concludes that 'the weight of evidence suggests that
this risk is small and normally can be dealt with by means other than an
embargo on importation' (id.). Where theoretical risk exists, WHO
recommends that "agreement should be reached between exporting and
importing countries on the most appropriate public health measures to
prevent transmission" (WHO, EMC, "Cholera", 9 January 1998,
<http://www.who.ch/programmes/emc/news.htm>).
The EC action in banning fresh fish imports from East Africa is, thus,
neither authorized by the IHR nor supported by the WHO or scientific
evidence. These conclusions raise the question whether the EC is in
violation of the IHR in its import ban.
Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS
Agreement)
Under the WTO's SPS Agreement, sanitary measures must be based on
scientific principles and be supported by "sufficient scientific evidence"
(SPS Agreement, arts. 2 and 5). The EC's import ban on East African fresh
fish is a sanitary measure within the meaning of the SPS Agreement; but,
based on WHO recommendations on cholera, the ban does not appear to be
supported by 'sufficient scientific evidence'. Of course, even after the
Beef Hormones Case, it is not clear exactly what type/amount of scientific
evidence is needed to satisfy the SPS Agreement. Would a theoretical risk
to human health qualify as "sufficient scientific evidence"?
Leaving aside that question, the EC import ban would possibly be in
violation under the SPS Agreement for being a measure that was not
"necessary" to protect human health in the EC. Under longstanding GATT law,
a measure is not necessary if there is another, less trade-restrictive
alternative measure reasonably available to the state in question. In the
cholera situation, WHO has recommended that the theoretical risk of cholera
importation can be adequately dealt with by measures less trade-restrictive
than an embargo on importation (WHO Guidelines on Cholera, Box 12). Thus,
the ban on the importation of fresh fish from East Africa is not necessary
to protect human health in the EC under the SPS Agreement and represents a
violation of the SPS Agreement by the EC.
