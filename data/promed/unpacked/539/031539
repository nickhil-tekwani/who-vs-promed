Potato export decline
----------------------
The potato export has dropped by 634 MT [metric tons] in 2008
compared to 2007, Food Corporation of Bhutan (FCB) statistics says.
Last year [2008], Bhutan earned [BTN] Nu 138 [million] [approx. USD
2.8 million] from export of 20 974 MT of potatoes but in 2007 the
country had earned [BTN] Nu 231.3 million [approx. USD 4.7 million]
from export of 21 608 MT. The increase in production in India has
dropped prices in Bhutan by around 20 percent.

Moreover, a large quantity of potatoes was damaged in
Wangduephodrang, Paro, and Bumthang [districts] due to unidentified disease.

[2] Wheat and cumin - India (Gujarat)

Cloudy weather spells doom for wheat, jeera [cumin] crop
--------------------------------------------------------
Farmers are worried as the cloudy weather prevalent in the state for
the past few days spells doom for their wheat and cumin seed crop.

Farmers in Banaskantha and Ahmedabad districts [Gujarat] are facing
the disease 'sukaro,' which has hit their wheat crop. Generally,
chilly weather is favourable for wheat production, but this year
[2008-09] that cold has been absent.

"In addition, for the past few days we are trying to control
'chitary' in wheat where the grains turn yellow and become dry. This
causes a fall in the output," says farmer Balvant Thakore in
Gandhinagar district.

Besides wheat, jeera [cumin] is also being hit. "Jeera cultivation is
highly dependent on weather. The slightest change in weather
conditions makes farmers anxious. We are likely to lose more than 30
percent of our crop," says Valjibhai Patel, a farmer in Surendranagar district.

According to a scientist at Anand Agriculture University, this year
[2009] when farmers sowed jeera, there was unseasonable rain, which
caused problems. "Now, farmers are tackling 'kaliyo' and 'dholiyo'
diseases in jeera. Both jeera and wheat output in some regions will
be less than anticipated as a result of this weather," he says.

[A number of potato diseases have been reported from the region,
including early and late blights and some viruses, and an outbreak of
late blight was reported from Bhutan in 2008. Any of these diseases
or a combination of several pathogens may be the cause of the
problems reported from Bhutan in item 1.

A number of diseases of wheat are known to occur in India. The term
'sukaro' is apparently used by farmers in Gujarat for crop wilting
diseases, which are generally more likely to be due to fungal or
bacterial rather than viral pathogens. While fusarium head blight has
been reported from India previously, and symptoms include premature
drying and yellowing of kernels, it is not clear whether this may be
the disease referred to as 'chitary' in item 2.

The term 'kaliyo' has been reported as a local name for cumin
(_Cuminum cyminum_) blight caused by the fungus _Alternaria burnsii_,
which is considered one of the major diseases of this crop. The other
major diseases in India are considered to be powdery mildew and
fusarium wilt, and the local name 'dholiyo' may possibly refer to one of these.

We would be most grateful for any information on the local names of
the wheat and cumin diseases reported above.
