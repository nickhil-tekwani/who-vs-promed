Alert, verification and public health management of SARS in the
post-outbreak period
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Rationale for continued vigilance for SARS
First recognized as a global threat in mid-March 2003, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) was successfully contained in less than 4
months. On 5 Jul 2003, WHO reported that the last human chain of
transmission of SARS had been broken. While much has been learned about
this syndrome since March 2003, including its causation by a new
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), our knowledge about the epidemiology and ecology of
SARS coronavirus infection and of this disease remains limited. Resurgence
of SARS remains a distinct possibility and does not allow for complacency.
In the post-outbreak period, all countries must remain vigilant for the
recurrence of SARS and maintain their capacity to detect and respond to the
re-emergence of SARS should it occur. The WHO case definitions during the
outbreak period relied heavily on epidemiological criteria to increase the
specificity of syndromic clinical criteria for atypical pneumonia or
respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). However, epidemiological links to
cases of SARS and areas reporting recent local transmission are no longer
of use in helping to define incident cases. Furthermore, the non-specific
clinical features of SARS, the lack of a current rapid diagnostic test that
can reliably detect SARS-CoV in the first few days of illness, and the
seasonal occurrence of other respiratory diseases, including influenza, may
confound any surveillance for SARS or demand a level of quality and
intensity which few health care system worldwide can sustain. Even with the
most sophisticated surveillance systems, the first case of SARS in the
post-outbreak period may escape early detection.
This document describes a SARS alert mechanism for the post-outbreak
period. It provides guidance for managing a SARS "alert" through to
laboratory confirmation or exclusion of people under investigation as SARS
cases. The document does not address complex surveillance issues or case
categorization for SARS.
It also provides guidance to clinicians on the clinical presentation,
laboratory and radiological findings to assist in diagnosis of SARS and in
decisions to implement transmission-based infection control.
2. Risk assessment
Ideally, each member state should determine the intensity of its
surveillance for SARS in the post-outbreak period on the basis of a risk
assessment. WHO has defined 3 major areas that take into account the
experience during the recent outbreak of SARS and the potential for resurgence:
Potential zone of re-emergence of SARS-CoV
Identified as source(s) of the previous outbreak in November 2002 or areas
with an increased likelihood of animal to human transmission of SARS-CoV
infection.
Nodal areas
Sustained local transmission experienced during the previous outbreak or
entry of large numbers of people from the potential zone of re-emergence of
SARS-CoV.
Low risk areas
Never reported cases, reported only imported cases or experienced only
limited local transmission during the previous outbreak.
Thus, WHO recommends a staged approach to surveillance:
Potential zone of re-emergence of SARS
-SARS Alert AND
-enhanced surveillance for SARS AND
-special studies for SARS-CoV infections in animal and human populations
Nodal areas
-SARS Alert AND
-enhanced surveillance for SARS
Low risk areas
-Surveillance for clusters of "alert" cases among health care workers,
other hospital staff, patients and visitors in the same health care unit
(see section 3 ­ The SARS Alert)
3. The SARS Alert
The SARS Alert is an operational definition to ensure that appropriate
infection control and public health measures are implemented until SARS has
been ruled out as a cause of the atypical pneumonia or RDS.
3.1 Objectives of the SARS Alert
Provide early warning of the potential recurrence of SARS to:
-rapidly implement appropriate infection control measures
-expedite diagnosis
-activate the public health response
Raise a global alert if indicated
Definition of a SARS Alert: 2 or more health care workers in the same
health care unit fulfilling the clinical case definition of SARS (see
section 3.3) and with onset of illness in the same 10 day period;
OR
hospital acquired illness in 3 or more people (health care workers and/or
other hospital staff and/or patients and/or visitors) in the same health
care unit fulfilling the clinical case definition of SARS (see section 3.3)
and with onset of illness in the same 10 day period.
A jurisdiction may chose, based on its experience, to increase the minimum
number of "alert" cases defining a cluster. The definition of the health
care unit in which the cluster occurs will depend on the local situation.
Unit size may range from an entire health care facility if small, to a
single department or ward of a large tertiary hospital.
3.2 Case description of SARS
See Annex 1 Clinical description of SARS. The case description provides
details of the clinical evolution of SARS and radiological and laboratory
findings to assist clinicians with its diagnosis. It provides information
on the spectrum of the disease, including atypical presentations.
3.3 Case Definitions
Clinical case definition of SARS
The following clinical case definition has been developed for public health
purposes.
A person with a history of:
- fever (= 38°C)
-AND one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (cough,
difficulty breathing, shortness of breath);
-AND radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or
RDS OR autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia or RDS
without an identifiable cause;
-AND no alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illness.
Laboratory case definition of SARS
A person with symptoms and signs that are clinically suggestive of SARS AND
with positive laboratory findings for SARS-CoV based on one or more of the
following diagnostic criteria:
a) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for SARS-CoV
PCR positive using a validated method from:
at least 2 different clinical specimens (for example, nasopharyngeal and
stool) OR
the same clinical specimen collected on 2 or more occasions during the
course of the illness (for example, sequential nasopharyngeal aspirates) OR
2 different assays or repeat PCR using a new RNA extract from the original
clinical sample on each occasion of testing.
b) Seroconversion by ELISA or IFA
Negative antibody test on acute serum followed by positive antibody test on
convalescent phase serum tested in parallel OR
fourfold or greater rise in antibody titre between acute and convalescent
phase sera tested in parallel.
c) Virus isolation
Isolation in cell culture of SARS-CoV from any specimen AND PCR
confirmation using a validated method. Testing should only be undertaken in
a national or regional reference laboratory as per WHO recommendations (Use
of laboratory methods for SARS diagnosis). WHO will assist resource poor
countries to confirm their first cases of SARS through laboratory
collaboration.
3.4 Public health management of a SARS Alert
When a SARS Alert is raised:
1. Patient(s) should be immediately isolated and transmission-based
precautions instituted, if not already in place (see clinical management
guidelines)
2. The diagnosis should be expedited (see Annex 2 Guidance regarding the
diagnosis of SARS in the post-outbreak period ­ A concern for all health
care workers). WHO will assist in the investigation of SARS alerts as
appropriate, including the facilitation of access to laboratory services
(see Annex 3 WHO Focal Points for SARS).
3. Contacts of people under investigation for SARS should be traced and
quarantined until SARS has been ruled out as the cause of the illness.
3.1 A contact is a person who is at greater risk of developing
SARS because of exposure to a SARS case. Risky exposures include having
cared for, lived with, or having had direct contact with the respiratory
secretions, body fluids, and/or excretions (such as faeces) of cases of SARS.
3.2 Individuals with risky exposures to a person or persons in a
SARS alert cluster should be managed as contacts until SARS has been ruled
out as the cause of the illness.
3.3 Contact within the health care setting should be managed in
the following way:
Inpatient contacts should be isolated or cohorted away from unexposed
patients and transmission-based precautions instituted. They should be
placed on fever surveillance. Exposed staff should be placed on active
fever surveillance, and either cohorted to care for exposed patients (as
above) or placed on home quarantine depending on local circumstances.
3.4 Community contacts should be:
- given information on the clinical picture, transmission, etc. of SARS
- placed under active surveillance for 10 days and voluntary home
quarantine recommended
- visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public health care team
- temperature recorded daily.
- if the contact develops disease symptoms, they should be investigated
locally at an appropriate health care facility.
- the most consistent first symptom that is likely to appear is fever.
3.5 National public health authorities should report every
laboratory confirmed case of SARS to WHO (see below).
International reporting of SARS
A new outbreak of SARS is defined as the occurrence of one or more
clinically compatible, laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS in any country
based on definitive laboratory investigations. The reappearance of SARS in
the human population would be considered a global public health emergency.
For the purposes of the international reporting of SARS in the
post-outbreak period, Member States are requested to inform WHO of
laboratory-confirmed cases only.
Laboratory confirmed cases of SARS could be detected through a SARS alert
verification process but also as sporadic case(s) of acute respiratory
illness on which SARS-CoV testing was undertaken (that is, fulfil the case
definition described in section 3.3). Reporting to WHO should include both
of these scenarios but should exclude asymptomatic people with a positive
laboratory test or symptomatic people without laboratory confirmation. No
nil reporting is required.
WHO requests that member states immediately inform the focal points at
regional offices or headquarters of every person meeting the
laboratory-confirmed case definition of SARS (see Annex 3 WHO Focal Points
for SARS). This will allow WHO to assess the need for a global alert and
re-institute global surveillance for SARS on the basis of that notification
as appropriate.
The development of new case definitions applicable to the new situation,
surveillance standards and a step-down strategy may be required once
laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported.
In the event of an international traveller being investigated for SARS, all
member states involved in international contact tracing around the case(s)
should communicate directly with each other during the investigation. WHO
should be informed only when the incident is laboratory confirmed.
WHO will continue to identify and verify rumours of events of international
public health concern, including rumours about SARS, through its usual
well-established mechanisms.
Indicators of the quality of the SARS alert mechanism
WHO recommends that national public health authorities monitor the quality
of the SARS alert mechanism -- for example, by establishing indicators
based on:
- the number of alerts expected and reported by health facilities over time
- the time taken to implement transmission-based precautions and expedite
diagnosis
- the time taken to alert local public health authorities, national public
health authorities
- the time taken to complete contact tracing and quarantine contacts.
This list is not meant to be exhaustive but rather a suggested approach to
monitoring the alert mechanism.
4. Enhanced surveillance and special studies for SARS-CoV infections in
animal and human populations
Jurisdictions in nodal areas and areas of potential re-emergence have
maintained heightened SARS surveillance established during the outbreak
period, and continue doing so for the foreseeable future. WHO will
encourage these jurisdictions to make available to the global community the
details of these surveillance activities and will offer its assistance in
summarizing and updating available information on its website.
Depending on risk assessment and available resources, nodal areas and areas
of potential re-emergence may include one or more of the following activities:
Surveillance for atypical pneumonia in settings such as nursing homes,
rehabilitation units, community health care centres and in private practice
(see Annex, Guidance regarding the diagnosis of SARS in the post-outbreak
period - A concern for all health care workers)
surveillance of people discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of
unspecified atypical pneumonia
surveillance for absenteeism among health care workers
laboratory-based surveillance of SARS-CoV infection
surveillance for requests for laboratory testing of respiratory pathogens
or SARS-CoV
surveillance for unexplained deaths following an acute respiratory illness
serological surveillance of high risk populations (health care workers,
animal handlers, market vendors, hunters, etc)
community-based serological surveys to monitor changes in the
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV infection
serosurveys among animal populations.
This list is not meant to be exhaustive but rather a suggested approach to
enhanced surveillance.

[As of 7 Aug 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8422 cases of SARS
with 916 deaths (case fatality rate 11.0 per cent) attributable to SARS
reported (note that during the past week there have been 2 additional
deaths reported in Canada thereby raising the total number of deaths due to
SARS in Canada to 43, and overall to 918 with the case fatality rate still
at 10.9).Sixty-four cases of SARS are still in hospital; 7442 cases have
recovered (88.4 per cent). Of the reported cases, 1725 (20 per cent) were
health care workers. The above table presents additional information by
country including the male/female distribution of cases, the median age of
cases and the range of ages, the number of imported cases and the dates of
onset of the first and last probable case reported.
The second part of this posting contains the key strategies for heightened
surveillance in the post-SARS period. The full information can be found at
the web address shown. The recent report of possible identification of the
SARS coronavirus or a closely related virus associated with an outbreak of
a milder respiratory illness (see ProMED-mail posting Acute respiratory
syndrome - Canada (BC): non-severe 20030815.2035) is currently under study.
The health authorities in British Columbia have implemented precautions
consistent with a suspected SARS outbreak while further information is
pending. The clinical case descriptions in that outbreak are not consistent
with the case descriptions used for SARS (see
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/postoutbreak/en/> : a person with a history
of: fever (= 38°C); AND one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract
illness (cough, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath); AND
radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or RDS
OR autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia or RDS
without an identifiable cause; AND no alternative diagnosis can fully
explain the illness. In addition the laboratory case definition of SARS
used is: a person with symptoms and signs that are clinically suggestive of
SARS AND with positive laboratory findings for SARS-CoV based on one or
more of the following diagnostic criteria presented.) Thus, in accordance
with the currently established case definitions, the ongoing outbreak in
British Columbia is not currently considered to be an outbreak of SARS. -
