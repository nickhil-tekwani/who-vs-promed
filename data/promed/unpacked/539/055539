Avian influenza H5N1 confirmed in a wild bird in Spain: authorities
applying precautionary measures
-----------------------------------------------
The Spanish authorities have informed the European Commission this
afternoon [10 Jul 2006] that tests have confirmed the presence of the
highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 in a wild duck (of the
_pociceps_ species) found dead in a wetland in the province of Alava in the
Basque Country. Samples will be sent to the Community Reference Laboratory
for avian influenza in Weybridge for further tests to determine whether
this is the H5N1 strain of the virus found in Asia.
The Spanish authorities are applying the precautionary measures set out in
Commission Decision 2006/115 on certain protection measures in relation to
highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds in the Community. The
Decision sets out the measures to be applied in any EU Member State which
has a case of suspected or confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1
virus in wild birds.
The measures consist of the establishment of a high risk area (a 3-km
protection zone) and a surrounding surveillance zone of 10 km (which
includes the protection zone), to be defined taking into account the
specific conditions of the wetland. In the protection zone, poultry must be
kept indoors, movement of poultry is banned except directly to the
slaughterhouse and the dispatch of meat outside the zone is forbidden
except where products have undergone the controls provided for in EU food
controls legislation (i.e. meat sourced from healthy animals in registered
farms, subject to ante and post mortem checks by vets in the
slaughterhouse). In both the protection zone and the surveillance zone,
on-farm biosecurity measures must be strengthened, hunting of wild birds is
banned, and disease awareness of poultry owners and their families must be
carried out.
Spain is the 14th EU Member State to report a case of highly pathogenic
avian influenza H5N1 in wild birds. The other countries are Greece, Italy,
Slovenia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, France, Slovakia, Sweden, Poland,
Denmark, Czech Republic and the UK. Avian influenza H5N1 was confirmed in
poultry in 5 EU Member States: France, Sweden, Germany, Denmark and Hungary.

[The following additional pieces of information have been kindly derived
(and translated) from various Spanish news sources by Dr. Pablo Nart.
1. The HPAI H5N1 virus involved in the 1st case of avian flu in a wild bird
in Spain is similar to the virus previously found in other Europeans
countries and does not have the same characteristics as the ones that had
affected wild and/or domestic birds in Africa. This is one of the
preliminary results made public by the National Reference Laboratory in
Algete after nucleotide sequencing.
Samples of the infected bird were sent to the reference laboratory in
Weybridge (UK) the same day that the case was made public. The results
might enable a determination of whether the bird had been infected in Spain
by a bird migrating from Europe or whether it arrived from central Europe
while carrying the virus.
(From: ABC, Spain, 9 Jul 2006).
2. Following H5N1 virus detection, there is an increase in sampling of live
wild birds in the Salburua area, from 5 to 10 weekly. The initial analysis
will be carried out at the Basque regional laboratories (Instituto Vasco de
Investigacion y Desarrollo Agrario, NIKER).
(From: La Nueva Espana, 10 Jul 2006).
3. During the last weekend, samples from 2 other dead birds found in the
Salburua reserve, as well as 12 dead birds found in the province, have been
sent to the Basque regional laboratory for analysis, Eloy Lpez de Foronda,
the local deputy of Agriculture, said.
There are 500 free range birds in 25 holdings within 3 km of the Salburua
wetlands, which are under movement control. The census in the 10 km area is
not yet completed.
(From: Terra, 10 Jul 2006).
4. The Salburua wetlands, near the city Vitoria, are open to the public.
The local and regional police are in charge of controlling the movements of
animals in the area.
(From: Terra, 10 Jul 2006).
5. 15 veterinarians and 25 rangers are engaged in the current surveillance
effort.
