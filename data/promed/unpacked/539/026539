[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.9.2 "Camelpox" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.09.02_CAMELPOX.pdf, from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Camelpox is caused by _Orthopoxvirus cameli_ virus, which belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus within the family Poxviridae.

Camelpox occurs in almost every country in which camel husbandry is practised apart from the introduced dromedary camel in Australia and tylopods (llama and related species) in South America. Outbreaks have been reported in the Middle East (Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen), in Asia (Afghanistan and Pakistan), in Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Somalia and Sudan) and in the southern parts of Russia and India. The disease is endemic in these countries and a pattern of sporadic outbreaks occurs with a rise in the seasonal incidence usually during the rainy season.

The incubation period is usually 9-13 days (varying between 3 and 15 days). Clinical manifestations of camelpox range from inapparent and mild local infections, confined to the skin, to moderate and severe systemic infections, possibly reflecting differences between the strains of camelpox or differences in the immune status of the animals. The disease is characterised by fever, enlarged lymph nodes and skin lesions. Skin lesions appear 1-3 days after the onset of fever, starting as erythematous macules, developing into papules and vesicles, and later turning into pustules. Crusts develop on the ruptured pustules. These lesions 1st appear on the head, eyelids, nostrils and the margins of the ears. In severe cases the whole head may be swollen. Later, skin lesions may extend to the neck, limbs, genitalia, mammary glands and perineum. In the generalised form, pox lesions may cover the entire body. Skin lesions may take up to 4-6 weeks to heal. In the systemic form of the disease, pox lesions can be found in the mucous membranes of the mouth and respiratory tract.

The animals may show salivation, lacrimation and a mucopurulent nasal discharge. Diarrhoea and anorexia may occur in the systemic form of the disease. Pregnant females may abort. Death is usually caused by secondary infections and septicaemia.

Both attenuated and inactivated vaccines are commercially available. Vaccination with live attenuated vaccine provides protection for at least 6 years and with inactivated vaccine for 12 months.

Camelpox virus is very host specific and does not infect other animals. Zoonotic camelpox virus infection in humans associated with outbreaks in dromedary camels (_Camelus dromedarius_) was described in the north-eastern region of India during 2009. This was a single incident illustrating that camelpox is of limited public health importance."

Camelpox was recently reported by Israel in the adjacent Negev area (see posting 20160728.4376693). A possible earlier contact between the affected populations of both parties has been, unofficially, suspected, justifying a cooperative investigation.
