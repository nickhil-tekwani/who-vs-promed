A newly discovered koala immune deficiency virus is associated with leukemia and lymphoma, according to a study performed with the help of the San Diego Zoo. Checking for the virus in wild koalas may help prevent its spread.

The virus is one of 2 the study named KoRV-A and KoRV-B. These were formerly thought to be just one virus, called KoRV, for koala endogenous retrovirus. KoRV-B is passed along from mother to cub by infection. KoRV-A is passed down through the genome.

KoRV-A is found in koalas at the San Diego Zoo, and does not appear to cause cancer. None of the koalas at the San Diego Zoo have cancer. As a retrovirus, KoRV-A can integrate into the genome, and some time ago integrated into the koala genome.

The other, called KoRV-B, is found along with KoRV-A in koalas at the Los Angeles Zoo, some of whom have leukemia or lymphoma. In Australia, the blood cancers cause more than 60 percent of deaths in captive koalas, the study said. The virus weakens the immune system of koalas, similar to HIV in humans. HIV is also a retrovirus.

The study was published Monday [24 Jun 2013] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Geoffrey W Pye of the San Diego Zoo took part in the study. It was led by Maribeth V Eiden of the National Institutes of Health.

Understanding how the virus-caused cancer is spread among captive koalas can better help prevent it, the study said.

"Furthermore, assessment of KoRV-B infection in the Australian native koala population may provide important insights into the prevalence and spread of KoRV-B that potentially threatens the existence of the koala species as a whole," it said.

"Preventing KoRV-B-positive dams from breeding, sequestering KoRV-B-positive koalas from the rest of the koala population, and treating KoRV-B-positive animals with antiretroviral agents may all be sensible approaches to reducing the impact of KoRV-B infection on the koala population.

The study pointed out several differences between the 2 viruses.

"KoRV-B is most divergent in the envelope protein and uses a host receptor distinct from KoRV-A," The study stated. "KoRV-B also has duplicated enhancer regions in the LTR [long terminal repeats] associated with increased pathology in gammaretroviruses."

Before the discovery of the koala endogenous retrovirus (KoRV), mammalian endogenous retrovirus were thought not to produce infectious particles. KoRV retains its ability to form virus particles capable of 'de novo' infection transmission.

The study revealed that Los Angeles Zoo koalas with lymphomas/leukemias are infected with 2 subtypes of KoRB. "KoRV-A" (also present in koalas from San Diego zoo) and by a unique KoRV termed subtype "KoRV-B". KoRV-B is transmitted from dam to offspring through 'de novo' infection, rather than via genetic inheritance like KoRV-A. - Mod.PMB
