Scientists are trying to figure out what's behind the deaths of seabirds that have been found by the hundreds along the Pacific Coast since October [2014].

Mass die-offs of the small, white-bellied gray birds known as Cassin's aucklets have been reported from British Columbia [Canada] to San Luis Obispo, California [USA].

Julia Burco of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife tells the Salem Statesman Journal that the birds appear to be starving to death, so experts don't believe a toxin is the culprit.

But why the birds can't find food is a mystery.

Researchers say it could be the result of a successful breeding season, unusually violent storms or changes in ocean chemistry.

Bird carcasses have been sent to a federal lab in Wisconsin for more research.

[The Cassin's auklet (_Ptychoramphus aleuticus_) is a small seabird native to the North Pacific. For a picture go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassin%27s_auklet#mediaviewer/File:Cassins_Auklet.jpg.

Cassin's auklets are planktivores that feed mainly on macrozooplankton (primarily copepods and euphausiids) and larval fish.

It has been reported in this species that survival is highly influenced by the winter "El Nino Southern Oscillation" (ENSO; a naturally occurring phenomenon that involves fluctuating ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific). Changes in ENSO alter prey availability. - Mod.PMB
