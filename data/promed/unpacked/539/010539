Dolphins Died From Toxin, Tests Show
-------------------------------------------
Preliminary test results indicate the deaths of more than 65 dolphins in
the Panhandle may have been caused by biotoxin released by naturally
occurring algae.
Jane Whaley, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
National Marine Fisheries Service, said domoic acid had been found in water
samples.
Domoic acid has been blamed for several marine mammal deaths on the West
Coast, she said.

[An excellent review of domoic acid in mammals can be found in "Mammal,
bird die-off, domoic acid - USA (CA) (02) 20020708.4702."
Domoic acid is a neurotoxic tricarboxylic amino acid structurally related
to kainic and glutamic acids. It was chemically identified after its
isolation in 1958 from the seaweed _Chondria armata_, found off the coast
of Japan. In 1987, more than 100 people became ill and several people died
following the consumption of blue mussels caught off Prince Edward Island,
Canada. Canadian scientists found that domoic acid had entered the food
chain when the mussels fed on a toxic algal bloom of the pennate diatom
_Pseudonitzschia pungens_ forma multiseries. - Mod.TG]
