The Ministry of Health of Egypt has announced 2 new cases of human
infection with H5N1 avian influenza.

A 28-year-old woman from Manshaet district of Damnhouar governorate
developed symptoms on 12 Dec 2010. She was admitted to hospital on 14
Dec 2010 and subsequently was discharged on the 22 Dec 2010 in good
and stable condition. She has a history of exposure in a market where
live animals are sold.

An 11-year-old girl from Esna district of Luxor governorate developed
symptoms on 18 Dec 2010 and was admitted to the hospital the following
day. She experienced severe respiratory symptoms requiring mechanical
ventilation and died on 23 Dec 2010. No information is available
regarding poultry exposure. Investigations into the source of
infection are underway.

Laboratory tests have confirmed H5N1 virus and both patients were
treated with antiviral medications. Of the 115 cases confirmed to date
in Egypt, 38 have been fatal.

[As of 9 Dec 2010, the WHO had listed 113 human cases of avian
influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection, 37 of whom have died: see
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2010_12_09/en/index.html#>.

- The 11-year-old-girl who died on 23 Dec 2010 is the 115th case
previously described in ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza, human (67):
Egypt, 115th case 20101223.4515.

- The 28-year-old woman from Manshaet district of Damnhouar
governorate who developed symptoms on 12 Dec 2010 is presumed,
therefore, to be the 114th case, although not the same person
identified as the 114th case previously by the Egyptian Ministry of
Health (see: Avian influenza, human (63): Egypt (DQ) susp. 114th case
20101208.4378).

- The 116th case reported by the Egyptian Ministry of Health on 28 Dec
2010 (see: Avian influenza, human (69): Egypt, 116th case
20101228.4577) has yet to be confirmed by WHO. No doubt, these
discrepancies will be resolved in due course.
