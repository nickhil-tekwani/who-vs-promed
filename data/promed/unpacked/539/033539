Verburg and Klink: vaccination against Q fever is catching on
-------------------------------------------------------------
Within a short period, many goats and sheep have been vaccinated. Only
9 holdings remain to be heard from. This was reported by ministers
Verburg (Agriculture) and Klink (Health) today [1 Jun 2010] in a
letter to the House.

Alleviation of the measures regarding Q fever control will become
feasible only when all commercial farms have completed their full
vaccination. Until then, the general ban upon breeding and
introduction of animals into such farms, as well as the biweekly
tank-milk monitoring, will be maintained.

Situation of human epidemic:
----------------------------
The rapid increase in the number of reported cases, seen during
April-May 2009, has not (yet) been observed in 2010. This may be an
indication of the absence, this year, of the disease peaking. The
ministers write that this is a hopeful sign, but drawing conclusions,
based upon these data, is still premature.

[Though yet to be fully scrutinised and confirmed, the above promising
update is good news, probably justifying the extreme measures applied.
Hopefully, this trend will be maintained when breeding is renewed and
during the next parturition season in goats and sheep.

The conclusions and recommendations of the Dutch Q fever Evaluation
Committee, nominated by the 2 ministers and chaired by Prof. van Dijk,
are expected in September 2010 (following the extension of the
investigation period). - Mod.AS]
