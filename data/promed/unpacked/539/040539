Singapore: 6 More Pneumonia Cases Reported
--------------------------------------------
6 more people have been admitted to hospital for pneumonia, following a
global alert issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Ministry of
Health said Friday. In addition to the 3 cases reported on Thu 13 Mar 2003,
the 6 who have been admitted have been in close contact with the patients
who have developed pneumonia after returning from Hong Kong, it said in a
statement. Of these, 2 are hospital staff who have attended to the
patients, and their condition is stable.

Ongoing investigations suggest a viral origin, stated the Ministry.
"However, no causative organism has been identified. The transmission of
the infection among the cases in Singapore appears to be due to close
contact with the patients who have travelled to Hong Kong," it noted.

On Thu 13 Mar 2003, the World Health Organisation started a worldwide
surveillance of cases of atypical pneumonia. The Ministry has also advised
the public to seek immediate medical attention if they develop fever,
muscle ache, and flu-like symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of
breath, or breathing difficulty) and have travelled to Hong Kong, Hanoi, or
Guangdong province in China, within 2 weeks of onset of the symptoms.

Taiwan: Suspected Atypical Pneumonia Cases
------------------------------------------
The Department of Health, Taiwan, reported a 54-year-old man who had been
hospitalized due to atypical pneumonia on 10 Mar 2003. This Taiwanese
businessman had a business trip in Dong Guan (Guandong), PRC from 5 to 21
Feb 2003 and returned on 21 Feb with flu-like symptom. On 25 Feb 2003,
fever and intermittent diarrhea began, and the symptoms worsened to include
cough and exertional dyspnea on 6 Mar 2003. The businessman was sent to an
emergency room on 8 Mar 2003 and was hospitalized due to bilateral lung
diffused infiltration (revealed by chest radiogram) and elevation of
leukocyte count. 2 days later, he was transferred to the intensive care
unit due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and artificial
ventilation was administered.

The businessman's wife, a 51-year-old woman who had not traveled abroad,
also developed fever and other flu-like symptoms, slight bloody sputum, and
diarrhea on 7 Mar 2003. Her chest radiogram showed an infiltration lesion
in the left-upper lung compatible with atypical pneumonia.

All necessary samples have been taken for pathogen study and isolation
procedures. The health authorities in Taiwan continue to observe this event
closely.

Pneumonia Outbreak Prompts Travel Warning in Asia
-----------------------------------------------
A mysterious outbreak of pneumonia spread further in southeast Asia today
[Thu 13 Mar 2003], prompting Singapore and Taiwan to warn their citizens
against unnecessary travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi, and China's Guangdong
Province, where most of the cases have occurred.

Doctors at laboratories in Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States have
been struggling without success to identify the cause of the disease. The
sickness causes flu-like symptoms, including a high fever, and appears
highly contagious at least for hospital workers who treat infected
patients, health officials around the region said.

The World Health Organization has been especially concerned about the
spread among hospital workers, because it may make them leery of caring for
further patients if the disease spreads. Dr. Dick Thompson, a spokesman for
the World Health Organization in Geneva, cautioned that because laboratory
researchers could not isolate the cause of the sickness, it remains unclear
whether the dozens of cases in various countries were caused by a single
[agent].

Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, Hong Kong's Secretary of Health, Welfare and Food, said
that 43 hospital staff had been admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the
sickness, and 29 had been found to show signs of pneumonia. An American
businessman who lived in Shanghai died of pneumonia at a hospital here on
Thu 13 Mar 2003. The businessman had passed through Hong Kong to Hanoi,
where he fell ill, entered a hospital and was then evacuated here, when his
condition deteriorated and the disease began spreading through the hospital
staff. Officials in Vietnam said that 30 doctors and other employees had
fallen ill at the hospital where the man was treated.

Dr. Yeoh pointed out at a press conference this afternoon that there are
1500 to 2000 cases of pneumonia each month in Hong Kong, and that pneumonia
is a common problem around the world. But Dr. Yeoh said that the current
outbreak was troubling because its pattern of transmission appeared
consistent with a virus that travels as droplets through the air. By
contrast, bacterial infections are the most common causes of pneumonia
here, although so-called atypical pneumonia cases also occur, triggered by
influenza and other respiratory viruses. Seeking to allay concerns that
might hurt the territory's important tourism industry, however, Dr. Yeoh
said that the disease still appeared to be confined to medical workers and
was not spreading through the general population. Hospital officials here
acknowledged, however, that there might be additional cases among family
members of hospital workers.

Taiwan authorities announced after Dr. Yeoh's press conference that a
businessman had developed pneumonia and his wife was developing flu-like
symptoms following their recent trip to Shenzhen, the mainland city
adjacent to Hong Kong, in China's Guangdong Province. The couple had passed
through Hong Kong on the way home. While Taiwan mildly discouraged its
citizens from taking unessential trips to Hong Kong and Guangdong Province,
Singapore's Ministry of Health issued an unusually strong warning to
citizens there. "As a precautionary measure, the ministry advises you to
avoid travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi and Guangdong province in China for the
time being, unless absolutely necessary," the ministry said at the end of a
statement announcing the illnesses there.

China's Guangdong Province has acknowledged 305 cases earlier this year, a
third of them involving medical workers. Mr. Thompson said that the Chinese
government had asked for technical assistance from the World Health
Organization in investigating the Guangdong outbreak, a rare request from
Beijing, which prides itself on self-sufficiency in technical expertise.
The World Health Organization is assembling experts to go to China. The
group already has 6 specialists in Hanoi, Vietnam, to analyze the outbreak
there, with more on the way, and one in Hong Kong, Mr. Thompson added.

None of the people currently suffering from pneumonia has so far been found
to be infected with the avian influenza that killed a man here and
temporarily sickened his son last month, although tests are continuing.

Hong Kong SAR: Government Says Pneumonia Outbreak Confined to Hospitals
---------------------------------------------------
5 more hospital workers showed symptoms of pneumonia on Friday, bringing
the total to 29 in an outbreak that raised fears of a mystery illness. But
Hong Kong's top health official insisted no epidemic is afoot. "We are not
talking about any outbreak in the community," said Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, Hong
Kong's secretary for health, welfare and food. 2 of the hospital workers
were in serious condition but most were stable, officials said.

43 workers from 4 Hong Kong hospitals have fallen ill, and 29 displayed
signs of pneumonia, raising fears that an atypical form of pneumonia that
recently killed 5 people in neighboring Guangdong province had made its way
to this former British colony. Health officials were also trying to see
whether there are any links to a disease that spread through a hospital in
Vietnam, forcing its closure early this week. An American businessman from
Shanghai became ill with atypical pneumonia on a trip to Hanoi and infected
26 workers there before being flown to Hong Kong, where he died Thursday.

The World Health Organization has issued a global alert, but no links have
been confirmed among the disease outbreaks in Hong Kong, mainland China,
and Vietnam. Yeoh told reporters Friday the new cases reported in Hong Kong
were atypical pneumonia caused by influenza or other viruses, instead of
the bacteria that cause regular pneumonia. Yeoh said the territory has not
seen a jump in overall pneumonia cases or atypical cases, but the hospital
workers were vulnerable because they may have treated patients with
atypical pneumonia. Hong Kong gets about 1500 to 2000 cases of pneumonia
each month, with about half of them atypical, Yeoh said, adding that both
types are commonly seen all over the world. Despite such assurances, many
Hong Kong residents are frightened. Most of the pneumonia cases have
occurred in workers at the Prince of Wales Hospital in suburban Shatin,
where residents have been snapping up surgical masks. The American man died
far away in another part of Hong Kong, in a hospital that has not reported
any of its employees ill with pneumonia.

Although just 6 people have died in the outbreaks under investigation, WHO
spokesman Dick Thompson said officials were worried because the disease
spread quickly, and they are not sure what caused it. In Taipei, officials
at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport put up posters and handed out
leaflets warning Taiwanese travelers about the outbreak in Hong Kong and
urging them to be cautious if they go to Hong Kong or mainland China.

[The common feature of all these reports is that no viral (or non-viral)
infectious agent that is unequivocally associated with these outbreaks has
yet been isolated. The wide geographic spread of the reports and the
almost apparently exclusive involvement of hospital staff (and travellers) are
singular features of this enigmatic situation. 2 reports suggest that the
infection may have reached Taiwan also. - Mod.CP]
