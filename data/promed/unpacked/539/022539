After 5 years of relief from the cassava mosaic disease, another
disease has emerged in Mukono district. The disease, which poses a
threat of famine and poverty was identified by the agriculture
officer of Mukono, Doreen Kataama, as cassava brown streak [disease].
The disease causes rotting of the roots, and is caused by a virus
spread by white small flies that suck water from cassava leaves and
stems. They move from infected plants to uninfected ones. The
attacked plant remains green but the roots rot.
"The entire district is affected but Seeta Namuganga and Kasawo
sub-counties are the most affected because cassava is grown there on
a commercial basis," Ms Kataama said.
Seeta Namuganga sub-county agricultural officer Steven Kasumba said
the sub-county has been producing between 15 and 24 tonnes of cassava
every day but last year's [2006] produce was reduced to 445
kilogrammes because of the disease.
Ms Kataama said the virus was identified in 1945. She said there was
no drug for it but advised farmers to plant resistant species of the
crops.
"There are 2 types of resistant cassava at Namulonge Agriculture
Research Institute: Akena and Type 2961," she said. However, these 2
types do not mature quickly.

[Cassava brown streak potyvirus -- see Plant Viruses Online:
<http://image.fs.uidaho.edu/vide/descr168.htm> -- is spreading in the
African eastern regions. Symptoms in cassava are leaf chlorosis often
in a characteristic pattern of feathering along the veins and, in
severe infection, stem necrosis. Unlike cassava mosaic disease,
symptoms may be found also on the roots, as a yellow/brown, corky
necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue, making the most severely
affected roots unfit for consumption. Losses in root weight of up to
70 percent have been attributed to cassava brown streak disease in
susceptible cultivars. It is transmitted by the white fly vector _B.
tabaci_ (Maruthi et al. 2005, J Phytopath 153, 307
