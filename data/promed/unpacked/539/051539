Report date: 17 Dec 2015
Date submitted to OIE: 17 Dec 2015
Date event resolved: 17 Dec 2015
Reason for notification: New strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] virus (genotype VII)
Serotype: A
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country
Related reports: Immediate notification (16 Nov 2015)
Follow-up report No. 1 (23 Nov 2015)
Follow-up report No. 2 (30 Nov 2015)
Follow-up report No. 3 (17 Dec 2015)

Outbreaks
There are no new outbreaks in this report

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Illegal movement of animals; contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering; fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.)
Epidemiological comments: The new strain of type A FMD virus has rapidly spread on a large area in Anatolia. The event is considered endemic and therefore no more follow-up reports will be sent.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; disinfection/disinfestation; quarantine; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; no treatment of affected animals; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):
Administrative division / Species / Total vaccinated / Details
AMASYA / Cattle / 789
BITLIS / Cattle / 460

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Future reporting
The event cannot be considered resolved, but the situation is sufficiently stable. No more follow-up reports will be sent. Information about this disease will be included in the next 6-monthly reports.

[On 6 Nov 2015, Turkey informed EuFMD Secretariat on the occurrence of 2 FMD outbreaks due to a new serotype A strain, topotype Asia, lately named "Genotype VII". Since then, a total of 3 FMD outbreaks of the new FMD virus from 3 provinces, namely Van & Bitils (south-East) and Amasya (north), were reported to OIE. The previous follow-up report (No. 2) was submitted to the OIE on 30 Nov 2015. The current, "final" report, in essence means that this new serotype A strain, against which no matching vaccine was available when initially detected, has most remarkably managed to spread and become endemic within less than 3 months, throughout Anatolia -- a territory which occupies 97 percent of Turkey. Anatolia's land area is 756 816 sq km (292 208 sq mi; more than 10 percent bigger than Texas). The report says that "this event pertains to a defined zone within the country"; what is the "defined zone"?

According to the recent information provided by Turkey's Minister of Agriculture (20151217.3870329), at least 217 outbreaks have already been recorded in Anatolia; it has not been disclosed how far westwards the disease has already spread.

Turkey's livestock population (OIE 2014 data) is: cattle 14.1 million, sheep 31.1 million, goats 10.3 million. The rapid spread reflects the susceptibility of livestock in spite of earlier mass FMD vaccinations. The efficacy of the new vaccine, reportedly produced by the Turkish Veterinary Institute, remains to be tested and proven. Even if matching (which remains to be established), a single, 1st vaccination might not suffice to confer satisfactory immunity level for the required duration.

Hopefully, the number of animals already "vaccinated in response to the outbreak" is bigger than the total of the odd 1240 reported to the OIE; updated information is needed.

Several points remain to be clarified:
- What is the territory already infected; in particular, how far westwards has the new virus spread so far?
- What are the registered morbidity and mortality rates in cattle?
- Has clinical disease been observed in small ruminants? If affirmative, what were the typical clinical signs and the morbidity/mortality rates?
- What has been the actual vaccination coverage with the new vaccine, so far?
- Have matching studies with the said vaccine been completed? In case affirmative, details are requested.
- How was the virus introduced? (Is the index outbreak established?)

According to the above final report, further information about this disease "will be included in the next 6-monthly reports." The next such report is due during the 1st semester of 2016; some of the issues laid out in the questions above might be required earlier by concerned regional parties and by Europe at large, which are threatened by FMDV-A topotype Asia, genotype VII. - Mod.AS
