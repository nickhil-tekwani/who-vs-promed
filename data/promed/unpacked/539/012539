A former meatpacker in Nebraska has the same neurological condition
that has struck workers at pork processing plants in Minnesota and
Indiana, and that sparked a nationwide disease investigation in November 2007.

The Nebraska case is the 1st in that state. Like the other workers,
the Nebraska meatpacker, who has not been identified, worked at a
processing plant that uses a high pressure air system to remove
brains from pigs, Nebraska health officials said.

The newest case brings the total number of workers known to be
affected to 14. Officials say that as the investigation continues to
look into past workers at all 3 plants, they expect to find more cases.

Those affected have reported fatigue, numbness and tingling in their
arms and legs with a wide range of severity. Some have recovered and
returned to work, while others are severely disabled. Officials are
calling the condition progressive inflammatory neuropathy, or PIN.

Most of those affected worked at Quality Pork Processors in Austin,
MN, where the condition was 1st recognized, and 2 have been
identified in Indiana.

Nebraska officials declined to say which plant employed the
meatpacker, but the only plant in the state that uses the high
compression system is owned by Hormel Foods, based in Austin.

State and federal health officials are looking into whether pig brain
tissue, liquefied during removal by the air-compression system and
sprayed into the air as droplets, somehow caused nerve damage in
workers who were exposed to it. The brains are frozen in boxes and
shipped to the southern USA and Asia, where they are sold as food.
All 3 plants stopped using the air compression system when the
investigation began.

Investigators theorize that a protein or other substance from the
animal brains triggered the workers' immune systems into mistakenly
attacking their own nerve tissue.

[No clinical details are given regarding the Nebraska case but it is
not surprising that aggressive surveillance might find cases related
to the Nebraska plant. We await definitive information regarding the
pathophysiology of this process. - Mod. LL]
