In the previous account, it was stated that "[the patient was not
vaccinated for JE and is presumed not to have traveled outside Manila, so
vaccination was not recommended." By whom this non-recommendation was made
was not stated. This may be misconstrued to imply that current published
recommendations weigh-in against JE vaccination of travelers to Manila.
According to the current ACIP recommendations*, however, JE is presumed to
be endemic on all of the Philippine Islands and outbreaks have been
described in Manila itself. Furthermore, the transmission season for JE
virus in Manila is assumed to be year-round with the greatest risk
occurring in April-January. Therefore, based on the current ACIP
recommendations, health care providers in the U. S. are encouraged to
consider JE vaccination of any traveler whose itinerary includes Manila.
Ultimately, the decision to vaccinate or not should be made after weighing
such factors as the planned duration of stay, planned activities (a person
staying exclusively in a modern, downtown, air-conditioned hotel would be
at lower risk than a person planning excursions to suburban or rural
areas), other stops on the itinerary, and relative medical
contraindications to vaccination. There are no simple algorithms or
hard-and-fast rules or recommendations. JE can be a terrible disease and
the vaccine can be highly effective, but JE cases in travelers are very
rare and the vaccine is associated with a relatively high risk of allergic
side-effects. Therefore, a decision on whether or not to vaccinate against
JE should be made on a traveler-by-traveler basis and depends heavily on
clinical judgment.

[Thanks to Roy Campbell for the clarification and further information. This
patient is quite ill with what may very well have been a preventable
disease. Not having seen any data regarding diagnosis, I cannot say with
certainty that the patient is suffering from Japanese encephalitis, but
that is the way it appears. - Mod.CHC
