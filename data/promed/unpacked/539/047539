Connecticut Woman Has Inhalation Anthrax
----------------------------------------
An elderly woman who lives on her own in the farm country of southwestern
Connecticut has inhalation anthrax, according to initial test results
disclosed Tuesday. The patient, who is in her 90s, was hospitalized in
serious condition, Gov. John Rowland said. He said more test results were
pending and there was no indication of a criminal act.
The woman tested positive for the inhaled form of the disease in 5 separate
tests conducted by the Department of Public Health and Griffin Hospital in
Derby, Rowland said. More tests were being conducted by experts at the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Results are
expected Wednesday. "Testing by the CDC could prove negative," Rowland said.
He said the woman lives in Oxford, a small rural community about 30 miles
southwest of Hartford. She was originally treated for pneumonia and
admitted to the Derby hospital last Wednesday.
"It's difficult to explain how the person contracted anthrax," Rowland
said. "There is no evidence they contracted the disease as a result of a
criminal act."
The FBI and state police have secured the woman's home and are conducting a
criminal investigation, Rowland said. The woman lives by herself and has a
limited routine. Joxel Garcia, the state health commissioner, said the
state received positive tests from the hospital Monday and immediately
began conducting its own investigation. Rowland said there was no
indication the woman is related to any government official or had any
public activity that would cause her to be a target of terrorism.
"I continue to say that Connecticut has never been a (target) of attack
from any terrorist," Rowland said. ``We still can't determine it's a
terrorist attack. It could be an accident."
Still, Derby Mayor Marc Garofalo said the city sent its emergency response
team to the hospital immediately after he learned of the case Tuesday
evening. "We want to assure the public that the city and all its resources
are standing by," he said.

Anthrax suspected in elderly Connecticut patient
------------------------------------------------
Governor Rowland said the woman lives alone in her home in Oxford, about 10
miles west of New Haven. She seldom left the house and has no known
connection with the U.S. Postal Service. He described the woman as "a
patient who happens to be in her 90s, limited exposure in terms of
traveling, limited routine; so we're a little bit disturbed as to how this
could have happened."
"We thought it could have been natural anthrax, but that (occurs) only
through contact. This is inhaled anthrax, so that rules out natural
contact. So we really have no other leads at this point," he said.
The woman was admitted to Griffin Hospital last Wednesday with symptoms of
pneumonia, Rowland said. Three tests done at both the hospital in Derby and
in state health labs have indicated anthrax, the governor said. Clinical
samples are being flown to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta. Further results could come as early as Wednesday afternoon,
Rowland said. CDC investigators will also go to Derby and Oxford.
Rowland also said the woman's house has been secured and that FBI, state
police and health officials will do a preliminary examination of the house,
plan to retrace the woman's recent movements, and will interview her family.

Rowland said the woman lives in Oxford, a rural community of about 9800
people 30 miles southwest of Hartford. She was originally treated for
pneumonia and admitted Friday to the Derby hospital after being brought in
by a family member, said the hospital's president, Patrick Charmel.

Further Washington contamination found
--------------------------------------
Meanwhile, trace amounts of anthrax were found in the offices of Sens. Ted
Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, and Christopher Dodd, D-Connecticut, both located
in the Russell building where the letter to Leahy was addressed.
Investigators believe these traces -- the first time the substance has been
found in the Russell building -- are the result of cross contamination with
a tainted letter. Dodd said the trace spores were found after testing in
the building last weekend.
