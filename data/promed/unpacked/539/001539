----------------------------------------------------------------------
In [the posting] Moderator TG states that "...In the past, penguins
have died of malaria, influenza, and starvation. - Mod.TG"

I would also add to this list, avian cholera [_Pasteurella
multocida_], the largest outbreak being a die-off of 500-700
chinstrap penguins [_Pygoscelis antarctica_] on South Georgia
[island, British Overseas Territory] attributed to avian cholera in late 2004.

Then Moderator JW adds:
"...and of Newcastle disease picked up from chicken bones thrown out
with the garbage from thoughtless Antarctic research stations."

This is not true. There are no confirmed deaths of wild Antarctic
penguins from Newcastle disease. A few studies have isolated
Newcastle virus and several other studies have found antibodies, but
no deaths from Newcastle have been reported in Antarctic penguins
outside of captivity. And certainly no study has demonstrated that
any of the viruses in Antarctic birds have come through poorly
disposed of chicken bones. I write because I feel it is important
that we not present misinformation.

[ProMED-mail regrets the error, and I thank Gary for correcting it.
ProMED somehow missed the avian cholera in 2004, but has posted
reports of outbreaks in penguins due to a variety of different
infections, including avian pox, chlamydiosis, Corynebacterium, and
infectious bursal disease, nearly every year in the past -- see below.

Photos of chinstrap penguins [_Pygoscelis antarctica_] are available at
