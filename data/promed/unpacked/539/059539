My friends are giving me a hard time about my promotion to Director of the
PHLS!
The issue of public disclosure is extremely important, and handling it
sensitively is going to be crucial to the attempt to build effective
international surveillance systems.
There is an ideal to move towards, which is the open disclosure of
information to an informed public.
However in the last few years of building international surveillance
schemes within Europe we have learned that different countries have
different cultures, customs, prejudices, laws ... which mean that they take
different stances over the issue of placing information in the public
domain. Developing effective international surveillance systems has meant
taking this into account and developing clear "rules of engagement" for
collaborations. These may on occasion restrict the ability of partners in a
collaboration to place information in the public domain. This approach
helps build confidence, and over time leads to more information being made
available. Indeed this approach has lead to data sharing and the
identification of events leading to effective public health action which
might not have happened if participants thought that all the information
would have been made public.
I applaud the attempts of ProMED to increase openness in the international
surveillance of communicable disease. However I also recognise that
"failure" to report the name of a country may not be dereliction of duty,
but may well be a consequence of the need to build trust and win minds to
new ways of working. Imposing one social viewpoint of the "right" way to
act may not be beneficial in the long run.
This does not translate into support for "denying that they have endemic
cholera, rather than upgrading the water supply to their food processing
plants to avoid contaminating the products"
As for raw shell eggs - my Swedish friends say theirs are safe - but I
think I would still stick to simple advice "avoid them" for our
hypothetical tourist.
