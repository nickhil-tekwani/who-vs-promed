In the post on ricin made 22 Mar 14 (ProMED-mail post 20140322.2348185), the moderator made a comment speculating whether the 2 cases were related, and if the men arrested for making ricin had any contact with one another. I would like to point out that ricin was a major plot point in the TV series Breaking Bad (popular with that age group), with the main character manufacturing it from castor beans, and the show bringing ricin into the spotlight is a possible connection between the 2 cases.

[As far as I can discover on the internet, the final episode of the final series (Series 5) of that show aired in September last year (2013). I can't find anything about reruns this year. Are you suggesting both cases are related to something they saw last year? Bit of a coincidence, that? - Mod.JW]

September isn't that far away, really. There's also the time it takes to find the castor beans and make the ricin, and how long ago the break up was for the guy who tried to poison his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. In both cases it's not known when they started making ricin; it sounds like they both made significant quantities, so it may have taken them a while, maybe waiting for the right opportunity to use their "untraceable poison" on someone.

In this article, a friend of the 2nd ricin maker notes that he [the perpetrator] was a fan of Breaking Bad: http://wamu.org/news/14/03/21/georgetown_student_arrested_for_ricin_possession.

I believe ricin was used in multiple seasons of Breaking Bad. It's more likely than them knowing each other on Twitter, at least.

[The TV program has garnered enormous followings. With the prevalence of social media, it is possible these 2 perpetrators did know each other. As life often imitates art, it is also possible that the ricin idea was from this show. - Mod.TG]
