------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
Since 2015, the arthropodborne viruses (arboviruses) Zika and chikungunya have spread across the Americas causing outbreaks, accompanied by increases in immune-mediated and infectious neurological disease. The spectrum of neurological manifestations linked to these viruses, and the importance of dual infection, are not known fully. We aimed to investigate whether neurological presentations differed according to the infecting arbovirus and whether patients with dual infection had a different disease spectrum or severity.

Methods
We report a prospective observational study done during epidemics of Zika and chikungunya viruses in Recife, Pernambuco, a dengue-endemic area of Brazil. We recruited adults aged 18 years or older referred to Hospital da Restauracao, a secondary-level and tertiary-level hospital, with suspected acute neurological disease and a history of suspected arboviral infection. We looked for evidence of Zika, chikungunya, or dengue infection by viral RNA or specific IgM antibodies in serum or CSF. We grouped patients according to their arbovirus laboratory diagnosis and then compared demographic and clinical characteristics.

Findings
Between 4 Dec 2014 and 4 Dec 2016, 1410 patients were admitted to the hospital neurology service; 201 (14%) had symptoms consistent with arbovirus infection and sufficient samples for diagnostic testing and were included in the study. The median age was 48 years (interquartile range 34-60), and 106 (53%) were women. 148 (74%) of 201 patients had laboratory evidence of arboviral infection. 98 (49%) of them had a single viral infection (41 [20%] had Zika, 55 [27%] had chikungunya, and 2 [1%] had dengue infection), whereas 50 (25%) had evidence of dual infection, mostly with Zika and chikungunya viruses (46 [23%] patients). Patients positive for arbovirus infection presented with a broad range of CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) disease. Chikungunya infection was more often associated with CNS disease (26 [47%] of 55 patients with chikungunya infection vs 6 [15%] of 41 with Zika infection; p=0.0008), especially myelitis (12 [22%] patients). Zika infection was more often associated with PNS disease (26 [63%] of 41 patients with Zika infection vs 9 [16%] of 55 with chikungunya infection; p less than or equal to 0.0001), particularly Guillain-Barre syndrome (25 [61%] patients). Patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome who had Zika and chikungunya dual infection had a more aggressive disease requiring intensive care support and longer hospital stays than those with mono-infection (median 24 days [IQR 20-30] vs 17 days [10-20]; p=0.0028); 8 (17%) of 46 patients with Zika and chikungunya dual infection had a stroke or transient ischaemic attack, compared with 5 (6%) of 96 patients with Zika or chikungunya mono-infection (p=0.047).

Interpretation
There is a wide and overlapping spectrum of neurological manifestations caused by Zika or chikungunya mono-infection and by dual infections. The possible increased risk of acute cerebrovascular disease in patients with dual infection merits further investigation.

[This report suggests that patients with neurological disease during a chikungunya virus outbreak should be tested for infection by that virus with or without a dengue virus coinfection. As the authors state, the possible increased risk of acute cerebrovascular disease in patients with dual infection merits further investigation. - Mod.TY

Lima STS, Souza WM, Cavalcante JW, et al. Fatal outcome of chikungunya virus infection in Brazil. Clin Infect Dis. 2020 Aug 7: ciaa1038. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa1038. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 32766829.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerged in the Americas in 2013 and has caused approximately 2.1 million cases and more than 600 deaths. A retrospective investigation was undertaken to describe clinical, epidemiological, and viral genomic features associated with deaths caused by CHIKV in Ceara state, northeast Brazil.

Methods
Sera, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue samples from 100 fatal cases with suspected arbovirus infection were tested for CHIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Clinical, epidemiological, and death reports were obtained for patients with confirmed CHIKV infection. Logistic regression analysis was undertaken to identify independent factors associated with risk of death during CHIKV infection. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using whole genomes from a subset of cases.

Results
There were 68 fatal cases with CHIKV infection confirmed by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (52.9%), viral antigen (41.1%), and/or specific immunoglobulin M (63.2%). Co-detection of CHIKV with DENV was found in 22% of fatal cases, ZIKV in 2.9%, and DENV and ZIKV in 1.5%. A total of 39 CHIKV deaths presented with neurological signs and symptoms and CHIKV-RNA was found in the CSF of 92.3% of these patients. Fatal outcomes were associated with irreversible multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Patients with diabetes appear to die at a higher frequency during the subacute phase. Genetic analysis showed circulation of 2 CHIKV East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineages in Ceara and revealed no unique virus genomic mutation associated with fatal outcome.

Conclusions
The investigation of the largest cross-sectional cohort of CHIKV deaths to date reveals that CHIKV-ECSA strains can cause death in individuals from both risk and non-risk groups, including young adults.

[The report rules out a more virulent chikungunya virus as the cause of the fatalities. Underlying comorbidities such as diabetes found to be contributory to some of the fatal outcomes of the cases they studied. Clearly, chikungunya virus infections can be more serious than just a febrile disease with arthralgia. - Mod.TY]

[4] Reproduction number for aedes mosquitoes

ref: Haider N, Vairo F, Ippolito G, Zumla A, Kock RA. Basic reproduction number of chikungunya virus transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Emerg Infect Dis. 2020; 26(10): 2429-2431. doi: 10.3201/eid2610.190957
--------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We estimated the weighted mean basic reproduction number (R0) of chikungunya virus based on outbreak size. R0 was 3.4 (95% CI 2.4-4.2) and varied for 2 primary chikungunya mosquito vectors: 4.1 (95% CI 1.5-6.6) for _Aedes aegypti_ and 2.8 (95% CI 1.8-3.8) for _Ae. albopictus_.

Conclusions
-----------
We found the overall mean R0 for CHIKV was 3.4 (95% CI 2.4-4.2). Our estimated R0 of 4.1 (95% CI 1.5-6.6) for _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes suggests CHIKV could spread rapidly and cause high disease incidence in urban areas, where this species thrives. Our estimated CHIKV R0 for _Ae. albopictus _mosquitoes of 2.8 (95% CI 1.5-6.6) was lower than for _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes. In rural areas, where _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes are more prevalent, sylvatic cycles, maintenance of biodiversity including natural mosquito populations, and presence of hosts other than humans might reduce the effects of an outbreak. Early interventions targeting aedes mosquitoes will be vital to controlling CHIKV outbreaks.

[One hopes that the current attempts to control _Aedes aegypti_ populations by genetic manipulation and release of sterile males and reduction of virus transmission efficiency by blockage of mid-gut infection with wolbachia bacteria can be applied successful over large areas with a reduction in transmission of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study in December 2015 included 1305 homes in 8 urban clusters considered representative of Acapulco in southern Mexico. Administered questionnaires collated information on 5870 individuals, including sociodemographic variables, a history of chronic conditions, and the self-reporting of chikungunya. Bivariate and multivariate analyses relied on a cluster-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel procedure to identify the factors associated with chikungunya and its relapse.

Results
Some 66% (3531/5870) of the population reported suffering chikungunya and 31.1% (1098/3531) reported a relapse. Factors associated with relapse included the severity of the chikungunya case (odds ratio [OR]: 3.35; clusters adjusted 95% confidence interval [95% CIca]: 3.16-3.55); history of arthralgia (OR: 2.96; 95% CIca: 2.27-3.86); age 30 years or older (OR: 1.85; 95% CIca: 1.72-1.98); female (OR: 1.64; 95% CIca: 1.42-1.90); and higher education households (OR: 1.18; 95% CIca: 1.11-1.27).

Conclusions
The high occurrence of chikungunya and its relapse are a public health problem. The factors associated with relapse do not immediately suggest specific prevention strategies but emphasize the dire need for effective approaches to vector control.

[In this study, relapse is defined as a reported recurrence of chikungunya symptoms (joint pain and inflammation) after 1 month having recovered from the disease. The chronic arthralgia following acute febrile chikungunya virus infection can persists for weeks to even years. This condition can be incapacitating making work and normal activities difficult to impossible. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine available to prevent infection so avoidance of mosquito bites and vector mosquito control are the only practical measures for prevention of infection. - Mod.TY
