The number of confirmed cases of Ross River virus rose in Queensland this year [2015], and health workers are reminding the public to be aware of the risk of mosquito-borne diseases.

Dr Margaret Young, Director of Queensland Health's Wide Bay public health unit, said there had been an increase in Ross River virus notifications across the state this year [2015]. "These diseases do fluctuate from year to year. They have a seasonal pattern with most infections occurring over the summer and early-autumn period, which aligns with rainfall and mosquito breeding conditions," Dr Young said.

The Wide Bay region, which takes in southern Queensland cities and towns including Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, as well as west to Gayndah and Monto, had 185 confirmed cases of Ross River virus [infections] in 2015, compared to 149 in 2014. "In other parts of Queensland, they've noticed a stronger increase," Dr Young said.

These figures only include cases which have been confirmed by blood tests, and Dr Young said it was unclear whether the figures reflected a true increase in disease rates or whether increased testing was picking up cases that would previously not have been recorded.

With the storm season already here and the wet season on its way, mosquito numbers are expected to take off, and with them the incidence of diseases such as Ross River and Barmah Forest virus.

"At the moment, laboratory-notified infections of mosquito-borne diseases are low, but we expect to see them start increasing as we come into the summer months," Dr Young said.

Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for either virus.
While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet.

[Ross River virus (RRV) infections occur sporadically across Australia. The summer-autumn period has been a very active year (2015) for RRV transmission, with 6404 cases reported as of 25 Apr 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20150426.3322934). Especially hard hit has been Queensland state, where cases have been mounting, approaching 4000 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20150328.3262332) and then reached 4645 cases. Subsequent onset of cooler weather slowed transmission of the virus, but, as noted above, arrival of rains is expected to increase transmission of the virus again.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring.
