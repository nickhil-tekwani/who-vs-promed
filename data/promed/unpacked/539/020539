Toxic Alocasia, 11 people got food poisoning
--------------------------------------------
The prefectural government announced on 4 Oct 2022 that 11 men and women in their 40's and 60's in the jurisdiction of the central public health center, including Usuki City, had food poisoning after eating poisonous alocasia stems. The patient complained of pain in the mouth and tongue, and there were no serious cases. A farmer in the same city mistakenly shipped them as a juniper (Tenjiku).

[Many, if not all, plants in the grouping Alocasia contain oxalate crystals. Oxalate crystals in plants are shaped like a long fine needle, and very pointed on each end. They are microscopic. When this plant is bitten into the oxalate crystals are shot out of their cell and into the mouth of the victim. These microscopic sharp needle structures result in pain and often numbness. This may result in the person having slurred speech. This sudden pain can cause patients to vomit, especially if these needle-like projections reach the back of the throat. Depending upon the amount consumed, it can take from several hours, to a day or 2 for the numbness and possible nausea/ vomiting and slurred speech to subside. Generally most patients recover uneventfully. - Mod.TG
