1st Report of Tomato chlorosis virus and Tomato infectious chlorosis virus in
Tomato Crops in France

1243C. Accepted for publication 11 Aug 2005.

Since 2002, yellowing symptoms associated with high levels of whitefly
populations have been observed in plants of protected tomato crops in France.
Symptomatic plants exhibited interveinal yellowing areas in older leaves,
followed by generalized yellowing. Symptoms were not observed in young plants
or fruits. _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_ populations were generally abundant in
spring, and _Bemisia tabaci_ (established in France for approximately 10
years) became predominant in summer and fall.
To check for the presence of Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) and Tomato
infectious chlorosis virus (TICV), 2 whitefly-transmitted criniviruses known
to induce yellowing symptoms, 696 samples were collected in the major tomato-
growing areas; 573 samples from southern France and 123 samples from northern
France. Total RNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed using reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Primers specific to ToCV (2)
and TICV (1,3) were used to amplify either part of the heat-shock-like protein
gene HSP70h (both viruses) or part of the diverged coat protein gene (CPd),
(TICV only).
A 439-bp DNA fragment was obtained with ToCV primers in 178 samples from
southern France collected mainly from mid-spring to early fall from 2002 to
2004. 3 RT-PCR products amplified from samples collected from diverse growing
areas were sequenced and showed 99-100 percent sequence identity with
published ToCV sequences from Spain (GenBank Accession Nos. AF215818,
AF233435, and AF215817), Portugal (GenBank Accession No. AF234029), Sicily
(GenBank Accession No. AY048854), and the United States (GenBank Accession No.
AF024630).
Considering the high frequency of ToCV-infected samples (41 positive samples
of 112 samples collected in 2002, 71 of 295 collected in 2003, and 66 of 166
collected in 2004), this virus appears to be well established in southern
France but remains absent in the northern regions. The presence of TICV was
tested in 485 samples using the CPd-specific primers or the HSP70h-specific
primers. The virus was detected in only 2 samples from Nice (southeastern
France) in 2003 with both primer pairs. The CPd DNA fragment (700 bp) from one
of these samples was sequenced, showing 98.9 percent sequence identity with a
TICV Japanese isolate (AB085603).
Results of these assays suggest that in contrast to ToCV, TICV is not yet
broadly established in France. This difference could be associated with the
specificity of the vectors, since ToCV is transmitted by _B. tabaci_ and _T.
vaporariorum_, while TICV is transmitted only by _T. vaporariorum_ (4).

[Criniviruses are an emerging genus worldwide, containing new species that
have evolved over time and are now evident as causal agents of new plant
diseases. Their symptoms are easily mistaken for those of physiological or
nutritional disorders or pesticide phytotoxicity, thus confounding their
identification. Symptoms can vary, depending upon the host species, to
include interveinal leaf yellowing, loss of photosynthetic capability, leaf
brittleness, reduced plant vigor, yield reductions and early senescence.
Criniviruses remain confined to cells associated with the plant phloem and
symptoms are considered to result from plugging of the phloem with large viral
inclusion bodies, thus likely interfering with normal vascular transport in
infected plants. Both TICV and ToCV were first reported during the 1990s in
the United States, and ToCV has been reported to occur in the Mediterranean
countries, Portugal, Spain, and Italy
4 crinivirus species transmitted by greenhouse white fly (GHWF) have been
identified to date, including Beet pseudo yellows virus (BPYV), Strawberry
pallidosis-associated virus (SPaV), ToCV and TICV. The latter viruses have
exerted significant pressure on vegetable and fruit production in North
America, Europe, and other parts of the world, affecting both greenhouse-grown
crops as well as field crops.
3 viruses, primarily BPYV, SPaV, and TICV, are transmitted exclusively by
GHWF, and are currently responsible for economic damage to vegetable and fruit
production. Although ToCV is transmitted by the GHWF and impacts tomato
production, it is much more efficiently transmitted by _B. tabaci_ [Bt]
biotype B than by GHWF, and its incidence is associated more closely with the
presence of Bt in fields and greenhouses than with GHWF. These criniviruses
have host ranges of varying size, ranging from quite narrow in the case of
SPaV, to extremely broad in the case of BPYV. Although all GHWF-transmitted
criniviruses infect weed species and wild relatives of cultivated crops, their
primary agricultural impact occurs on 3 major groups of crops. Thus TICV and
ToCV exert their main economic impact on tomato production in both greenhouse
and field settings. SPaV is a problem in strawberry; BPYV, with its extensive
host range, infects numerous cucurbit species, as well as strawberry and blac!
kberry.
Disease management is straightforward; use of virus-free transplants,
avoidance of susceptible hosts, especially weeds, roguing of infected plants,
and control of insects by chemical insecticides.
