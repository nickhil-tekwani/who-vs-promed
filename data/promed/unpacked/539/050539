Authorities in Japan have confirmed that the earlier outbreak of bird
flu on a layer farm was caused by the H5N1 sub-type of the highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus.

The veterinary authorities sent an immediate notification last week
to the World Organisation for Animal Health [see comment].

The report confirms that the outbreak of bird flu at a layer farm at
Yasugi city in Shimane prefecture in the southwest of Honshu was
caused by the H5N1 HPAI virus. The outbreak started on 27 Nov 2010.
In total, 57 birds died, but the remaining 21 549 layers have been destroyed.

According to the report, the outbreak of HPAI was confirmed on 2 Dec
2010 in Shimane prefecture. The previous outbreak of HPAI in Japan
started in April 2008.

The event has been contained in the affected farm by control measures
including stamping-out and movement restrictions.
