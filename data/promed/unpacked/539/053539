A 49-year-old Grand County woman has become the sixth person in Colorado
stricken by the hantavirus this year, the state's highest number in a
single year since the potentially deadly virus was identified in 1993. The
latest victim is in good condition at the University of Colorado Hospital.
The high number has state health officials thinking about new ways to
prevent people from being exposed to the virus.
"Previously, we were emphasizing safe ways to clean up when you discovered
a mouse nest or infestation," such as using some diluted bleach or
disinfectant, said Dr. Richard Hoffman, state epidemiologist. Sweeping or
vacuuming a mouse nest seems to kick up the dust and increase risk, he
said. The virus is carried by deer mice and occurs primarily in rural areas
of the West. Those cleanup methods are still valid. But Hoffman said that
in the most recent cases, the virus may have been transmitted when humans
scared mice. The frightened mice tend to urinate, which causes the virus to
become airborne.
To guard against that kind of exposure, Hoffman recommends trying to reduce
the number of mice, either through poison or traps, and airing out barns or
sheds before going into them. He also suggests wearing a mask when cleaning
or entering a building that has been closed up for a while.
He said investigators aren't sure how the Grand County woman became
exposed. "She did have activities that took her into a barn, but she also
had a cat that brought a live mouse into the house. And I'm sure that mouse
was scared." Two of the six who have contracted hantavirus in Colorado this
year have died.
There is a test to identify the virus, but because its early symptoms are
so common - fever, backaches and muscle aches - the disease often
progresses before a doctor prescribes the test. There is no specific
treatment for hantavirus, Hoffman said. "Like a lot of viruses, it runs its
course," he said. Thirteen of the 26 people known to have contracted the
disease in Colorado have died from it.

[The inferences regarding hantaviruses being aerosolized are unproven, as
far as I know, but they are innovative. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that
infected mice produce a shroud or large cloud of virus when they urinate.
Possible though; viruses are very small. Citing "hantavirus", Dr. Hoffman
is utilizing the incorrect but vernacular term for Sin Nombre virus.
I find it interesting that in this La Nina year Colorado has had as many
(6) recognized cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome as we had during
1993, the year this disease was first recognized during an epidemic in the
Four Corners states. - Temp. Mod. CHC

[In Hantavirus pulm. syndrome - USA (Colorado & Texas?) ProMED-mail
transcribed a newspaper report of a possible case of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome in a Texas resident and asked Texas state officials to let us know
whether this was a confirmed case or not. We have the answer from Lisa
Marengo. It was not a hantavirus infection. - Temp. Mod. CHC

Serology results run at TriCore Reference Laboratories of New Mexico for a
suspected HPS case in a patient living near Houston, Texas were negative
for [evidence of a hantavirus infection.

[I apologize to our subscribers for not having posted these messages sooner
than this. ProMED-mail has decided to post only summaries of certain
diseases, including hantaviral infections, and I had assumed more of these
would be received; there have been no more. - Temp. Mod. CHC
[When this decision was made by the staff of ProMED-mail, there had been
numerous postings on ProMED-mail during the early part of June of human
hantaviral infections. The decision was made that reports of isolated human
cases of these infections in areas that are known to be endemic would not
be reported on a case by case basis. Human cases in previously non-endemic
areas and clusters of cases that are truly potential outbreaks will be
reported as individual ProMED-mail postings. - Man. Ed. DS
