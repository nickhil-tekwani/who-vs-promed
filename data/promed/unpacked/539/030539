[With new information, it appears there is potentially a new phenotype of
atypical' BSE/TSE in animals in Japan and France. The article below
indicates a new strain of Scrapie, the 'Nor98', which also has negative IHC
and histology. Although this article does not suggest a link to the
atypical forms seen in cattle, it does seem more than coincidence that
there are also appearing different strains, or perhaps atypical strains of
scrapie as well. It has been believed for years that there is a link
between BSE and scrapie; perhaps this is another bit of research that
should be carefully examined. ­ Mod.TG]
Cases of scrapie with unusual features in Norway and designation of a new
type, Nor98.

Abstract:
5 cases of scrapie with unusual features have been diagnosed in Norway
since 1998. The affected sheep showed neurological signs dominated by
ataxia, and had the PrP genotypes homozygous A136 H154 Q171/ A136H154Q171
or heterozygous A136H154Q171/A136R154Q171, which are rarely associated with
scrapie. Brain histopathology revealed neuropil vacuolisation essentially
in the cerebellar and cerebral cortices; vacuolation was less prominent in
the brainstem, and no lesions were observed at the level of the obex. The
deposits of PrPSc were mainly in the cortex of the cerebellum and cerebrum,
and no PrPSc was detectable by immunohistochemistry or ELISA in the
lymphoid tissues investigated.
Western blot analysis showed that the glycotype was different from other
known scrapie strains and from the BSE strain. From a diagnostic point of
view, these features indicate that this type of scrapie, designated Nor98,
could have been overlooked and may be of significance for sampling in
scrapie surveillance programmes.
