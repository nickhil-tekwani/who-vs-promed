A man who flew to Dallas and was later found to have the Ebola virus was identified by senior Liberian government officials on Wed [1 Oct 2014] as ... a resident of Monrovia in his mid-40s. Mr. D., the 1st person to develop symptoms outside Africa during the current epidemic, had direct contact with a woman stricken by Ebola on 15 Sep 2014, just 4 days before he left Liberia for the United States, the woman's parents and Mr. D.'s neighbors said.

In a pattern often seen here in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, the family of the woman, MW, 19, took her by taxi to a hospital with Mr. D.'s help on 15 Sep 2014 after failing to get an ambulance, said her parents, [Mr & Mrs] Williams. She was convulsing and 7 months pregnant, they said. Turned away from a hospital for lack of space in its Ebola treatment ward, the family said it took MW back home in the evening and that she died hours later, at around 3 a.m.

Mr. D., who was a family friend and also a tenant in a house owned by the Williams family, rode in the taxi in the front passenger seat while MW, her father and her brother, SB, shared the back seat, her parents said. Mr. D. then helped carry MW, who was no longer able to walk, back to the family home that evening, neighbors said. "He was holding her by the legs; the pa was holding her arms, and SB was holding her back," said Arren Seyou, 31, who witnessed the scene and occupies the room next to Mr. D.'s. SB, 21, also started getting sick about a week ago, his family said, around the same time that Mr. D. 1st started showing symptoms [in the USA].

In a sign of how furiously the disease can spread, an ambulance had come to their house on Wed [24 Sep 2014] to pick up SB. Another ambulance picked up a woman and her daughter from the same area, and a team of body collectors came to retrieve the body of yet another woman; all 4 appeared to have been infected in a chain reaction started by MW. A few minutes after the ambulance left, the parents got a call telling them that SB had died on the way to the hospital...

The way Mr. D. appears to have been infected with the Ebola virus is typical in Monrovia, where the epidemic is spreading rapidly, and most people are dying at home because of a lack of ambulances and Ebola treatment centers. At home, they spread the virus to family and friends who are taking care of them. MW's family said they had no choice but to take her back home after being turned away from John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, 1st at its maternity ward and then at its Ebola center. While she was sick at home, she appeared to have also infected a neighbor, SS, whose corpse was picked up on Wed [24 Sep 2014]. Neighbors said that an ailing MW used to visit SS, who lived in a pink house next door. After SS fell ill, a friend of hers living nearby started coming over to take care of her. That friend, [a 2nd MW], did chores for SS, including washing her clothes.

On Wed [24 Sep 2014], a visibly ill 2nd MW was taken by ambulance to a hospital; her daughter, Mercy, 9, joined her in the ambulance, though she was not showing symptoms herself. Other neighbors, fearful of the growing contagion in their neighborhood, had insisted angrily that Mercy be taken away. While [the 1st] MW appears to have been the 1st patient in her area of the neighborhood, members of a local volunteer Ebola task force say they believe that the virus was brought in by an outsider. MW rarely left home because of her pregnancy, they said. But a cousin who came to visit MW later died of Ebola after apparently being infected by her [the cousin's or MW's?] mother, who is now in a Ebola treatment center, members of the task force said. "That's how Ebola came here," said Mark Kpoto, 21, a task force member.

[This chain of events illustrates the danger that anybody arriving from Liberia, even without symptoms on departure from there or on arrival in the USA (or anywhere else in Africa or overseas) may be incubating Ebola -- but not international volunteers who have only been in contact with Liberians while wearing adequate PPE (personal protection equipment). - Mod.JW]

[2] USA: follow up

Ebola patient told hospital he had been to Liberia
--------------------------------------------------
1 Oct 2014: (USA TODAY) A man infected with Ebola was allowed to leave the hospital last week because the results of a screening weren't shared with his healthcare team, which concluded he had a common virus and discharged him, hospital officials said Wed [1 Oct 2014]. While health experts agree that the USA is not at risk for a large Ebola epidemic like the one affecting West Africa, some doctors are concerned that the infected patient was sent home from a Dallas hospital without treatment the 1st time he sought care.

The unidentified Ebola patient, now in intensive care at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, arrived in the USA on 20 Sep 2014 without symptoms but sought care on 26 Sep 2014. He was sent home, only to return to the hospital 2 days later and be admitted. At a press conference on Wed [1 Oct 2014], hospital officials said that a triage nurse performed the recommended screening -- asking about both his symptoms and his travel history -- but her report wasn't communicated to the rest of his healthcare team. He's now in serious but stable condition, according to hospital officials http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/01/hospital-ebola-patient/16527143.

US Ebola patient said he was from Liberia
----------------------------------------------
1 Oct 2014: (WFAA) Three Dallas Fire-Rescue paramedics and several emergency room workers at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital are off work and under observation after making contact with the patient being treated for Ebola... Tuesday night [30 Sep 2014], the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] flew in a team of 10 Ebola experts to help local officials and the hospital staff...

Dallas Fire-Rescue told News 8 that the paramedics who treated the man put on gloves and a mask after the patient exhibited possible signs of a communicable disease. "The patient did exhibit high fever, nausea, vomiting, GI [gastro-intestinal] issues along those lines," said Assistant Chief Norman Seals. Those 3 Dallas paramedics are under observation for at least 3 weeks. That's the maximum amount of time, the CDC said, for Ebola symptoms to develop. "I spoke to all 3 medics personally this evening [1 Oct 2014]. They seem relaxed," Seals said. "They didn't have a lot of concern at this time, and were kind of getting a little tickled [pleased] with the hype coming with this. They seem perfectly at ease." While doctors at Presbyterian treat the patient, the CDC and Dallas County health officials will begin a "contact investigation," which requires interviewing everyone the patient contacted. Dallas County Health Director Zachary Thompson said that includes 4 or 5 children, several adults, and the emergency medical personnel, about a dozen people in all. "What we're hearing is that the individual was a traveler," Thompson said. "Then, we're hearing they might live here. All this has to be flushed out in this contact investigation." Thompson maintained that this is a manageable health situation http://wfaa.mlnwap.com/article.html#!/11687/5c45f95ba728a850a4825fe8783403df.

5 Dallas ISD students at 4 schools may have had contact
----------------------------------------
1 Oct 2014: (Dallas News) 5 Dallas ISD [Dallas Independent School District] students at 4 schools [2 elementary, a middle and a highschool] may have had contact with the Ebola patient in Dallas and stayed home from school as a precaution, according to a district email sent to employees today [1 Oct 2014]... The schools are in the Vickery Meadow area in northeast Dallas, where many refugee families and other immigrants have settled in apartments... - more

[3] WHO: Ebola virus disease - United States of America
Date: 1 Oct 2014

http://www.who.int/csr/don/01-october-2014-ebola/en


On 30 Sep 2014, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) was informed of the 1st confirmed imported case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the United States.

The case is an adult with recent travel history to West Africa who developed symptoms compatible with Ebola on 24 Sep 2014, approximately 4 days after arriving in the United States on 20 Sep 2014. The patient did not have symptoms when leaving West Africa. The case sought medical care on 26 Sep 2014 and was admitted into isolation on 28 Sep 2014 at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.

Samples were sent for testing to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia and at the Texas state laboratory. Results were positive for ebolavirus.

Identification of close contacts for further daily monitoring for 21 days after exposure is underway. Given that the case did not exhibit symptoms of Ebola during the flights from West Africa, contact tracing of people on the same commercial airline flights is not indicated.

***PLEASE NOTE: Future WHO updates on EVD in the United States will not be posted on the Disease Outbreak News. Further information will be available in WHO's Ebola Situation Reports, which provide regular updates on the WHO response http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied by countries except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.

Temporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee with regard to actions to be taken by countries can be found at:
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en and at

IHR Emergency Committee on Ebola outbreak in West Africa http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en.
