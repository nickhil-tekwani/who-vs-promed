The Oklahoma _E. coli_ [O111] outbreak continues to get worse as the
total number of cases is now near 300. Oklahoma state health
officials increased the number of confirmed cases this past weekend
to 291. This marks a huge spike in the number of cases, as well under
250 were reported just days ago.

The outbreak has been linked to those who ate at the Country Cottage
restaurant in Locust Grove, OK. Out of the 291 sickened by the _E.
coli_ outbreak, 227 are adults while 46 are children. So far, around
70 people or so have had to be hospitalized. One person, a young man, has died.
