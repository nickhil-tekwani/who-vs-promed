Thai government to draw up bird flu vaccine trial plans
---------------------------------------------------
Thai government officials are to meet next week to determine the zones for
avian flu vaccine trials, the Director of the government's avian flu
operation centre, Dr. Charal Trinvuthipong, revealed on Friday [24 Dec 2004].
Dr. Charal was quoted by the Thai News Agency as saying Saturday that the
meeting on 27 Dec 2004 would select zones which had been affected by the
bird flu pandemic, but said that the government had not yet decided which
provinces it would choose.
He said the test would be conducted in areas where outbreaks of the bird
flu occurred earlier this year.
He also revealed that government study tours to Vietnam and China had shown
that several practices to stamp out avian flu used in those 2 countries
could be adapted for use in Thailand.
Dismissing foreign media accusations of a cover-up in Thailand, he said
that Thailand's image as a country where the pandemic was rife was largely
a result of the government's widespread and open reporting.

[By opting for geographically-restricted vaccination trials, the Thai
authorities might be attempting to regionalise the disease. This means that
if accepted by the importing countries, Thailand might be allowed to
continue exporting from disease-free, non-vaccinating areas.
The decision falls in line with the recent views of OIE/WHO/FAO, which
published updated recommendations at the end of Nov 2004 (see
20041111.3046). The document included the following statement:
"Such control needs to consider all suitable measures ranging from the safe
and swift elimination of affected poultry, through strict biosecurity,
movement and market control and if relevant, to vaccination and its close
monitoring".
We shall be grateful to receive additional information, especially
regarding the areas selected and the type of vaccine to be used. The Thai
authorities might decide to use a DIVA (Differentiating Infected from
Vaccinated Animals) vaccine, such as H5N2 -- similar to that used by China
and, probably, by Indonesia. - Mod.AS]
