Officials are investigating a possible link between seeds sold by a
UK firm and an outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ infection in France.
News agency AFP [AFP is a global news agency] said 10 people have been
affected by _E. coli_ in Bordeaux. It is thought a number of them had
eaten rocket and mustard vegetable sprouts, which are believed to have
been grown from seeds sold by Thompson and Morgan.

The Ipswich [United Kingdom]-based company told the BBC it had no
evidence of a link. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said no _E. coli_
cases had been reported in the UK. However, it has revised its
guidance and is advising people not to eat raw sprouted seeds,
including alfalfa, mung beans (or bean sprouts), and fenugreek. The
agency said these should only be eaten if cooked until steaming hot
throughout.

A spokeswoman for Thompson and Morgan said the company sold "hundreds
of thousands of packets of these seeds" throughout France, the UK and
other parts of Europe every year. "We are very confident the problem
is not with our seeds. People can still grow these seeds and use these
seeds with absolute confidence," she said. "For such a small number of
people to have been affected, it does suggest that the problem is
perhaps in the local area, how the seeds have been handled or how they
have been grown, rather than the actual seeds themselves." The company
was co-operating fully with investigations, she added. Paul Hansord,
the company's managing director, said: "We make sure that everything
we do is to a high standard." He said the firm bought its seeds in
bulk from suppliers around the world. The affected seeds may have been
sourced from Italy. Thompson and Morgan also said they did not raise
any seeds, instead selling packets via mail order to gardeners.

Seven of those affected by the _E. coli_ outbreak, who ate the
sprouts at a country fair at Begles near Bordeaux, needed hospital
treatment. Helen Johns of Thompson and Morgan said: "It does suggest
the problem is in the local area."

Food Standards Agency [FSA] advice:
- do not eat sprouted seeds such as alfalfa, mung beans (or
beansprouts) and fenugreek raw
- cook sprouted seeds until steaming hot throughout
- clean equipment that has been used for sprouting seeds
- wash hands after handling seeds intended for planting or sprouting

The FSA says it is asking the company for more information about the
seeds.

There is no suggestion of a link to the German _E. coli_ outbreak,
which came from bean sprouts grown on an organic farm, but 2 people
are said to be infected with a similar strain.

Frederic Lefebvre, France's secretary of state for consumer affairs,
was quoted by AFP recommending "consumers who bought these same
products not use them." [However], Mr Lefebvre added: "The link
between the symptoms and eating of the sprouts so far has not been
definitively established."

Three seed types are involved: mustard, rocket [rocket is a plant
used as an herb http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si] and fenugreek
[fenugreek is used both as a herb (the leaves) and as a spice (the
seed) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenugreek]. Thompson and Morgan
have provided samples of these seeds to investigators in the UK. An
FSA spokesman told the BBC: "We have been in contact with the French
authorities about this outbreak and are aware that a UK business has
been named in connection with it. No cases of food poisoning have been
reported in the UK linked with the outbreak in France, but we are in
close contact with the Health Protection Agency. We have asked for
further information from the French authorities with regard to the 3
named types of seeds to help us carry out investigations in the UK."

Germinated seeds sprinkled on soups at a fair [in Bordeaux, France]
appear to be at the root of most of the 10 cases of probable infection
with _E. coli_ near Bordeaux. Bacteriological examinations conducted
by the National Reference Centre showed in 2 patients the presence of
a bacterial strain O104, [similar to that which killed 40 people in
Germany, health officials said]. But the seeds [involved in the latter
outbreak] came from the German operation to Gartnerhof Bienenbuttel,
in northern Germany, now closed.

Those seeds involved in the outbreak at the fair in Bordeaux,
according to the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs
and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), were fenugreek, mustard and arugula seeds
that were purchased at Jardiland [a garden supply store] and supplied
by a British company Thompson & Morgan, based in Ipswich (UK).
[However], the secretary of state for consumer affairs, Frederic
Lefebvre insisted that "the link between symptoms and the consumption
of these seeds is not definitively established to date." Pending the
results, however, the secretary of state has requested the suspension
of the marketing of seeds from this supplier.

Two new cases near Bordeaux were reported on Friday [24 Jun 2011]. In
all, 7 people were hospitalized in the evening, 5 of whom had HUS
[hemolytic uremic syndrome] (renal complications), but were in stable
condition, and 2 less seriously ill. Two other people were able to
return home. A 10th has never had to be hospitalized.

The survey revealed 8 "case clusters"[?], 6 women and 2 men aged 31
to 78 years old, from [the] Bordeaux [suburb of ] Begles or [the]
neighborhood [of] adjoining Nansouty. Seven attended the same fair on
8 Jun 2011 at the Recreation Center Early Childhood (CLPE) of
Bordeaux, and at least 6 had gazpacho decorated with sprouted seeds.

The deputy mayor of EELV Begles, Noel Mamere, where 120 people
attended the fair, said that the seeds of these sprouts were purchased
at the store Jardiland in Villenave d'Ornon [a suburb of Bordeaux].
Jardiland, contacted by AFP in Paris, could not immediately comment.
Mr Mamere has insisted that the seeds were handled and raised by 2
employees of the CLPE, who have not been sick, and "at no time have
the children been in contact with the seeds." Finding that "is not
surprising that one is faced with this kind of poisoning" and that
"there will be more" because "it is linked to agricultural production
systems and to industrial modes of food processing," he noted that
"environmentalists have long alerted us to the dangers we face."

The Regional Health Agency (LRA) has estimated that, given the
incubation time of 2 weeks, there should be more cases of _E. coli_
reported that are linked to this fair.

[The news release above reports that _Escherichia coli_ 0104 has been
isolated from 2 of the 10 people in the Bordeaux outbreak. Five of the
10 people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which suggests
that this strain of _E. coli_ O104 in the Bordeaux outbreak produces
Shiga (vero) toxin. The _E. coli_ strain that caused the large
outbreak of hemolytic uremic syndrome and diarrhea in Germany and
elsewhere in May and June 2011 possesses the unusual combination of
pathogenic features typical of enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EaggEC)
together with the capacity to produce Shiga toxin. Whether the
Bordeaux strain is the same as the strain responsible for the German
outbreak would require further genetic analysis.

Bordeaux is a port city on the Garonne River in the department of
Gironde in the Aquitaine region of south west France. Begles is a
southern suburb of Bordeaux and has a population of 22 475
