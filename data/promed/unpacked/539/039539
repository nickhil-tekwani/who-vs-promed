Vietnam reports more poultry deaths
-----------------------------------
About 4000 fowl have either died or been killed in Vietnam's 3 southern
localities in recent weeks, many of them found to have contracted the virus
strain of H5, local newspaper Youth reported Tuesday [21 Dec 2004].
Over 200 chickens raised by Tao Van Loi in Binh Thuy district in Can Tho
city died on 12 Dec 2004. The local veterinary force culled his 3685
chickens and 4541 eggs worth some 200 Vietnamese dong (12 700 USD) after
finding that samples from the dead fowl tested positive for H5.
In mid-December, the force also killed 24 chickens raised by 2 other
farmers in the same district, since samples were tested positive to the
virus strain. Head of the district's veterinary station Nguyen Thi Anh
Tuyet said poultry in Can Tho could have been stricken by the bird flu
virus [strain] H5N1.
In the 2 provinces of Hau Giang and An Giang, hundreds of chickens and
ducks have suddenly died since mid-December. Local veterinarian forces are
trying to identify the cause. Some 200 out of 540 chickens in Hau Giang's
Long My rural district died last week. Other healthy fowl in the flock have
already been culled.
Now, the 3 localities are taking urgent preventive measures, mainly
tightening management over poultry flocks, slaughterhouses and markets, and
isolating areas with dead fowl. Can Tho's veterinary force sprays
antiseptics and bans the transport of poultry in the areas within a radius
of one kilometer.
Denmark on Monday offered 12 southern localities equipment for bird flu
prevention worth some 150 000 US dollars. The equipment includes sprayers,
slaughtering tools and protective clothes.
Vietnam remains highly alert to potential new outbreaks of bird flu this
winter, because cold weather favors the spread of the disease. Free raising
of poultry, especially ducks in fields, and rampant transport and sale of
fowl before the Lunar New Year, which falls in early February, are also
contributing factors to the high risk [for the return of] bird flu.
The country is intensifying anti-bird flu activities such as frequently
disinfecting farms, monitoring the transport and import of fowl and their
eggs via border gates, and raising public awareness of the disease
nationwide, especially in the southern Mekong Delta. It plans to vaccinate
poultry if large-scale resurgence of bird flu is reported.
In late March 2004, Vietnam [prematurely] declared an end to the bird flu
that had killed 17 percent of its poultry population and claimed 16 human
lives during the previous outbreak starting in December 2003. A total of
43.2 million fowl nationwide either died or were culled, causing direct
losses of 1.3 trillion Vietnamese dong (82. 8 million dollars) to the local
poultry industry.
