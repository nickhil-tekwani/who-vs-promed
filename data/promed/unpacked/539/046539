Anthrax outbreak kills 100 animals in Turkana
---------------------------------------------
About 100 livestock have died following an outbreak of anthrax in Kibish Division, Turkana North District. District Veterinary Officer Lucas Kemboi said the disease was 1st reported in Natomeri village before spreading to Korimunyang and Koesa locations. The official said the disease, which was reported early this month, killed 40 animals in the 1st week and 60 in the 2nd.

Dr Kemboi said the signs of the disease include swollen stomach in dead animals, blood oozing from the mouth and anus and a swollen spleen. He said it was difficult to identify the disease signs in live animals as they appear just before the animals die. "The disease kills very fast as it takes only 12 to 24 hours to kill an animal," he said.

According to Kemboi, anthrax affects all kinds of grazers and germs of the disease are transmitted through the grass. [i.e., grazing. MHJ]

The veterinary officer said efforts to vaccinate animals to prevent the disease have been hampered by lack of vaccines. He said available vaccines in Nakuru and Kabete are for sale and most farmers in the area cannot afford them.

Kemboi said he has communicated with his headquarters over the issue, but was told to look for a donor to sponsor the exercise, as the ministry does not have funds for the same. "Our hopes lie with the proposal we have presented to Turkana North Constituency Development Fund office for financial support to buy vaccines," he said.

Meanwhile, he said, veterinary officers are enlightening residents on how to dispose of carcasses of the livestock by burning or burying them as the disease can be transmitted to human beings.

Kemboi said the pastoralist lifestyle in the area has made it difficult for him to issue a quarantine notice and instead he has directed them to graze animals in new areas where germs do not exist.

Councillor Paul Lobwel blamed the Government for ignoring their plight despite the disease killing more than 10 animals per day in the affected area.

[For years anthrax outbreaks were under-reported but have improved recently. However in previous years the reports were concentrated on Central, Eastern, Nairobi, and Rift Valley provinces. Turkana is the northwesternmost district in Kenya. It is bordered by the countries of Uganda to the west; South Sudan and Ethiopia, including the disputed Ilemi Triangle, to the north and northeast; and Lake Turkana to the east.

In 2005 there was a single outbreak reported in the Rift Valley Province; 2006 (6); 2007 (5); 2008 (1, cattle and sheep affected); 2009 (4); 2010 (1); 2011 (1, cattle and sheep affected). The Nairobi perception that it is sporadic limits government supported control programmes. But without vaccination the disease can decimate the livestock unhindered. In this areas burning and burial are essentially impossible and therefore control must depend totally on proactive vaccination of the herds at risk.

It is only a matter of time before we start seeing reports of fatal human cases in the province. - Mod.MHJ]
