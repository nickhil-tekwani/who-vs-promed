DRC: Katanga Measles Crisis Update - December 2015
-------------------------
Background

MSF response to 2015 Measles outbreak
--------------------
A measles epidemic has been raging since the beginning of the year (2015) in the former province of Katanga in the southeast of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). According to the Ministry of Public Health, as of 20 Nov 2015 a total of 39 619 cases including 474 deaths have been officially reported in Katanga since early 2015. More than 77 percent of children affected were aged 1-5 years, and 88 percent of the children who died were from this age group.

Katanga is almost the size of Spain and has more than 10 million inhabitants. 24 of its 68 health zones have been affected by the epidemic, according to the Katanga Provincial Health Inspection, based in the provincial capital Lubumbashi.

In the most remote and economically depressed parts of this mineral-rich province, healthcare is out of reach for many. Most people have lost confidence in the health system, which suffers from a chronic shortage of medicines and a lack of trained medical staff. Treatment costs are so high as to prevent the mostly poor population from seeking care.

Katanga was the scene of a large measles epidemic in 2011, after which MSF vaccinated 2.1 million children. Measles vaccinations are theoretically part of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and should be available in all Congolese health centres. In addition, catch-up vaccination campaigns are held each year. The current measles epidemic raises questions on the effectiveness of previous vaccinations campaigns.

Measles has become endemic in DRC, with recurrent and cyclical epidemics. The disease is particularly dangerous for children under the age of 5 years, especially those with acute malnutrition. Children who contract measles become even more vulnerable to other diseases such as malaria.

In recent years, international donors have provided funds to improve overall immunisation coverage. Since September 2015, donors have allocated more than 5 million USD to support the Ministry of Health and its partners in the response to this emergency.

The latest epidemic appears to be on the decline, but the risk of it spreading to other regions remains a concern.

Main challenges in the response to the epidemic:
- It took time for the authorities to officially declare the epidemic, which led to a significant delay in the response.
- The number of cases and deaths is widely underestimated due to a lack of reliable data from health centres, particularly in the remoter areas of Katanga province.
- The national response plan focuses solely on vaccination, and does not include curative care for children with measles.
-Decisions about which areas and age groups of children to vaccinate do not take into account epidemiological data or the way the epidemic is evolving.
- The response to the epidemic is hindered by logistical constraints -- difficulties of access -- which dramatically increase the costs.
- Maintaining the cold chain in such conditions is one of the biggest challenges.
- There is a significant lack of equipment and qualified health staff to respond to this epidemic.

MSF response to the epidemic
--------
MSF started its response in April 2015 in Malemba Nkulu health zone. As the epidemic gained ground, MSF teams quickly expanded into other areas.

MSF's response is based on supporting local health centres with the following:
- Managing simple cases on an outpatient basis by providing health centres with supervision, donations of medicines, and training and bonuses for staff.
- Referring serious cases to hospital for inpatient care.
- Managing complicated cases that require inpatient care.
- Vaccinating children aged 6 months to 15 years.
- Caring for children with severe acute malnutrition (in some areas, more than 10 percent of children screened) and malaria (in certain hospitals, 90 percent of children test positive).
- Actively detecting cases of measles in communities.

As of early December 2015, MSF teams had vaccinated more than 962 900 children aged 6 months to 15 years, and provided support to nearly 30 000 children with simple or complicated cases of measles.

Human resources: In December 2015, more than 500 international and national staff were deployed to respond to this epidemic.

Health Ministry to provide measles vaccinations for babies as young as 9 months
-------------------------
Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah states that 2 children died due to measles in 2015, compared with 1 death during 2014.

Babies as young as 9 months old will be vaccinated for measles beginning in April 2016 based on the increasing number of measles-related cases in the country.

According to a report by New Straits Times today, Health deputy director-general (Public Health) Datuk Dr Lokman Hakim Sulaiman said that early vaccination was timely and necessary considering the increase in the number of measles cases in the past 3 years.

"Health Ministry will bring forward the 1st dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination to 9 months and 2nd dose to 12 months, from the current 12 months and 7 years.

"It is timely and necessary as measles is still endemic in Malaysia, indicated by the increase in the number of cases and clusters in the past 3 years. Beginning [in 2016], babies in the peninsula and Sarawak will get their 1st MMR shot at 9 months, and the 2nd dose at 12 months," he was quoted as saying in the report.

Dr Lokman further said that babies in Sabah would continue to receive measles vaccination at 6 months and would receive their 1st MMR dose at 9 months and the 2nd was when they reached 12 months.

He added that the new schedule would start with babies born on 1 Jul 2016 onwards.

Other than that, Dr Lokman said that they would carry out campaigns to inform the public about the new schedule aside from giving them the awareness about the health issue.

"This would provide sufficient time for medical personnel to inform parents on the new schedule, set new appointments for MMR shots and acquire a sufficient supply of vaccines. We will also carry out campaigns on the new vaccination schedule to create awareness and educate the public. This has been discussed with the ministry's Family Health Development Division and state health personnel," he said.

In the report Dr Lokman also said that immunising infants before the age of 6 months often failed to induce seroconversion due to the immaturity of the immune system and the presence of neutralising maternal antibodies. Seroconversion is the time period during which a specific antibody develops and becomes detectable in the blood.

Measles is a virus that lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. It develops into a highly infectious disease that occurs only in humans.

According to the report, it said that the number of measles cases in the country had tripled as of September 2015.

"Health Ministry statistics revealed that the number of confirmed measles cases rose to 794 cases (34.7 per million population -- annualised) from 235 cases (7.8 per million population) in 2014 and 195 cases (6.6 per million population) in 2013," it read.

It is also reported that the Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah stating that 2 children died of measles in 2015, compared with 1 death during 2014. Most cases of measles struck infants and children aged 6 years and below.

"The number of outbreaks increased more than threefold, with 37 episodes from only 11 last year, with cases had been reported in childcare institutions, schools and detention centres," said Dr Hisham as quoted in the report.

Sindh Health Minister Jam Mehtab Hussain Dahar on Monday directed the Health secretary and EPI Programme CEO to submit a report regarding the deaths caused by measles in Mirpurkhas and Shahdadkot within 3 days.

Presiding over a meeting at his office, the minister said that it was a matter of serious concern that 2 children had died of measles. He said concrete measures should be taken to prevent the disease from spreading to other areas.

Dahar also directed the secretary to see to the shortage of doctors and paramedics in the Dadu Civil Hospital and ensure proper attendance of the staff. He said he had received complaints that certain doctors had been on leave for a long time.

He said there was no shortage of medicines in the EPI Programme and tenders were being floated for the purchase of anti-hepatitis vaccine on court's orders. He said that the health department was handing over some hospitals to non-governmental organisations with a view to improve their working. He said that these NGOs would manage the hospitals while employees would come under direct control of the health department.

NSW Health warns of measles outbreak
---------------------------
An infant in western Sydney has been diagnosed with measles after an adult contracted the disease during a trip to Singapore. The child was too young to have been vaccinated.

NSW Health communicable diseases branch director Vicky Sheppeard said people need to be aware of the symptoms of measles in the coming weeks, especially those if they who have been in contact with areas the adult visited while infectious.

He attended retail outlets at Parramatta, Wentworthville, Rouse Hill and Kings Langley on 26 and 27 Nov 2015.

The man was at 2 medical centres at Castle Hill and Carlingford 28-30 Nov 2015 and was at Blacktown Hospital's emergency department on 30 Nov 2015.

"These cases signal that a measles outbreak could begin in Sydney in the coming days," Dr Sheppeard said.

"Susceptible people, such as infants under 12 months of age, and older children and adults who have not received 2 doses of measles vaccine, should be on the lookout for symptoms, particularly in the common week."

A measles warning has been issued after an infected tourist visited several parts of the country.

The 28-year-old European tourist, who visited Canterbury, Wellington and Marlborough in the last week, became aware of measles-like symptoms on 7 Dec 2015.

The tourist visited a GP in Kaikoura 2 days later and laboratory tests confirmed he had measles on Thursday.

The visitor had stayed in Wellington and Motueka before he was diagnosed, but while he was infectious. It was thought he contracted the illness while in Australia.

Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Alistair Humphrey said measles was highly infectious.

"We're asking people who haven't been immunised and who may have been in contact with the [infected tourist] to keep a close eye out for these symptoms.

"If you develop symptoms phone a doctor and let them know that you have potentially been in contact with a confirmed measles case."

The virus spread easily through the air, including by coughing, breathing and sneezing. Symptoms began with fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, followed by a rash that spread over the body.

Humphrey said the tourist "did all the right things" after realising he might have measles. "By isolating himself he has greatly reduced the likelihood of further spread, and possibly saved lives as well."

The tourist was staying in a house outside Christchurch with people who were fully immunised. His infectious period would end at midnight on Friday.

Humphrey said the New Zealand tourist industry needed to be on alert for possible measles cases.

"Over the next few years there is a heightened risk of measles as a result of the decision by parents in the 1990s not to get their children immunised due to now discredited research on the link between the measles vaccine and autism. While it's important to get vaccines on time, every time, it's never too late," he said.

THE INFECTED TOURIST'S TRAVEL HISTORY
------
Dec 3-5: Comfort Hotel, Cuba Street, Wellington. The tourist has no symptoms, but the infectious period begins at this time.
Dec 5: Bluebridge Ferry from Wellington at 8am.
Dec 5-7: Motueka Holiday Top 10 (private cabin). The tourist notices symptoms on December 7.
Dec 8-10: Lazy Shag Backpackers, Kaikoura. The tourist isolates himself in a private room.
Dec 9: Visits doctor who notifies the Canterbury District Health Board of a suspected measles case.
Dec 10: Lab test confirms measles.
Dec 11: Travels by car to a private residence outside Christchurch. The infectious period will end at midnight.
