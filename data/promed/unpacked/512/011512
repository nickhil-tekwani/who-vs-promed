There is no class at an Omaha [Nebraska] school Fri 11 Nov 2005 because of
what may be the 4th outbreak of norovirus this fall.
The Douglas County Health Department is investigating at Oak Valley
Elementary School near 125th Street and West Center Road. 45 students at
the school either called in sick or went home sick on Thu 10 Nov 2005. The
school decided it was enough to cancel classes on Friday. Workers will
spend Friday deep-cleaning the school.
"They determined that it was possible that it was a viral illness that
could possibly spread rapidly through the school," said Sharon Moran, with
Omaha Public Schools. The school sent home a letter and called parents to
tell them about canceling class, but the announcement still came as a
surprise to some.
The school is encouraging students to frequently wash their hands. The
school is treating the outbreak as the norovirus, but it will take testing
to confirm that. Only essential staff will be at Oak Valley Friday, along
with cleaning crews.
Omaha Public Schools thinks the outbreak is contained to one school. About
40 students at Creighton University have been ill since Friday, and there
is speculation that it may be due to norovirus infection.
Administrators said the outbreak was concentrated among residents of the
Fr. Francis Deglman, S.J., Student Residence Hall. Students have reported
vomiting, diarrhea and cramping.
At least 300 people were sickened over 3-4 days in October 2005 at the
Doubletree Hotel at 16th and Dodge streets.
In September 2005, 80 students at Fire Ridge Elementary School in Elkhorn
came down with the norovirus after the food became contaminated.

[2] Norovirus, school, UK (England)

At least 250 pupils and 20 staff at a secondary school in the southwest of
England have been confirmed to be suffering from a contagious virus that
causes vomiting and diarrhoea. About 1000 pupils failed to attend Holyrood
School, in Chard, Somerset, on Fri 9 Dec 2005 where there is an outbreak of
Norwalk virus infection. [_Norwalk virus_ is the type species of the genus
_Norovirus_ of the family _Caliciviridae_. The noroviruses are responsible
for illness with non-fatal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea which can
last up to 72 hours. - Mod.CP]. Education officials believe many children
have been kept at home by worried parents. Health experts have visited the
school since the outbreak started on Tuesday. A Somerset County Council
spokeswoman said the school had been specially cleaned and a thorough
disinfection would be carried out at the weekend. Letters have been sent to
parents advising them to keep sick children at home 48 hours after
recovering. The head teacher is among the staff who have contracted the
illness. The school has been advised to stay open if it can continue to run
"reasonably well".
Paul Courtney, of the Dorset and Somerset Health Protection Unit dealing
with the outbreak, said it is believed to have started outside the
school. "An infection like this can spread very quickly. On Tuesday, we
had about 6 parents reporting to the school they had children who were
showing symptoms of sickness and diarrhoea. By Wednesday, that was more
like 150 more. And so the nature of this kind of infection is if
somebody's sick in a confined space for instance, aerosol droplets of vomit
can be inhaled and quickly infect other people." He indicated that the best
way to stop the spread of the infection was by good hygiene measures such
as hand washing after going to the toilet and before preparing food.
Holyrood School is the only institution in the area known to be affected by
the virus.

[Viruses classified in the family _Caliciviidae_are associated with a
variety of hosts and several disease syndromes. The human caliciviruses,
however, are restricted to 2 of the 4 genera in the family, the genus
_Norovirus_ (type species _Norwalk virus_) and the genus _Sapovirus_ (type
species _Sapporovirus_). These viruses are associated with similar
non-fatal illnesses, i.e. acute self-limited gastroenteritis and
malaise. The noroviruses are the more common, whereas the sapoviruses are
more sporadic and are also associated with outbreaks in pigs. The symptoms
and rapidity of onset of illness are so specific that accurate diagnosis is
rarely undertaken. Formerly human caliciviruses were know as "small round
structured viruses" and electron microscopy of fecal samples is sufficient
to confirm diagnosis.
Initially norovirus infection appeared to be associated predominantly with
food-borne outbreaks of sudden-onset viral gastroenteritis, but latterly it
became apparent that infection can be transmitted directly from person to
person. Subsequent reports of norovirus infection included those associated
with hotels, cruise ships, hospitals, and sports facilities. Recent reports
have concerned outbreaks at educational institutions. It is likely that
this progression reflects changes in public awareness rather than
fundamental changes in the epidemiology of norovirus infection. - Mod.CP]
