The Ministry of Health of Cambodia has announced a new confirmed case
of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The
27-year-old male, from Prey Veng province, developed symptoms on 13
Apr 2010, was admitted to the hospital on 16 Apr 2010 and died the
following day. The presence of the H5N1 virus was confirmed by the
National Influenza Centre, the Institute Pasteur in Cambodia. The
patient prepared and consumed sick poultry 7 days before onset of
symptoms.

To date, Cambodia has reported 10 laboratory confirmed cases with 8
deaths since 2005.

[This is the WHO confirmation of the 10th case in Cambodia, reported
previously in "Avian influenza, human (33): Cambodia (PV), fatal,
20100422.1295". There have been relatively few human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in Cambodia up to the present, but
mortality has been high (80 per cent). There were 4 cases in 2005, 2
cases in 2006, and single cases in 2007, 2008, 2009 and now in 2010.
All the cases in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were fatal, and the single case
recorded this year [2010] also had a fatal outcome.
