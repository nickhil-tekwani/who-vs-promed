The sudden death of 31 swine has been reported in one of the private
farms in the [Tbilissky] district [one of the 38 districts of
Krasnodar Krai [Territory]. Specimens were collected and sent for
testing at the Kropotkin regional laboratory. Though the laboratory
results are pending, local authorities have decided to implement
emergency measures.

The neighboring farms include 4000 additional swine. In addition to
the dead 31 swine, 22 animals have been culled on the affected farm.
