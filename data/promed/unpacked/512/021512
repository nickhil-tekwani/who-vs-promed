The Ebola virus has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever now believed to have killed nearly 60 people in southern Guinea, government officials say.

Scores of cases have been recorded since the outbreak began early last month [February 2014].

There is no known cure or vaccine for the highly contagious Ebola virus. It is spread by close personal contact with people who are infected and kills between 25 percent and 90 percent of victims. Symptoms include internal and external bleeding, diarrhoea and vomiting.

Outbreaks of Ebola occur primarily in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests, the World Health Organization says. Analysts suggest it has never been recorded in Guinea before. Recent years have seen outbreaks in Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo.

"We got the 1st results from Lyon yesterday (Friday, 21 Mar 2014) which informed us of the presence of the Ebola virus as the cause of this outbreak," Guinean health ministry official Sakoba Keita told AFP. "The quicker we can contain this the fewer cases we'll have, then the smaller the scale of the epidemic. That's the idea of going in as strong as we can early on. The Ebola fever epidemic raging in southern Guinea since 9 Feb [2014] has left at least 59 dead out of 80 cases identified by our services on the ground. We are overwhelmed in the field, we are fighting against this epidemic with all the means we have at our disposal with the help of our partners, but it is difficult."

Medical aid charity Medecins sans Frontieres [MSF] said on Saturday [22 Mar 2014] it would strengthen its team in Guinea and fly some 33 tonnes of drugs and isolation equipment in from Belgium and France. Dr Armand Sprecher, an emergency physician and epidemiologist working with MSF in Guinea, told the BBC that doctors had to identify all patients with the disease and monitor anyone they had been in contact with during their illness. The latest outbreak could be brought under control if people acted quickly, he said. "Based on our history with these sorts of outbreaks it will happen. Ideally, sooner rather than later," said Dr Sprecher. "The quicker we can contain this the fewer cases we'll have, then the smaller the scale of the epidemic. That's the idea of going in as strong as we can early on."

Guinea has received confirmation that a mysterious disease that has killed up to 59 people in the West African country, and may have spread to neighbouring Sierra Leone, is the hemorrhagic fever Ebola, the government said on Saturday [22 Mar 2014].

Cases of the disease -- among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans, with a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent -- have been registered in 3 southeastern towns and in the capital Conakry since 9 Feb [2014]. It has never before been recorded in Guinea.

"It is indeed Ebola fever. A laboratory in Lyon (France) confirmed the information," Damantang Albert Camara told Reuters; 6 of the 12 samples sent for analysis tested positive for Ebola, Dr. Sakoba Keita, who heads the epidemics prevention division at Guinea's health ministry, told Reuters. He added that health officials had registered 80 suspected cases of the disease, including 59 deaths. "But you have to understand that not all the cases are necessarily due to Ebola fever. Some will have other origins, including a form of severe dysentery," Keita said.

World Health Organization (WHO) officials said that cases showing similar symptoms, including fever, diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding, had also been reported in an area of Sierra Leone near the border with Guinea....

The international medical charity Doctors Without Borders announced on Saturday [22 Mar 2014] it was reinforcing its medical and logistics teams in Guinea in response to the epidemic. It is also flying in 33 tons of medicines and equipment and is setting up isolation units in the 3 affected towns in Guinea. "These structures are essential to prevent the spread of the disease, which is highly contagious," Dr. Esther Sterk, Doctors Without Borders' tropical medicine adviser, said in a statement. "Specialized staff are providing care to patients showing signs of infection."

Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with infected animals including chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines, according to the WHO. The disease, which is transmitted between humans through contact with organs, blood, secretions, or other bodily fluids, is most commonly found in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, South Sudan and Gabon. Though no epidemics of the disease have been recorded among humans in West Africa, a variety of Ebola infected a colony of chimpanzees in Ivory Coast's Tai National Park, near the country's border with Liberia, in 1994. A Swiss scientist, who performed an autopsy on one of the infected animals, contracted the disease but later recovered.

[Earlier reports said that Ebola virus (EBOV) had been excluded, but now it has been confirmed. These laboratory results were received yesterday (21 Mar 2014), and MSF has acted very commendably fast. As they indicate, with the use of personal protective equipment and special precautions for burials, further person-to-person spread can quickly be stopped in its tracks.
