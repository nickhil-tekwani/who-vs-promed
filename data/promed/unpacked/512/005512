[1] Adenovirus-based vaccine adverse effects
[A] Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause
Date: Wed 14 Apr 2021 12:17 EDT

Injections of Johnson & Johnson's single-dose coronavirus vaccine came to a sudden halt across the country on Tuesday [13 Apr 2021] after federal health agencies called for a pause in the vaccine's use as they examine a rare blood-clotting disorder that emerged in 6 recipients.

All 6 were women between the ages of 18 and 48, and all developed the illness within 1 to 3 weeks of vaccination. One woman in Virginia died, and a 2nd woman in Nebraska has been hospitalized in critical condition.

More than 7 million people in the United States have received Johnson & Johnson shots so far, and another 10 million more doses have been shipped out to the states, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"We are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution," Dr. Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, said in a joint statement. "Right now, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare."

While they framed the move as a recommendation to health practitioners, the impact was immediate. By Tuesday evening [13 Apr 2021], every state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico had announced a pause in Johnson & Johnson vaccine injections.

Scientists with the FDA and CDC will jointly examine possible links between the vaccine and the disorder and determine whether the FDA should continue to authorize use of the vaccine for all adults or limit the authorization. An emergency meeting of the CDC's outside advisory committee has been scheduled for Wednesday [14 Apr 2021].

The move could substantially complicate the nation's vaccination efforts at a time when many states are confronting a surge in new cases and seeking to address vaccine hesitancy. Regulators in Europe and elsewhere are concerned about a similar issue with another coronavirus vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University researchers. That concern has driven up some resistance to all vaccines, even though the AstraZeneca version has not been authorized for emergency use in the United States.

The vast majority of the nation's vaccine supply comes from 2 other manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which together deliver more than 23 million doses a week of their 2-shot vaccines. There have been no significant safety concerns about either of those vaccines.

But while shipments of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been much more limited, the Biden administration had still been counting on using hundreds of thousands of doses every week. In addition to requiring only a single dose, the vaccine is easier to ship and store than the other 2, which must be stored at extremely low temperatures.

Mark D. Levine, a New York City councilman, lamented on Twitter that the pause would be a "huge setback" for the city's vaccination program, which he said relies "entirely on J & J" to inoculate the homebound, reach small private doctors' offices and supply mobile vaccination vans. "NYC now has the biggest messaging challenge yet in vaccination," he wrote. "We have to do everything possible to avoid a collapse in confidence in vaccination overall."

The development also throws a wrench into the Biden administration's plans to deliver enough vaccine to be able to inoculate all 260 million adults in the United States by the end of May [2021]. Now federal officials expect there will only be enough to cover fewer than 230 million adults. But a certain percentage of the population is expected to refuse shots, so the supply may cover all the demand.

Federal officials are concerned that doctors may not be trained to look for the rare disorder if recipients of the vaccine develop symptoms of it. The federal health agencies said Tuesday [13 Apr 2021] morning that "treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered" for blood clots. "Usually, an anticoagulant drug called heparin is used to treat blood clots. In this setting, administration of heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given," the statement said.

In a news release, Johnson & Johnson said: "We are aware that thromboembolic events including those with thrombocytopenia have been reported with COVID-19 vaccines. At present, no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine." Janssen is the name of Johnson & Johnson's division that developed the vaccine.

In the United States alone, 300 000 to 600 000 people a year develop blood clots, according to CDC data. But the particular blood clotting disorder that the vaccine recipients developed, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, is extremely rare.

All of the women developed the condition within 1 to 3 weeks of vaccination, and government experts are concerned that an immune system response triggered by the vaccine was the cause. Federal officials said there was broad agreement about the need to pause use of the vaccine while the cases are investigated.

The decision is a fresh blow to Johnson & Johnson. Late last month [March 2021], the company discovered that workers at a Baltimore plant run by its subcontractor had accidentally contaminated a batch of vaccine, forcing the firm to throw out millions of doses. That plant was supposed to take over supply of the vaccine to the United States from Johnson & Johnson's Dutch plants, which were certified by federal regulators earlier this year [2021].

The Baltimore plant's certification by the FDA has now been delayed while inspectors investigate quality control issues, sharply reducing the supply of Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The sudden drop in available doses led to widespread complaints from governors and state health officials who had been expecting much bigger shipments of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine this week than they got.

States have been using the vaccine in a broad range of settings, including at mass vaccination sites and on college campuses. The vaccine's one-shot approach has proved popular, and officials have directed it to transient, rural and isolated communities where following up with a 2nd dose is more complicated.

It is common for regulators to investigate "safety signals" in new vaccines and other medical products. Very often, the signals prove not to be of concern. But the concerns about Johnson & Johnson's vaccine mirror concerns about AstraZeneca's, which European regulators began investigating last month [March 2021] after some recipients developed blood clots.

Out of 34 million people who received the vaccine in Britain, the European Union and 3 other countries, 222 experienced blood clots that were linked with a low level of platelets. The majority of these cases occurred within the first 14 days following vaccination, mostly in women under 60 years of age.

On 7 Apr 2021, the European Medicines Agency, the main regulatory agency, concluded that the disorder was a very rare side effect of the vaccine. Researchers in Germany and Norway published studies on 9 Apr 2021 suggesting that in very rare cases, the AstraZeneca vaccine caused people to make antibodies that activated their own platelets [see below].

Nevertheless, the regulators argued, the benefit of the vaccine -- keeping people from being infected with the coronavirus or keeping those few who get COVID-19 out of the hospital -- vastly outweighed that small risk. Countries in Europe and elsewhere continued to give the vaccine to older people, who face a high risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19, while restricting it in younger people.

Both AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson use the same platform for their vaccine, a virus known as an adenovirus. On Tuesday [13 Apr 2021], the Australian government announced it would not purchase Johnson & Johnson vaccines. They cited Johnson & Johnson's use of an adenovirus. But there is no obvious reason adenovirus-based vaccines in particular would cause rare blood clots associated with low platelet levels.

AstraZeneca has not yet applied for an emergency use authorization in the United States. The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines use a different technology to produce immunity.

The 1st sign of concern about Johnson & Johnson's vaccine came on 9 Apr 2021, when the European Medicines Agency announced that it was investigating reports of 4 cases of blood clots in people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the United States. One case occurred in the clinical trial that took place before the vaccine was authorized. Three occurred in the vaccine rollout. One of them was fatal, the agency said.

The regulators described these reports as a "safety signal" -- a cluster of cases requiring further investigation. But they said it wasn't clear if the vaccine caused the clots.

[The pause in inoculation with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine may have important consequences for those who cannot easily travel to clinics, those experiencing homelessness, prison populations, and other underserved populations. Because it is a single dose, it makes immunization of these populations easier to achieve. Since the cases of the rare blood clot condition are all females mostly under 60 years of age, it may have been reasonable to limit the pause to females in the age-group at risk. But even considering the low risk, 6 cases out of 6.8 million individuals vaccinated, one must consider the risk of blood clots in COVID cases, 1 in 5, albeit not this rare presentation of blood clots, i.e., cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The risk of death from COVID is 1 in 1000.]

[B] AstraZeneca

[Two] papers, which looked at patients [who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine] from Austria and Germany, found that blood clots were seen in people who had high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4, the same types of antibodies reported, infrequently, after treatment with heparin. That doesn't explain why a vaccine is causing the immune system to produce those antibodies, or whether other vaccines might do the same. But it provides a 1st step toward explaining the side effect, which experts say is extremely rare, and to looking into whether the same types of rare clots could occur with other shots.

"It's now a recognized syndrome, a recognized disorder, and most importantly there is a combination of tests that can establish if a patient has this or not," said Theodore Warkentin, a professor at McMaster University, a co-author of one of the papers and an expert on the rare clots that can be caused by heparin.

The new discovery still raises questions about what, exactly, is going on.

The challenge for public health officials is that these deadly clots occur without vaccines. It's possible that some people who developed clots after being vaccinated would have developed them even without being vaccinated. So officials have to compare the vaccines against each other, and to try and model the normal rate of clots with low levels of platelets.

[Like AstraZeneca], the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine, as well as the Sputnik V vaccine developed in Russia, also uses a form of adenovirus -- in J&J's case, a less common strain, Ad26, that is found in humans. (The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use a different technology, known as mRNA.)

Dan Barouch, a researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who played a key role in the development of the J&J vaccine, said Friday [9 Apr 2021] that the Ad26 adenovirus used in the J&J vaccine is evolutionarily distant from the adenovirus used by AstraZeneca, even using a different cellular receptor to enter cells. Barouch described the process of looking at side effects tied to the vaccine as normal.

Warkentin, the expert on heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, said that free DNA -- that is, DNA not contained in the virus -- could, if it were to be exposed to platelet factor 4, itself trigger the immune system to create antibodies against platelet factor 4. It's not clear how that risk would differ between vaccines.

[2] Potential superspreading events
[A] India (Haridwar): Kumbh Mela
Date: Tue 13 Apr 2021
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/12/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases#as-india-rises-to-no-2-in-total-infections-a-huge-hindu-pilgrimage-risks-becoming-a-superspreading-event


Even as India hit a record for daily coronavirus infections, and its total caseload rose to 2nd in the world behind the United States, the images that dominated Indian news media on Monday [12 Apr 2021] were of a crowded religious festival along the banks of the Ganges River. The dissonance was a clear manifestation of the confusing messages sent by the authorities just as India's coronavirus epidemic is spiraling, with a daily high of 168 000 cases and 900 deaths reported on Monday.

Yet millions of devotees have thronged the holy city of Haridwar for the monthlong Kumbh Mela, or pitcher festival, when Hindu pilgrims seek absolution by bathing in the Ganges. Officials have said that about one million people will participate every day, and as many as 5 million during the most auspicious days, all crowded into a narrow stretch along the river and searching for the holiest spot to take a dip.

Already, fears are running high that one of the most sacred pilgrimages in Hinduism could turn into a superspreading event.

Dr. S. K. Jha, a local health officer, said that an average of about 250 new cases had been registered each day recently. Experts have warned that many more infections are going unrecorded, and that devotees could unwittingly carry the virus with them as they return to their homes across the country.

India is in the grip of the world's fastest growing outbreak, with more and more jurisdictions going back into varying stages of lockdown. Infections are spreading particularly fast in Mumbai, the country's financial hub, and the surrounding state of Maharashtra, where the government has announced a partial weekday lockdown and near-total closure over the weekends.

The situation is also worsening in the capital, New Delhi, which reported more than 10 000 new cases on Sunday [11 Apr 2021], surpassing the previous daily high of nearly 8500. The state government has imposed a curfew and ordered restaurants and public transport systems to run at half capacity. Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi's top official, has said more restrictions may follow.

Hospitals in several states are reporting shortages of oxygen, ventilators and coronavirus testing kits, and some are also running low on remdesivir, a drug used in serious COVID-19 cases. India has halted the export of remdesivir until the situation improves.

India is also trying to ramp up its vaccination drive, with about 3 million people being inoculated daily and 104 million doses administered so far. But with many vaccination centers nationwide expressing concern over possible shortages, India's large pharmaceutical industry has sharply reduced its exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine in order to keep more doses at home, creating serious challenges for other countries that had been relying on those shipments. On Monday [12 Apr 2021], Indian experts recommended the use of Russia's Sputnik-V coronavirus vaccine, which would become the 3rd available in the country if approved by the authorities.

After months of lower-than-expected infections and deaths from the virus, critics say Indian officials have sent dissonant messages about the seriousness of the crisis. Police officers are enforcing curfew and mask rules, sometimes resorting to beatings captured on videos shared across social media. But senior political leaders, including the prime minister, Narendra Modi, have been holding large rallies for local elections.

Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist government has also allowed the religious festival to proceed -- in contrast to what happened last spring [2020], at the start of the pandemic, when India's health ministry blamed an Islamic seminary for fanning a far smaller outbreak. Critics say rhetoric from members of Mr. Modi's party contributed to a spate of attacks against Muslims, a minority of about 200 million people in a Hindu-dominated country of 1.3 billion.

[B] Thailand: Songkran holiday
Date: Tue 13 Apr 2021
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/12/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases#thailand-faces-its-worst-virus-outbreak-as-a-major-travel-holiday-begins


Thailand is facing its worst coronavirus outbreak just as millions of people head to their home provinces during the country's biggest travel holiday.

The latest wave of infections, which has sent at least 8 cabinet members into isolation, is centered in a Bangkok nightlife district said to be popular with government officials and wealthy partygoers. The country, which until now has largely kept the virus under control, set a record Monday [12 Apr 2021] for new daily cases with 985.

One top health official warned that Thailand could soon face as many as 28 000 new cases a day in the worst-case scenario. The government announced it would set up field hospitals as COVID-19 wards at existing facilities begin to fill up.

Officials ordered the closure of hundreds of bars and nightclubs, but critics say the government has been inconsistent in its efforts to bring the outbreak under control. The prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, stopped short of banning travel between provinces for the Songkran holiday, which begins on Tuesday [13 Apr 2021] and marks the beginning of the Thai New Year.

"Whatever will be, will be," he said last week in explaining his decision. "The reason is it's a matter that involves a huge number of people. The government will have to try to cope with that later."

Dozens of provinces have imposed their own restrictions on travelers coming from Bangkok and other affected areas, prompting many Thais to cancel their trips. But many others set off over the weekend.

During earlier outbreaks, the government often acted quickly to require face masks, ban foreign tourists, impose quarantine restrictions and lock down hard-hit areas. It has reported fewer than 34 000 cases -- mostly from a January [2021] surge traced to a seafood market near Bangkok -- and just 97 deaths.

But it has been lax in testing and slow to vaccinate. So far, it has procured about 2.2 million doses and given at least one to about 500 000 people. Thailand's population is 70 million. Vaccine production is not expected to begin in earnest until June [2021], when a manufacturer in Thailand is scheduled to begin producing 10 million doses a month of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Health officials were alarmed by the recent discovery of dozens of cases of the highly infectious coronavirus variant first identified in Britain. The finding highlighted the inadequacy of Thailand's virus testing and suggested that its quarantine procedures have not been as effective as officials believed.

Tourism operators have been especially angered by the government's lackadaisical approach to obtaining vaccine supplies. The tourism industry, which normally accounts for about 20% of the nation's economy, is highly dependent on foreign visitors and has been calling for widespread vaccinations to speed its recovery.

The outbreak in Bangkok has also prompted questions about the activities of some top officials and their aides. The transportation minister, Saksayam Chidchob, who was hospitalized with COVID-19, was criticized for not being forthcoming about his whereabouts during times when he may have been exposed to the virus. He denied visiting the gentlemen's club at the center of the outbreak and said he believed he had contracted the virus from an aide.
