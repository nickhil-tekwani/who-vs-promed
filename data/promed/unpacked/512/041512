Four Mild Cases of Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease In Hong Kong
----------------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: Several 2-year-old Hong Kong boys contracted a mild form of
hand, foot and mouth disease last week, a local health official confirmed
on Wed 22 Nov 2000. The 4 boys had all attended the same nursery in
central Hong Kong, but none of them is in any danger, the official
said. "One has already recovered and gone back to school. The other 3 are
still resting at home," he told Reuters.
The last outbreak of the disease in Hong Kong was in 1999 when 350 cases
were reported with no fatalities. The latest outbreak follows similar
illness in Malaysia's southern Johor state in late October and in Singapore
in September. The Singapore and Malaysian authorities had closed
kindergartens and nurseries to halt the spread of the virus, which was
suspected to have killed 4 children in Singapore. Since the disease is
spread through contact with nasal discharges, saliva and feces, children
are more susceptible to infection than adults. Symptoms include fever,
sore throat, vomiting, mouth ulcers and rashes. Complications can lead to
death.

[In fact on 18 Aug 2000 ProMED-mail carried a report of a case of hand,
foot & mouth disease in Hong Kong (see Hand, foot & mouth disease - China (Hong
Kong) 20000818.1374). A 5-year-old girl had died after being infected by a
virus during a trip to the mainland. This was the second fatal case of
Enterovirus type 71 (EV71) infection recorded since the government set up a
surveillance programme during outbreaks in 1998. In May of 2000 a boy 3
years of age was reported to have fully recovered after a mild EV71
infection. The virus responsible for the current outbreak in Hong Kong has
not yet been identified. - Mod.CP
