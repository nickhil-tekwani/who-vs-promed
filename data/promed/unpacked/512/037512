In the last week of March 2009, 5 measles cases among students of an
anthroposophic school were reported to the public health authorities
in the Austrian province of Styria, where only 5 cases had been
reported in the whole of 2008. A descriptive epidemiological
investigation of the measles outbreak was performed. Between 2 Mar
and 10 May 2009, 37 cases of measles were identified in Styria: 33
confirmed outbreak cases and 4 probable outbreak cases. The measles
outbreak spread from the general population (12 cases) to an
anthroposophic [a formal educational, therapeutic, and creative
system established by Rudolf Steiner, seeking to use mainly natural
means to optimize physical and mental health and well-being]
community (25 cases). Cases outside of the anthroposophic community
were mostly over 10 years of age (10/12). 35 cases were unvaccinated,
and 2 of the 37 had received one dose of measles, mumps, rubella
(MMR) vaccine. Following a measles outbreak in Salzburg in 2008 with
394 cases [see ProMED-mail archived reports listed below], this
outbreak re-emphasises the continued need for additional vaccination
campaigns in population groups over the age of 10 years.

Introduction
In the last week of March 2009, 5 measles cases were reported to
public health authorities in the Austrian province of Styria (total
population: 1.2 million). All cases were pupils of an anthroposophic
school (total school population: 305). No measles cases had been
reported in the 2 previous months in Austria. In 2008, 5 cases had
been reported in Styria during the whole year.

A bivalent measles, mumps (MM) vaccine was introduced in Austria in
1974 as part of the national childhood immunisation programme. This
was replaced in 1994 by a trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)
vaccine (2-dose regimen with the 1st dose at 15 months and the 2nd
dose at 6 years of age) [1]. The Ministry of Health estimates the
average measles vaccine coverage with at least one dose for the birth
cohorts 1997-2007 to be 84 percent [2]. Measles vaccination is not
mandatory in Austria for enrolling a child in school.

The World Health Organization (WHO) set the year 2010 as the target
for elimination of measles in the European Region [3]. Between 2004
and 2007, Austria was considered a low to moderate incidence country,
according to the criteria of EUVAC.NET (less than 1/100 000
population/year) [4]. In 2008, a measles outbreak with at least 394
cases in the Austrian province of Salzburg, linked to the
anthroposophic community, changed Austria's status to a high
incidence country [5].

Methods
A descriptive epidemiological outbreak investigation was performed.
Case data on demographics, date of rash onset, clinical symptoms,
past history of contact with a known measles case, vaccination
status, and disease outcome were assessed by telephone interviews.

A confirmed outbreak case was defined as a patient with a generalised
macular-papular rash with fever accompanied by at least one of the
following clinical signs: cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis, who
fulfilled one of the criteria of a laboratory-confirmed measles
infection as described elsewhere [6] or who was epidemiologically
linked to a laboratory-confirmed measles infection within 7-21 days
prior to rash onset, who fell sick after 1 Mar 2009, and was resident
in the Austrian province of Styria. A probable outbreak case was
defined as a patient who fulfilled the clinical criteria of measles,
who fell sick after 1 Mar 2009, and was resident in the Austrian
province of Styria.

Active case finding was conducted among contact persons of the
measles cases who were notified to the district public health
authorities. Infection with measles virus was defined as
laboratory-confirmed if at least one of the following 3 laboratory
criteria was fulfilled: detection of measles virus-specific IgM,
detection of measles virus RNA, or isolation of measles virus from a
clinical specimen [6]. The detection of measles virus RNA in clinical
specimens as described by El Mubarak et al. [7] and genotyping as
described by Santibanez et al. [8] were performed by the Austrian
National Reference Centre for Measles.

Results
37 cases fulfilled the outbreak case definition. Of these, 33 were
confirmed, and 4 were probable cases. Nine of the 11
laboratory-tested cases were confirmed for measles virus infection.
The measles virus RNA from 2 outbreak case specimens was partially
sequenced and was genotype H1. The outbreak affected 4 of the 17
public health districts of Styria between 2 Mar (week 10) and 10 May
2009 (week 19) and peaked with 8 cases with onset of symptoms in week
17 (20-26 Apr 2009). Between March and May 2009, 11 unrelated measles
cases were reported in the other 8 Austrian provinces. [A figure in
the original text illustrates the outbreak cases by week of rash
onset according to the outbreak case classification.]

Of the 35 cases, 25 belonged to the anthroposophic community,
including 12 pupils of the anthroposophic school (giving a school
attack rate of 12/305 or 3.9 percent), 4 household members, and 9
acquaintances. A likely source was identified as one of the 1st 4
anthroposophic community cases (including 2 cases in pupils) who fell
sick at the same time. This anthroposophic case was a pupil who had
visited a billiard pub within the 3 weeks prior to his rash onset. An
earlier case from the general population had also reported having
visited the same pub. This is one probable route which enabled the
measles virus to spread from the general population to the
susceptible anthroposophic community.

Among the cases belonging to the anthroposophic community, the age
group of 5-9-year-olds was most affected, with 14 of 25 cases. Among
the cases in the general population, the age group of 10-14-year-olds
was most affected, with 5 of 12 cases. Most of the cases from the
general population were over 10 years old (10/12).

The symptoms most commonly reported by all 35 cases were fever
(n=35), cough (n=34), conjunctivitis (n=34) and cold-like symptoms
(n=28). Two measles cases reported having otitis media. Two cases
were hospitalised during the course of the infection for 5 and 8
days, respectively. All cases recovered.

None of the 37 outbreak cases had received both doses of MMR vaccine.
Two cases had received one vaccine dose of MMR. Both belonged to the
12 cases in the general population. All cases in the anthroposophic
community and 10 cases in the general population were completely unvaccinated.

The anthroposophic school was closed for 2 weeks, and cases were
asked to stay at home for the period of communicability (at least 4
days after the onset of the rash). An MMR post-exposure prophylaxis
was offered free of charge to susceptible contacts of outbreak cases.

Discussion
We report a measles outbreak, which began in the general population
in week 10 of 2009 and spread to an anthroposophic school in week 13.
In a measles outbreak in 2008 involving 397 cases, the attack rate in
the affected anthroposophic school was 44 percent (150/340 pupils),
significantly higher than the 3.9 percent observed here. Assuming
similar low vaccination coverage in the anthroposophic community as
observed in the 2008 measles outbreak, the low attack rate in this
outbreak was likely due to the prompt 2-week closure of the
anthroposophic school and the prompt isolation of cases at home for
the period of communicability. The supplementary province-wide MMR
vaccination campaign addressing the 15-25 years age group in the
general population was implemented as a consequence of an outbreak
affecting Austrian provinces other than Styria in 2008. In the 1st 6
months of 2008, 5335 1st doses (5.1 percent of those administered
within the age group of 7-25 years) were administered, which is more
than the number of 1st doses administered during the 1st half of 2009
(i.e. the period of the described measles outbreak) [unpublished
data]. A concurrent rubella outbreak (ongoing since October 2008) may
have also contributed to raise awareness for contagious rash
diseases, which probably led to an early case presentation and case
isolation [9].

Combating measles is still a high public health priority in Europe
[10]. In Austria, a mumps outbreak in 2006, a measles outbreak in
2008, and a rubella outbreak in 2008-2009 have shown a clear shift of
the age distribution of the cases to those older than 10 years
[1,5,10]. The age groups most affected were: 16-30 year-olds (mumps),
10-19 year-olds (measles), and 15-24 year-olds (rubella) [1,5,10].
The current outbreak of measles, in which the over 10 year-olds
accounted for 10 of the 12 cases in the general population, justifies
the introduction of supplementary MMR vaccination campaigns targeting
the over 10 year-olds in Styria. Based on the vaccination register in
Styria [unpublished data], an average vaccination coverage of 90
percent was reported for the birth cohorts 1999-2008.

Age group specific seroprevalence surveys could provide the required
comprehensive information for designing supplementary age
group-targeted vaccination campaigns Austria-wide. In neighbouring
Germany, adolescents are often not fully vaccinated or unvaccinated
[11]. Coverage is still insufficient to achieve wide enough herd
immunity for measles elimination in central Europe. Continuing with
suboptimal vaccination coverage in certain population groups such as
the adolescents endangers the possibility of achieving the 2010
target for measles and rubella elimination in the WHO European Region.
