["ASF has a severe socio-economic impact and implications for nutrition and food security, both in areas where it is newly introduced and where it is endemic. The high impact is most apparent in countries with a significant commercial pig industry, but this does not mean that smallholder pig farmers are in any way spared. In Africa, ASF has devastating effects on both the commercial and subsistence pig production sectors, but the greatest losses are usually inflicted on the poorer pig producers who are less likely to implement effective prevention (that is, biosecurity) and control strategies. The consequences of ASF include major economic losses throughout the pig value chain and considerable social effects such as loss of employment for farm workers and loss of income for farmers. Pig production is an important source of high quality and cheap dietary protein in many countries, particularly for poor communities, and the income generated is used to access a variety of dietary requirements. The farmers often lack financial resources to restart production following outbreaks in the absence of compensation schemes and recovery plans.

"Outbreaks of ASF in the recent past have resulted in losses of between 30-50% of the pig populations in a number of countries. In some cases, the entire village pig populations are wiped out either by ASF-related deaths or stamping out measures."
