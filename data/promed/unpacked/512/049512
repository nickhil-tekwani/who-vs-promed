[Now that the incidence in the UK of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease --
abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail -- shows evidence of
having peaked, or at least of having reached a plateau, the Department of
Health's full table of definite and probable CJD deaths and referrals will
no longer be reproduced in ProMED-mail. Only the monthly summary of variant
CJD statistics will be posted, unless there is a substantial change in the
situation. The full table, updated monthly, can be accessed at the
Department of Health website:
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/08/35/86/04083586.pdf>.
The precise definition of the terms deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD
cases, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the Department of
Health website or by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in this
thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693) -

Monthly variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of Mon 6 Dec 2004
----------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 6 Dec 2004] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the form
of the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The situation is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 106
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 39
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 2
Total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 147
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 152
(The next update will be published on Mon 10 Jan 2005)
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 1 Nov 2004, the
number of deaths from definite vCJD has increased by one, raising the total
number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD to 147. The number of
probable vCJD cases still alive remains at 5. Therefore, the overall total
number of definite or probable vCJD cases now becomes 152. - Mod.CP]

[2] Increased concern about protection of the blood supply

Concerns about 2nd wave of "mad cow" prion infection
----------------------------------------------------
There is increasing evidence that infectious prions that can cause variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the human form of "mad cow" disease, can
be transmitted through blood transfusion, according to Roger Eglin PhD,
head of the National Transfusion Microbiology Laboratories for the English
National Blood Service. He spoke at a symposium on transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs) and was joined by prominent government, public
health, and blood safety experts from around the globe, including the US
and Canada, who raised concerns about a 2nd wave of the disease brought
about by human-to-human transmission via blood transfusions.
Citing 2 confirmed cases in the UK, where vCJD was transmitted via blood
transfusions from donors who were young and apparently healthy at the time
of donation, Dr Eglin said the current decline in reported cases could be
followed by a new wave of vCJD infections around the world of unknown
magnitude. These concerns were echoed by the panelists, who noted the
increase of vCJD in France from 6 to 8 [now 9] cases in just the past few
months and the news that blood from a [now 2] vCJD-infected donor was
transfused to a number of people and used to manufacture medicines. "This
may not be a disease in decline, despite the low number of cases today,"
said Dr Eglin. "There is much uncertainty over the number of cases
predicted for the UK. Estimates of up to 25 000 total cases have been
predicted with an incidence of one in 24 000 of the UK population."
The 2nd case of transfusion-transmitted vCJD in the UK demonstrated that 2
human genotypes are susceptible to the infectious prion, rather than one,
as had been previously reported. According to Dr Eglin, this extends the
number of people at risk from 40 to 90 per cent of the UK population. Since
people can incubate vCJD with no clinical signs or symptoms of disease for
a decade or more, there is no way to determine who or how many people may
be harboring the fatal prion or how many of these people may be blood
donors. A single vCJD-infected blood donor has the potential to amplify
transmission to several people, creating the basis for a far more
widespread infection. Dr Eglin described the measures taken by the UK,
including deferral of previously transfused donors and 100 per cent
leukocyte (white blood cell) reduction, to increase the safety of the blood
supply.
David M Asher, MD, chief and supervisory medical officer with the FDA (Food
and Drug Administration) Division of Emerging and Transfusion-Transmitted
Diseases at the Center of Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER),
expressed heightened concern about vCJD transmission by blood due to the 2
cases in the UK [and now 2 cases in France]. He concurred that a 2nd wave
is possible and said that the number of people who may be harboring the
infection in the UK, 237 per million, is a minimum estimate and may be too
low. The US has a number of measures in place to protect blood safety, he
said, but stated that it is not possible to remove every blood risk by
donor deferral. "If we attempt to defer every donor who spent time in the
UK from 1980 to 1996, the blood donor loss would be enormous," he
explained. On 14 Oct 2004, the FDA TSE Advisory Committee made the
recommendation that no additional residency deferrals are necessary in the
US at this time.
Dr Asher also commented that species barrier protection from TSEs other
than BSE is not absolute. He listed several TSE infections found in animals
in the US, including chronic wasting disease (CWD), which is found in both
farmed and wild deer and elk in many Midwestern and Western states and
parts of Canada. Although there is no evidence of transmission to humans,
hunters are being warned to avoid contact with or eating the meat of
animals that may be infected with CWD.
Although Canada has detected only one case of BSE and one of vCJD to date
[probably contracted in the UK], the country has taken a number of
precautionary measures to help prevent further infections, similar to those
taken in the UK, according to Dr Peter R Ganz, director of the Centre for
Biologics Evaluation (CBE), Health Canada. Dr Ganz cited the precautionary
principle -- "If risk is possible, then we must err on the side of caution"
-- which, he said, drove Canada's actions even before the emergence of
possible vCJD transmission through blood. Dr Ganz noted that Canada's
surveillance system, its 3 deferral directives to exclude donors with the
potential for infectious disease, and the implementation of universal
leukocyte reduction has reduced the potential risk of vCJD transfusion
transmission by about 92 per cent.

[3] Implications of transgenic mouse experiments

Everyone at risk from mad cow disease
-------------------------------------
No one is immune to the human form of mad cow disease, variant CJD
(Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), new research suggests today [Sun 14 Nov 2004].
Some people, whose genetic make-up normally acts as a barrier against
infection, may ultimately develop a different, and so far unrecognized,
type of disease, it is claimed. Scientists have shown that individuals with
a pair of genes known as MM -- about a third of the population -- acquire
vCJD relatively easily. No one with a different paring, VV, has been known
to suffer the disease.
Then, in August 2004, it emerged that a patient from a mixed MV genetic
group had been infected with vCJD from contaminated blood, without showing
any symptoms. Just over half the population has the MV pairing. The news
sparked fears of a mad cow disease "time bomb" in the population, with
thousands of people unwittingly carrying the brain disease on a long
incubation fuse.
Now experiments on mice by British and Australian scientists have increased
the uncertainty still further. They suggest that even people with the
highly resistant VV genotype might be at risk, though it would probably
take them longer to become ill. If they did develop symptoms, they could be
quite different from those normally associated with vCJD.
Variant CJD emerged from the cattle disease BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy), spreading to humans via infected beef. It has been linked
to 146 deaths in Britain, and causes a specific set of symptoms and changes
in the brain. Classic, or sporadic, CJD is from the same group of diseases
-- spread by defective prion proteins -- but has a very different pathology
and is not associated with eating contaminated meat.
The scientists, led by Jonathan Wadsworth at University College London,
carried out tests on mice engineered to carry human genes. They showed that
the V gene [allele] severely restricted the propagation of both BSE and
vCJD prions. But the results indicated that it was possible for "V" mice to
develop a novel form of the disease. It also affected the brain but
produced a different pattern of damage from any seen in known versions of
the illness, including variant and sporadic CJD. The researchers wrote in
the journal Science: "While caution must be exercised extrapolating from
animal models, even where, as here, faithful recapitulation of molecular
and pathological phenotypes is possible, our findings argue that primary
human BSE prion infection, and secondary infection with vCJD prions by
iatrogenic routes (through medical procedures), may not be restricted to a
single disease phenotype." None of the affected mice in the study developed
visible symptoms. But the scientists pointed out that laboratory mice only
had a 2 year life span, which may be less than the disease's incubation period.
Dr Rudy Castellani, director of neuropathology at Michigan State University
Clinical Center in the USA, said: "The most alarming point raised in this
paper is the experimental evidence that there may be types of vCJD lurking
in the population unrecognized as BSE-associated CJD."

[4] Prion disease varies with genotype in transgenic mice

Pathology and biochemistry of prion disease varies with genotype in
transgenic mice
--------------------------------------------------
The development of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in transgenic
mice expressing the human PrP gene only occurred in those mice that were
methionine homozygotes at codon 129 of that gene, according to a recently
published study (1). Mice expressing valine at PrP 129 developed a
different type of disease with different neuropathological and molecular
phenotypes and a different rate of secondary (within-species) transmission.
4 distinct forms of the disease-related prion protein (PrPSc) have been
found in the brain tissue of patients with CJD: patients with classical CJD
have PrPSc types 1-3, and patients with vCJD have type 4 PrPSc (2, 3, 4).
Codon 129 of the human PrP gene encodes either methionine or valine. This
polymorphism appears to critically affect the susceptibility of humans to
prion diseases. All vCJD patients (that is, patients with type 4 PrPSc)
tested to date have been homozygous for methionine at codon 129.
In this study, mouse strains with the human PrP gene instead of the mouse
PrP gene (transgenic mice) were given intracerebral inoculation with brain
tissue from vCJD patients and cows with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE). All the mice that were homozygous for methionine at human PrP codon
129 developed clinical disease and neuropathological signs typical of vCJD,
as well as having type 4 PrPSc. Mice that were homozygous for valine at
human PrP codon 129 responded quite differently: only 50 percent became
infected, and they developed type 5 PrPSc. Type 5 was 1st described by the
same research group in 1997 (5), also in mouse studies. Type 5 PrPSc has
type 4-like glycoform ratios but gives type 2-like digestion products after
treatment with proteinase K, and is associated with very weak diffuse PrP
deposition in the brain in contrast to the florid PrP plaques associated
with type 4.
The study went on to investigate the within-species transmission of these
PrP types -- that is, transmission without a species barrier -- and as
such, a model for human-to-human transmission of prion disease.
Within-species transmission of prion disease typically has a high (100 per
cent) attack rate. Surprisingly, the brain inocula derived from 4
clinically-affected mice that were homozygous for valine at human PrP codon
129 failed to transmit clinical disease or asymptomatic prion infection to
other valine homozygous mice of the same breed. Furthermore, when
methionine homozygous mice were inoculated with brain tissue containing
type 5 PrPSc from the valine homozygous mice, some (10 of 13) developed
sub-clinical infections with type 4 PrPSc, and 3 of 13 developed clinical
prion disease with type 2 PrPSc and a neuropathology that resembled that of
human sporadic CJD.
These findings indicate that codon 129 polymorphism determines the ability
of human PrP to form the various types of PrPSc, and also the disease
phenotype resulting from infection with BSE and vCJD prion. Specifically,
human PrP 129 valine appears not to be a compatible substrate for the type
of prion (type 4) seen in vCJD. The authors recommend determination of
PrPSc types among all human patients with prion disease. This may further
contribute to our understanding of patterns of human prion disease in
relation to exposure to BSE or iatrogenic sources of vCJD, and also guard
against missing BSE-related infections that present as disease that
resembles sporadic CJD more closely than vCJD.
Based on these animal models, and therefore with caution, the authors
conclude that human infection with BSE-derived prions may not be restricted
to a single disease phenotype, but may result in sporadic CJD-like -- or
novel -- phenotypes in addition to vCJD, with the type of disease
experienced depending on the genotype of the host source of the infection
and the genotype of the recipient.
