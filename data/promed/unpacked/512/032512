If uncontrolled, a disease known as phytophthora could potentially wipe out avocado and macadamia trees in Murang'a and neighbouring counties in Kenya.

Olivado EPZ Ltd said that after realising the disease had invaded tree nurseries, the company decided to grow its own seedlings through the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation [KALRO] to ensure the pathogen is not transferred to the seedlings. The company has now embarked on training farmers and nursery operators on the disease and how to eradicate it.

Major symptoms of the disease are wilting of leaves and drying up of branches, which leads to the eventual death of the tree. Farmers [are urged] to stop buying seedlings from roadside tree nurseries, whose source of scions is untraceable.

[The fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora cinnamomi_ (Pc) has a wide host range, but different host genera may show different levels of sensitivity. While symptoms vary between hosts, on trees and shrubs (including crops like avocado, macadamia, olive, and some pine species) it mainly causes root rots and stem cankers which destroy the host's access to water and nutrients. Symptoms usually include yellowing of foliage followed by dieback, and sudden death of the host may occur when additional water stress is imposed by a dry season.

The pathogen is soil borne. It is spread with soil and plant material, by water and mechanical means (often by contaminated equipment and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements) and removal or burning of affected plants. Trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective in some tree species, for example for avocado root rot and jarrah dieback in Australia.

The genus includes some of the most destructive pathogens of crops (for example, _P. infestans_, causing potato late blight) as well as native environments (_P. kernoviae_, _P. ramorum_ in Europe, North America; _P. cinnamomi_ in Australia). Eradication or control of phytophthora diseases of trees in Australia and North America have been largely unsuccessful.

In Kenya, Pc, although not new to the country, was for the 1st time reported to cause extensive damage to macadamia crops in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100901.3119).
