In March 1997 ProMED-mail received and posted reports of the occurrence of
Lassa fever in Sierra Leone. Because at that time also there was civil
unrest leading towards revolution and the governmental infrastructure
appeared to be collapsing, it occurred to us that the world should be
warned of the possibility that a person infected with Lassa virus might be
evacuated/repatriated from the unstable situation. We therefore posted such
an alert. As a result, a physician in Alaska called his Senator in
Washington, D.C. and alerted him to the situation. The Senator's office
contacted the U.S. military and asked whether they were prepared for such
an eventuality.
Predictably, they were. One of us (CHC) had contacted both CDC and the US
Army and asked about the availability of the antiviral drug ribavirin,
which is efficacious in the treatment of Lassa virus infections. Neither
had much ribavirin in stock and the manufacturer (ICN) was not producing
ribavirin at the time because of quality control problems.
The Army volunteered to make small quantities of ribavirin available to the
US Navy evacuating team, should such be needed. Meanwhile, the Alaskan
physician had contacted the Captain and Chief Medical Officer of the ship
evacuating civilians from Sierra Leone. The Chief Medical Officer was
unaware of the threat and was most grateful for the offer of ribavirin by
the Army.
Fortunately, no cases of Lassa fever were detected and there was never a
need for the antiviral drug. In this case, ProMED-mail served as a
facilitator. In addition, the discussion on ProMED-mail brought the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration into the picture because that organization
wanted to know why there was not a larger stock of ribavirin available.
Now we have a similar situation, in which expatriates are being repatriated
to their home countries from Sierra Leone. Less than 2 months ago, a UK
citizen was repatriated from Sierra Leone suffering from Lassa fever. There
is Lassa fever in Nigeria as well as in Sierra Leone; the general area is a
"hot spot" of Lassa fever activity. National and international rescue
organizations, the UN and West African peacekeeping forces, should be aware
of the risks.
The address for the manufacturer of ribavirin is:
ICN PHARMACEUTICALS INC.
3300 Hyland Avenue
Costa Mesa, CA 92626
Telephone: (714) 545-0100
As far as we know, ICN still is the only source for ribavirin.
