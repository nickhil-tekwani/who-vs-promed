Americans consume so much salmon these days -- most of it farmed -- that it
is now the third most popular fish in the country, after canned tuna and
shrimp. It is one of those foods nutritionists say is good for you, and the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says you can eat as much of it as you like.

But a report released today by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit
environmental research and advocacy organization, says that 10 samples of
farmed salmon bought at markets on the East and West Coasts were found to be
contaminated with PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, at an average level
far higher than any other protein source, including all other seafood. The
high levels do NOT exceed those set in 1984 by the FDA for commercially sold
fish. But they are in excess of the guidelines set by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) in 1999 for recreationally caught fish. The salmon
tested came from 5 countries, including Canada and the USA.

PCB's, an industrial byproduct identified as a probable human carcinogen,
were banned by the USA in 1976. [If some of the contaminated salmon were
produced in the USA, but PCB's have been banned there for over 25 years,
where is the contamination coming from? - Mod.JW]

The study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but 2 previous
peer-reviewed studies of farmed salmon found similarly high levels of PCB's.
Responding to the fresh findings, Dr. Terry Troxell, a toxicologist in the
FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, (CFSAN) said, "Any time we
have a standard that goes back to the 70's and 80's, it's time to review it."

If consumers applied the findings to the environmental agency's 1999
guidelines, they might be wary of eating farmed salmon more than once a
month.

Farmed salmon accounts for 60 percent of the salmon consumed in the U.S. The
EPA standards, which are far stricter than those used by the FDA, are used by
states to issue weekly consumption advisories for recreational fishing. For
example, New York State says that wild striped bass caught in Jamaica Bay
should be eaten no more than once a week, based on average levels of PCB's in
the fish. [Again, where are the PCB's in NY state waters coming from? -
Mod.JW]

One sample in the farmed salmon study contained levels of PCB's so high that
the EPA's advice would be to eat it no more than once every 2 months. The
remaining 9 samples tested exceeded the agency's weekly
recommendation. "Until we hear differently from the FDA, we would assume
that theirs are the regulations we need to follow," said Alex Trent, acting
director of Salmon of the Americas, an organization of 80 salmon farmers in
the U.S., Canada and Chile. "We assume they know what they are doing, and the
regulations and levels they have promulgated mean that the food, including
farmed salmon, is safe, wholesome and nutritious. EPA and FDA should work out
their differences.

A high-level EPA staff member said the environmental agency's
recommendations "reflect the best science available to make recommendations
to states for setting fish advisories." The guidelines will continue to be
used, he said."

Kimberly Rawlings, a press officer for the FDA, said the FDA was considering
updating its guidelines. "We are clearly aware of it and actively looking at
the science to see whether the science dictates that it needs to be changed,"
she said.

The Environmental Working Group's study followed the analytical methods of
the EPA, said Jane Houlihan, the group's research director. Each sample of
farmed salmon, bought with its skin on, was cut into smaller pieces, ground
up 3 times and mixed to homogenize the meat. A portion of the fish tissue was
then extracted and analyzed for PCB's.

3 previous studies of farmed salmon found similarly high levels of PCB's: a
study conducted at the University of Surrey in England of salmon bought in
Scotland and Belgium and reported last year [2002] in the Journal
Environmental Science and Technology, which is peer-reviewed; a government
study for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, reported in March 2002; and a
study by Dr. Michael Easton of International EcoGenInc in British Columbia,
Canada, reported in 2002 in the journal Chemosphere, also peer-reviewed.

The Easton study, and the one from the Environmental Working Group, found the
level of PCB's in farmed salmon in the USA and Canada 5 to 10 times higher
than those in wild salmon. The average levels of PCB's in wild salmon,
according to the Environmental Working Group report, are about 5 parts per
billion (ppb); in farmed salmon, they are about 27 ppb, far below the FDA
levels of 2000 ppb. EPA guidelines say that if a person eats fish twice a
week, it should contain no more than 4 to 6 ppb of PCB's.

The Environmental Working Group, based in Washington and financed by private
foundations, used the seafood industry's fish consumption data to report how
many Americans regularly eat salmon. About 25 percent of Americans eat
salmon, they say; 23.1 million eat it more than once a month, 1.3 million
people eat it once a week, and 180 000 eat it more than twice a week. From
those figures, the organization conducted what it says is the first cancer
risk assessment of exposure to PCB's from farmed salmon. The assessment
estimates that 800 000 people face an increased lifetime cancer risk of more
than one in 10 000 from eating farmed salmon, and 10.4 million people face an
increased cancer risk exceeding one in 100 000.

Previous studies have shown that PCB levels in farmed salmon are higher than
in wild salmon because of the fish meal they are fed. The meal, made mostly
from ground small fish, has high levels of fish oil to fatten the salmon.
PCB's concentrate in fats. An ounce of farmed salmon has 52 percent more fat
than an ounce of wild salmon, the Department of Agriculture says. In June
[2003], the National Academy of Sciences called for changes in fish farming
and in human consumption to reduce exposure to PCB's.

"When, and if, the FDA changes its limits, we will be the first to comply,"
Mr. Trent said. "They haven't proven this point to the FDA yet. If they had,
they would change their standards."

[The difference between the EPA regulations and those of the FDA reflect the
period when the guidelines were set. There have been changes in science since
the FDA guidelines were established. Furthermore, there have been changes in
the diet of Americans, which should also be considered.

However, a study of 10 samples from 5 countries is not truly representative
of the situation. This article also gives no indication of how the samples
were selected, which may introduce bias into this study. It certainly raises
some questions and points out the differences in the regulated levels of the
different agencies; but without more research, the cause for alarm may be
exaggerated.  Mod.TG]
