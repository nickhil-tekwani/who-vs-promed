An outbreak of diphtheria in southeastern Niger has killed 5 children, the African country's Ministry of Health reported Tuesday [11 Oct 2022], encouraging parents to vaccinate their children against this disease.

The outbreak, the note indicates, began a few days ago in Gouré, within the Zinder region, and was perceived by the local population as a new disease, which led the ministry to release the statement clarifying that it is diphtheria. "This is not a new disease," says the ministry, but an ailment, diphtheria, "that rages from time to time in Africa" and attacks "especially children who are not vaccinated."

Since the outbreak of the epidemic in the town, Health reports that 29 cases have been registered, of which 5 children have died because, says the note, "the parents did not quickly take the patients to the health center" to receive the proper care.

"The 24 cases admitted to the Gouré health center are currently undergoing treatment and 7 of them are already cured. The other 17 continue to be treated and their health is progressing well," says the note, announcing the launch of a vaccination campaign against the disease in the area to benefit children between 1 and 15 years of age.

As Garba Hama, an epidemiologist at a Niamey hospital explained to EFE, it is the 1st time in 2 decades that such a "sudden" outbreak of the disease has been recorded in a Nigerien town. According to the specialist, "vaccination against diphtheria has been free for decades in all public health facilities in Niger, with massive and routine vaccination campaigns. Unfortunately, many parents are still reluctant to take their children to be vaccinated."

"It is a contagious disease caused by a bacillus, which is characterized by the formation of pseudomembranes in the larynx and causes suffocation," said the doctor, who added that "it is manifested by the appearance of angina with fever and other forms of general malaise." If the patient is taken to a health center soon, they recover without any problem, but if the disease is not attended to in time, it can progress to the appearance of false membranes that obstruct the airways and, sometimes, bleed, which causes difficulty to breathe and can cause death.
