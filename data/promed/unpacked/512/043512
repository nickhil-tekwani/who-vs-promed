Cherry disease outbreak suspected in Tasmania
---------------------------------------------
The Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment [DPIPWE] is investigating a suspected case of little cherry disease on a property in the state's south. The disease has never before been detected in Australia.

Andrew Bishop, DPIPWE, says that at this stage, there is no knowledge how the disease came to be in Tasmania, but his department is investigating. "We're doing what we call a trace-back investigation to determine the origin of the plant material. The disease takes some years to manifest itself in the tree, so it's been within the identified trees for some years. We will have to look back at where that planting material came from, and it may be that we have actually found it in Tasmania but it may be elsewhere in Australia."

DNA testing of leaf samples from the tree suspected to be infected are being undertaken and results are expected later this week.

Mr Bishop says the disease is spread in overseas countries by an insect called the apple mealybug, which is not present in Australia. He says if the case is confirmed any infected trees will be removed, but the orchard in question is not under threat. DPIPWE is calling for calm among Tasmanian cherry growers.

[Little cherry disease (LCD) is a serious problem for sweet and sour cherry producers in parts of northern Europe and North America. It can be caused by 2 closteroviruses, _Little cherry virus 1_ (LChV-1, not yet assigned to a genus) and LChV-2 (genus _Ampelovirus_), in single or mixed infections.

Symptoms vary with host cultivars, but may include reduced size and quality of fruit, premature leaf reddening, stunting of seedlings, and some loss of tree vigour. All commercial cherry cultivars are susceptible, and ornamental flowering cherries can be asymptomatic reservoirs of LChV-1.

LChV-2 is transmitted by one or several species of mealybug vectors which can be spread by wind and with packing material in their nymph stages. An insect vector for LChV-1 is not known. Both viruses can be spread by both shoot and root grafting and with infected plant material. Disease management for LCD includes use of certified clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum (removal of infected trees, as mentioned above), and vector control for LChV-2.

While the report above states the absence of the apple mealybug (_Phenacoccus aceris_) as a vector for LChV-2 in Australia, it has been suggested that virus spread by other mealybug species cannot be excluded. It remains to be confirmed which of the 2 viruses the suspected outbreak is due to, but if no insect vectors are involved in Tasmania, the disease will be easier to control by phytosanitation and increased standards of quarantine certification for _Prunus_ planting material.
