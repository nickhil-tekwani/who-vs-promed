CDC Lab Determines Possible Anthrax Exposures: Staff Provided Antibiotics/Monitoring
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC announced today [19 Jun 2014] that approximately 75 Atlanta [Georgia, USA]-based staff are being monitored or provided antibiotics because they may have been unintentionally exposed to live _Bacillus anthracis_ (anthrax) after established safety practices were not followed.

Out of an abundance of caution, CDC is taking aggressive steps to protect the health of all involved, including providing protective courses of antibiotics for potentially exposed staff. Based on most of the potential exposure scenarios, the risk of infection is very low. Based on the review to date, CDC believes that other CDC staff, family members, and the general public are not at risk of exposure and do not need to take any protective action. Although the investigation continues, early reports show that one of its Roybal campus biosafety level 3 (BSL3) labs was preparing _B. anthracis_ samples for research in other CDC labs at lower biosafety levels to yield new means of detecting dangerous pathogens in environmental samples. However, the lab used a procedure that did not adequately inactivate the samples.

The potentially infectious samples were moved and used for experimentation in 3 CDC Roybal campus laboratories not equipped to handle live _B. anthracis_. Workers, believing the samples were inactivated, were not wearing adequate personal protective equipment while handling the material.

Lab safety investigators also determined that, sometime between [6 Jun 2014] and [13 Jun 2014], procedures used in 2 of the 3 labs may have aerosolized the spores. Environmental sampling was done, lab and hallway areas were decontaminated and laboratories will be re-opened when safe to operate.

The unintentional exposure was discovered [13 Jun 2014] when the original bacterial plates were gathered for disposal and _B. anthracis_ colonies (live bacteria) were found on the plates. These plates had appeared negative for _B. anthracis_ at the time samples were distributed to the other CDC laboratories. The review began immediately to assess the health risk, and those workers handling the plates were immediately notified.

CDC's guiding principles for laboratory work are to ensure the safety of all staff and the community and be as transparent as possible about our work as we conduct high-quality scientific research to protect people in this country and around the world.

CDC continues its internal review to determine why validated procedures were not used by the lab. Also, CDC has reported the incident to the Federal Select Agent Program. Given that CDC expert protocols were not followed, disciplinary action(s) will be taken as necessary. In addition, CDC will review the safety protocol again with all employees who work in this area.

It is CDC's obligation to ensure that people feel safe and are safe in the workplace and the community as we conduct our life-saving laboratory work. We will report findings of this review and all steps we take to improve lab-safety processes as a result of this incident.

At least 75 workers at the Atlanta [Georgia] headquarters of the US Centers for Disease Control may have been exposed to anthrax, a deadly infectious disease, the agency said today [19 Jun 2014].

"We are devastated. It is unacceptable. This is what we do best," Paul Mecham of CDC's Environment Health and Safety Compliance Office told ABC News. "Our people are our number one resource. We are going to find out what went wrong and we are going to fix it." The workers are being monitored and offered antibiotics and vaccination, CDC officials said. So far none have shown signs of illness, but symptoms can take 2 months to appear, according to the agency.

Left untreated, the inhaled form of anthrax can be deadly in 85 percent of cases, according to the CDC. Even with treatment, the fatality rate is as high as 45 percent. The risk of infection among the 75 workers is thought to be very low, and the general public is not at risk, CDC officials said.

Initial reports from the CDC stated that staff members were exposed to the anthrax-causing bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ after the Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology Laboratory failed to fully inactivate samples of the live bacteria. The samples were moved to another laboratory where workers were not wearing full protective gear since they believed the samples posed no risk.

Between [6 Jun 2014] and [13 Jun 2014], the infectious samples were used for experiments in 2 different CDC labs that were unequipped to handle the dangerous bacterium, CDC said. At one point, the spores may have even been aerosolized and dispersed into the air, according to the agency. The breach was not discovered until the samples of the bacterium were gathered to be destroyed and the live bacteria were discovered, CDC said. The CDC is still investigating the exposure and has decontaminated lab and hallway areas that were exposed, according to a statement.

Anthrax spores can be breathed in or ingested through contaminated food or water, according to the CDC. The bacterium can also invade the skin through cuts or scrapes. Anthrax cannot be passed from person to person, according to the CDC.

Scientists at laboratories in Atlanta [Georgia, USA] may have been exposed to live anthrax bacteria after researchers failed to follow procedure. As many as 75 scientists working in US federal government laboratories in Atlanta may have been exposed to live anthrax bacteria and are being offered treatment to prevent infection, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday [19 Jun 2014].

The potential exposure occurred after researchers working in a high-level biosecurity laboratory at the agency's Atlanta campus failed to follow proper procedures to inactivate the bacteria. They then transferred the samples, which may have contained live bacteria, to lower-security CDC labs not equipped to handle live anthrax.

Dr Paul Meechan, director of the environmental health and safety compliance office at the CDC, said the agency discovered the potential exposure on the evening of Friday, [13 Jun 2014], and immediately began contacting individuals working in the labs who may have unknowingly handled live anthrax bacteria. "No employee has shown any symptoms of anthrax illness," Meechan said. Meechan said the normal incubation period can take up to 5 to 7 days, though there are documented cases of the illness occurring some 60 days after exposure. Meechan said as many as 7 researchers may have come into direct contact with the live anthrax. But the agency is casting as wide a net as possible to make sure all employees at the agency who may have walked into any of the labs at risk are being offered treatment.

Around 75 individuals are being offered a 60-day course of treatment with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin as well as an injection with an anthrax vaccine.

Meechan said it is too early to determine whether the transfer was accidental or intentional. He said that all employees who were doing procedures to inactivate the bacteria were working in a biosecurity laboratory and were "tier one select agent approved," meaning they had undergone a security reliability review and deemed to be "stable, trustworthy individuals." Meechan said the CDC is conducting an internal investigation to discover how the exposure occurred and said disciplinary measures would be taken if warranted. "This should not have happened," he said. For those exposed, he said, "We're taking care of it. We will not let our people be at risk."

[I have repeated with the ABC and Guardian reports, as each provides a modicum of fresh information. Reading between the lines, the original culture was probably neutralised by irradiation, but in this instance it only impacted the rapid germinating spores -- leaving the slow germinators to be missed on inspection of the test agar plates, but they had emerged as colonies by 13 Jun 2014. Apparently, there was meant to be a 48-hour hold period before release to the testing laboratories. Logically, the CDC Roybal labs were trying out some new aerosol surveillance chips. The suggestion by their compliance officer that this possibly happened not by accident is surprising, but bureaucrats do strange things when defending their agencies. For it to have been intentional would necessitate a prior knowledge that the irradiation had been incomplete, when in fact viability was only demonstrated long after exposure. It is a learning experience for all concerned, and I am glad that they are offering vaccination. Personally, I would miss out on the ciprofloxacin and make do with 3-10 days of doxycycline. We always learn more from our mistakes than when we get it "right." - Mod.MHJ]
