Organization: Mesa County Health Department

We have received a message from Dr. Mick Aduddell, Director, Mesa County
(Colorado) Health Department. Mick explained that the report in the Denver
newspaper, quoting him as saying he was convinced the patient had vesicular
stomatitis, was incorrect. What he actually said was that the patient
definitely had stomatitis and that there had been vesicles.
The patient has now been shown to not have been infected with either
vesicular stomatitis New Jersey or vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus [see
Vesicular stomatitis, human: not - USA (Colorado) (03) 971115004414.
As this is the first time a newspaper has misquoted someone, I thought it
worthwhile posting.
