[There are a couple of unusual items in this report. First, this is a report of dual infection with 2 separate notifiable infections in the same population. Not only is this mentioned in the epidemiologic comments but there is the same number of goats in the same location in both reports. The reports were filed as separate OIE immediate notifications but cross referenced in the Epidemiologic comments section. They have been combined in one posting for the convenience of our readers.

The other unusual item in these reports is that neither one includes information on how the diagnosis was made, although both refer to clinical and basic laboratory information under the "Nature of diagnosis" section of the report. A previous OIE report indicates a PCR finding for Q fever - see references below for Q fever - Netherlands (20): goats, OIE 20091230.4388. - Mod.PC
