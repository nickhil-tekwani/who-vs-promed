Rabies threatens Ethiopian wolf
-------------------------------
The Ethiopian wolf, considered the world's rarest dog, has been hard hit by
a recent rabies outbreak. The recent outbreak has been centered at the Bale
Mountains national park in south eastern Ethiopia, which is home to 300 of
the wolves. So far 20 of the estimated total population of 500 wolves have
died, with more expected to succumb to the virus.
Stuart Williams, coordinator of the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme
in Addis Ababa said, "We should be moving to vaccinate the wolves." Without
vaccination Williams estimates up to 3/4 of the wolves could die, as
happened during a rabies outbreak in 1991. At that time the population
dropped from an estimated 450 wolves to just 120 animals.
With government assistance Williams hopes to begin vaccinating the wolves
by early November. Previously, however, the Ethiopian government has been
reluctant to allow the wolves to be vaccinated. A rabies vaccination
program for wild dogs in the Serengeti received bad publicity after the
animals died out from distemper after receiving the rabies vaccine.
The wolf population only recently recovered from that last outbreak with
diseases like rabies appearing to become more rampant when the population
rises above a density of one wolf per square kilometer. Based on a computer
model designed in 2002, scientists believe it might be possible to prevent
the wolves' extinction by vaccinating only 20 to 40 per cent of the known
population.
Williams believes an immigrant dog is responsible for this latest outbreak,
as all domestic dogs within 10 miles of the park have been vaccinated for
rabies since 1996 in an effort to help protect the wolves. In August and
September each year, farmers from the area move their livestock into the
wolves' territory for grazing and their dogs come with them. Contact
between the dogs and wolves helps spread the disease.
The Ethiopian wolf is a relative of the grey wolf, which is found in
Europe, America, and Asia. In the past 50 years disease [and] the spread of
agriculture and political stability have increased the risk of extinction
for the wolves. The wolves have also been found to be breeding with
domestic dogs, which also threatens their continued existence.

[The rabies oral vaccination programmes in Ontario (foxes), Texas
(coyotes), and Western Europe (foxes) have been very successful, so it
would be logical to expect the proposed Ethiopian programme to be likewise.
Like many infectious diseases, rabies incidence is a function of contact
rates and thus animal densities; in northern Canada, for example, fox
rabies has long been known to be in step with fox densities. A constant
problem with the African national parks has been the villages on the park
peripheries and movement of village animals into the park and wildlife into
the villages. Village dogs are regularly hunted and eaten by park animals,
facilitating disease interactions. With the effective eradication of
rinderpeste, wild animals such as canids and felids have become susceptible
to canine distemper. - Mod.MHJ]
