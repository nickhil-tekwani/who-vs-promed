Avian influenza situation in Indonesia - WHO update 4
-----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a confirmed case of
human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus.

The case is an 8-year-old female from West Jakarta district, DKI
Jakarta Province. She developed symptoms on 1 Apr 2011, was admitted
to a health care facility on 4 Apr 2011 and referred to a hospital on
8 Apr 2011. She died on 11 Apr 2011.

Epidemiological investigation identified a possible risk factor as
exposure to wild bird faeces found around the house. In addition,
during the week before the child developed symptoms, her mother
purchased chickens from a local market.

Laboratory tests have confirmed infection with avian influenza
A(H5N1) virus. Of the 177 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 146
have been fatal.
