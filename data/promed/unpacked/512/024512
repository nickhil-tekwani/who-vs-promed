--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that the website referenced for the above posting appears to have removed the information that you referenced. It is unclear where they obtained their information; much of it was in error.

The BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy] case was from a farm in South West Wales, Carmarthenshire.

Please note that the standard procedures involve tracing, restricting and culling all cohorts still alive (cattle that were present on the farm from one year prior to one year post birth of the BSE case) and relevant offspring (born in the preceding 2 years to death or clinical onset). I can confirm that there was one offspring (now culled) and there are a number of identified cohorts. Some cohorts have left the farm where the BSE case was born. All have been traced and are under restriction. These numbers do not constitute the herd on the farm. We do not carry out whole herd culling for BSE cases.

Please note that cohort owners have 21 days to allow them to appeal against the identification of and official notice given of intention to cull cohorts. Appeals are limited to appealing on the grounds of and producing supporting evidence for the identified animal (cohort) not to have been exposed to or fed the same feeding stuffs as the BSE case. Those that are eventually culled will be screen-tested for TSEs [transmissible spongiform encephalopathies].

[The above corrective information from an official source is much appreciated.

Subscribers are advised to disregard the information in posting 20151007.3698563, citing a source which has been shown to erroneously claim stamping out to be the alleged policy applied in Wales in relation to BSE-affected holding. The correct information is that the prescribed policy is "modified stamping out," in line with EU's official document "REGULATION (EC) No 999/2001 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 22 May 2001, laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies" (OJ L 147 31.5.2001, p. 1). The updated version of the said regulation, as consolidated 5 Aug 2015, is available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02001R0999-20150805.

For the text relevant to the current event in Wales, please go to annex VII: "CONTROL AND ERADICATION OF TRANSMISSIBLE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHIES," Chapter B: "Measures following confirmation of the presence of a TSE in bovine, ovine and caprine animals."

Results of the investigation launched in the affected herd in Carmarthenshire (south west Wales), particularly in relation to the identification of the possible source of infection, are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
