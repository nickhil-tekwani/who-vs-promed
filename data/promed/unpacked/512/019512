In light of the spike of dengue cases in Central Visayas, the Region
7 office of the Department of Health (DoH) has declared a dengue
outbreak covering 6 barangays [smallest administrative division] in
the region. "This week [week of 27 Sep 2010] has been the peak season
of the dengue cases and we already anticipated this given the average
trend in the last 5 years," she said.

Meanwhile, DoH-7 regional epidemiology surveillance unit (RESU) nurse
Rennan Cimafranca bared that dengue cases in the region remains high
with 8708 cases covering the months of January to 25 Sep [2010] this
year. It is 75.5 percent higher as compared to last [2009] on the
same period. However, fatalities are fewer this year, with only 63
deaths while last year RESU recorded 67. Cebu city tops the list with
the most number of cases posting 27.4 percent out of the total cases
followed by Tagbilaran City and Dumaguete City.

Meanwhile, the number of dengue cases recorded by the National
Epidemiology Center (NEC) from January to 18 Sep [2010] reached 90
771, which is 124.37 percent higher compared to the same period last
year [2009]. There were also 611 deaths registered by NEC. With this
development, health officials asked residents of areas affected by
water interruption to take caution on where they store water so as
not to make breeding grounds of dengue-carrying mosquitoes. "Our
concern is for the parts of Quezon City that have no water for the
next few days. The public should be very careful not only in the
water that they will drink but the water that they will collect. They
should be made aware that dengue mosquitoes breed in clean and
stagnant water," health secretary Enrique T Ona said.

The DoH chief said there is now a downward [dengue case] trend in
Western Visayas, Eastern Mindanao, and Central Visayas. This is also
the same in Region 1 although in La Union, cases were reported to be
increasing. Outbreaks of dengue were reported in La Union and Capiz,
particularly in Roxas City.

Over 3000 residents of the northeastern province of Surin have been
infected with dengue fever, which has become a widespread concern in
all 17 districts of the province.

MD Sa-ard Weeracharoen of the Surin Provincial Public Health Office
revealed that the accumulated number of dengue fever patients in the
province over the 1st 8 months of this year [2010] stood at 3120 with
the infection rate of 226.44 per 100 000 population. He added that
the prevalence of the disease had become a worrying issue in all
districts of the province.

Surin province now ranks 16th in the country in terms of the number
of dengue fever infections. MD Sa-ard attributed the outbreak of the
disease nationwide to the wet conditions during the rainy season,
which are conducive to mosquito breeding.

The public health officer also advised people experiencing symptoms
of dengue fever, such as high fever, muscle pain, rash, nausea, and
loss of appetite, to see the doctor immediately as the disease can
occur in people of all ages and can lead to death.

[The situation of dengue infection during the 1st 8 months of 2010 in
Surin province was reported in PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Thailand
(12): 20100906.3193.

According to the Thai Ministry of Public Health, Bureau of
Epidemiology's (BOE) report of cases and deaths of suspected dengue
infection, as of week 38 (19-25 Sep 2010), available in Thai at
<http://epid.moph.go.th/?page=prior>, there were 3203 cases and one
fatality due to dengue infection in Surin province between 1 Jan 2010
and 25 Sep 2010. The attack rate was 232.47 per 100 000 population
and the case fatality rate was 0.03 percent.

According to the Thai Ministry of Public Health, BOE's report of the
situation of dengue infection in Thailand, between 1 Jan 2010 and 21
Sep 2010, available in Thai at
<http://epid.moph.go.th/wesr/file/y53/F53381.pdf>, a total of 86 407
cases and 100 deaths were reported nationwide. The attack rate was
136.02 per 100 000 population, which is 2.23 times higher than the
attack rate during the same period in 2009. The case fatality rate
was 0.12 percent. The highest percentage of cases was reported in the
10-14 year old age group (24.83 percent), followed by the 15-19 year

<http://www.thanhniennews.com/2010/Pages/20100924180447.aspx>


The Vietnamese government is urging its public health agencies to
strengthen measures to contain the spread of dengue fever. So far,
the mosquito-borne disease has sickened 55 430 people across the
country, 42 of whom have died, since the beginning of this year
[2010], according to a government dispatch released last week [week
of 13 Sep 2010]. The number of confirmed cases has spiked in the
middle of the country, the dispatch said.

Health officials from the central region have reported a 2-fold
increase in cases compared to the 1st 8 months of last year [2009].
Meanwhile, the Central Highlands region has reported nearly 11 times
as many cases as they did by September 2009.

Nguyen Van Binh, deputy chief of the health ministry's Department of
Preventive Health, said the disease is on the rise in the southern
region as well.

However, local agencies failed to conduct a proper preventative
campaign, he said. Locals still aren't fully aware of the
preventative measures they can take (such as, spraying, disrupting,
or draining standing water) to decrease their chance of infection.

In fact, dengue is peaking in Ho Chi Minh City, which is seeing 300
hospitalized cases every week, Tran Ngoc Huu, head of the Pasteur
Institute in HCMC, said. Dengue is not restricted to suburban
districts anymore, but has spread to central ones like districts 1,
10, and 4, according to experts.

One of the city's major pediatric hospitals, Children's Hospital No.
2, reported over 600 kids with the disease within the 1st 2 weeks of
September [2010]. Nearly half of them were hospitalized for treatment
-- a 30 percent increase over last month [August 2010]. The hospital
further advised that 10 percent of its new patients are in critical
condition where they may suffer circulatory failure, neurological
problems, and hemorrhaging.

The Hospital for Tropical Diseases, meanwhile, said it has recorded
over 4000 dengue cases since the beginning of this year [2010] -- 50
percent of which were in critical condition. A representative from
the hospital said dengue among adults is often accompanied by
unexpected complications. Without strong preventive measures, the
epidemic will spread even more, Huu warned.

The same situation was reported in Hanoi, where dengue cases have
spread to all of the city's 29 districts. Trinh Thi Ngoc, chief of
the Bach Mai Hospital's infectious diseases department, said many of
the hospitalized victims suffer from internal bleeding which
manifests itself in vomiting blood.

According to experts from the Ministry of Health, the epidemic will
last till November [2010]. They expect to see more infected cases,
more critical cases, and more deaths with unexpected happenings

[The newswire above describes the complicated situation of dengue
outbreaks in many provinces throughout Viet Nam, especially in the
central and highland central regions, where the cumulative reported
number of dengue fever cases are 2 and 11 times higher than the
reported numbers for the same 1st 9 month period in 2009, respectively.

Although the updated report from Ministry of Health is not available
yet, the report (available in Vietnamese at <http://bit.ly/8XoM8s>)
dated 20 Aug 2010 stated a 5 percent decrease in the number of dengue
fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases, and a reduction
of number of deaths in the whole country compared with the same period in 2009.

According to the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific
(WHO/WPRO) report, available at
<http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>, as of 14 Sep 2010,
there were a total of 42 314 cases and 33 deaths reported in Viet Nam

The health secretary, Lorenzo Gonzalez Feliciano, confirmed Friday [1
Oct 2010] that another person died due to dengue virus [infection],
raising the total [number of dengue deaths] to 24 so far [in 2010].
According to the report for [epidemiological] week 36, covering the
period from 3-9 Sep [2010], 861 cases were reported, 648 cases above
the epidemic threshold. DHF cases have remained at 28 so far this year.

"We continue to work hard against the dengue epidemic on the island.
In conjunction with the CDC Dengue Division in Puerto Rico, we are
carrying out an action plan to continue to impact and educate
communities in the prevention and elimination of breeding mosquito
sites. Also, we are increasing surveillance to include mosquito
vectors and so direct our efforts more precisely," said the secretary.

"Interestingly, the 2nd week of October in previous years has seen a
rise in the spread of this disease. It is extremely important to
remain vigilant and continue to perform all the preventive measures
that have been recommended to the population," Gonzalez Feliciano said

"For the 6th consecutive week, the number of patients who consulted a
general practitioner for a syndrome suggestive of dengue fever is
down," announced the Interregional Epidemiology Unit [CIRE] in its
weekly review on the evolution of the dengue epidemic. According to
this, "during the 4th week of September 2010, 1127 patients consulted
for dengue against 1483 the previous week, a decrease of 23 percent.
The weekly number of consultations is now below the peaks observed
earlier but is still very high," notes the CIRE.

The same trend is observed in Meynard [Martinique Island]. "In the
adult emergency CHU [University Hospital Center] of Fort de France,
the number of consultations for suspected dengue stabilized during
the 4th week of September 2010, with 39 patients referred, 8 of whom
were hospitalized. Emergencies at the pediatric MFME [Mother and
Child Hospital], are down as 34 children aged under 16 consulted
during the 4th week of September 2010, against 105 the previous week.
The number of hospitalizations has decreased; only 5 children were
hospitalized between 20-27 Sep [2010]. " According to CIRE, the
epidemiological situation continues to improve in the central
districts. However, for some municipalities of the Atlantic coast, in
the south (Ducos, Diamant, Sainte-Luce, Sainte-Anne, Marin, Trinity)
incidence rates remain high, as in the north (Carbet, Saint-Pierre
Basse Pointe).

The official death toll of the epidemic is now 16, with 39 700 cases
clinically suggestive of dengue and 583 patients hospitalised.
