Cow death sparks virus risk probe
----------------------------------
The mystery death of a cow in Cumbria [in England, just south of
the Scottish border. - Mod.JW] has sparked a government
investigation into any virus risk to humans. State vets are also
examining the unexplained deaths of a further 20 animals as "a
matter of urgency". The alert was triggered by the death of a
milking heifer at a farm in Cumbria late in 2003.

The government's deputy chief vet, Frank Landeg, said the Health
Protection Agency is looking into whether humans could be at risk.
Mr Landeg said experts had been looking for any possible human
link to the polio-like virus since the milking heifer died before
Christmas 2003.

The animal's death could not be put down to any known cattle
disease and has sparked concerns that an unknown condition
could be in circulation. Tests on the heifer were carried out at the
government's veterinary laboratory in Penrith.

It is thought a virus may be responsible for the condition, described
as a type of cattle polio. But, so far, tests for various known bovine
diseases have all proved negative. At present there is no evidence
to suggest a risk to humans, but scientists are not ruling it out.

It is thought the brain disease vCJD originally passed to humans
from cows infected with the closely related condition BSE.

Analysis of this cow's brain showed that the disease affected the
white matter. This led to paralysis for 5 to 6 days, followed by death.

Mr Landeg defended not making details of the investigation public
earlier. He said: "It does take time to put together a group to look
at this, bearing in mind what we are talking about here is a possible
examination of significance to man. "There is a great deal of
uncertainty about this."

A spokesman from the Department for Environment and Rural
Affairs (Defra) said the case was being carefully investigated. He
said: "The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) have recorded
possibly a new condition in cattle in the UK. "In layman's terms, a
type of cattle polio was identified which we haven't seen before."

The animal was tested for a battery of diseases, all of which proved
negative. The spokesman said no meat from the animal had
been allowed into the food chain.

Mr Landeg added: "The fact is that we do not know whether there is
any significance for man, because we have not been able to isolate
a causal agent."

[This news item includes some additional information, such as the
location and timing of the initial disease incident and the possibility -
- yet to be substantiated -- of similar cases in the past.

2 statements need clarification: on the one hand, a "polio-like virus"
is mentioned; on the other hand, it is stated that "no casual agent
has been isolated". Can it be speculated that a "polio-like" virus, the
etiology of which not yet established, has been detected by
electron-microscopy? - Mod.AS]
