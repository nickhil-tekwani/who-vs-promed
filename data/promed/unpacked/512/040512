Human Rabies --- Iowa, 2002
-----------------------
On 28 Sep 2002, a man aged 20 years residing in Linn County, Iowa, died
from rabies encephalitis caused by infection with a variant of rabies virus
associated with silver-haired (_Lasionycteris noctivagans_) and eastern
pipistrelle (_Pipistrellus subflavus_) bats. This is the first case of
human rabies in Iowa since 1951. This report summarizes the investigation
of the case by the Linn County and Iowa public health departments. Bats
found in living quarters should be submitted to local public health
laboratories for rabies testing.

On 16 Sep 2002, the man sought care at the emergency department of a Cedar
Rapids hospital complaining of nausea and vomiting, generalized abdominal
pain, shortness of breath, headache, and back stiffness. He reported
drinking numerous beers and expressed a concern about alcohol poisoning.
The patient was treated with an antiemetic and discharged with
prescriptions for antianxiety and antinausea medications. He returned later
the same day for reevaluation but left without being seen. He returned
again the next day complaining of the same symptoms, at which time he was
noted to be hostile, paranoid, and hallucinating. He was admitted to the
hospital with a diagnosis of suspected drug reaction or withdrawal
syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram
(EEG) performed during the first 24 hours of hospitalization were normal,
and the patient received multiple doses of sedative-hypnotic drugs for
treatment of agitation. His condition deteriorated with development of
fever of 101.5 F (38.6 C) and increasing tremors, followed by intractable
seizure requiring intensive care. On 19 Sep 2002, he was placed on
ventilator support. He received empiric therapy for encephalitis, including
acyclovir and ceftriaxone, and multiple anticonvulsants. On 23 Sep 2003,
the patient had evidence of profound neurologic impairment with fixed and
unreactive pupils, and repeat neuroimaging showed early herniation. A
surgical procedure to decrease intracranial pressure was performed, and a
brain biopsy (occipital lobe) was taken. Contact and droplet precautions
were initiated after the procedure. On 28 Sep 2003, ventilator support was
withdrawn, and the patient died.

On 25 Sep 2003, clinical specimens, including occipital lobe biopsy tissue
impression slides, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva, were submitted for
rabies virus evaluation to the University of Iowa Hygienic Laboratory
(UHL). Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining of the occipital lobe
biopsy slides was inconclusive but suggestive of rabies infection. A
subsequent nuchal biopsy, taken on 28 Sep 2003 and sent to CDC
laboratories, was strongly positive by DFA for rabies virus antigen and was
positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for
rabies virus RNA. The virus variant involved in this infection was
determined by DNA sequence analysis to be most similar to variants found in
silver-haired and eastern pipistrelle bats. The diagnosis was confirmed
postmortem at UHL by DFA examination of specimens from the brain stem and
cerebellum.

The source of the patient's infection remains unclear. No specific history
of exposure to bats was reported. The patient had been bitten by a dog
approximately 12 days before admission; the animal was determined to be
free of rabies. No evidence of bat infestation in the patient's house was
found, and family and friends did not recount any episodes of potential
contact between the patient and bats.

The patient apparently was healthy before this incident. A substantial
portion of the patient's social activity occurred during evenings, and
preliminary investigation suggested that multiple persons could have been
exposed to live virus from the patient through shared use of glasses,
bottles, cigarettes, and other vehicles for saliva contamination of mucus
membranes. The patient was a musician and had traveled to recording studios
in several cities in Iowa and Illinois during the prodrome of his illness.
Because family members were not able to provide public health authorities
with contact information for many of the patient's associates, a decision
was made, with consent of family members, to release the patient's name to
the media to facilitate contact tracing and screening for rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). County public health staff also attended
funeral services to counsel associates of the patient who had not yet come
forward. A total of 53 family members or associates of the patient received
PEP. No persons with potential exposure outside of the Cedar Rapids area
were identified.

Several hospital staff also reported potential exposure to the patient's
bodily fluids before isolation precautions were initiated. Public health
officials presented information to potentially exposed employees on 30 Sep
2003. Hospital staff were requested by hospital administrators to make
their own risk assessment and decision about starting PEP based on the
information provided. A total of 71 hospital staff, including 5 physicians,
received PEP.

Editorial Note:

Incidence of human rabies in the United States has declined sharply during
the last several decades, from an average of 11 persons per year in the
1950s to fewer than 3 persons per year during the 1990s (1,2). This decline
is associated largely with successful control of rabies in domestic dogs.
Nonbite-associated (i.e., cryptic) cases of rabies -- those cases for which
no evidence or history of animal bite is established (3) -- now constitute
the largest category of human rabies cases in the United States (78 percent
of all cases occurring during the 1990s compared with 23 percent during the
1950s). A history of animal bite was reported in only 7 of the last 35
documented human rabies cases (5 dog bites acquired overseas and 2 bat
bites acquired domestically). The high proportion of cases that are
reported as cryptic probably is attributable to several factors, including
the difficulties associated with obtaining detailed exposure histories from
neurologically impaired patients and the possibility that bites from very
small mammals, such as bats, might go unnoticed.

Molecular typing of viral RNA obtained from clinical specimens permits
rapid identification of the virus variant involved in the infection, but
virus typing in the absence of specific exposure history cannot identify
the source of human rabies infections definitively. Variants specific to
one vertebrate host can be found in animal species other than that of their
natural reservoir; for example, bat-variant rabies viruses have been found
in domestic cats (4). However, virus typing provides a valuable
epidemiologic clue to the source of an infection and is important for
targeting prevention efforts. In the case described in this report, the
rabies virus type was determined to be most similar to that found naturally
in silver-haired and eastern pipestrelle bats, which range widely
throughout North America, including Linn County. Both are solitary,
forest-dwelling animals not found commonly in human dwellings.

This is the third report of human rabies published during 2002 (5,6). All
were attributed to viruses identified as bat variants (2
silver-haired/eastern pipistrelle variant and one Mexican free-tail
variant); none of the 3 cases had a specific history of bat bite recorded.
Of 35 human rabies deaths recorded since 1990 in the United States, 26 (74
percent) have been associated with bat-variant rabies viruses, but in only
2 cases was a bite history documented (2). Human rabies is preventable with
properly performed and timely administration of rabies PEP (7). However,
prevention efforts are complicated if the patient does not recognize that
an exposure has occurred.

Although bats have an important role in local ecosystems, they can be a
source of rabies infection in humans. Messages to the public should
emphasize that bats can transmit rabies virus to humans. Bats should be
excluded from human living quarters and should never be handled with bare
hands. When a bat is found in living quarters and the possibility exists
that an unrecognized exposure has occurred, the animal should be submitted
to a local public health laboratory for diagnostic testing. Testing of
suspect animals ensures rapid PEP where indicated and minimizes unnecessary
prophylaxis in persons not exposed to rabies virus.
