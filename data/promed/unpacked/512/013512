Quebec's health ministry is reporting what it believes to be the 1st local outbreak of toxoplasmosis -- a parasitic disease that can severely affect pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems -- linked to the consumption of undercooked venison eaten outside the province.

A bulletin published by the ministry notes that 5 people in a party of 10 hunters from Quebec fell ill after a 12-day hunting trip last November and December [2018] in the US. During the trip, they ate meat on site from the deer they had killed. It was determined later that one of the deer had unidentified lesions on its liver.

Subsequent examinations of the affected hunters confirmed a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis, and health officials are recommending that hunters avoid eating venison killed in Illinois, where many local species seem to have been infected with the disease.

Authorities also suggest that all game meat be cooked to an internal temperature of 74 deg C (165 deg F) and not be served to pregnant women or those with weak immune systems. It is also recommended that those handling the meat wash their hands and that any cutting of the meat be done on cutting boards used only for that purpose.

[_Toxoplasma gondii_ has an unusual wide host range and can infect all mammals and birds. A study of white-tailed deer in the US found that 41% were _T. gondii_ seropositive (Gerhold RW, et al. _Toxoplasma gondii_ seroprevalence and genotype diversity in select wildlife species from the southeastern United States. Parasit Vectors 2017;10:508).

Therefore, it is not a surprise that the hunters may have caught an acute infection with _T. gondii_ if they ate meat from deer without proper cooking. - Mod.EP
