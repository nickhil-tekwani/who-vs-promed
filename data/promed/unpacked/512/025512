An alert has been issued for bunchy top (BBT) and moko diseases of banana. All eyes are on fusarium race 4 (TR4) [see comments below] and none on the banana bunchy top virus. Its effects on production and the costs of its control are high. In the Philippines, for example, more plants are lost to BBT than to TR4. BBT can cause the loss of thousands of plants in one day, so it is recommended to take the necessary precautions to avoid it entering Ecuador. In the countries of the Andean region this disease is not yet present. The contingency plan to prevent the entry of BBT is a very complicated matter. The important thing is to avoid bringing in infected material, because the aphid vector already exists in Ecuador.

Moko is also a dangerous disease. Ecuador's former minister of agriculture, Alfredo Saltos Guale, stresses the importance of controlling also this bacterial disease. Right now, he says, there are quarantined plantain farms in Esmeraldas [province], because these crops are even more susceptible than bananas [see ProMED-mail post 20141126.2990348].

[Banana bunchy top
-----------------
_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the type member of the genus _Babuvirus_ (family Nanoviridae) and only affects _Musa_ species. It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting and death of the host plant. The virus is spreading in Africa, Australasia and the Pacific Islands. It has been reported from Hawaii and quarantine interception was recorded in Brazil, but otherwise it appears to be absent from the Americas so far. BBTV is transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ and infectious insects may be spread on plant material or by air currents. The virus is also spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools).

Disease management is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of inoculum, use of clean planting material and frequent scouting for new outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV from a cluster of plants is impossible, the only option is to kill off all plants in the group. Tolerant varieties can enable some crop production in infected areas, but may still support virus replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs. There are 2 groups of BBTV isolates, the South Pacific and the Asian groups, which is thought to suggest that the virus has spread after movement of its hosts from the Indo-Malaysian region to Africa and the Americas.

Moko
----
Moko, as well as the other bacterial wilts of banana and plantain known as blood disease and bugtok, are caused by members of the _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (Rs) species complex. Symptoms of moko (and bugtok) include wilting, fruit rot, blackening of suckers, and bacterial ooze. Moko is one of the most serious banana diseases, with reported yield losses of over 70 percent, but all 3 diseases cause severe yield losses and eventually death of the plants.

The bacteria are spread by water, wind, infected plant material or soil, and mechanical means (including human activities, animals, insects). Suckers for propagation pose a high risk of spreading the diseases. Ornamentals and weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Infection can occur via roots or flowers depending on the host cultivar and pathogen strain. Control primarily relies on exclusion from new areas and eradication of infected plants where the pathogens are present. Disease management may also include cultural, chemical (for example soil treatments), and biocontrol (antagonistic microorganisms) measures. Certified clean planting material is essential. No resistant banana or plantain cultivars are known.

Moko is present in the region and was reported in Ecuador for the 1st time in 2014 on plantain (ProMED-mail post 20141126.2990348). Plantains are _Musa_ cultivars in the group of AAB hybrids (see link below) and mostly used for cooking.

Panama disease TR4 (caused by the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ tropical race 4) is of great concern worldwide (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives) and has recently been confirmed for the 1st time from the Americas, in Colombia (ProMED-mail post 20190820.6630576). As a response, FAO (Food & Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations) has now launched an emergency project to combat TR4 (see link below).
