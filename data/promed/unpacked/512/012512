Farmer tells of anguish at poultry cull
---------------------------------------
The farmer at the centre of a rare poultry disease outbreak in the Lothians
today [14 Oct 2006] spoke of his devastation as government officials
prepared to cull more than 15 000 of his birds.
Keith Chalmers-Watson, the managing director of the company that runs
Fenton Barns, near Drem in East Lothian, said it would take his business
years to recover from the outbreak of Newcastle disease.
The cull at Fenton Barns, as one of the biggest suppliers of partridges in
the UK, is expected to lead to serious shortages of the birds on the menus
of some of the finest restaurants in the country.
It is impossible to insure against the disease, which is not harmful to
humans, so the effect on the farm could be devastating.
Mr Chalmers-Watson said today [14 Oct 2006] that no new birds had been
introduced to the farm in recent months so he believed that the source of
the outbreak was likely to be wild pigeons. That has also led to fears that
any other farm that breeds avian species, including turkeys or chicken,
could be hit by the disease. The farm is also home to some of the most
endangered species of game birds in the world, many of which are owned by
foreign governments.
That has sparked frantic negotiations by Mr. Chalmers-Watson, also
vice-president of the Royal Pheasant Association, to ensure that these 60
threatened species are not included in the cull. Mr Chalmers-Watson,
managing director of DC Watson & Sons, said: "We usually sell to London
food markets, but now we'll have nothing; it will have a devastating effect
on us.
"Because we will not now get any eggs from this batch, it means next year's
[2007] stock will also be lost to us. I've been breeding for 50 years, and
I've never experienced anything like this.
"I believe that wild pigeons may have caused this, although that is not
proven. It can't be anything else. It is impossible to estimate the cost to
us of this, but it is horrific thinking about it.
"We are a specialist supplier and one of the few that supply partridge;
this will have a big impact on the major restaurants in London and up here."
The farm will be liable for compensation from the Department for
Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) for each bird that is
culled, but the payment will not account for future earnings from the
birds, such as from eggs they hatch. It means the farm will suffer
generations of losses.
Today, there is a 3 km protection zone drawn around the farm by Defra, with
disinfection measures in place at the entrances and exits of all poultry
premises. There is also a 10 km surveillance zone where the movement of
poultry, captive birds, racing pigeons and hatching eggs are restricted,
and bird shows and other gatherings are banned.
Mr Chalmers-Watson also breeds rare game birds, and 60 of the 240 different
species are on site at his farm, many leased from numerous international
governments. He said: "We have a valuable collection of rare and endangered
game birds. They are bloodlines of global importance, and we are seeking
derogation that these are not slaughtered; they are priceless. This is not
just an ordinary farm; we have possibly the most valuable collection of
game birds in Europe."
Officials announced that all the fowl kept on the premises were to be
culled in line with EU requirements. They added that the bug mainly affects
poultry and there was no danger to humans eating meat from a bird affected
by the disease. Restrictions will remain in place for a minimum of 21 days
in the protection zone and 30 days in the surveillance zone.
No one at nearby Hawthorn Bank Farm, home to a large collection of
chickens, was willing to comment on the threat posed to it.
A spokesman for Defra said: "Keepers of poultry in the [controlled] areas
are being contacted with information on disease and how to maximize
biosecurity protection for their flock."
The last known outbreak of Newcastle disease in the UK was in July 2005,
when a large flock of pheasants was culled near Surrey.

[Photos of NCD clinical signs (in chickens) are available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/pictures/newcastled.htm>.
According to The Guardian, the infected avians were gray partridges; see
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-6146837,00.html>. (Mary
Marshall is acknowledged for forwarding the above newswire).
Information on the vaccination history of the affected flock -- if
vaccinated at all -- would be helpful. According to Defra's information to
the OIE, prophylactic vaccination of poultry against NCD is undertaken
routinely in the UK. However, this might be different relating to game
birds. NCD vaccination of game birds is difficult and requires specialist
knowledge and experience. Gray partridges demonstrated a poor response to
vaccination with any of the vaccine strains used in a French trial; see
Guittet et al. Safety And efficacy of Newcastle disease vaccines in game
birds. In: Proceedings of the joint 2nd annual meeting of the National
Newcastle Disease And Avian Influenza Laboratories of countries of the
European Union, Brussels, 18-19 Oct 1994, pp 93-96, available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/proceedings1994.pdf>.

The following vaccines were used: Live vaccine strains Hitchner B1 (HB1)
and La Sota, administered by eye drop of one dose (0.03 ml) per bird; and
inactivated oil adjuvanted vaccine, administered by intramuscular injection
of one dose (0.3 ml) per bird. - Mod.AS]
