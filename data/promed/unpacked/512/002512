Thank you so much for your kind suggestions. We are putting your input for
sending our specimens for more type of causative agents. We are also
suggesting sending the specimens to the WHO representative for _Yersinia_
culture or serology but we do not know where and who we should contact.
Does anyone know this information?
For some of you who are interested in this outbreak, we just had a meeting
with some experts this morning in a university hospital with the
pathologist who examined our appendix specimens, an experience surgeon,
some national and international pathologists and some clinicians. From our
85 cases, 40 cases were sent the appendix for pathological examination. The
first 6 cases, which were the most severe, have autolysis and the specimens
could not be read. For the next 14 specimens, only 1 had frank pathological
finding of acute appendicitis. 8 of them had lymphoid hyperplasia, in 2
Enterobiasis was found and some had other nonspecific findings. (The
doctors who operated on these patients did not look for mesenteric adenitis
and also do not have much information about the abnormality of adjacent
organs). At this moment the pathologists have an impression that it is
non-specific finding of appendicitis. The last 20 appendix specimens are
ongoing for pathological examination.
I would like to correct my information about the proportion of fever in
this group. It was 36%, not 20% as I roughly estimated. However, together
with the clinical [finding of just tenderness at McBurney's point but no
guarding, no rebound tenderness and very few [with nausea and vomiting.
Therefore, some of the participants in this morning's meeting raised the
question about hysteria on top of a low amount of true disease, because
our cases were predominantly female, only one hard evidence which was
fever, while the tenderness at McBurney's point is also subjective. In our
first field investigation, we did not pay much interest about their
attitude toward appendicitis or their background psychological problems.
Actually we also received information about the previous outbreak of acute
appendicitis in this group, 3 years ago. At that time there were about 90
cases who had appendectomies, almost all of the cases were adult like this
time, but males predominated. This information was told [us by a local
health personnel who himself had [had an appendectomy.
The outbreak is still going on with the highest number of admitted cases in
the fourth week of March with a maximum of 10 cases per day. The other
interesting information is that there is another Cambodian refugee camp in
the same province with a population of about 30,000. They receive the same
source of provided food but a different source of water. The water quality
in the second camp has been much better. However, the composition of their
meals is also different since this bigger camp has a greater component of
high fiber diet. The drinking water in both camps is treated with chlorine,
and all patients which were interviewed in the problem camp (first camp)
reported drinking boiled water.
We are going to the camp this week to set up the more detailed data
collection form and look at more descriptive data on these patients.
Although we do not focus our potential cause of this outbreak on _Yersinia_
we still would like to know the WHO representative for Yersinia
examination, thus, please contact us [if you know.
