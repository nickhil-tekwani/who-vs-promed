ref: Hammer AS, Quaade ML, Rasmussen TB, et al. SARS-CoV-2 transmission between mink (_Neovison vison_) and humans, Denmark. Emerg Infect Dis. 2021 Feb [cited 20 Nov 2020]. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2702.203794

Abstract
--------
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused a pandemic in humans. Farmed mink (_Neovison vison_) are also susceptible. In Denmark, this virus has spread rapidly among farmed mink, resulting in some respiratory disease. Full-length virus genome sequencing revealed novel virus variants in mink. These variants subsequently appeared within the local human community.

[We hereby present the Conclusions segment extracted from the article:

"A high proportion of mink on farms can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 within a few days, which may provide major virus exposure to persons working with mink. The infections we describe here occurred with little clinical disease or increase in death, making it difficult to detect the spread of infection; thus, mink farms could represent a serious, unrecognized animal reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. There is no evidence for spread of the virus outside of farm buildings, either in Denmark or in the Netherlands, except by infected persons. However, there appears to be some risk of virus transmission to persons working with infected mink as well as for their contacts and thus, indirectly, for the public.

"On farm 1, the virus had probably been introduced some weeks before detection. On farm 2, the low frequency (4%) of seropositivity and the high proportion of qRT-PCR positive animals at 2nd sampling (22 Jun 2020) suggested that the virus had been recently introduced but was spreading. Indeed, a 3rd sampling (8 days later; 30 Jun 2020) showed a much higher seroprevalence (higher than 90%). Conceivably, the variant viruses that appeared in farm 1 and spread to farms 2 and 3 may be better adapted to mink and thus able to transmit rapidly. The infection at farm 3 was detected relatively late (30 Jun 2020), with a high seroprevalence (66%) at 1st visit. [The table presenting timetable, tissues sampled and test results in the mentioned 3 farms is available at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/2/20-3794-t1. - Mod.AS]

"A likely scenario for the spread of infection in mink in Denmark is that the index human case-patient, with nt T15656, introduced it into farm 1. Initially, we observed sequence heterogeneity at nt 22920 in mink on farm 1, but subsequently, we detected only the variant form (T22920) on farms 2 and 3 and in subsequent linked human cases (H1-H9) (Table 2; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/2/20-3794-t2). Remarkably, this heterogeneity also occurred on farm NB02 in the Netherlands [see Figure 3 at https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.23.2001005#figuresntables. - Mod.AS]. This change, possibly together with the mutation at nt 25936, may represent virus adaptation. It is not yet established whether these changes confer advantages in mink, but the variant viruses in farm 2 spread rapidly. It seems that the variant viruses on farm 1 spread to more than one human and were then transmitted, presumably by human-human contact, to other persons and to farms 2 and 3. The change at nt 22920 results in substitution Y453F in the S-protein. This Y-residue, within the receptor-binding motif of the S-protein, is highly conserved among SARS-related coronaviruses and is close to residue L455 that is critical for interaction with the cellular ACE2 receptor."

The 3 farms mentioned as 1, 2, and 3 are likely to be the ones culled in July 2020, before the authorities decided to discontinue culling; see item [2] Denmark (North Jutland): mink, control measures mitigated in 20200708.7553067.

As of Friday (20 Nov 2020), the number of infected mink holdings in Denmark has risen to 288 located in 23 municipalities, out of the given total number of Denmark's 1147 mink holdings (see map and table at https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/Leksikon/Sider/Kort-over-screening-af-COVID-19-i-mink.aspx).

The decision to cull the entire Danish mink population has become subject to discussions in media, public and parliament. The early publication of this paper is expected to enable scientists elsewhere to analyse and assess the situation in Denmark and the measures applied.

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 situation in most mink-farming countries, including leading ones such as China and Poland, as far as mink and human health are concerned, remains unknown. - Mod.AS
