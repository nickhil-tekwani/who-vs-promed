Sleeping Disease: Major Slow-killer in Ghana
--------------------------------------------
At least 60 percent of Ghana's total area is infested with sleeping
sickness, the slow killer disease transmitted by the tsetse fly to both man
and animals, Ghana News Agency reported Friday.
Two people recently died in the Western Region from the disease and experts
said it has assumed a serious threat to manpower development especially in
rural settings where it is most prevalent. "It is a disease that will eat
you up gradually and in most cases render you unproductive until you die,"
Christopher Kwame Doku, Deputy Director at Ghana's Veterinary Services
Department, was quoted as saying.
Presently, there is no vaccine that can completely cure trypanosomiasis
(sleeping sickness) and it has destroyed nearly 40 percent of the nation's
livestock. Cattle, sheep, goats are the most afflicted while horses rarely
survive in endemic areas. Doku said the disease could only be controlled
through massive spraying with designated drugs most of which are toxic and
expensive. For example, it would cost at least 30 U.S. dollars to spray one
square-kilometer of an infested area.
Doku, who has spent 22 years in the bush researching into the disease's
prevalence in livestock, estimated that it would take at least the next 20
years to spray Ghana's total infested area. The worst part of it is that
besides the awareness that the vector is found along major rivers, there is
very little information on the disease despite its devastating effect.
"Although the government, through the World Health Organization, has made
efforts to make the needed drugs available, the impact of the disease on
the nation's manpower resources is not known," Doku said.

[Ghana is regarded as a low endemicity country for sleeping sickness, and
there is no data suggesting that trypanosomiasis is emerging in the human
population as it is seen in East and Central Africa. Insecticide spraying
is mentioned as the only control method available, but old fashioned
clearing of vegetation providing breeding habitats is effective. Traps,
also called "artificial cows" attracting tsetse flies by chemicals and
killing them by insecticides have been very effective (Lancet Infectious
Diseases 2001,1:218). There is no data on the WHO website
<http://www.who.int/emc> on human trypanosomiasis in Ghana since 1992. -
