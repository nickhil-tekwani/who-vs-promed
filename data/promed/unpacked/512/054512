Fruit growers are worried because fireblight has been rife in south
Hesse for the past several weeks. The disease has been spreading from
the Odenwald region to the areas of Darmstadt-Dieburg and
Gross-Gerau. Officials fear that a major fireblight epidemic may be
imminent in 2008. Hail has acerbated the situation by causing damage
to the trees because the wounds serve as entry points for the causal
bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_.

Since last year [2007] fireblight has been spreading rapidly in
Switzerland and continues to do so. In 2007, for example, 100 ha (247
acres) of fruit orchards and around 10 000 trees had to be destroyed.
For 2008, the antibiotic streptomycin has been officially approved to
fight fireblight, with some restrictions. This has caused opposition
from environmental groups and Bio Suisse [see link below].

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is
considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees
worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible,
although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only
members of the _Rosaceae_ sub-family _Pomoideae_ are affected and the
host range covers more than 180 species from 39 genera.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of
the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. The bacteria are highly
infectious and are spread by insects, wind, water, mechanical means,
and on plant material (including budwood). They enter the host plant
through wounds. The pathogen has been placed on the quarantine alert
list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). For more
information on fireblight please see links and previous ProMED-mail
posts listed below.
