Some 29 510 malaria cases were reported in Cambodia in the 1st 5 months of this year [2012], claiming 27 lives, according to a report of the country's National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control on Tuesday [26 Jun 2012].

The report showed that the number of malaria cases declined by 11 percent compared with the same period last year [2011], while casualties remained the same.

Char Meng Chuor, director of the center, said that the decline was thanks to regular awareness campaigns by health officials and the distribution of mosquito nets to the disease-prone groups of people.

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease. In Cambodia, the disease is often found in the rainy season and mostly happens in border provinces, as well as forest and mountainous provinces.

The country sets a goal to completely eradicate malaria by 2025, which calls for a financial input of 20 million USD a year. In 2011, Cambodia reported 62 690 cases of malaria, which killed 98 people.

[The border between Cambodia and Thailand is a hotspot for drug resistance in malaria, and it is therefore commendable that the incidence is declining.
