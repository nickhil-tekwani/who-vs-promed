A total of 300 people mostly children have been affected by pertussis, or whooping cough, in Afghanistan's southern Zabul province, and 2 children have died of the disease, Abdul Hakim Hakimi, the provincial public health director, said on [Tue 29 Nov 2022]. "The disease which has erupted in the Suri district of the province has been affecting at least 300 people, mostly children, and has claimed the lives of 2 children over the past week," Hakimi told Xinhua. He said an emergency team of health officials had been sent to the district to treat those infected with the disease.

The public health office of the province has asked the people not to leave their places for a few days to avoid further outbreaks of the transmissible illness.

Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease, which is known for uncontrollable violent coughing that often makes it hard to breathe.

[Zabul (pop., about 250 000 residents) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the southeast of the country; Qalat is the capital of the province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabul_Province). A map showing the location of Zabul can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zabul,+Afghanistan.

Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable infection, caused by _Bordetella pertussis_, a Gram-negative coccobacillus, is a very contagious disease only found in humans. Pertussis can be severe in infants under 12 months of age; about 1/3 in that age group require treatment in a hospital (https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/clinical/complications.html), with patients younger than 6 weeks accounting for the majority of the deaths (https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-021-06732-1).

When a large proportion of the population is immunized, even those who are unvaccinated can benefit from a lower risk of exposure to the pathogen, as a consequence of herd immunity. The spread of disease from person to person becomes unlikely when herd immunity is achieved. The percentage of the population needed to be immune to achieve herd immunity varies from disease to disease. The more contagious the pathogen, the greater the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to the disease to stop its transmission. For example, measles is caused by a highly contagious virus. It's estimated that at least 95% of the population must be immune to interrupt the chain of transmission of measles. The vaccination coverage rate required to provide adequate pertussis protection for the whole population is said to be 92-94% (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1753-6405.12732).

In the US, DTaP, and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/recommendations.html). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lowercase "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult formulations of the vaccine. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.

In the US, DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year-olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as parents, grandparents, siblings, and other caregivers) to have up-to-date vaccines. - Mod.ML
