A new, highly contagious and sometimes deadly canine flu is spreading in
kennels and at dog tracks around the country, veterinarians said yesterday.
The virus, which scientists say mutated from an influenza strain that
affects horses, has killed racing greyhounds in 7 states and has been found
in shelters and pet shops in many places, including the New York suburbs,
though the extent of its spread is unknown. How many dogs die from the
virus is unclear, but scientists said the fatality rate is more than 1 per
cent and could be as high as 10 per cent among puppies and older dogs.
Dr Cynda Crawford, an immunologist at the University of Florida's College
of Veterinary Medicine who is studying the virus, said that it spread most
easily where dogs were housed together but that it could also be passed on
the street, in dog runs, or even by a human transferring it from one dog to
another. Kennel workers have carried the virus home with them, she said. Dr
Crawford first began investigating greyhound deaths in January 2004 at a
racetrack in Jacksonville, Fla., where 8 of the 24 greyhounds who
contracted the virus died. "This is a newly emerging pathogen," she said,
"and we have very little information to make predictions about it. But I
think the fatality rate is between 1 and 10 per cent."
She added that because dogs had no natural immunity to the virus, virtually
every animal exposed would be infected. About 80 per cent of dogs that are
infected with the virus will develop symptoms, Dr Crawford said. She added
that the symptoms were often mistaken for [those of] "kennel cough," a
common canine illness that is caused by the _Bordetella bronchiseptica_
bacterium.
Both diseases can cause coughing and gagging for up to 3 weeks, but dogs
with canine flu may spike fevers as high as 106 degrees (Fahrenheit) and
have runny noses. A few will develop pneumonia, and some of those cases
will be fatal. Antibiotics and fluid cut the pneumonia fatality rate, Dr
Crawford said.
The virus is an H3N8 flu closely related to an equine flu strain. It is not
related to typical human flus or to the H5N1 avian flu that has killed
about 100 people in Asia. Experts said there were no known cases of the
canine flu infecting humans. "The risk of that is low, but we are keeping
an eye on it," said Dr Ruben Donis, chief of molecular genetics for the
influenza branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which
is tracking the illness. But with the approach of the human flu season and
fears about bird flu in Asia, there is much confusion among some dog owners
who have heard about the disease.
Dr Crawford said she was fielding calls from kennels and veterinarians
across the country worried that they were having outbreaks. "The hysteria
out there is unbelievable, and the misinformation is incredible," said Dr
Ann E Hohenhaus, chief of medicine at the Animal Medical Center in New
York. Dr Hohenhaus said she had heard of an alert from a Virginia dog club
reporting rumors that 10 000 show dogs had died. "We don't believe that's
true," she said, adding that no dogs in her Manhattan hospital even had coughs.
Dr Donis of the disease control centers said that there was currently no
vaccine for the canine flu. But he said one would be relatively easy to
develop. The canine flu is less lethal than parvovirus, which typically
kills puppies but can be prevented by routine vaccination. Laboratory
tests, Dr Donis said, have shown that the new flu is susceptible to the 2
most common antiviral drugs, amantidine and Tamiflu, but those drugs are
not licensed for use in dogs.
The flu has killed greyhounds at tracks in Florida, Massachusetts, Arizona,
West Virginia, Wisconsin, Texas, and Iowa. Tracks and kennels have been
forced to shut down for weeks for disinfection. In Chestnut Ridge, north of
New York City, about 88 dogs became sick by early September 2005, and 15
per cent of those required hospitalization, said Debra Bennetts, a
spokeswoman for Best Friends Pet Care, a chain of boarding kennels. The
kennel was vacated for decontamination by 17 Sep. About 17 of the infected
dogs were treated at the Oradell Animal Hospital in Paramus NJ, where one
died and 2 more were still hospitalized, a staff veterinarian said. The
Best Friends chain owns 41 other kennels in 18 states, and no others have
had an outbreak, Dr Larry J Nieman, the company's veterinarian, said.
In late July, at Gracelane Kennels in Ossining NY, about 35 dogs showed
symptoms, said the owner, Bob Gatti, and he closed the kennel for 3 weeks
to disinfect. About 25 of the dogs were treated by an Ossining
veterinarian, Glenn M Zeitz, who said 2 of them had died. "The dogs came in
very sick, with high fevers and very high white blood cell counts," Dr
Zeitz said, making him suspicious that they had something worse than kennel
cough.
A spokesman for the New York City Health Department said that there were "a
few confirmed cases" in New York but that the city was not yet tracking the
disease. Veterinarians voluntarily sent samples to the Animal Health
Diagnostic Center at the Cornell School of Veterinary Medicine, which was
the only laboratory doing blood tests.
