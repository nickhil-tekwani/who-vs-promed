"Neuroinvasive disease" refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is optional whether or
not state health departments report these cases to CDC. [Further
explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever
can be found on the CDC website at the URL provided above.]
"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN fever,
WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was
not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC: "these numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the national electronic
surveillance system established by CDC to assist states in tracking West
Nile virus and other mosquitoborne viruses. Information regarding 2007
virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

[5] USA: additional report (New Jersey)
Date: Sat 6 Oct 2007
Source: Harnesslink.com [edited]
<http://www.harnesslink.com/www/Article.cgi?ID=56984>

New Jersey secretary of agriculture Charles M Kuperus today [6 Oct 2007]
announced that the state's 1st equine case of West Nile virus (WNV)
[infection] for 2007 has occurred in Ocean County. A 21 year old
non-pregnant mare was euthanized on 27 Sep [2007] after becoming ill on 26
Sep [2007]. The horse was not vaccinated for the mosquitoborne infection.
Secretary Kuperus said that even though we are seeing less and less cases
of West Nile virus [infection] and another mosquitoborne infection --
eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) -- every year, owners still need to be
diligent in vaccinating their animals.
"With the state's stepped up efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding areas
and more public awareness of the benefits of vaccinating, we have seen a
decrease in equine WNV and EEE cases in recent years, and we urge owners to
continue to guard their animals from these potentially deadly diseases,"
said secretary Kuperus.
There was one case of West Nile virus in horses and one case of eastern
equine encephalitis in horses last year [2006]. In 2005, there were no
cases of WNV in horses and 4 cases of EEE. That compares with 2003, when
there were 150 cases of WNV and 8 cases of EEE.
