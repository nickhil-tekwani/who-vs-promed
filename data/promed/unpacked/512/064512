South Korea on Tuesday [28 Nov 2006] confirmed a 2nd outbreak of the
H5N1 strain of bird flu at a poultry farm, after confirming over the
weekend it had its 1st outbreak in 3 years of the strain that can
kill people.
The agriculture ministry said about 600 chickens died in the latest
outbreak at a farm 3 km (2 miles) from where the 1st case had been
confirmed in poultry in North Cholla province in the country's
southwest.
There were no reports to suggest residents or quarantine officials
had been infected in or around both infected farms, an agriculture
official said by telephone.
"The test results have shown that we had a 2nd case of highly
pathogenic H5N1 bird flu," the ministry said in a statement.
Quarantine authorities would cull all poultry within a 500 metre
(1640 ft) radius of the latest infected farm.
The farms lie on a path for migratory birds that are heading south
from Russia, Mongolia and Kazakhstan and sparked concern that other
parts of South Korea might have also been hit.
South Korea had planned to cull 236 000 poultry by Thursday [30 Nov
2006] within a 500-metre radius of the 1st infected farm in North
Cholla province, about 170 km (105 miles) south from Seoul. It had by
Monday culled 75 500 poultry and disposed of 6.6 million eggs in the
same area.
Bird flu killed about 6000 chickens in the 1st outbreak.
Between December 2003 and March 2004, about 400 000 poultry at South
Korean farms were infected by bird flu. During that outbreak, the
country destroyed 5.3 million birds, officials said.
Subsequent testing in the United States indicated at least 9 South
Korean workers involved in the culling had been infected with the
H5N1 virus, but none developed major illnesses.
The vast majority of human bird flu cases involving the H5N1 virus
have been linked to direct or indirect contact with infected fowl.
Bird flu remains essentially an animal disease, but it has infected
nearly 260 people worldwide since late 2003, killing more than 150,
according to the World Health Organisation.
Since 2003, outbreaks have been confirmed in about 50 countries and
territories.

A 2nd [in light of the previous item, this one becomes 3rd. - Mod.AS]
outbreak of bird flu has been detected in Seosan, about 140 km north
of Iksan where the fatal H5N1 led to a massive culling of poultry and
other animals.[Seosan is located at Lat 36.7817, Long 126.4522, map
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KS/17/Sosan.html>].
Provincial officials said the sick chickens were hatched from eggs
distributed in mid-November from a breeding farm in Iksan, North
Jeolla Province. But the authorities have not yet confirmed whether
the Seosan chickens were infected with the highly virulent strain.
"Preliminary tests indicate the virus is a harmless strain," the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said in a statement.
To prevent the spread of the virus, quarantine officials have so far
destroyed about 100 000 chickens and ducks within a 500-meter radius
of Iksan, which is about 250 km south of Seoul. Officials confirmed
the H5N1 virus in the Iksan poultry on Saturday [25 Nov 2006].
The ministry said the government plans to cull a total of 236 000
birds, in addition to other animals such as pigs, dogs and cats in
the area by Thursday. About 6 million eggs will also be destroyed.
Seosan officials said they are waiting for the preliminary test
results of chickens from 8 farms in the area. They said measures have
been put in place to contain the transfer of livestock. Five of the
farms have bought livestock from breeding farms in Iksan, the
authorities said.
The latest bird flu case in Seosan is expected to unnerve
poultry-related industries. Since news of the 1st outbreak on 22 Nov
2006, major retailers have been seeing chicken sales decline.
Demand for poultry at E-Mart, the nation's largest discount store
chain, has also been declining compared to a year ago, however, at a
slower pace.
"Sales have climbed 55 percent from Thursday to Saturday compared to
a year ago, but the growth rate is slowing down," said Park Soo-beom,
a spokesman for Shinsegae Co.'s E-Mart. "We expect sales to slow
further if there continues to be reports of the bird flu spreading
because consumers would feel more uneasy," he added.
Hallim Co., the nation's No. 1 supplier of chicken and poultry
products, suffered a 30 percent drop in sales from Thursday to
Monday. Hallim commands about 25 percent of the nation's chicken
[production] market.
"The sales decline is slower compared to the first scare the nation
experienced in 2003," said Kim Dae-sik, the spokesman for Hallim.
"But we attribute this slower pace to consumers' wider awareness of
the avian influenza and how consuming chicken, if well cooked, is not
harmful to humans."
Experts assure the public that poultry is safe to consume when it is
cooked at temperatures above 75 degrees Celsius for more than 5
minutes [meaning: after the flesh has reached and maintained the
temperature of 75 C/167 F for 5 minutes at the end of cooking time;
obviously simply cooking chicken for 5 min at 167 F won't get the job
done - CopyEd.PG].

[Korea's high alertness and intensive surveillance activities are
reflected by the detection of additional outbreaks, one of which was
reportedly already confirmed as HPAI H5N1 while the other one might
be of lower pathogenicity (LPAI). Ruling out high pathogenicity
(HPAI, which is OIE-notifiable) is dependent upon lab results.
In the meantime, Korea has officially confirmed, in a notification to
the OIE, its H5N1 outbreak; see
