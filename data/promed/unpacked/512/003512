Hong Kong: three distinct incursions of avian influenza (H5N1) virus
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Genetic studies of the avian influenza virus outbreak in Yuen Long have
shown that it involved 3 [distinct genotypes] of [avian influenza (H5N1)
virus], [indicating] that infections were introduced on at least 3 separate
occasions, [rather than on a single occasion with subsequent spread from a
single source].
The deputy director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, Dr Liu
Kwei-kin, said that: "Of the 22 infected farms, 13 were infected by
genotype "Z" virus, which was basically confined to the Kam Tin area with
spread to Pak Sha Tsuen. [Epidemiological] information suggested there may
have been more than one incursion (of the Z genotype). Eight farms were
infected by the "Z1" genotype, following a single incursion in Kam Tin. An
"X" genotype virus infected a single farm in Hung Shui Kiu."
Dr Liu said the recent H5N1 avian influenza viruses were highly infectious
to chickens, but had not acquired the ability to infect humans, as
[happened] in 1997 when 6 people died. "The government has implemented a
very comprehensive monitoring programme and so far the viruses are detected
well before they pick up any ability [to infect] humans," he said. "The
main point is that they are [genetically distinct] from the 1997 virus that
affects humans and we [are detecting] these viruses before they have spread
further or [acquired virulence for humans]." The epidemiological study was
conducted by the University of Hong Kong and the Massey University
EpiCentre in New Zealand.

[These findings from a combination of epidemiological and genetic analyses
are reassuring to the extent that the genotype responsible for the outbreak
of severe disease in humans in 1997 is not a genotype frequently
transmitted from outside to chickens in Hong Kong (or alternately easily
generated there after transmission). Nonetheless, continued vigilance is
essential. - Mod.CP]
