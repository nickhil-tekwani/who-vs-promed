Farmers have called on the industry to highlight their appetite for the reintroduction of the Zulvac Schmallenberg (SBV) vaccine in light of the resurgence of the virus in the UK.

The virus has so far been confirmed in the North East, North Yorkshire, Wales, the South East and South West, with more recent cases found in West Wales, Devon, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire.

Farmer Michael Waycott, Devon, said it was 'ever so important' a case was made to bring back the vaccine, after he lost 2 pedigree Suffolk lambs to SBV.

He said there was a mutual concern over how far the situation must go before the vaccine could be made available again.

He said: "People are not reporting it, this is the trouble. The only way we can make our case for a vaccine is if people send carcases to a veterinary investigation centre and make it known there is a demand for it."

But vet Carolyn Hogan of Zoetis, the firm which manufactures the vaccine, said a poor uptake following production in 2015 left her questioning if farmers actually wanted it.

She said: "We are in a lively discussion across Europe to look at manufacturing capabilities and how quickly it can be produced if there is a farmer demand for it.

"It is in everyone's best interest to prevent heavy disease losses, so if people want a vaccine we want to and can produce it."

Changes since 2015 mean Zulvac SBV is now a single dose vaccine for sheep and has a three-week onset of immunity.

But before the vaccine is able to recirculate, Ms Hogan said the industry needed 'some kind of green light' from farmers.

She added: "At what point do you question when this should be part of your annual vaccination system? Do you take the risk and then take the hit when it happens? Or do you say this should become part of my routine flock vaccination?

"This is what farmers should be thinking about with their vets."

Scottish farmers have been warned to be alert for possible cases of Schmallenberg disease as the virus has been confirmed in livestock just south of the border.

The head of SAC's veterinary services, Brian Hosie, advised farmers to arrange a post-mortem examination for any stillborn or deformed animals to curb any resurgence of the virus.

It was recently detected in lambs on 4 holdings in the north-east of England - including Northumberland - and cases have also been confirmed in Devon, Dorset, Cornwall, Somerset, County Laois and County Cork, according to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).

Scotland is believed to be on the outer edge of the range for the virus but Mr Hosie said there was no scope for complacency.

"The outbreaks in 2013 pointed to infection in November and December of the previous year [2012], and it's perfectly possible that midges could bite stock in sheds in January [2013]," he said.

"Obviously Schmallenberg is not the only cause of abortions. A post-mortem can identify whether it has been caused by toxoplasma or border disease in sheep or if it is related to BVD in cattle, fungal toxins or neospora. There are vaccination programmes that can then be followed."

A post-mortem for a calf costs £59 [approx. USD 73.67] and for a lamb it is £39 [approx. USD 48.70].

The virus was first discovered in 2011 and appeared in Scotland in a small number of livestock in Dumfries and Galloway in 2013. That was followed by a 2nd strike in suckler cattle in Aberdeenshire [see comment] and at the height of the outbreak farmers vaccinated their most valuable pedigree stock.

"It was probably wise because in some cases the deformity of the foetus can cause serious problems at lambing and calving and be a disaster for the future productivity of the cow or ewe," said Mr Hosie.

There are currently no stocks of vaccine, but vets are keen to ascertain the true levels of the virus as it will help them determine whether there is a need to vaccinate later in the year.

AHDB Dairy's lead veterinary science expert, Derek Armstrong, said: "It is expected SBV (Schmallenberg virus) will be found in the later lambing season."

"Milder weather conditions earlier in November [2016] were a perfect platform for the midge-borne virus to breed and prolong the period of infection."\

[Figures published by UK's Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) in April 2013 showed how the 1750 cases recorded in Britain during the 1st quarter of 2013, had been spread across every county in England and Wales (by vectors in late 2012) and much of Scotland. AHVLA reported that all cases outside of Dumfries and Galloway, in 9 other Scottish counties, related to animals introduced into Scotland from areas where SBV had been reported (see in 20130630.1800385).

In respect to the surveillance needs and the SBV vaccination issues, subscribers are referred to the remarks made by Ulster (N. Ireland) Farmers' Union (ULS) president in March 2013 (post 20130328.1608058): "SBV is a non-notifiable virus, which does not have any trade implications and poses no threat to human health. The real concern for farmers is the possible losses on farm due to an increase in fetal mortality. The UFU are appealing to all farmers to stay vigilant and report any suspected cases of the virus. We are also encouraging farmers to send animals that are displaying clinical signs of the virus for post-mortem testing, which will be free of charge (!!)"... "A vaccine for the virus has been developed and is currently going through the Veterinary Medicines Directorate authorization system. However, if on-farm losses average at 2-3 percent, it may not be cost effective to vaccinate all stock. Also, immunity is developed once an animal has been infected; therefore, it appears that any animals affected this year [2013] will develop their own immunity and will not be affected again next year [2014]".

On top of the cost-benefit issue, the advantageousness and efficacy of SBV vaccination in potentially exposed ruminants while infected vector population is already active, or had been active during the earlier gestation months of the susceptible animal population, are debatable. It will be interesting to note if a comprehensive, science-based study addressing SBV vaccination in cattle and sheep has been undertaken/published. - Mod.AS
