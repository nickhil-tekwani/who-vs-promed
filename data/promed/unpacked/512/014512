Public Health England confirms advice suspending use of heated birthing pools filled in advance of labour in home settings.

On 17 Jun 2014, Public Health England (PHE) and NHS England temporarily advised against the home use of birthing pools with built-in heaters and recirculation pumps, potentially filled up to 2 weeks in advance of the birth. This followed a case of legionnaires' disease identified in a baby born in this specific type of birthing pool at home.

The temporary advice was issued as a precautionary measure while further investigations were carried out into the provision of these pools by a number of companies, including the advice given by the companies on pool filling and on controlling risks from exposure to _Legionella_.

Further investigations have been carried out, and based on an assessment of the available evidence, PHE has now confirmed the provisional advice issued on 17 Jun 2014. This means that PHE recommends that heated birthing pools (incorporating both a re-circulation pump and heater), filled in advance of labour, should no longer be used for labour or birth, in the home setting. The majority of birthing pools used at home are filled from domestic hot water systems at the time of labour -- these birthing pools do not pose the same risk and are excluded from this alert, as long as pumps are used solely to empty the pool and not for recirculation of warm water.

Professor Nick Phin, PHE's head of legionnaires' disease, said: "Further investigation into this incident has confirmed that the type of _Legionella_ bacteria found in the birthing pool is the same strain [that] caused the baby to become ill with legionnaires' disease. As part of the investigation, PHE has been working with local authorities to investigate the provision of these pools by a number of companies, including the advice given by the companies on pool filling and on controlling risks from exposure to _Legionella_. This final recommendation is based on the difficulty, in the home setting, of preventing _Legionella_ growth in re-circulated warm water over a period of days or weeks. For this reason, PHE has confirmed its earlier precautionary advice and is recommending that this type of pre-filled, heated birthing pool is no longer used at all at home."

Louise Silverton director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said: "Women planning birth at home using a traditional pool that is filled when the woman is in labour or using a fixed pool in an NHS unit are not affected by this alert and should not be concerned. Birthing pools in hospitals are subject to stringent infection control procedures and monitoring. Home birthing pools filled during labour come with disposable liners and are only in place for a relatively short time period, reducing opportunity for bacterial growth. Any women with concerns about using home birthing pools should contact their midwife or local maternity unit."

This is the 1st reported case of legionnaires' disease linked to a birthing pool in England, although there have been 2 cases reported internationally some years ago.

The baby diagnosed with legionnaires' disease remains very poorly in hospital. A briefing note confirming the original advice has been issued by PHE via the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) to local authorities and to all PHE Centres across the country.

The Patient Safety Alert (PSA) issued by NHS England on 17 Jun 2014 remains in place. The PSA notified the healthcare system -- and specifically midwives -- to the possible risks associated with the use of these heated birthing pools at home. The alert recommends that heated birthing pools, filled in advance of labour and where the temperature is maintained by use of a heater and pump, are not used for labour or birth.

The majority of birthing pools used at home are filled from domestic hot water systems at the time of labour. These types of pools do not present the same risk as long as pumps are used solely to empty the pool and not for recirculation of warm water. This new advice relates to the importance of women not labouring or giving birth in a heated birthing pool which has been filled prior to the onset of labour and where the temperature has been maintained by the use of a heater and pump.

The heated pools from the supplier involved in this incident have been recalled. Currently there are at least 6 companies known to hire out heated birthing pools, with a total of 60 to 70 pools made available for hire. The majority of these pools have been recalled, and all known companies have been advised. The pools were usually delivered around 2 weeks before the expected delivery date, filled from the domestic hot water supply, and the temperature maintained via a pump and heater until labour and delivery. Various disinfection regimes are recommended by the companies. It is unclear whether or not legionellosis risk assessments have been undertaken by the companies.

_Legionella_ are commonly occurring bacteria and can be found in around 10 to 20 percent of domestic hot water systems. Legionnaires' disease is a severe pneumonia caused by the _Legionella_ bacteria. There are 350 to 400 cases a year reported in England and Wales, mainly in older adults.

Legionnaires' disease is extremely rare in childhood, with only one case in children aged 0 to 9 years reported in England between 1990 to 2011.The infection does not spread from person to person -- people become infected with the bacteria through inhalation of contaminated water droplets. There are 2 international reports of _Legionella_ infection after birth in birthing pools, both from the late 1990s, in Italy and Japan:

[Legionnaires' disease is uncommon in children and exceedingly rare in neonates. Infected children have usually had many of the same risk factors for legionellosis as have adults, such as heart or lung disease and immunosuppression. Many of the reported neonates who subsequently developed _Legionella_ pneumonia had been ventilator-dependent and on corticosteroid therapy. In studies of neonatal legionellosis where environmental cultures were performed, the same serotype of _Legionella_ has been isolated from cases of neonatal infection as were cultured from the potable water, which also suggested to the authors that aspirated tap water was the source of infection in the infants (Famiglietti RF, Bakerman PR, Saubolle MA, Rudinsky M. Cavitary Legionellosis in Two Immunocompetent Infants. Pediatrics 1997; 99: 899-903).

The report above from Public Health England (PHE) presents an instance where aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated water was the obvious source for neonatal legionnaires' disease that occurred following use of a home birthing pool, heated with a built-in heater and recirculation pump, that could be potentially filled up to 2 weeks in advance of labor. The type of _Legionella_ bacteria found in the birthing pool was found to be the same strain that caused this baby to become ill with legionnaires' disease. PHE in the report above cites 2 additional reports of _Legionella_ neonatal infection after birth in birthing pools, one from Italy and another from Japan (see references 1 and 2 above).

Underwater birthing has become popular in certain parts of the world and has been promoted as a means of decreasing maternal discomfort during childbirth, despite a paucity of solid data demonstrating that it is either beneficial or safe (Batton DG, et al. Underwater Births. Pediatrics 2005;115(5):1413-1414). Contamination of the birthing tub systems with bacteria, such as _Burkholderia pickettii_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, that could cause infection in a baby, has been reported in water pumps and heating systems, filling hoses of the tub, and water in the birthing tubs (Rawal J, Shah A, Stirk F, Mehtar S. Water birth and infection in babies. BMJ.1994;309 :511).

Although _Legionella_ infection is usually thought to be acquired by inhalation of contaminated aerosols, sometimes aspiration of contaminated water, for example, in association to nasogastric tube feeding, is thought to be the mechanism (Marrie TJ, Haldane D, MacDonald S, et al. Control of endemic nosocomial legionnaires' disease by using sterile potable water for high risk patients. Epidemiol Infect. 1991 Dec;107(3):591-605 and Venezia RA, Agresta MD, et al. Nosocomial legionellosis associated with aspiration of nasogastric feedings diluted in tap water. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 1994 Aug;15(8):529-33).

Dr. Victor Yu was the 1st to suggest that the mode of transmission for legionnaires' disease is aspiration of contaminated water rather than aerosolization, as is widely assumed and _Legionella_-contaminated potable water systems are the source. He has nicely reviewed this topic (Yu V. Could aspiration be the major mode of transmission for _Legionella_. Amer J Med 1993;95:13-15).

Another example of possible aspiration as a mode of acquiring legionnaires' disease is dental procedures that use warm water under high pressure. In one example, genetic sequencing found that _L. pneumophila_ in the waterlines matched the organisms that caused legionnaires' disease (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - Italy: (Rome) dental exposure 20120218.1045716). This report postulated that "aerosolized water from high speed turbine instruments was most likely the source of the infection," but anyone who has undergone similar dental procedures using high-pressure waterlines could easily imagine aspiration was the mechanism involved. - Mod.ML
