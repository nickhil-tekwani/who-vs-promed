FAO urges countries to closely monitor H1N1 in pigs
---------------------------------------------------
After the detection of the A/H1N1 virus in pigs in Canada transmitted
by a human, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO) has again urged national authorities and farmers to
carefully monitor pigs and investigate any possible occurrences of
influenza-like symptoms in domestic animals.

"The human-to-animal transmission that occurred in Canada does not
come as a surprise as influenza viruses are capable of transmitting
from humans to animals," FAO's Chief Veterinary Officer Joseph
Domenech said. "The Canadian event should therefore not be a matter
of panic, but it should remind us of the human-animal link in virus
transmission on which we definitely need to keep an eye."

Influenza viruses, whether in humans or among animals, are constantly
evolving genetically, along with changes in their ability to cause
morbidity and mortality in humans or animals. Therefore the current
A/H1N1 situation should be carefully monitored as many of the virus
characteristics and developments are still unknown, Domenech said.

Surveillance for porcine respiratory disease should be intensified
and all cases of porcine respiratory syndrome are recommended to be
immediately reported to veterinary authorities. It is also
recommended to inform OIE and FAO about any occurrence of outbreaks
of the new A/H1N1 Influenza virus in pigs. Strict biosecurity
measures including restriction of movements of pigs, goods and people
should be applied on all farms or holdings with swine showing signs
of clinical respiratory illness until diagnosis of the illness has been made.

Where A/H1N1 influenza is confirmed, movement restrictions should be
in force for 7 days after the last animal has recovered. Governments
are requested to provide full support in improving biosecurity
measures particularly to small and medium pig farmers. Persons who
work directly with swine should be urged not to go to work if they
have any signs of respiratory disease, fever or any influenza-like
illness. Animal handlers and veterinarians should wear protective
clothing to minimize the risk of being infected.

The FAO stressed that there is absolutely no need to slaughter
animals in view of preventing circulation of the A/H1N1 virus. The
agency emphasized that the A/H1N1 virus cannot be transmitted to
humans by pork and pork products. Pork and pork products, handled in
accordance with good hygienic practices recommended by the FAO/WHO
Codex Alimentarius Commission and the OIE, will not be a source of infection.

[Canada has, in the meantime, submitted to the OIE an official
'immediate notification' of an 'emerging disease,' reporting an
Alberta pig farm infected by the 'Novel A/H1N1 2009 influenza virus.'

This notification is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8065>
and includes the following epidemiological comments:

"A carpenter hired by the farm owner (ALB-001) travelled to Mexico
recently and returned to Canada on 12 Apr 2009. The carpenter, the
producer and the producer's family had been ill with flu like
symptoms between 14 - 29 Apr 2009. Investigation of human cases by
the Public Health authorities is underway.

"A Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) team attended the premises
on 28 Apr 2009 and collected samples from swine for influenza virus testing.

"Swabs and serum samples were received at the CFIA National Centre
for Foreign Animal Diseases (NCFAD) in Winnipeg on 29 Apr 2009. The
samples were run in conventional RT-PCR for the Matrix and the H1
gene (primers kindly provided by the PHAC National Microbiology
Laboratory, Winnipeg). These results showed that 19/24 samples were
positive for the M gene and 15/24 samples positive for the H1 gene.

"This was immediately followed up by sequencing of these PCR products
(6 samples for the Matrix and 5 for the H1 gene). The sequences of a
segment of approximately 244 nucleotides of the Matrix gene from 6
samples showed that this sequence was 100 percent (for the 244
nucleotides sequenced) identical to sequences derived from the novel
A/H1N1 influenza virus from the USA and Mexico and similar results
(99-100 percent identity) were found for around 500 nucleotides of
the H1 gene from 5 samples. The sequences derived from the pig
samples were identical to each other and for the M gene most similar
to the Eurasian lineage while the H1 gene is more reminiscent of the
North American lineage as would be expected for this novel virus.

"Additional sequencing of part of the N gene clearly shows that this
is an N1 virus and the sequence of the approximately 1400 nucleotide
fragment is highly related to the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus. It is
thus confirmed that this is the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus and
being very closely related to the human strains based on the genes
sequenced so far. Full characterisation is continuing and so is virus
isolation in eggs."

In view of the said information, one can speculate that similar
situations have ocurred in other countries where H1N1 infected humans
had contacts with domestic pigs; this is particularly relevant to
Mexico, where the prevalence of the new virus in humans may be
estimated to have reached high dimensions. Surveillance in pig farms
in Mexico is thus anticipated the earliest.

It would also be advisable that those involved in the surveillance
activities on farms, as well as personnel of suspected pig herds, be
vaccinated against seasonal influenza virus to prevent possible mixed
infections. - Mod.AS]
