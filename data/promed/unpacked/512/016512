DEFRA denies pig jab plan
---------------------------------
The government has dismissed media reports that it is about to vaccinate
pigs against foot-and-mouth disease in North Yorkshire. The Department for
Food, Environment and Rural Affairs rejected claims that ministers had
asked for European Union approval to vaccinate this month. A department
spokeswoman said: "We can introduce vaccination if necessary, but we are
not planning to do so at the moment."
The spokeswoman was reacting to claims in The Times newspaper that
ministers have approved a plans for a "firebreak" vaccination policy for
pigs. Vaccination would be introduced if the virus persists in the Thirsk
area or if it moves into East Riding, an area densely populated with pigs,
the paper said.
According to the Daily Mail, Chief Veterinary Officer Jim Scudamore is
believed also to be planning how a vaccine could be used in mid-Wales. But
National Farmers' Union president Ben Gill is opposed to vaccination,
saying it would delay the resumption of exports and cause abortions in
sows. Mr Gill is also concerned that products from vaccinated animals would
be shunned by meat processors and retailers. National Pig Association
producer group chairman Stewart Houston said he would support vaccination
around Thirsk as a last resort. Pigs would have to be culled out afterwards
to prevent problems with selling meat at home and abroad, he added.

Foot-and-mouth vaccine "little help"
------------------------------------------
A computer model of strategies for controlling the UK foot-and-mouth
outbreak suggests mass slaughter is the best way.
[Predictive spatial modelling of alternative control strategies for the
foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in Great Britain, 2001, RS Morris et al,
Vet Record 149(5): 137-144 <http://www.vetrecord.co.uk/abs481.htm> Abstract
only is available on-line. - Mod.MHJ
The model found that vaccinating animals in the worst-affected areas could
have helped only marginally. At worst, it says, replacing slaughter with
vaccination in buffer zones would have let the outbreak spread out of
control. The model appears to vindicate the government's persistence in
slaughtering animals to end the outbreak.
The modelling assumed the control policies which were in operation from 20
Mar [2001 -- a ban on all animal movements from 23 Feb, and a policy of
stamping out the disease by slaughter. The outbreak was confirmed on 20
Feb, and the veterinary surgeons and epidemiologists who wrote the report
say: "The epidemic was already well established and disseminated by the
time it was diagnosed. "Epidemiological data show that at least 29 farms
were infected but undiagnosed at the date of the initial confirmation."
They simulated a number of control strategies, starting with the known
number of infected farms on 10 Apr, and running for 200 days. They write:
"For the control policy which best approximated that actually implemented
from late March, the model predicted an epidemic of approximately 1800 to
1900 farms. It estimated that the epidemic would be eradicated between July
and October 2001, with a low probability of continuing beyond October. This
policy included the slaughter-out of infected farms within 24 hours,
slaughter of about 1.3 of the surrounding farms per infected farm within a
further 48 hours, and minimal inter-farm movements of susceptible animals."
By 3 August the total number of cases across the UK had reached 1925.
The modelling showed that delays in the slaughter of animals on infected
farms beyond 24 hours after diagnosis slightly increased the size of the
epidemic. But failure to slaughter preemptively on an "adequate" number of
at-risk farms substantially increased its expected size.
With vaccination, the modellers considered 2 possibilities. One was the
vaccination of 3 of the most seriously affected areas, in Cumbria, Devon
and Gloucestershire. Using vaccination here with the control policy that
was in force would have reduced the predicted size of the epidemic by fewer
than 100 farms, they say. The other possibility tested was the use of
"buffer zone" vaccination in a series of bands across the country, designed
to create a barrier between affected and disease-free areas. It allowed the
disease to spread out of control, predicting by October an epidemic 3 times
larger than the existing one, with more than 6000 farms affected, and "with
no prospect of immediate eradication".
The authors conclude: "The analyses support historical field experience in
reinforcing the crucial value of the slaughter of all susceptible animals
on affected farms as rapidly as possible after diagnosis, and especially
the benefits of preemptive slaughter of high-risk farms before signs of
disease can appear."
One of the report's authors is Professor John Wilesmith, of the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He told BBC News Online: "It's
still possible that vaccination might be of value in certain circumstances.
The Dutch used it successfully, but theirs was a totally different
scenario. They were able to identify where it was needed, go to the fridge
and start vaccinating. We were up against it from the very beginning,
because of the early movements of sheep which spread the virus across the
country."

[Without access to the full script, critical comment is constrained. A part
that is confusing is that buffer-zone vaccination would have allowed the
disease to spread "out of control." I can only guess that this reflects the
model's withdrawal of manpower to implement the vaccination and thus
stopping all effective control activities within the area delimited by the
vaccinated boundary buffer-zone. - Mod.MHJ

Slaughter decision "cost 3 billion pounds"
---------------------------------
Culling could prove to [have been an expensive policy. Vaccinating animals
against foot-and-mouth at an early stage could have reduced the cost of the
crisis by about two-thirds, research for the BBC suggests. Even now,
vaccination could result in substantial savings if the disease were to
continue for many months, according to the study. The research --
commissioned by BBC Radio 4's Today program -- challenges the idea that the
government has tackled foot-and-mouth disease in the most cost-effective
way. But the findings emerge as a computer model of strategies for
controlling the outbreak suggests [see #2 above that the government's mass
slaughter policy is the most effective way of containing the disease.
Researchers said vaccinating animals in the worst-affected areas could have
helped only marginally and if it was adopted in "buffer zones" could have
let the disease spiral out of control.
Meanwhile, a cull of 1300 sheep found to be carrying virus antibodies has
been carried out the Brecon Beacons, sparking fears that the Welsh National
Park's entire flock will be affected.
The research on the economic cost of the disease was carried out by
Professor Peter Midmore at the University of Wales in Aberystwyth. He
compared the likely economic impact under the current policy of culling all
affected livestock with the alternative, of controlling the spread of the
virus through vaccination. Professor Midmore estimates the crisis will have
cost about 5 billion pounds in total by the end of the year. This includes
the money spent on slaughter, compensation for farmers and the impact on
tourism.
In contrast, he calculates that vaccinating animals in a ring around
infected areas would have cut the total bill to between 1.5 to 2 billion
pounds, even considering the likely delay in lifting an export ban on
British meat and livestock. Even now, the research suggests, vaccination
around infected areas could cut the continuing costs of the epidemic by
about half, unless the disease is eradicated in the next few weeks. Frits
Pluimers, the Chief Veterinary Officer for Holland, where they vaccinated
after a foot-and-mouth outbreak earlier this year, said that once animals
were immune they could be kept without risk -- creating more time to manage
the disease.
And organic farmer Helen Browning, who chairs the Soil Association and sits
on the Meat and Livestock Commission, believes the caution surrounding
vaccination is misplaced as meat from vaccinated animals is already for
sale in Britain. "We have been importing meat from those countries that do
vaccinate during the past few years," she told Today.

Slaughter policy "did not waste money"
----------------------------------------------
The government has denied squandering billions of pounds on efforts to
eradicate foot-and-mouth, rejecting claims that vaccination would have cut
costs by two-thirds. Research for the BBC suggests vaccinating animals
would have been at least 3 billion pounds cheaper than the government
policy of slaughter and disposal. The study also suggests that introducing
vaccination now -- 6 months after the first outbreaks -- could result in
substantial savings if the crisis continues long term.
But Elliot Morley junior minister at the Department of Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs (Defra) says the study failed to consider the widespread
nature of the outbreak and varying compensation costs. The National
Farmers' Union has also challenged the study's findings, saying vaccination
would have caused the disease to spread more quickly. The NFU, the now
defunct Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (Maff) and its
replacement Defra have continually resisted calls for vaccination.
Economist Professor Peter Midmore, who carried out the study for BBC Radio
4's Today programme, predicts the cost of fighting the disease and
compensating farmers will reach 5 billion pounds by the end of the year.
"If vaccination or culling were equally effective in bringing the outbreak
to an early close then the cost difference is fairly little, there is not
much to lose in employing vaccination," he said. "But because culling has
so far been claimed to be the most effective method of halting the
outbreak, but clearly has not had quite the impact we would have expected,
then I think vaccination should be given a chance." He said vaccination
could be a very much cheaper alternative to slaughter "in the longer term
if the outbreak does continue, and there are fresh outbreaks".
Mr Morley said the study was flawed because the widespread nature of the
outbreak would have made ring-vaccination virtually impossible. He added:
"This economic study seems flawed because it does not factor in the cost of
compensation. "There is an assumption that all the culled livestock would
be sold as food yet some animals will be bleeding animals [sic, breeding
and some could be dairy cattle with longer life spans of up to 10 years.
"Compensation for such losses would contribute far greater costs to the
taxpayer than we are facing at the current time. We don't rule out
vaccination and never have but the argument is a complex one."
The NFU's Ian Gardener, also dismissing the study. "The 'most important
variable' was the speed at which the disease spread from farm to farm," he
said. Mr Gardener said scientific research being published next week will
show "quite clearly that the disease, if we had treated it with vaccines
earlier, would have spread far faster than it did".
