Thu 12 Sep 2002, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health was cited as
saying the brain-destroying illness that allegedly killed a man who had
eaten venison and elk meat was not a form of chronic wasting disease
affecting deer herds.
The story says the officials had been investigating the deaths of 3
outdoorsmen to find out whether chronic wasting disease (CWD) has crossed
from animals into humans, just as mad cow disease (BSE, Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy) did in Europe.
The hunters knew one another and ate elk and deer meat at wild game feasts
hosted by one of them in Wisconsin during the 1980s and 1990s. All 3 died
of brain-wasting diseases in the 1990s.
The test results made public Thursday were for [a man] whose death was
attributed to Pick's disease, a more common brain-destroying disorder.
State epidemiologist Jim Kazmierczak was cited as saying that [the man's]
brain tissue showed no evidence of the mutant proteins called prions that
are associated with CWD.
There has never been a documented case of a person contracting a
brain-destroying illness from eating wild animals with chronic wasting disease.
