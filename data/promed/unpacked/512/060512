17 suspected anthrax cases at Hariharpara in Murshidabad district, West Bengal
-----------------------------------------------
In the Kedartala area of Hariharpara in Murshidabad district, there are
again reports of anthrax cases.
17 villagers are now suffering from anthrax following consumption of
infected beef. One cow of a villager became sick, and instead of treating
the diseased cow, the villagers sacrificed it and sold the meat at a
cheaper rate, which was purchased by many poor villagers. It was 2 days
after intake of that cooked meat that villagers noticed the development of
ulcers on their palms and in the corners of their mouths, followed by an
onset of fever.
Although a total of 17 persons, including 7 females, have been reported as
suffering from anthrax in this way, there are many other villagers who are
also suspected to be suffering as a result of handling the infected meat.
Health department personnel collected blood samples of the suspected
anthrax cases for confirmation.

Though the account refers to the meat being cooked, these hand and mouth
lesions are characteristic of exposure to infected blood and fluids.
Oropharyngeal anthrax carries a high risk of mortality, not just from the
lesion but also from being unable to breath. Dr. Das has sent us, over the
years, a regular accounting of this disease in West Bengal, which is
tragic, as this disease in humans is readily prevented if livestock are
routinely vaccinated. Obviously, though the disease is patently enzootic in
the region, this is not being done. - Mod.MHJ]
