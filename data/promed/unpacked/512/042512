Pennsylvania: Beaver County Hepatitis Probe Changes Focus
---------------------------------------------------
Health officials now believe that contaminated food delivered to a Beaver
County restaurant is a more likely cause of the ongoing hepatitis A
outbreak than poor worker hygiene as originally suspected. Investigators
are also considering whether the problem at the Chi-Chi's restaurant at
Beaver Valley Mall is related to recent hepatitis A outbreaks in Georgia
and Tennessee, which are being blamed on contaminated green onions.
The number of cases, which rose to 340 yesterday, forced investigators to
reconsider the worker-hygiene theory, said Richard McGarvey, spokesman for
the state Department of Health. The new thinking also coincided with the
arrival this past weekend of investigators from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, which investigated the outbreaks in the other states.
In Georgia, about 250 people came down with hepatitis A in September and
October 2003 after eating at about 12 restaurants in the central and
northern parts of the state, said Richard Quartarone, spokesman for the
state's health department. In Knoxville, Tennessee, 80 people became ill
with hepatitis A in September after eating at one city restaurant, said
Mark Jones, director of the Knox County Health Department.
Contaminated green onions are the prime suspects in both states. "Because
they're multi-layered, green onions are very difficult to clean,"
Quartarone said. "The only way to be 100 percent sure that you killed the
hepatitis [virus] in green onions is to cook them. But they're often used
as a garnish, so you don't cook them."
McGarvey cautioned that investigators have not concluded that green onions
are the prime suspect here. "We're focusing more on some product that came
through here, some ingredient that was possibly contaminated before a food
handler could have contaminated it," he said. "Can I say what product at
this point? No."
A confounding factor in the Pennsylvania investigation is that one victim
apparently was exposed to hepatitis A around 20 Sep 2003, more than a week
before most others were exposed, McGarvey said. If that individual was a
restaurant employee, it might suggest the worker caused the problem, but
that's not the case, he said. All of the workers -- 11 as of yesterday --
with confirmed hepatitis cases were apparently exposed during the first
week of October.
Dr. Bruce Dixon, director of the Allegheny County Health Department, said a
food item such as green onions might be contaminated at one restaurant but
not others in a community, because of the way restaurants buy perishables.
"It may be that there are different lots and only one lot was
contaminated," said Dixon, who is not involved in the investigation.
"That's the real concern with the whole scenario. You're going to have to
say it was a different lot than what someone else got, or it was only a
certain box or quantity that got contaminated."

Pennsylvania: Hepatitis A Outbreak Now Affects 410
--------------------------------------------------
The toll of those infected by a hepatitis A outbreak at a restaurant
climbed to 410 on Thu 13 Nov 2003, as state health officials continued to
interview each victim for clues about how the virus spread. Those infected
are being interviewed individually by Health Department officials about
when, what and how much they ate at a Chi-Chi's restaurant in the Beaver
Valley Mall that's believed to be the source of the sickness. Because
officials can't pinpoint the cause, Louisville, Kentucky-based Chi-Chi's
has agreed to keep the restaurant closed until 2 Jan 2004 -­ 2 months after
the restaurant voluntarily closed after the initial reports of the disease.
Through Thu 13 Nov 2003, 31 people infected were known to be from Ohio, 8
from West Virginia, one from Florida, and one from South Carolina. Although
not all 410 had been interviewed, the rest of those who had been were from
Pennsylvania ­- including 280 from Beaver County, said Health Department
spokesman Richard McGarvey.
McGarvey said the only real anomaly at this point is one person who
reported being infected after eating at the restaurant 20 Sep 2003 -­ 8
days before any of the other cases. Infectious disease experts say finding
the source of the outbreak can be challenging because hepatitis A has a
long incubation period, meaning the virus could be spread to many places
before it's detected. Pennsylvania health officials didn't begin warning
the public until 3 Nov 2003.
