A cluster of measles cases in Denmark following importation
-----------------------------------------------------------
A total of 5 cases of measles were reported to
the Department of Epidemiology in Denmark between
mid-January and early February 2008. The cluster
involved 4 adults aged between 23 and 39 years
and an infant. All cases resided in the greater
Copenhagen area. 3 cases were unvaccinated, one
was vaccinated with 2 doses, and in one case the
vaccination status is not yet known.

The index case was a 23-year-old unvaccinated man
who developed a rash on 12 Jan 2008, 9 days after
his return to Denmark after travelling to Nepal
and India. The following 4 cases were a
24-year-old woman, a 10-month-old girl, a
26-year-old woman and a 39-year-old man with
onset of rash on 1 Feb 3008. The 2nd case was the
girlfriend of the index case. 2 cases are
believed to have been infected from the index
case while at the waiting room of 2 different
general practitioners' practices, and another one
in the hospital to which the index case was admitted.

All cases were laboratory-confirmed by serology.
Furthermore, the measles virus has been detected
by PCR and identified as genotype D4 in all cases.

The measures taken so far to control the outbreak included the following:

a) Immediate follow-up of possible cases by the
Medical Office of Health in Copenhagen to
identify contacts and the need for prophylactic
measures: administration of immunoglobulin and
the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)
vaccine. Immunoglobulin is recommended to all
those above the age of 4 months within 6 days of
exposure to a measles case. MMR vaccination is
recommended within 72 hours following exposure
[1]. The investigation did not identify any cases
that required post-exposure prophylaxis.

b) Increased awareness of the importance of
isolating patients and immunising hospital staff
in the main hospital in Copenhagen to which the
index case and 2 of the contacts had been admitted.

c) The Medical Office of Health in Copenhagen
issued a notice to all general practitioners,
paediatric wards, departments of infectious
diseases and emergency medical services in
Copenhagen informing them of the newly diagnosed
measles cases. A daycare/parents' centre and
possible contacts were also informed about the
cases and the symptoms of the disease. In cases
of suspected measles infection, they were asked
to 1st contact general practitioners and
emergency medical services by telephone, if
possible, so that the appropriate arrangements
could be made to minimise the risk of nosocomial transmission.

d) The cluster was described in the national
epidemiological bulletin EPI-NEWS to inform
general practitioners across the country and to
highlight the importance of increasing the
vaccination coverage with the MMR vaccine [2].

Discussion
----------
This outbreak shows marked similarities to one
reported from central Italy in 2006 that was
caused by the measles virus genotype D4 following
the index case's return from India [3]. In the
ensuing outbreak that mainly affected young
adults, nosocomial transmission also played a
part in the spread of infection. Genotype D4 is
endemic in both India and Nepal [4], which the
index case had visited prior to onset of his
illness. The prompt laboratory investigation,
including the molecular characterisation of these
cases, has been useful in confirming them and in
identifying measles virus importation from
abroad. Rigorous case investigation and
laboratory testing, including identification of
genotypes, are a necessary component of the
measles elimination plan by 2010 [5].

Molecular characterisation has proven very useful
in documenting the interruption of endemic
measles transmission in Denmark in 2006, when 27
cases were reported and 4 different genotypes
were identified [6]. In that year, 2 variants of
the measles virus genotype D4 that had been
imported from Pakistan and Lebanon were
identified. The D4 genotype of this cluster is
identical to one that has been found in India
(GenBank: MVs/Satara.IND/15.05/1).

The high proportion of young adults among the
cases reflects a surprisingly low exposure of
this age group to the virus even before the
national MMR childhood vaccination programme was
introduced. In Denmark, MMR vaccination was
introduced into the national childhood
vaccination schedule in 1987 [7]. Since then, the
vaccine has been recommended to all those born
after 1974 and is available free of charge to
those under the age of 18 years [8,9]. The
schedule recommends the first MMR vaccination at
15 months and the 2nd dose at 12 years. However,
from 1 April 2008, the age for the 2nd dose will
be lowered to 4 years [2]. Since 2006, MMR
vaccination has also been recommended as a
pre-travel vaccine to unvaccinated travellers
without a history of the disease who are visiting
measles-endemic countries and areas in which
measles outbreaks are known to occur. The same
recommendation extends to children over 9 months [8].

This cluster, although small, shows that pools of
individuals susceptible to measles infection
still exist in Denmark and are brought to light
when the measles virus is imported from abroad.
The cluster also highlights the role of
nosocomial transmission in the spread of
infection. Nosocomial transmission of measles
virus has also recently been described elsewhere
[10,11]. This should raise the awareness of the
spread of infection and the potential for serious
complications in infants and adults and
particularly in immunodeficient patients. It also
shows the importance for health-care workers to
be fully vaccinated against measles if they have
no history of the disease. The age distribution
of the cases in this cluster shows the
vulnerability of unvaccinated adults without a
history of the disease. Therefore, a higher index
of suspicion of measles is required in adults who
present with a rash in a known outbreak setting
or who have a history of travel to areas endemic for measles.

[This report documents another instance of
introduction of measles virus via a traveller
from an endemic region to a non-endemic region,
and the subsequent spread of infection to
unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals
via the healthcare system of the non-endemic
region. The report makes a case for the routine
vaccination of travellers to endemic regions to
reduce the chance of introduction of measles
virus by a returning traveller. The genotyping of
measles virus isolates is playing an increasing
role in elucidating the epidemiology of measles.

genotypes can be accessed at page 475 of Vol. 51

[One would think that hospitals would have an isolation area where
patients with rash could be held before examination. Also that doctors
should move patients arriving with rash to the head of the queue, to
minimize exposure of the other patients in the waiting room. And of
course, all health workers need to have adequate levels of measles
immunity as shown by serology. - Mod.JW]
