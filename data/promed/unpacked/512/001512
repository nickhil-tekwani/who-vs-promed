With [the occurrence of] 11 dead animals, including cattle and burros, the sacrifice of 3 dogs and the application of vaccine against rabies in more then 900 animals, as well as the application of rabies vaccine in humans, were some of the measures that permitted the stabilization and placing of the rabies outbreak under control in Maltrata communities.

[This report indicates that 900 animals have been vaccinated against rabies, without indicating which species were vaccinated. With cattle and burros dead of rabies, presumably bovine and equine animals were vaccinated. The report indicates that this is an outbreak of "derriengue", a term used in Mexico that refers to paralytic rabies transmitted by vampire bats. No mention is made in the brief report above of vampire bat control as part of the measures used to prevent rabies virus transmission. The lyrics of an interesting song about derriengue in Mexico appears in the 1st and 2nd editions of the Natural History of Rabies edited by George Baer. This song, composed by a local farmer, is an outstanding example illustrating the epidemiology of vampire bat transmitted rabies and its serious social and economic consequences in a rural area of Mexico.

The vampire bat species most frequently involved in transmission of bovine paralytic rabies is _Desmodus rotundus_. An image of this bag can be accessed at http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/common-vampire-bat.html.
