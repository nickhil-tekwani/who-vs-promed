Sanofi Genzyme on [Mon 11 Dec 2017] told doctors and pharmacists to return more than 12 000 syringes filled with an injectable arthritis gel because it was contaminated, as the Cambridge-based biotech elevated its "product hold" of last week to a recall. A lot containing 18 000 gel-filled syringes of Sinvisc-One [sic] tested positive for microbial contamination, said Ashleigh Koss, a spokeswoman for the company's French parent, Sanofi SA. Only 12 380 of the syringes were distributed, all in the USA.

Syringes from the lot, which bears the identification number 7RSL021, were associated with an unexpected surge in "adverse events", according to a product hold letter sent to health care providers. The drug was made at the company's plant in Ridgefield, New Jersey.

The company has declined to specify how the lot got contaminated or what the medical problems were, but said there were no deaths associated with the problem. Because some of the distributed syringes may not have been used on patients yet, the drug maker wanted doctors, pharmacists, and clinics to return them to prevent further problems.

[Synvisc-OneÂ® (hylan G-F 20) (http://products.sanofi.us/synviscone/synviscone.html) is an elastoviscous high molecular weight fluid containing hylan A and hylan B polymers produced from chicken combs. Hylans are derivatives of hyaluronan (sodium hyaluronate). Hylan G-F 20 is unique in that the hyaluronan is chemically crosslinked. Hyaluronan is a long-chain polymer containing repeating disaccharide units of Na-glucuronate-N-acetylglucosamine.

ProMED-mail would appreciate more information with regard to the nature of the contamination (bacterial or fungal presumably) and data on affected individuals. - Mod.LL
