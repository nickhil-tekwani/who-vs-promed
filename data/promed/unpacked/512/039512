Summary
-------
Globally, influenza activity continued to increase in the northern hemisphere with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating so far. The antigenic characterization of most recent A(H3N2) viruses so far indicated differences from the A(H3N2) virus used in the influenza vaccines for the northern hemisphere 2014-2015.

- In North America, the levels of influenza activity continued to increase and had passed the seasonal thresholds. Influenza A(H3N2) virus predominated.
- In Europe, overall influenza activity mainly associated with A(H3N2) virus continued to increase, but remained at low levels.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity continued to increase with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating.
- In northern Africa, influenza activity increased with influenza B virus predominating, except for Egypt, where influenza activity was low.
- In eastern and western Africa, influenza activity was low or decreasing, except for the United Republic of Tanzania, where increased detections of influenza A(H3N2) were reported.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza activity was low, with the exception of Costa Rica and Cuba, where an increase of influenza detections was reported.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity was low.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels.

- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 23 Dec 2014 10:15 UTC), during weeks 49 to 50 (30 Nov 2014 to 13 Dec 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 79 countries, areas, or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 70 341 specimens. 12 567 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 11 826 (94.1 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 741 (5.9 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 109 (1.8 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 6025 (98.2 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 134 (99.3 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and one (0.7 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.
