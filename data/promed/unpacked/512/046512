The OIE report says that there was a previous outbreak on 5 Jul 2017, but we lack any notification of a July outbreak, only in Botosani in June 2017; see below. The Romanian authorities are to be congratulated on tracking the source of the associated human case. Anthrax in sheep and goats in Romania is very infrequently reported. Since 2004 only 4 outbreaks have been reported; 2007 (1), 2014 (1), and 2016 (2). - Mod.MHJ]
