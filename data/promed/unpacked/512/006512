The New Mexico Department of Health announced today, 1 Nov 2013, a fatal case of plague in an 80-year-old man from Bernalillo County. Confirmatory testing was performed at the Department's Scientific Laboratory Division. This is the 4th human case of plague in New Mexico and in the USA in 2013. An environmental investigation by the Urban Biology Division of the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department will take place at the man's home to look for ongoing risk to others in the surrounding area.

"The Department of Health will work with health care providers and others close to the patient to determine if they have been exposed to plague and require preventive treatment," said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. "As winter approaches, it's important for families to keep wood piles -- where rodents can live -- as far away from your home as possible."

"People living in areas known to have plague should ensure that their dogs and cats are treated year-round with flea control. This will help prevent domestic animals from bringing plague-infected fleas into the home," said Dr. Paul Smith with the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department.

"Though the peak of plague activity is during the summer months from May to August, we have had human plague cases in New Mexico every month of the year," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian at the Department of Health. "Taking precautions year-round should be a routine that everyone takes seriously."

With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report to the New Mexico Department of Health.

The 1st 3 human plague cases in New Mexico in 2013 were in a 15-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl, both from Torrance County; and a 52-year-old man from Santa Fe County. All 3 have recovered. There was one human plague case in New Mexico in 2012, 2 human cases of plague in 2011, no cases in 2010, and 6 human cases of plague in 2009, one of them fatal.

[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA are reported from the Four Corners area of the USA where the states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico come together.

As outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: "Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.

"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.

"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal." - Mod.LL
