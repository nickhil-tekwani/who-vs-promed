CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and
the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of Salmonella serotype I
4,[5],12:i:- infections. Investigators are using DNA analysis of
bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing to identify cases of
illness that may be part of this outbreak.

From 1 Nov 2010 through 4 Jan 2011, 112 individuals infected with
the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype I
4,[5],12:i:-, whose illnesses began (onset dates) since 1 Nov 2010,
have been reported from 18 states and the District of Columbia. The
number of ill persons identified in each state and the District of
Columbia with the outbreak strain is as follows: California (1),
Colorado (1), Connecticut (1), District of Columbia (1), Georgia (1),
Hawaii (1), Iowa (1), Illinois (59), Indiana (10), Kentucky (1),
Massachusetts (2), Missouri (22), New York (1), Pennsylvania (3),
South Dakota (1), Tennessee (1), Texas (1), Virginia (1), and
Wisconsin (3). Among 111 persons for whom information is available,
illness onset dates range from 1 Nov 2010 to 24 Dec 2010.
Case-patients range in age from 1 to 75 years-old, with a median age
of 28 years-old. 75 patients (or 68 percent) are female. Among
persons with available information, 24 percent reported being
hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Because the pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern associated with this particular
_Salmonella_ serotype commonly occurs in the USA, some of the cases
identified may not be related to this outbreak.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
Collaborative investigative efforts of local, state, and federal
public health and regulatory agencies have linked this outbreak to
consumption of Tiny Greens Alfalfa Sprouts and Spicy Sprouts (which
contain alfalfa sprouts mixed with radish and clover sprouts). The
sprouts were distributed to various customers, including farmers'
markets, restaurants and groceries in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and
Missouri, and may also have been distributed to other Midwestern states.

Approximately half of the illnesses occurred in Illinois, where many
of the ill individuals ate sandwiches containing sprouts at various
Jimmy John's outlets. Jimmy John's restaurants have voluntarily
suspended serving sprouts at their Illinois franchise locations.

The FDA and the state regulatory agency conducted an inspection,
including sample collections, at Tiny Greens Organic Farm. The
investigation on how contamination may have occurred is continuing.

This investigation is ongoing. CDC, FDA, and state and local public
health partners are continuing surveillance to identify new cases and
trace potentially contaminated products. CDC will continue to update
the public on the progress of this investigation as information
becomes available.

Sprouts and Foodborne Illness
------------------------------
Since 1996, there have been at least 30 reported outbreaks of
foodborne illness associated with different types of raw and lightly
cooked sprouts. Most of these outbreaks were caused by _Salmonella_
and _E. coli_ infections.

Recall Information
-------------------
Recently, Tiny Greens Organic Farm of Urbana, Illinois, announced a
recall of specific lots of Alfalfa Sprouts and Spicy Sprouts because
they have the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_. Product
was distributed through various distributors in Illinois, Indiana,
and Missouri and could have ended up in restaurants and supermarkets
near those areas.

[No reports have yet appeared of isolation of the outbreak strain
from the sprouts, but they appear to be the reservoir based on sound
epidemiologic grounds.

Since it is a new year, we re-publish information as discussed by Ana
Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric Bacteriology Section at the
British Columbia Centre for Disease Control)
<http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf>
as follows:

_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S.
enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_,
_arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_ and _indica_. _S. enterica_
subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually
isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority
of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5], 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with
the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries
somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the Group B antigens). Paccagnella
pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed
in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the
flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the
serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H
antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to
another; as an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. The
outbreak organism here, however, is monophasic. Echeita and
colleagues (1) have found that this monophasic strain appears to be
such due to the absence of the _flj_B gene, which is involved in the
H antigen switching mechanism. According to Paccagnella, around 1903,
Smith and Reagh reported on the different behavior of the flagellar
and somatic antigens of salmonella strains. Their work was mostly
ignored until Weil and Felix, working on _Proteus_ cultures, noted 2
forms, the swarming form called the H form (_mit Hauch_, in English:
with breath) and the non-swarming form, called the O form (_ohne
Hauch_, in English: without breath). The H form contained both O and
H antigens (correctly termed the OH form). These parallels were
transposed to the salmonella antigens.

If O antiserum is added to a culture, motility is preserved, whereas
if H antiserum is added, the culture does not move. Therefore, H
antigen was involved with swarming in the agar plate (breathing might
have been used to imply the ability to move). (Salmonellae, of
course, do not swarm on certain agar plates like _Proteus_ bacteria do.)

Several other foodborne outbreaks related to 4, 5, 12:i:- salmonellae
have been reported, including one in New York City reported in 2002
(2). Additional information about this monophasic organism, which may
be resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, can be found in references 3-5.
