The encephalitis outbreak in northern West Bengal has claimed one more life, taking the death toll in the entire state this year to 212, an official said Wednesday [13 Aug 2014].

According to BR Satpathi, director of state health services, 693 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases were reported this year [2014] in the state. "As many as 212 deaths due to AES have occurred in Bengal since January. Of them, 44 died due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus infection]," Satpathi told IANS. JE is a subset of AES caused by the mosquito-borne virus.

The number of deaths this year [2014] due to AES in north Bengal is 108, while 40 of them were due to JE. "There has been one death and 2 suspected cases of AES in the last one day," he said.

Encephalitis is a disease that results in inflammation of the brain, affecting the patient's central nervous system. It can be caused due to bacterial or viral infections of the brain, injection of toxic substances, or complications of an infectious disease.

While the lesser symptoms include headache and fever, the more severe ones cause the onset of mental issues like seizures, confusion, disorientation, tremors, and hallucinations.

For JE, while human beings are the dead-end hosts of the virus, pigs act as amplifying hosts that aid in spread of the disease [and birds, especially ardeids, are reservoirs of the virus. - Mod.TY]

[The number of AES cases and deaths in West Bengal continues to rise. Only 44 of the 212 deaths were attributed to JE virus infections. Revisiting the comments by Dr T Jacob John, the number of JE cases may be higher. Others early in the year may be due to a Reye-like syndrome. He noted, in his 3 Aug 2014 comment (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140804.2656983), "Assam and the northern part of West Bengal are contiguous and traditionally Japanese encephalitis virus-enzootic areas." He continued, adding that, "the term acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is used in the context of JE epidemics to denote encephalitis cases that are not laboratory confirmed for one reason or another. Thus, in Assam and West Bengal, the cases of JE and AES should be added up to see the real magnitude of the JE outbreak. I understand that West Nile virus is also present in that region, and some AES may indeed be West Nile encephalitis."
