Haut-Lomami: 4 health zones affected by wild poliovirus
-------------------------------------------------------
A total of 4 out of 16 health zones in Haut-Lomami province are affected by several cases of wild poliovirus. According to the provincial Minister of Health, Jean Tayari Kiswabantu, actions are planned including the response to prevent the spread of this disease that cripples humans. This will be done with the support of the province's partners.

"There is the Mukanga health zone with 3 cases precisely in the Kasenga I and Kasenga II health areas, there is the Kinkondja health zone with only 1 case, precisely in the Kipamba health area. Kitenge Health Zone has 1 case in Kileo Health Area and Malemba Nkulu Health Zone has 5 cases. We sent a team from the DPS (Provincial Health Directorate) to the intermediate level for the investigation. They took the samples that the province sent to the laboratory in Lubumbashi. The diagnosis has been confirmed," he said.

The provincial Minister of Health announces actions to stop the circulation of the polio virus: "In relation to the actions to be taken, it is the organization of the response, the awareness of the community with the systematic search for zero-dose children. This will allow the recovery of all these children who escape routine vaccination."

[The affected province of Haut-Lomami has an ongoing outbreak of cVDPV1 (see sections [2] and [3] below). I was unable to identify if the lab in Lumbumbashi has genomic testing capabilities to identify cVDPVs. That being said, while Haut Lomami is not adjacent to Malawi or Mozambique where WPV1 has been imported and is circulating (see https://www.africaguide.com/afmap.htm), introduction of the WPV1 could have occurred through population movement in the region. If so, this would be a major set back for the Polio Eradication Initiative. I suspect the virus responsible for these AFP cases is the cVDP1 that has been circulating in the area.

More information on this identified outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

Poliovirus weekly update as of 26 Oct 2022, World Health Organization
---------------------------------------------------------------------
New wild poliovirus isolates reported this week:
AFP cases: 0
Environment: 1
Others: 0

New cVDPV isolates reported this week:
AFP cases: 9
Environment: 2
Others: 7

Headlines
• [24 Oct 2022] marked World Polio Day and partners and countries around the world used the opportunity to raise awareness and resources for polio eradication. The WHO European Regional Office held an event celebrating 20 years since WPV certification. In Geneva, Rotary and WHO joined forces to discuss how the organization's efforts to eradicate polio can now be applied to broader maternal and child health issues. Many thanks to all partners, friends and countries who participated to make World Polio Day a success around the world.

• nOPV2 rollout: Approximately 500 million doses of nOPV2 have been administered across 23 countries under its WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) to date. An additional 16 countries have met the requirements for nOPV2 use in the event of an outbreak. More information on nOPV2 at https://polioeradication.org/nOPV2/

Summary of new polioviruses this week:
- Afghanistan: 1 WPV1 positive environmental sample
- Algeria: 2 cVDPV2 positive environmental samples
- DR Congo: 1 cVDPV1 case and 6 cVDPV2 cases
- Niger: 1 cVDPV2 case
- Nigeria: 1 cVDPV2 case

Afghanistan
• No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported this week. There are 2 cases reported in 2022. There were 4 cases in 2021.
• 1 WPV1 positive environmental sample was reported in Nangharar.
• The total number of cVDPV2 cases in the country is 43.
• Afghanistan is affected by 3, critical cross-border epidemiological corridors with Pakistan:
• The northern corridor specifically comprising Eastern Region and central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan; the southern corridor, comprising Quetta Block of Pakistan and Southern Region, Afghanistan; and, the central corridor, comprising southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and South-East Region in Afghanistan.
• Of note, in 2022, the central corridor had multiple WPV1 detections from polio cases and environmental samples, mainly from southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
• Districts along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the 3 epidemiological corridors are at high risk for poliovirus transmission, given the high proportion of zero-dose children and inconsistent quality of polio vaccination campaigns in some areas.
• The Pakistan and Afghanistan polio programmes continue to coordinate on surveillance and vaccination activities through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Support Hub, based in Amman, Jordan.

Pakistan
• No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported this week. There are 20 cases in 2022. There was 1 WPV1 case in 2021.
• As Pakistan continues to struggle from the effects of the devastating floods affecting parts of the country, polio staff on the ground continue to assist emergency relief efforts.
• In flood-affected districts, the polio effort is supporting establishment of critical health camps, to provide basic clinical services, particularly ensuring treatment of water-borne and vector-borne diseases and distributing water purification tablets. All routine immunization antigens are also provided to target children and pregnant women. Staff are actively conducting surveillance for communicable diseases, identifying nutrition needs of displaced populations, and collecting and analysing life-saving data to help target response strategies. Polio programmes around the world have a long history of supporting broader public health and humanitarian emergencies, as was the situation earlier this year [2022] in Afghanistan, following the devasting earthquake there.
• At the same time, the polio programme is adapting its operations, to ensure polio eradication efforts can continue unabated, even amid the tragedy. The programme is at a critical juncture -- intensive response is ongoing to stop this year's [2022] outbreak in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Virus linked to this outbreak was last month [September 2022] detected in an environmental sample from Karachi, in the south of the country. At the same time, the high transmission season for polio transmission is now starting and this transmission risks being particularly intense given the floods.
• Detection of virus in Karachi is not unexpected, given the large-scale and frequent population movements between Karachi and the rest of the country, in particular Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Urgent efforts are underway, coordinated by the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (NEOC and PEOC), to continue surveillance efforts in greater Karachi and further boost immunity levels through health camps, to prevent polio from establishing a foothold in Pakistan's largest city which has historically been a major polio reservoir.
• Despite the extraordinary climatic conditions and consequent operational challenges aggravated by the collapse of infrastructure, the programme continued with the August [2022] polio campaign -- including across Karachi -- and re-adjusted the schedule in all accessible areas. While the immunization campaign could not be conducted in Balochistan and parts of Sindh, the effort managed to reach nearly 32 million children in the country, with health workers wading through deep water to reach children with the life-saving vaccine.
• At the same time, the programme has undertaken contingency planning to resume intensified vaccination activities in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to stop the outbreak, as soon as the situation allows. The programme continues to innovate, adapt, and find opportunities to build children's immunity through vaccination at health camps, at transit points, and in settlements for displaced persons.

Afghanistan
• No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported this week. There are 2 cases reported in 2022. There were 4 cases in 2021.
• 1 WPV1 positive environmental sample was reported in Kunar.
• The total number of cVDPV2 cases in the country remain 43.
• Kunar, along with the rest of the country's Eastern Region, is part of 1 of 3, critical cross-border epidemiological corridors with Pakistan, the northern corridor specifically comprising Eastern Region and central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. Case response is currently being planned in the immediate area and the broader corridor. The other 2 cross-border epidemiological corridors are the southern corridor, comprising Quetta Block of Pakistan and Southern Region, Afghanistan; and, the central corridor, comprising southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and South-East Region in Afghanistan.
• Of note, in 2022, the central corridor had multiple WPV1 detections from polio cases and environmental samples, mainly from southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
• Districts along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the 3 epidemiological corridors are at high risk for poliovirus transmission, given the high proportion of zero-dose children and inconsistent quality of polio vaccination campaigns in some areas.
• The Pakistan and Afghanistan polio programmes continue to coordinate on surveillance and vaccination activities through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Support Hub, based in Amman, Jordan.

Pakistan

• nOPV2 for the campaign was received on 19 Jul 2022, cleared by the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) and is currently stored in the national cold room in VACSERA.
• A training of trainers (ToT) was conducted for Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) on social mobilization and community engagement; ERC trainers will train community leaders from non-Egyptian communities in Giza and Cairo for upcoming SNID.
• Following 4 months without detection of cVDPV2, the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) with support from WHO conducted an internal surveillance review in 7 high-priority governorates over 4-15 Sep 2022 to identify gaps and provide recommendations for strengthening polio surveillance. Notably, the 2nd detection of the variant occurred just afterwards.

[First, an apology for the radio silence on my part. Unfortunately, there were medical issues that precluded writing these reports.

Poliovirus, both the wild virus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, continues to be identified globally. In the period of time covered by this update, there has been evidence of ongoing transmission of the WPV1 in 3 countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Mozambique), evidence of transmission of cVDPV1 in 3 countries (DR Congo, Malawi and Mozambique) and of cVDPV2 in 12 countries (Algeria, Benin, CAR, Congo DR, Egypt, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, Togo, Yemen).

A media report provided information on positive environmental samples identified in the Boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens in New York City, USA. It mentioned that positive ESs had been found in 6 counties: Kings (Brooklyn), Nassau, Orange, Queens, Rockland, and Sullivan Counties. (https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/poliovirus-found-in-brooklyn-and-queens-sewage-samples-new-york-health-officials-say.html).

As stated previously, 2022 to date has been a good year for viruses but not for eradication efforts. The toll of back-to-back (now concurrent) pandemics of COVID-19 and Monkeypox along with civil unrest and natural disasters is showing more and more as public health infrastructures have been hard hit.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]
