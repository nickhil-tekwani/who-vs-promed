Kerala rat disease kills 60
-----------------------------
Health officials in the southern Indian state of Kerala say that a
disease spread by rats has resulted in the deaths of nearly 60 people
in the last 3 months.
According to the state's health department, new cases of the disease,
which is called leptospirosis, are being reported daily from
different parts of the state. In the city of Ernakulam in the past 24
hours 10 people are believed to have contracted it.
Doctors say the disease, which leads to high fever, spreads from the
urine of rats. Outbreaks are known to occur during the monsoon
season, when rats breed in the paddy fields, but this outbreak
appears to affect more individuals.
