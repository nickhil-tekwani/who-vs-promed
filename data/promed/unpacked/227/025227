A big rise in the potentially deadly Q fever has sparked a health alert and officials have urged people who work with animals to get vaccinated.

There have been 27 cases reported this year [2016], more than double the number last year [2015] and almost triple the number of cases 5 years ago.

Q fever is caused by direct or indirect contact with the bacteria from infected animals.

SA [South Australia] Health Chief Medical Officer Professor Paddy Phillips said the main carriers tend to be cattle, sheep or goats, but animals including cats, dogs, camels and kangaroos may also carry the infection.

"Q fever is typically an occupational disease of meat workers, farmers and hobby farmers, kangaroo hunters, shearers and veterinarians," he said.

"Symptoms include a fever which may last up to 4 weeks, severe headache, sweats and chills, chest pains when breathing, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.

"Some people may develop pneumonia and inflammation of the liver, while in rare cases serious complications such as endocarditis -- infection of the heart valves -- can appear years after initial infection."

Prof Phillips said only about half of the infected people show signs of the illness and onset of symptoms can be sudden. But with an early diagnosis and effective antibiotic therapy, a good outcome can be expected.

Most people recover within several months but 1 to 2 per cent of people who develop acute Q fever die of the disease.

Q fever vaccination can only be provided by trained and authorised doctors -- they are listed on the SA Health website.

These doctors will take a blood sample and skin test to see if the individual previously has been exposed to Q fever, as vaccinating those already exposed can result in a severe reaction.

Prof Phillips said person-to-person spread of Q fever is extremely rare and it usually occurs when people breathe in bacteria within dust, or come into contact with contaminated clothing, wool, hides or straw.

"Vaccination is recommended for farmers, livestock transporters, workers in abattoirs, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers, shearers and wool sorters, veterinarians, professional dog and cat breeders, tanning and hide workers and laboratory personnel handling veterinary products," he said.

Where the vaccine is not provided or funded by the employer, the individual can claim back the cost on their tax return.

[Q fever is an infection caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, a type of bacterium found worldwide except New Zealand. The infection is almost always related to direct or indirect contact with animals such as cattle, sheep or goats, although a wide range of animals including cats, dogs and kangaroos may carry the infection. Infection in animals is probably common, but animals usually do not appear to be ill.

The bacteria pass into milk, urine and faeces of infected animals and during birthing, large numbers of organisms are shed in the birth products. Q fever organisms are resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants, allowing them to survive for long periods in the environment.

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of the bacteria in air carrying dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, urine or faeces of infected herd animals. Contaminated clothing, wool, hides or straw may also be a source of infection. Person-to-person spread is extremely unlikely. Usually, Q fever is an occupational disease of meat workers, farmers and veterinarians (vets). People living within 1 kilometre [about 0.6 miles] downwind of an abattoir are also at increased risk of infection.

Only about half of all people infected with _Coxiella burnetii_ show signs of clinical illness, but onset of symptoms is usually sudden, with one or more of the following:
- fever, which may last for up to 4 weeks
- severe headache
- sweats and chills
- fatigue -- and a prolonged fatigue (post Q fever fatigue syndrome) may follow infection
- muscle aches
- confusion
- sore throat
- dry cough
- chest pain on breathing
- nausea, vomiting
- diarrhoea
- abdominal pain.

Up to half of symptomatic cases will develop pneumonia (lung infection or inflammation) and many people will have inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). However, most people will recover within several months without any treatment and only 1 to 2 percent of people with acute Q fever die of the disease.

Some people may develop chronic Q fever after exposure. Infection persists for more than 6 months and may not be apparent until many years after the initial infection. It is rare, but can have serious complications such as endocarditis (infection of the heart valves).

People at most risk of developing chronic Q fever include:
- those with underlying heart abnormalities
- transplant recipients
- cancer patients
- those with chronic kidney disease.

Incubation time is approximately 2-3 weeks but can range from 4 days to 6 weeks.

Diagnosis is made by a series of blood tests.

Effective antibiotic therapy is available. With early diagnosis, treatment is simple and a good outcome can be expected.

It is extremely rare for the disease to pass between people. So keeping someone home from work/school/social events is not necessary. What is necessary to prevent the spread is to refrain from drinking unpasteurized milk.

A Q fever vaccine is available in Australia and is 83 to 100 percent effective in preventing the disease. However, the vaccine can only be given to individuals 15 years of age and over.

Prior to immunisation, a blood and a skin test is recommended to see if the individual has previously been exposed to Q fever -- either naturally or by previous vaccination. Vaccinating those already exposed to Q fever can result in severe reactions.

Vaccination will not prevent disease in someone who has already been infected but is in the incubation period of the disease.

Q fever vaccination is recommended for:
- abattoir workers and contract workers in cattle, sheep dairy and goat abattoirs (but not pig abattoirs)
- farmers, stockyard workers and livestock transporters
- agricultural college staff and students and wildlife and zoo workers exposed to high risk animals
- shearers and wool sorters
- veterinarians, veterinary nurses and students
- professional dog and cat breeders, tanning and hide workers and laboratory personnel handling veterinary products or working with the organism
- others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats and kangaroos or their products.

People considering immunisation against Q fever should contact their doctor or an approved Q fever vaccination provider in South Australia. The Q fever vaccination register contains the location and contact details of approved Q fever vaccination providers in South Australia.

The information provided by the SA Health website is applicable to other countries as well, albeit not all countries have kangaroos or they are only in zoos and therefore zoo workers may need to be alerted to this situation.
