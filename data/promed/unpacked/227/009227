Report date: 9 Sep 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 9 Sep 2013
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: _Bonamia exitiosa_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Stage Harbor, Chatham, Barnstable, Massachusetts
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Jun 2013
Outbreak status: resolved (29 Aug 2013)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: Salt water
Population type: Farmed
Production system: Open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Eastern (American) oyster (_Crassostrea virginica_) / 0 (scale 0 to 5) / 0 (scale 0 to 5) / / / 0 / 0 /0
Affected population: 2-month-old, 8 mm, _Crassostrea virginica_ (Eastern American oyster) seed held at a nursery site in open water.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Eastern (American) oyster (_Crassostrea virginica_) / / ** / 0 / 0 / 0
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: through routine testing, _Bonamia exitiosa_ infection was detected in _Crassostrea virginica_ (Eastern American oyster) outside the known area of occurrence. The farmed species (_C. virginica_) were in open water. _Mercenaria mercenaria_ seed of similar age held at the same site were laboratory tested negative for _Bonamia_ infection.
_Crassostrea virginica_ seed were hatchery-produced, tested negative for _Bonamia_ infection, and then placed at nursery site when approximately one month old.
The affected stock (_C. virginica_) showed no increased morbidity or mortality (sub-clinical). Prevalence determined by histology was approximately 23 percent and parasite was detected principally in gill tissues. Additional sampling and studies are to be conducted but no official action in relation to the infection with _B. exitiosa_ event is planned at this time.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Kennebec River Biosciences (Local laboratory) / Eastern (American) oyster (_Crassostrea virginica_) / histopathological examination / 27 Jun 2013 / Inconclusive
Kennebec River Biosciences (Local laboratory) / Eastern (American) oyster (_Crassostrea virginica_) / nucleotide sequencing / 23 Jul 2013 / Positive
Kennebec River Biosciences (Local laboratory) / Eastern (American) oyster (_Crassostrea virginica_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 11 Jul 2013 / Positive

[According to chapter 2.4.2 of the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals 2013, "_Bonamia exitiosa_ is a Haplosporidia protozoan parasite (Carnegie & Cochennec-Laureau, 2004) infecting haemocytes of several oyster species and inducing physiological disorders and eventually death of the animal (Cranfield et al, 2005; Dinamani et al., 1987). For the purpose of this chapter, infection with _Bonamia exitiosa_ is considered to be infection with _B. exitiosa_ previously named _B. exitiosus_ (Berthe & Hine, 2003; Hine et al, 2001). This definition excludes infections with _B. ostreae_ (Pichot et al, 1979), _B. roughleyi_ (Cochennec et al, 2003; Farley et al, 1988), and _B. perspora_ (Carnegie et al, 2006). _Bonamia_ spp that are not identified to the species level (Burreson et al, 2004; Campalans et al, 2000; Kroeck & Montes, 2005) should be referred to the appropriate OIE Reference Laboratory.‚Äù

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to Infection with _Bonamia exitiosa_ are spelled out in chapter 11.2. of OIE's Aquatic Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.2.htm.

The disease has been reported previously in other limited zones of the country (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist (Note: to view the information on _Bonamia exitiosa_, you need to scroll down to the name of the aquatic disease).
Comment: although not a new disease, this event is being reported because US experts consider this detection to occur in a different geographical zone than last year's (2012) occurrence in North Carolina. - Mod.CRD
