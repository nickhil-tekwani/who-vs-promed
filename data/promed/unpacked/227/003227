[I have been asked by my colleague, Bonner Stewart, to post this update on
the distribution of _Angiostrongylus (Parastrongylus) cantonensis_ in the
United States. - MHJ
Since its problematic arrival in the United States in the early 1980's and
first reports in New Orleans in 1988 (Campbell & Little, Am J Trop Med Hyg
38:568-573), the death of a non-human primate at the Audubon Zoo (1990) and
a human infection (1995) attributed to _A. cantonensis_ in New Orleans
have been reported. In 1996 numerous _A. cantonensis_ were recovered from
the spinal cord of a miniature horse euthanised at the LSU Veterinary
Hospital in Baton Rouge. The infection of the animal probably took place in
Picayune, MS. In 1988 the deaths of a marmoset from New Iberia and a wood
rat from the outskirts of Baton Rouge were attributed to this parasite.
Since the detection of its presence in New Orleans in 1987, the parasite's
range has expanded to 109 miles (New Iberia, LA) WNW of the city, 73 miles
(Baton Rouge, LA) NW, and 44 miles (Picayune, MS). The incidence of the
parasite in the Baton Rouge _Rattus norvegicus_ population in 1997 was
approximately the same as that reported for New Orleans in 1988.
