Two cats from different households in Colorado have tested positive
for H1N1, according to Colorado State University's (CSU) Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory. The felines are expected to recover, but their
cases serve as a reminder to pet owners to seek veterinary attention
for companion animals that appear to be ill.

The cats in these 2 cases were diagnosed with lower respiratory tract
infections by Colorado veterinarians. Both cats are currently ill and
have been ill for multiple weeks, with one illness beginning on 2 Oct
2009 and the other beginning in early November. Antibiotics do not
treat H1N1, but both cats received antibiotics as a precaution
against secondary bacterial infections. Neither cat had signs that
responded to antibiotics.

"We expect that both cats will recover, but these cases serve as a
reminder to pet owners to seek veterinary attention as soon as
possible if their pet seems ill. This flu has also been identified in
ferrets, exotic cats and birds in the United States, so any companion
animal that appears to have the flu should get immediate attention,"
said Kristy Pabilonia, a veterinarian and expert on H1N1 testing in
animals at CSU.

"We are very interested in understanding more about H1N1 in cats and
other pets and providing tests to veterinarians who suspect H1N1 in
companion animals."

Swabs from the cats' mouth and nose were tested by CSU and additional
blood serum confirmation testing from Iowa State University confirmed
that they have the pandemic H1N1 strain. Veterinarians believe that
both of the cats became ill with H1N1 after a person in their
household contracted the virus.

In addition to receiving veterinary care, cats and ferrets with H1N1
should be made comfortable and get plenty of rest, enticing food, and fluids.

The USDA has reported 3 other confirmed cases of H1N1 in cats, one
each in Oregon, Iowa, and Pennsylvania. At least 4 ferrets have been
confirmed to have H1N1, four in Oregon and one in Nebraska. Pabilonia
said that because this strain of H1N1 is new, information about how
it impacts animals is limited. It is possible that any animal may be
susceptible to H1N1, but no other cases have been documented in
companion animals. To date, there are no reported cases of H1N1 in
dogs in the United States. Pet birds have been susceptible to other
strains of the flu, but no cases of H1N1 in these animals have been reported.

People with H1N1 or any flu should be careful when in contact with
their pets. Pabilonia recommends that they practice social distancing
with pets just as they would with people. People who are ill should
wash their hands before handling pets and, if possible, have someone
who is well feed and care for pets. Just like people, pets are
exposed to H1N1 through aerosols -- fluids released when someone
sneezes, coughs, or touches their face and then a surface.

Because there have only been a few cases of H1N1 flu in pets,
veterinarians have limited information about the symptoms. Pets with
H1N1 may behave as if they aren't feeling well, acting lethargic and
may appear to have a respiratory illness. If a pet seems ill, it
should be taken to a veterinarian for an exam as soon as possible and
the veterinarian should be alerted that the pet has been exposed to
someone with influenza. CSU's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory is
testing pets for H1N1 as part of the US Department of Agriculture's
National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The test detects H1N1
influenza virus in animals.

Tests are performed on nasal or mouth swabs. Swabs should be obtained
by a veterinarian and submitted to the lab for results.

[If you have the flu regardless of the strain, it is important to be
careful around your pets. Clearly they are susceptible to certain
strains of the influenza virus. Likewise as we learn more about these
viruses in animals we may learn that more strains than H1N1 affect
animals. - Mod.TG]
