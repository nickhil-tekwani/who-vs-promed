First Cases of Sheep Disease Scrapie Found in Spain
----------------------------------------------------
MADRID, Spain - The regional government of Navarre said it had detected
Spain's first outbreaks of scrapie in sheep, a transmissible spongiform
encephlopathy (TSE) not believed to be transmissible to humans. A spokesman
for the government of the northern region said the problem was under
control, with a herd of 2 200 sheep having already been terminated and
another 600 due to be culled.
"We have had cases of scrapie in 2 farms and they're the first cases (in
Spain) to be publicly declared," Navarre agricultural spokesman Javier
Errea said. The newspaper, El Pais, reported there had been other cases in
Spain, but they had not been confirmed publicly. No one at the Agriculture
Ministry was available to comment.
Scrapie is a variant of the same family as bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE, mad cow disease), the cattle brain-wasting disorder that has been
blamed for more than 79 human deaths in Britain alone. The European Union
said last week BSE probably exists in cattle in Spain, Germany and Italy,
although those countries deny the presence of the disease.
BSE has yet to show up in sheep, but Professor Emmanuel Vanopdenbosch, one
of the European Union's top scientists in the subject, told the Belgian
newspaper, De Morgen, "The BSE question with sheep is a time bomb
continuing to tick." Errea said the risk of the sheep disease being passed
on to cows and perpetuated had been eradicated by a 1994 law banning the
use of animal remains in cattle feed. "In reality there is no reason for
concern," he said.
However concerns of BSE appearing in sheep have recently been highlighted
by a case in Vermont in the United States where 4 sheep tested positive for
a TSE. Experts say it could take years before it is known which form of TSE
the Vermont sheep had.
