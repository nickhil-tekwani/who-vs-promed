Cases of a camel plague: Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan
---------------------------------------------------
Cases of camel plague have been recorded in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan
and Turkmenistan, says Dr Zahtab, Chief of the Central Veterinary
Directorate in the Iranian province Gulistan. Gulistan shares a
border with Turkmenistan, hence the decision to apply preventive
measures against the introduction of camel plague. This includes
patrols of veterinary teams along the province's frontiers and
surveillance activities.
So far, no symptoms of camel plague have been detected. Up to now,
5000 camels have been registered in the frontier areas of Gulistan.

[The use of the term Camel plague, as a specific camel-related
disease entity, might be misleading and confused with Cattle plague
(rinderpest). The issue is the potential spread of plague, caused by
_Yersinia pestis_, to humans.
Of the domestic animals, cattle, horses, sheep and pigs are not known
to develop plague. Goats and camels have reportedly developed
clinical illness, and there have been several human outbreaks of
plague attributable to ingestion of camel meat infected with
_Yersinia pestis_ in Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries (see
references).
