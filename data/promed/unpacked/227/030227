The [Colombian] National Institute of Health confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the departments of Bolivar, Cordoba, Norte de Santander, San Andres and Sucre. The municipalities where the virus is present are Arjona, Cartagena, Cordoba, Santa Rosa, Turbaco, Monteria, San Cayetano, San Andres and Sincelejo.

The Ministry of Health and Social Protection confirmed the possibility that the virus was introduced into the country by a tourist who arrived in Cartagena de Indias (Bolivar department). "That is what happened with chikungunya [virus]; Zika virus has come to Colombia to stay. It is [causes] a disease that was introduced into the Americas from Easter Island (Chile) and later appeared in Brazil, as we came to know this past June [2015], when we indicated the imminent arrival of the virus in the country," the Vice Minister of Public Health, Fernando Ruiz Gomez, said.

This official indicated that the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito now has the capacity to transmit not just dengue and chikungunya [viruses], but also Zika [virus]. "We request that extreme measures be taken to control mosquito breeding sites, that is to say clean water catchments where the mosquito reproduces. If there are no breeding sites, there will be no dengue, chikungunya nor Zika [virus] mosquito vectors," [he said].

The Director General of the National Institute of Health, Martha Lucia Ospina Martinez, indicated that the Institute has carried out the laboratory procedures to confirm the presence of the virus and has sent [samples] for testing to the Center for Disease Prevention and Control in Atlanta, Georgia [USA], where the tests done in the country [Colombia] will be validated.

This is a disease that causes fever and rash with symptoms that appear 3-12 days after the person has been bitten by an [infected] female _Aedes aegypti_. Infected people have a fever that is not very high, red eyes without secretions or itching, red to white skin spots, sporadic pain in joints and muscles, backache and headache and possible neurological and immunological effects (in few cases). In any event, it is considered a disease that is less aggressive than dengue or chikungunya.

This disease is treated with acetaminophen or paracetamol and antihistamines, but one must avoid self-medication. There is no curative treatment; however, it [the disease] can be managed at home taking care to provide liquids, rest and use of a mosquito net.

[The Colombian health services are to be congratulated for proactively monitoring the spread of Zika virus infections in the country. It is a good example of surveillance coupled with laboratory support and verification of laboratory results by an outside reference laboratory, in this instance the US CDC. Unfortunately, there are no epidemiological barriers to halt the spread of Zika virus in the country, nor its spread to neighboring countries, in areas where chikungunya and dengue viruses are transmitted.
