FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, SUSPECTED - PAKISTAN

Hundreds of thousands of sacrificial cattle are being herded together in
Pakistan for a major Muslim festival. Some of the animals are showing signs
of a disease similar to Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), which has struck Europe.
Veterinarians and animal traders said thousands of animals brought to
Karachi -- where nearly half a million beasts have arrived in the last 20
days -- had shown symptoms of a disease affecting the animals' feet and
mouths. "In one of our medical camps alone we have treated 15 000 cattle in
the last 20 days," said A.R. Rajput, a veterinary doctor.
But he said the disease was not as harmful as that in Britain, where
thousands of animals have been destroyed in a bid to halt the spread of the
virus. The provincial animal husbandry department shrugged off the reports
FMD was present, and said there had been no reports of animal deaths at the
market.
The animals are being gathered for the Eid al-Adha (Feast of the
Sacrifice), a major Muslim festival when people slaughter cows, sheep,
goats, or camels to mark a sacrifice first given by Abraham, who is
considered Islam's first prophet.
As Rajput spoke, a cattle trader arrived at one of his 4 medical camps
asking for medicine for his animals, which he said were suffering from
symptoms similar to FMD. "One of them has a mouth infection and also has
trouble in its hooves," he told Rajput.
The site, which is spread over more than 12 acres of land on the main
highway linking the port city of Karachi to the rest of the country, is the
largest cattle market in Pakistan. Honking cars and trucks compete for
space on the congested road, forcing traffic to slow to a crawl almost 3 km
(2 miles) away from the main site.
As night falls the market presents a surreal sight with dozens of towering
lights illuminating the dusty, crowded area. Cattle traders -- many of them
dressed in colorful traditional clothes -- came from distant towns and
villages in the province of Sindh and central Punjab. Animal sacrifices
during Eid al-Adha are not obligatory, but in meat-loving Pakistan
religious fervor mingles with tradition and people feel obliged to offer
animals for slaughter. The meat is divided into 3 parts: one portion is
given to relatives and neighbors, the second to the poor, and the third
retained for immediate family members.
Possible cases of FMD have not worried local people. "These are just rumors
people are spreading," said Sajjad Khan, who had bought a goat and was
loading it onto a public bus. Rajput, whose private Mehran animal hospital
has set up 4 camps in the market, said there was no need for alarm.
"Usually animals recover within 5 to 7 days after the treatment, so it is
not very dangerous," he said.

[There are a number of diseases that appear similar to FMD. One of the most
notable is vesicular stomatitis. I am not sure the above report is
describing FMD. - Mod.TG]
