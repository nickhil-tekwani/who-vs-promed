7 persons including 5 women died, and dozens were hospitalised
here on Saturday [4 Oct 2008] following the outbreak of a mysterious
disease in Sundhya village of Chakesar Union Council. Due to limited
health care facilities in the district, the affected people were
admitted to various hospitals in the Swat valley.

So far, the district administration could send only a dispenser
[health assistant] along with a helper to the area. Those who died
include a man and his sister, a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old
girl, and 3 other females of the Dandai area. The father of the 2
family members who fell victim to the disease told "The News" that it
spread on [Wed 1 Oct 2008].

Initial reports suggest that the affected persons run high
temperatures with deep red eyes followed by vomiting blood. Patients
could not receive timely medical relief due to an absence of proper
healthcare and physicians at the Chakesar Civil Hospital, [one
parent] said, adding that 2 persons died while being shifted to
Mingora. A Union Council [member] said no medical team had arrived in
the area. An official [representing] the executive district officer
(EDO health) said a 2-member team headed by a dispenser was sent to
the affected area. "The EDO is currently on leave, but has been
informed of the situation."

[The Swat valley and district are located in the North-West Frontier
Province of Pakistan. The main town in the Swat valley is Mingora. It
can be located using the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of
Pakistan at:
<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=30,69.4,5>.
This is a mountainous and remote region not well served by
health-care facilities or hospitals with diagnostic facilities.

It is difficult to suggest a precise diagnosis for the condition
precipitating these fatalities. The symptoms of high fever and
hemorrhage suggest a hemorrhagic fever something akin to
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, which has been recorded frequently
in Pakistan (see references below). However, the fatalities appear to
have been either children or adult women, who would be less likely to
have been have been exposed to livestock carrying the tick vector
responsible for transmission of the disease (although transmission by
other means such as contaminated milk is not unknown). Further
information from the area would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
