The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) has expanded
its recall to include all varieties of jam and jelly products prepared
by Jamnation Fine Foods over fears of botulism.

On Tue 8 Mar 2011, the BCCDC asked for the immediate disposal of
Jamnation watermelon jelly that had been distributed in 120 mL-sized
jars at various charity booths outside big box stores in Duncan as
well as across the province as part of a Huntingtons Research
Foundation fundraiser.

Eric Halstrom, president of the Huntington's Research Foundation, a
non-profit society, said in a telephone interview from the Lower
Mainland that his group sold 60 to 100 jars of the jelly. "We do
suspect it is an isolated incident," said Halstrom initially.

It turns out, after speaking with Jamnation representatives, the
BCCDC believes there's an even wider concern. "After conversations
with the manufacturer, there is concern about other jam and jelly
products prepared by Jamnation Fine Foods," explains Dr Eleni Galanis,
physician epidemiologist with BCCDC, an agency of the Provincial
Health Services Authority. "Anyone who may have purchased these
products should discard them immediately."

A Vancouver Island woman is in stable condition at Victoria General
Hospital after having consumed some of the watermelon jelly, a sample
of which has tested positive for the botulism toxin.
