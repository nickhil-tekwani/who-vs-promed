A "virulent" strain of methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_
(MRSA), whose prevalence outside hospitals is sparking concern in Europe
and the USA, has been isolated for the 1st time in Japan from the skin of a
child who had never been hospitalized, Professor Tatsuo Yamashita of
Niigata University, a bacteriologist, said on Sat 19 Jun 2004.
This child suffered from impetigo contagiosa, a skin infection, which has
successfully been treated with ordinary antibiotics. However, Prof.
Yamamoto warns that surveillance [of this type of MRSA] should be
strengthened in Japan because some fatal cases of virulent MRSA infection
have been reported in Western countries.
The strain that Prof. Yamamoto has isolated has some features in common
with those strains of MRSA found in non-hospital personnel in Europe, USA,
and Australia, such as the ability to produce a leukocyte-attacking toxin
named PVL [Panton-Valentine leukocidin - Mod.LL].
This type of MRSA is called "community-acquired MRSA," to be distinguished
from hospital-acquired MRSAs. In Japan, some strains of MRSA have recently
been isolated from the skin of kindergarten children who had never been in
hospital, but no "virulent" type had been reported.

[Virulence is defined in this posting not by clinical criteria, but by the
fact that the strain contained the gene for the PVL toxin. - Mod.LL]
