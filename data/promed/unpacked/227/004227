[Infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is a viral disease affecting most species of salmonid fish reared in fresh water or sea water. Caused by the rhabdovirus -- infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) -- the principal clinical and economic consequences of IHN occur on farms rearing rainbow trout, where acute outbreaks can result in very high mortality. However, both Pacific and Atlantic salmon can be severely affected.

IHNV has been detected in North America, Asia and Europe, but not in the Southern Hemisphere. Countries reporting confirmed or suspect cases of IHN to the OIE include: Austria, Belgium, Canada, China (People's Rep. of), Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea (Rep. of), Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland and United States of America. Infections and overt disease have been reported among fish reared in both fresh and sea water. http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_ihn.htm. - Mod.CRD
