Yellow Fever Death Toll Approaches 200
---------------------------------------
CONAKRY: Nearly 200 people have died in an outbreak of yellow fever in
Guinea, Health Ministry officials said on Mon 18 Dec 2000, adding that they
feared the epidemic would soon reach the capital. More than 20 000 people
had been infected since the outbreak was first discovered in early November
in the central Mamou regions, they said. It had now spread to 14 other
prefectures, with some cases just 30 miles north of Conakry. "We fear this
epidemic could reach the capital soon," one health official said. The
cash-strapped government is still waiting for international donors and
humanitarian agencies to provide anti-amaril vaccine to combat the
mosquito-borne viral disease, the officials said. They stated that 2
million doses were needed. The authorities have started an awareness
campaign, urging infected people to go to hospitals.

[This outbreak shows no signs of being contained. According to WHO the
outbreak commenced on 12 Oct 2000 in the district of Mamou, and now
involves the districts of Labe, Tougue, Mali and Koubia. The estimate of
20 000 people infected is far in excess of previous estimates and needs
independent confirmation. - Mod.CP
