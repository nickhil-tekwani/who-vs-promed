It has been established that the foot-and-mouth outbreak originated among
gazelle herds in Airag, Altanshiree, and Urgun soums [districts], Dornogobi
Aymag [province].

A cattle herder in Urgun Soum had the disease eradicated from his herd, but
the disease still spread to neighboring livestock, leading the General
Disaster Defence Authority (GDDA) to assume it was transmitted by gazelles.
Tests made on gazelles proved this, and urgent action was taken to halt the
spread.

According to some estimates, over 10 000 gazelles are moving northward. As it
is impossible to stop gazelle migration, it has been decided to vaccinate all
livestock on the gazelles' migratory route, said Ts Dash, chief of the GDDA.
