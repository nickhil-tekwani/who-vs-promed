At its weekly briefing in Taipei, the [Taiwan] CDC reported the 1st case of Japanese encephalitis in Kaohsiung this year [2020] saying the patient was a man in his 60s from Fongshan District [Kaohsiung province].

He developed a fever on [13 Jun 2020] and was admitted to hospital 3 days later, as his condition worsened, and he tested positive Tuesday [16 Jun 2020] for Japanese encephalitis, the CDC said. There have been 4 confirmed cases in the country so far this year [2020] -- 2 in Pingtung, and one each in Tainan and Kaohsiung, CDC data showed.

The disease is transmitted mainly by the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito, which breeds in rice fields, ponds, and irrigation canals.

Symptoms of Japanese encephalitis are often mild -- fever and headache -- but approximately 1 in 250 infections is characterized by a rapid onset of high fever, headache, stiff neck, disorientation, coma, seizure, and spastic paralysis, and can result in death, the CDC said.

[The case above and the 4 confirmed cases so far this year (2020) indicate that the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season is now underway in Taiwan. We expect cases to occur sporadically until the transmission season ends in October 2020. The mosquito species, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, and other related _Culex_ species are efficient vectors of JEV and breed in wet areas such as rice paddies. These _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease. It is not stated whether the affected individual above had been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
