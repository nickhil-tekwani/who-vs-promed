Monthly Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease Statistics - As of 4 Nov 2005
--------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 7 Nov 2005] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD] - the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 108
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 43
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 152
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 158
(The next table will be published on Mon 5 Dec 2005)
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Fri 30 Sep
2005, the total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD has
increased by one. This is accounted for by the death of one of the
surviving probable cases. Consequently the overall total number of
definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) has increased by one
and is now 158.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is now in decline. The number of deaths due to definite or
probable vCJD in the UK during the first 9 months of 2005 is now 4.
The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004. - Mod.CP]

<promed@promedmail.org>
[As of 30 Sep 2005, so far in the UK for the year 2005 there have
been 92 referrals of suspected CJD; there have been 41 deaths from
sporadic CJD, 2 from familial CJD, one from iatrogenic CJD and 3 from
vCJD. Data for all years since 1990 can be downloaded from this
web-site.
I am indebted to Terry S. Singeltary Sr. <flounder9@verizon.net> for
drawing my attention to similar data concerning CJD surveillance in
the USA, which are being compiled by the National Prion Disease
Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western Reserve University
beginning from the year 1997 (<http://www.cjdsurveillance.com/>. The
corresponding figures for the USA for the year 2005 up to the end of
September are: 256 referrals of suspected CJD, which include 46 cases
of sporadic CJD, 22 cases of familial CJD, none of iatrogenic CJD,
and none of vCJD. Another 52 cases have been diagnosed as prion
diseases with precise identification pending.
Since 1997 in the USA there have been 876 confirmed cases of sporadic
CJD, 159 cases of familial CJD, 15 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and one
case of vCJD (almost certainly acquired in the UK). No cases of GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome have been diagnosed in the
USA since the inception of surveillance in 1997.
The corresponding totals for confirmed diagnoses in the UK since 1990
are 805 sporadic cases, 46 familial cases, 49 iatrogenic cases, 24
GSS cases, and 151 vCJD cases. The reasons for the discrepancies in
the frequencies, vCJD apart, are unknown. - Mod.CP]

Paper, 19 Oct 2005 [edited]
<http://www.seac.gov.uk/statements/state191005.htm>

Hypothesis that BSE Originated from a Human TSE
-----------------------------------------------
Issue
-----
1. Consideration of a hypothesis that BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) was originally derived from a human TSE
(transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) [see: part 4 of the
ProMED-mail post archived as "CJD (new var.) update 2005 (09)
20050905.2627"].
Background
----------
2. The origins of BSE are unknown. Since the discovery of BSE, the
Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) and others have
considered a number of hypotheses about the origins of the disease.
[<http://www.seac.gov.uk/summaries/summ_0901.htm>,
<http://www.seac.gov.uk/papers/paper_inf81-8.pdf>]
Recently a further hypothesis has been considered by SEAC, which
suggests that BSE may have arisen as a result of UK importation, in
the 1960s and 1970s, of mammalian bone and carcass material from the
Indian subcontinent, for use in animal feed. Furthermore, this
hypothesis suggests that this material may have been contaminated
with human remains harbouring a strain of CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease), which could have been transmitted to cattle [Colchester AC,
Colchester NT (2005). The origin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy:
the human prion disease hypothesis. Lancet. 366, 856-61.]
Contamination of animal feed with human remains
-----------------------------------------------
3. It is not possible to establish with any certainty whether feed
given to animals in the 1960s and 1970s was contaminated with human
remains. However it is possible that carcass material, which may have
inadvertently included human remains, was imported into the UK from
the Indian subcontinent (particularly the Ganges region) during that
period, and used in animal feed. Professor Colchester provides
indirect evidence to suggest that this may have occurred.
4. It is likely that similar material was imported into other
countries, such as Australia, that have not detected BSE in their
livestock. Furthermore, the amount of human remains that may have
contaminated animal feed would have been a very small fraction of the
amount of sheep and cattle material that was incorporated into animal
feed in the past. Thus, there was a much greater opportunity for
cattle to have been exposed to an animal TSE rather than a human TSE.
Current control measures implemented across the EU and in the UK have
prevented the importation of such material for either animal feed or
fertilizer.
Properties of BSE and other TSEs
--------------------------------
5. BSE may have originated as a result of misfolding of the prion
protein in cattle, the amplification via feed of a rare, new
spontaneous mutation in cattle, or transmission of a TSE from another
species. There are barriers to transmission from one host species to
another, and there appears to be an appreciable barrier to
transmission between cattle and humans. It is not currently possible
to predict the ability, or likelihood, of transmission between
species based on current understanding of strain characteristics.
6. Prion strains can be characterised by their properties in
biochemical and infectivity tests. Generally, prion strains are
transformed as a result of transmission to a new host, with
consequent changes in their biochemical properties. However, BSE is
somewhat unusual in that it appears to retain its strain
characteristics when passaged through a new host. Experiments in
transgenic mice expressing human, bovine and ovine forms of the prion
protein gene have been designed to determine the likelihood of a
strain passing to a new host but can also shed light on possible
relationships between prion strains.
7. Nevertheless it is difficult, and often impossible with current
technologies, to establish whether one strain is related to another
following transmission to another species. It may therefore, never be
possible to determine the true origin of BSE.
Summary of SEAC's discussion
----------------------------
8. SEAC considered it unlikely that the origins of BSE would ever be
determined conclusively.
9. It is not possible to determine, from current knowledge of the
characteristics of prion strains, whether BSE originated from CJD or
other animal prion strains.
10. There was evidence to suggest that human remains may have been
included in animal feed derived from the Indian subcontinent in the
past, and the hypothesis presented by Professor Colchester was
therefore considered plausible, but ultimately untestable.
11. Very much larger quantities of cattle and sheep remains
historically had entered animal feed, compared with putative human
remains. There is also likely to be a significant species barrier
between humans and cattle, as there is known to be such a barrier in
the opposite direction. It is therefore very much more likely that
the origins of BSE are related to a TSE that originated in cattle or
sheep, rather than a TSE from humans.
12. In conclusion, although Professor Colchester's hypothesis can
never be ruled out, SEAC considered that, on the balance of
possibilities, human TSE-contaminated material in animal feed was
unlikely to have been the origin of BSE.
13. Although further experiments suggested by Professor Colchester
would be of some scientific interest, SEAC did not consider them
essential, as they are unlikely to yield conclusive results on the
origin of BSE, and because current control measures now prevent
possible transmission via the route proposed in this hypothesis.

A paper entitled "A newly identified type of scrapie agent can
naturally infect sheep with resistant PrP genotypes", published in
PNAS online on 20 Oct 2005, describes observations that support the
view that a truly infectious TSE agent, unrecognized until recently,
infects sheep and goat flocks. (The authors of the paper are Annick

The Abstract of the paper reads as follows: "Scrapie in small
ruminants belongs to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
(TSEs), or prion diseases, a family of fatal neurodegenerative
disorders that affect humans and animals and can transmit within and
between species by ingestion or inoculation. Conversion of the
host-encoded prion protein (PrP), normal cellular PrP (PrPc), into a
misfolded form, abnormal PrP (PrPSc), plays a key role in TSE
transmission and pathogenesis. The intensified surveillance of
scrapie in the European Union, together with the improvement of PrPSc
detection techniques, has led to the discovery of a growing number of
so-called atypical scrapie cases. These include clinical Nor98 cases
first identified in Norwegian sheep on the basis of unusual
pathological and PrPSc molecular features and "cases" that produced
discordant responses in the rapid tests currently applied to the
large-scale random screening of slaughtered or fallen animals.
Worryingly, !
a substantial proportion of such cases involved sheep with PrP
genotypes known until now to confer natural resistance to
conventional scrapie. Here we report that both Nor98 and discordant
cases, including 3 sheep homozygous for the resistant PrPARR allele
(A136R154R171), efficiently transmitted the disease to transgenic
mice expressing ovine PrP, and that they shared unique biological and
biochemical features upon propagation in mice. These observations
support the view that a truly infectious TSE agent, unrecognized
until recently, infects sheep and goat flocks and may have important
implications in terms of scrapie control and public health."

The following paper published in the November issue of the Journal of
Virology reports experimental transmission of Chronic Wasting Disease
(CWD) prions to a primate species. The paper is entitled Interspecies
Transmission of Chronic Wasting Disease Prions to Squirrel Monkeys
(_Saimiri sciureus_). The authors are: Richard F. Marsh (1)

Bozeman, Montana 59718(3).
The Abstract reads as follows: "Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an
emerging prion disease of deer and elk. The risk of CWD transmission
to humans following exposure to CWD-infected tissues is unknown. To
assess the susceptibility of nonhuman primates to CWD, 2 squirrel
monkeys were inoculated with brain tissue from a CWD-infected mule
deer. The CWD-inoculated squirrel monkeys developed a progressive
neurodegenerative disease and were euthanized at 31 and 34 months
postinfection. Brain tissue from the CWD-infected squirrel monkeys
contained the abnormal isoform of the prion protein, PrP-res, and
displayed spongiform degeneration. This is the 1st reported
transmission of CWD to primates."

[5] Italy: Prions suspected in sheep milk
Date: Tue 8 Nov 2005
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>
Source: News@nature.com, 3 Nov 2005 [edited]
<http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051031/full/051031-7.html>

Could sheep pass a fatal brain disease between them through their
milk? The inflamed mammary glands of sheep have been found to contain
protein particles that cause scrapie, a sickness similar to mad cow
disease. This suggests that the suspect proteins, called prions, may
also be present in the milk of infected animals. If prions exist in
the milk of cows infected with both an inflammatory illness and mad
cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), this raises concerns for human health. Consumption of
prion-contaminated meat from cows with BSE is believed to cause the
fatal variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in people; so might
contaminated milk.
Adriano Aguzzi, the lead researcher on the study, has not detected
prions in milk itself, because it is difficult to analyse for the
abnormal proteins. But he says he expects to find them. "It is
unlikely that the prions are not in the milk," says Aguzzi, a
pathologist at the University of Zurich Hospital, Switzerland. "And
the prospect is not a pleasant one." Neil Cashman, a prion researcher
at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, is worried too.
People have looked for prions in the milk of cows with BSE and
haven't found any, he says. "But they haven't looked in cows with
mammary-gland infection and BSE. This raises very serious questions,"
concludes Cashman.
Prions are mainly found in the brain, spinal cord and immune system.
Until recently, other body parts were thought to be relatively safe.
But in a series of studies, Aguzzi's group has shown that prions can
be present in other organs as well, provided that these organs are
inflamed. Earlier in 2005, his group found prions in inflamed
pancreases, livers and kidneys. A study [in October 2005] showed that
the urine produced by inflamed kidneys in mice also contains prions.
All this has helped to solve the mystery of how wild herds of elk and
deer, which are vegetarian, might manage to contract prion diseases
from each other. And it prompted Aguzzi to look at mammary glands to
see if they could carry prions too.
The researchers went to Sardinia, a Mediterranean island with more
than a million sheep, and analysed 261 sheep that were genetically
susceptible to scrapie. Of those, 7 had scrapie, and 4 also had an
infection of their mammary glands. All these 4 had prions in their
mammary glands; the others did not. The study appears this week in
Nature Medicine [Ligios C., et al. Nature Medicine, 11. 1137 - 1138
(2005)]. The mammary-gland infections were caused by a virus called
Maedi Visna [_Visna/Maedi virus_ is an ovine retrovirus, classified
in the genus _Lentivirus_, that includes HIV and other
immunodeficiency viruses. - Mod.CP]. Aguzzi says that if this
prion-virus combination is common, it may be a clue to how to fight
the transmission of scrapie. "Maybe to eradicate scrapie you have to
eradicate the virus first," Aguzzi says.
The prion concentration in the sheep's mammary glands is thousands of
times lower than in the brain, says Aguzzi. This is probably good
news, although it is not known how many prions it takes to cause vCJD
in humans.
