EV71 fatality: Hong Kong ex mainland China
-------------------------------------------
A 5-year-old girl has died after being infected by a virus during a trip
to the mainland, the Department of Health confirmed last night. It is the
second fatal case of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection recorded, since the
Government set up a surveillance programme during outbreaks in 1998. [EV71
has been associated with more severe forms of hand-foot-mouth disease. Last
year in May a 2-year-old boy died from [EV71 infection. The latest victim
became ill on 29 Jul 2000. She was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital the next day.
Her condition deteriorated on 31 Jul 2000, when she suffered a high fever and
tremors. She died after 2 hours of resuscitation failed. The department
believes the girl contracted the infection on the mainland. Her parents and
8-year-old sister, who live in Yuen Long, have shown no symptoms.
University of Hong Kong microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung said people infected
with EV71 could die within hours from brain infections and bleeding in the
lungs. He said there was no sign that the girl's death signalled a new
outbreak of EV71, but parents and teachers have been warned to be careful as
summer is peak season for the virus. The department's consultant in
community medicine, Dr Tse Lai-yin, said: "This is a sporadic imported case
and there is no cause for undue alarm." She said infections were usually
mild. The first case of EV71 infection this year was reported in May. The
patient, a boy of 3 years of age, has fully recovered. There were 22
confirmed cases
last year.
