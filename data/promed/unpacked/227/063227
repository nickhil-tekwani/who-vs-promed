[On top of the new outbreak described above, which was reported to the OIE 2 weeks after its start, India is currently experiencing 2 continuing HPAI H5N1 epizootics: one in Kerala (southern India) which started 20 Nov 2014, so far causing 5 outbreaks (the last one on a turkey farm, 18 Jan 2015); the other one started on 11 Dec 2014 on a duck farm in Chandigar, north India; so far, no spread from this farm has been reported. The current new outbreak is in the state of Uttar Pradesh, south-east of the outbreak in Chandigar (map at the source URL). Details on the production line involved on the holding involved, which reportedly includes 1037 birds, will be appreciated.

According to Echo of India dated 11 Mar 2015, avian influenza was suspected in Malda, West Bengal State, from 9-11 Mar 2015, where a large number of chickens died at the state government-owned farm in the area of English Bazaar. Farm sources said at least 500 fowl died in 3 days, sparking a bird-flu scare, and the dead chickens were buried deep underground inside the farm premises. The report indicated that: there were about 5000 chickens in the poultry farm, that blood samples of the dead animals were sent to Kolkata [Calcutta] for laboratory tests, that chickens showing symptoms of weakness were isolated to mitigate risk, and the entire farm area was being thoroughly cleaned. However, other department sources said the symptoms were more indicative of Ranikhet/Newcastle disease and not bird flu.

Official information on the event, particularly a final lab-confirmed diagnosis, is requested. - Mod.AS
