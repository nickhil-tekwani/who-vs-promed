Outbreak of dengue fever on Easter Island is confirmed
------------------------------------------------------
SANTIAGO: The Chilean government on Tue 19 Mar 2002 confirmed an outbreak
of dengue fever on Easter Island, where 20 people have been admitted to
hospital with symptoms of the disease and another 59 possible cases have
been reported. These are in addition to the one confirmed case registered
last week and 3 other people presenting dengue symptoms, deputy health
secretary Gonzalo Navarrete told a news conference.
Last weekend, Navarrete visited the Pacific island, which lies some 3500 km
(2175 miles) off the coast of Chile and has been a Chilean possession since
the 19th century. "In any case, this is an outbreak. Because of the
disease's characteristics, it is expected that 20-60 people will be
infected," Navarrete added. About 3500 residents live on Easter Island,
some 2500 of them descendants of the indigenous Rapa Nui people.
The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito that transmits the dengue virus was found on
Easter Island 3 years ago, but the first case of dengue was reported only a
week ago. The case was a young woman who had been visiting the island.
Despite confirmation of the outbreak, experts doubt it will spread to
continental Chile. Dengue fever has spread in the Southern Cone in recent
years, striking hardest in Brazil and Paraguay, with Chile and Uruguay the
only countries in the region to remain free of the disease.

[Previously it was suggested that the suspected outbreak on Easter Island
may have originated with the arrival of tourists (or an infected mosquito)
from Tahiti in January. Consequently the strain of dengue virus responsible
for the outbreak may be distinct from the strains (and serotypes) of dengue
virus presently circulating in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is
possible, however, that virus arrived earlier with the first appearance of
the vector on Easter Island. ProMED-mail would welcome information on
characterization of the Easter Island virus. - Mod.CP
