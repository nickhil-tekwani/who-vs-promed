While on their way to the Blue Mountains in NSW, many of the 25 Japanese visitors on the same tour bus started showing symptoms of food poisoning. Most of the people on board were suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Earlier that morning [28 Oct 2014], they had all been on a stopover in Brisbane where they shared a meal.

Just after 1:00 pm on Monday, 27 Oct 2014, paramedics were called to Governor Macquarie Drive in Chipping Norton when the tourists were apparently en route to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains. Pictures show the medics geared up assessing the sick holidaymakers, checking blood pressure and other symptoms. Wearing masks and other protective gear, they checked people one by one by the side of the road before transporting some of them in ambulances.

Four people were admitted to Liverpool Hospital and are now in a stable condition. Initially, the 1st sick tourist was quarantined in the bathroom of the Murray coach the group were traveling in, a witness told the website, before more of the passengers began to fall ill. Michael Akkari said the patients were transported to hospital in the coach, which was used as a "quarantine capsule."

"The less sick ones sat on the grass strip beside the bus. They were obviously concerned, but there were a few laughs being had," he said.

A southwest Sydney Local Health District spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that they were taken to Liverpool Hospital, where 4 people were admitted. She said that all were in a stable condition and had exhibited the same symptoms consistent with food poisoning.

Another spokesman made it clear to The Sydney Morning Herald "this is definitely not a case of Ebola."

[The short incubation period (less than 6 hours or so) associated with an illness presenting with both emesis and diarrhea suggests poorly thermally controlled rice as a vehicle and _Bacillus cereus_ as an etiology. _B. cereus_ can produce an emetic toxin and one causing diarrhea. The latter toxin-associated illness tends to have a slightly longer incubation period.

The photographs in the original URL are reminiscent of the response to a certain well publicized virus infection, suggesting the response may have been Ebola-phobic in character, despite the total lack of any reason to suspect the hemorrhagic fever agent. - Mod.LL
