In France, the latest epidemic has hit a farm with laying hens. It is the 1st case in a commercial livestock farm.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected last Friday [27 Nov 2021] on a laying hen farm in the Nord department, just a few kilometres from the Belgian border. Investigations were currently underway to trace the route of infection.

According to the ministry, the flock was culled and the farm immediately disinfected. A protection zone and a surveillance zone had been set up around the outbreak. This is connected with strict biosecurity regulations for poultry farmers and a transport ban for birds.

The alliance of the Confederation Paysanne (Conf), an association of small farmers, and the Federation of Organic Farmers (FNAB), meanwhile, stressed that the farm in question was a commercial one with 160 000 birds and was also located in a region with close links to Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. The organisations had jointly lodged a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court in order to bring down the new disease protection requirements. Among other things, they see high hurdles for exemptions from the stall obligation endangering animal welfare and the existence of free-range farms.

According to Conf and FNAB, there is scientific evidence that the risk of introducing avian influenza into free-range systems is generally low. The spread of the disease depends mainly on the density of the flock, and the transport of goods and animals and the introduction of people also play an important role in the spread of the virus. It is also criticised that exemptions from the obligation to keep animals in confined areas are only possible if a veterinarian has previously certified that the animals are suffering from the disease.

In France, according to official data, 4 cases of avian influenza in wild birds and 3 cases in backyard flocks have been registered so far. Lac de Madine in the Grand-Est region [map at <tinyurl.com/2hsb33ah>] is currently experiencing high mortality in swans, according to the ministry. Of the population of more than 1000 individuals, about 1/5 have died, it said. The previous epidemic, which came to a halt only last spring, had been concentrated in the southwest of the country and affected 492 commercial livestock farms, according to the ministry. By official order, a total of about 3.5 million birds, mostly ducks, had been killed at the time [see comment].

[The above outbreak was reported by France to the OIE on Fri 27 Nov 2021, following the confirmation of HPAI H5N1 in the commercial laying hen farm on 26 Nov 2021; see item [10] in 20211205.8700016. The immediate notification included the following information on the affected population: "Increase in mortality in a laying hen farm (15 000 deaths out of 80 000). The farm is composed of 2 separate buildings (2 x 80 000 hens). Depopulation is in progress in the outbreak, and preliminary disinfection will be applied. An epidemiological investigation is being carried out. Movements of poultry and poultry products from farms keeping poultry in the protection and surveillance zones is prohibited. The origin of the infection is not known at this time."

The above media addresses the reservations of the farming industry, challenging the applied control and prevention measures. These measures are prescribed by EU legislation, based upon scientific opinion. Some of the measures have been recently reviewed; see Nielsen S S, Alvarez J, Bicout D J, et al. Scientific Opinion on the assessment of the control measures of the category A diseases of Animal Health Law: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. EFSA Journal. 2021; 19(1): 6372, 78 pp; https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2021.6372.

The current epizootic, involving many European and other countries, is caused by HPAI H5N1. The earlier epizootic in France, mainly affecting the duck industry in the southwest, was caused by HPAI H5N8; see Guinat C, Artois J, Bronner A, et al. Duck production systems and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 in France, 2016-2017. Sci Rep. 2019; 9: 6177; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-42607-x. - Mod.AS
