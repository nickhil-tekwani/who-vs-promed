China: Undiagnosed Gastroenteritis at Dongguan University of Technology
---------------------------------------------------
Between Thu 20 Nov 2003 to Fri 21 Nov 2003, a number of students at
the Songshan Lake Campus of Dongguan University of Technology
[Dongguan is in Guangdong Province between Guangzhou and Hong Kong. -
Mod.CP] developed vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and other symptoms.
According to university statistics, 21 students received treatment
over 2 days. But this reporter's understanding is that there were
actually a greater number of students who experienced these kinds of
symptoms. Students in the computer science department said that [last
week] some students experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and other
symptoms. 3 students in their class became ill, but because the
school clinic was already filled with students, they decided to go to
nearby Dalingshan Village Hospital for treatment. 6 or 7 other
students shared transportation with them to see the doctor. According
to a student in the business administration department, most ill
students were from the computer science, electronics, and b!
usiness administration departments.
According to an unidentified student, some 30-40 students went to the
university clinic for treatment because of vomiting, diarrhea, and
other symptoms. There were also students who became ill but did not
go to the clinic or hospital for treatment. At the university's
clinic, medical personnel told this reporter that [one night last
week] they were busy the entire night, until midday yesterday when
they at last had time to rest.
An administrator of Dongguan University of Technology says that
according to the school's initial statistics, 10 students went to the
hospital for treatment [the evening of 18 or 19 Nov], [the next day]
another 11 students were added, but symptoms were all relatively
light. This administrator also said that although some students
suffered ill temper and other feelings, these were caused by
psychological influences.
Zou Xiaoping, Vice President of the university, stated that they had
invited over comrades from the Dongguan Municipal Disease Control
Station, Public Health Division, who took samples of food and
drinking water from the student cafeteria. They also went to the
hospital to see students now receiving treatment. According to their
initial inference, the change of seasons might be responsible for the
students experiencing these kinds of symptoms, and these kinds of
conditions will continue for at least another day. Zou Xiaoping also
said that these past 2 days the university's tap water was somewhat
turbid. Yesterday morning, Dalingshan Village Tap Water Company also
came to campus to take water samples to take back for water quality
evaluation.
The Songshan Lake Campus of Dongguan University of Technology has
been in use for just 2 months and has more than 1600 students, and
with faculty and staff has over 2000 people

[The symptoms are consistent with an outbreak of norovirus infection,
but the suspicion of a contaminated water supply suggests several
alternative explanations. Where the explanation of "change of
seasons" fits is unclear. - Mod.CP]
