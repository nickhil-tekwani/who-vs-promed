Arizona's 1st case of plague [human? - Mod.MPP] since 2000 has been
reported in an adult female in Apache County. The woman became ill
early September 2007 from a flea bite at her home in northern
Arizona. She is now recovering after receiving the appropriate
antimicrobial treatment.
In a community northeast of Flagstaff in Coconino County, an outbreak
of plague involving prairie dogs is occurring. Many rodents are dying
from the disease and are leaving behind infected fleas. County health
and Northern Arizona University officials are closely monitoring and
responding to this situation. Response has included flea collecting
and testing, and extensive prevention education and outreach to
people in affected areas.
During the last 30 years (1977-2006), 48 cases of plague have been
reported in Arizona, 8 of which were fatal. The plague risk has been
relatively low during the last 6 years due to drought conditions and
high summer temperatures.
"The recent appearance of plague activity in 2 northern counties has
us concerned that we may see plague in other areas as well," said
Craig Levy, head of the state Vector Borne and Zoonotic Disease Program.
Plague can be transmitted to humans by flea bites or by direct
contact with infected animal tissues during skinning or handling of
game animals. In very rare cases, plague can be spread from
person-to-person, or cat-to-person, by airborne transmission. People
or animals, particularly cats, infected with plague pneumonia can
transmit the bacteria by coughing or sneezing in the face of another
person or animal.
In Arizona, plague activity mostly occurs in areas above 4500 feet
(1372 m) in elevation. For this reason, campers, hunters, hikers, and
others who live in or visit areas above 4500 feet should take the
following precautions to avoid plague exposures:
- Do not handle sick or dead animals.
- Avoid close exposures to rodent burrows and fleas.
- Prevent cats and dogs from roaming. Wandering animals can pick up
plague-infected fleas and bring them home.
- Use appropriate flea control products on cats and dogs. Consult
your veterinarian for guidance.
- Wear protective gloves when skinning rabbits or rodents and when
preparing them for cooking. Also, game meat should be cooked to 180
deg [F] (82 deg C) or until the juices run clear.
- In the event a plague-like illness develops within 6 days of a
potential exposure, see a physician immediately.

[The outbreak of plague in Coconino County has previously been posted
on ProMED-mail. Although not stated, the case is probably one of
bubonic plague (lymph node infection), the most common form with the
lowest mortality rate.
From data collected by the Arizona Department of Health Services
<http://www.azdhs.gov/phs/oids/vector/plague/stats.htm>, a total of
61 cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infection have been acquired in the
state from 1950 to 2000. Adding in the case above from Apache County,
number of cases reported from the following counties:
County / Number of Cases
Apache / 21
Navajo / 18
Coconino / 17
Yavapai / 4
Gila / 1
Mohave / 1
Apache, Navajo, and Coconino counties occupy the northeast and north
central parts of the southwestern USA state of Arizona and accounted
for 56 of the 62 cases (85 percent).
