Auckland Central residents are being urged to check to see if they have been exposed to measles.

A measles alert is in place for various locations in central Auckland and Newmarket.

One case has been confirmed from a patient who has contracted it overseas.

The Auckland Regional Public Health Service have issued the alert for anyone not immunised who visited K Road City Travellers Hostel, Zarbo Cafe, and Auckland City Doctors at various times last week [week of 8 Aug 2016].

Medical Officer of Health Michael Hale said people need to immediately call their doctor or Healthline if they are showing symptoms of the disease.

"It usually starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, and sore red eyes before the rash starts a few days later."

If people are infected with the disease, it's not likely they will experience symptoms for up to 7 days.

The measles outbreak in Naga Self-Administered Zone has killed 44 in total as of [18 August 2016], said a local MP in Sagaing Region.

Seinn Maung, an MP from Nanyun Constituency of Sagaing Region Parliament, were in Nanyun Township of Naga SAZ from [13 to 17 Aug 2016] to distribute food allocated by the Sagaing Region Government.

The MP said: "Most children under 8 in the villages are ill. A 4-year-old girl died on [13 Aug 2016] and another 6-year-old boy died on [16 Aug 2016] in Kesansarlin Village."

According to the MP, medical treatment is needed in the villages of Nanyun as children are still being ill. He said: "There is no medical care in the villages and no improvement of health condition, especially in Kesansarlin, Kyuyan Nokno, and Sheikno villages. On average, 50 children in each village are ill. Some have rash on their skin, looking like herpes."

The MP told that food supply and regular medical care are extremely necessary in villages. The road network should also be improved.

A total of 400 out of 2800 packs of rice -- sent by the Sagaing Region Government -- have reached Nanyun from Lahe Township so far.

In the past few days, some ill children from Htankawlarma Village were transferred to a health centre in Lahe Township despite poor road condition and they get better now, said Nok Tun, chairperson of Naga Cultural Committee of Nayun who is also a member of Council of Naga Affairs.
