More than 22 people from Tegat Village in Molo were admitted at the Nyayo hospital in Elburgon, with residents fearing they may have contracted anthrax after consuming milk from a sick cow. According to Emily Sang, the Nyumba Kumi chairperson of the area, the 22 include the owner of the cow, his wife and 2 children.

Elburgon assistant commissioner Naftali Korir says 18 people have been treated and discharged. Korir has further cautioned residents against eating or drinking un-inspected meat or milk.

A veterinary officer is reported to have confirmed that the meat was found to have anthrax and advised all those who had consumed to seek treatment immediately.

[2] Lake Nakuru National Park

Rhinos and giraffes are at a high risk of contracting anthrax after the disease killed 10 buffaloes at Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya Wildlife Service said yesterday [Sun 7 Apr 2019]. KWS central Rift assistant director Aggrey Maumo said white rhinos and Rhode giraffes are highly susceptible to the outbreak because they have a close contact with buffaloes. "We have a total of 90 rhinos of which 14 are white and 66 black rhinos. We also had new births last year [2018] and the team is vaccinating all species susceptible to the disease," he said.

The officers also assured the tourists that they are safe to visit the park. "It's only when you come into direct contact with the carcasses that you'll be affected and we have a qualified team to handle the situation," he said.

Maumo however said a team of 15 officers are on the ground to monitor the situation. "On the ground we have a team of 15 officers who include 3 veterinary doctors, 4 scientists and 8 supporting officers to ensure they curb the spread of the outbreak. The team is conducting the aerial and ground inspection," he said. He said the team has managed to control the situation. He added that the 1st case was detected on [Mon 29 Mar 2019].

"The 1st case was detected on [Mon 29 Mar 2019]. We took the samples to the Nakuru government laboratory and the results turned positive. Since then we have had a total of 7 buffaloes dying from anthrax and 3 from anthrax-related diseases," said the KWS regional boss.

Maumo, who was accompanied by the park's deputy senior warden Collins Ochieng' on [Sun 7 Apr 2019], said they have taken preventive measures. "They are taking care on the way they are handling the carcasses, spraying the infected ground and burning the carcasses to prevent the spread," he said.

The KWS senior officials said the prolonged drought has triggered the spread of the outbreak. "A few animals have died as a result of direct food effects. If the food is too dry and doesn't have enough moisture, the animals' body systems won't be able to support or sustain themselves. To contain the trough situation, we have several borehole and water boozers to water the animals," he said. "The outbreak has seen the weak animals being the target and young buffaloes because of their low immunity," he said.

The outbreak was reported 1st 3 months ago in Nakuru, but the county government said it was in control. The park has more than 5000 buffaloes, which is more than the ideal capacity of 1000. "We have more buffaloes than the carrying capacity but plans are underway to relocate them to other parks," he said.

The residents said an open sewer near the park may contribute to the spread of the disease in Nakuru town and its environs. "The fencing of the sewer around Lake Nakuru will really help in curbing this disease. It is easy for the animals to come into contact with the bacteria because they drink water from the sewer," said Peter Yatich, a Nakuri farmer.

He said the animals also graze on fresh shoots of grass after rainfall, leading to anthrax outbreak due to the ingestion of organisms picked from contaminated soils.

In 2015, there was another outbreak of anthrax at the park. "There was an outbreak in 2015, however I cannot confirm the number of the animals that were affected," said Maumo.

[Members please note this report was forwarded to us by Kunihiko Iizuka in Japan. Yes, you all are our eyes & ears out there. We depend on you, and you, and you. And many thanks to Kunihiko Iizuka.

I would not be surprised if these 2 incidents were not related epidemiologically. The logical supposition was that a haematophagious female tabanid fly found her way from the infected buffaloes to the Tegat village herd.

For years anthrax was seldom reported from Kenya. We knew it was there but nobody would say where it was. Now we are at the receiving end of multiple reports -- see the list in "See Also" below -- but I doubt whether it is anything more than just the normal occurrence, aided by too little routine vaccination of livestock and the careless consumption of sick animals. What is needed is the development of a national anthrax control & surveillance programme, with niche mapping to show the areas of high (potential) risk, targeted vaccination of these areas, and better public awareness of the real risks and procedures being applied. And in a few years we will see the livestock incidence drop significantly. Wildlife anthrax is another problem unfortunately but it does respond to the rapid and efficient processing of infected carcasses.
