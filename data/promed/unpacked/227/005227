FL county warns against wrinkle injections amid botulism probe
--------------------------------------------------------------
Palm Beach County's top health official urged people not to take
anti-wrinkle injections, after investigators said 4 people were paralyzed
by botulism illegally sold as a cheap alternative to Botox. Federal
investigators say 51 vials of botulinum toxin worth USD 53 000 were shipped
by an Arizona supplier to 13 South Florida customers in 2004. Their
investigation is continuing.
A hearing was scheduled in Fort Lauderdale federal court on a government
request that a judge block Tucson, AZ-based Toxin Research International
Inc. and its affiliates from offering the substance for sale through
national mailings to doctors' offices.
People trying to erase wrinkles with injections "are really taking life in
their hands," Dr Jean Malecki, director of the Palm Beach County Health
Department, said on Sat 8 Jan 2005.
A delivery of the toxic substance from TRI is blamed for paralyzing an
unlicensed doctor and 3 other people, after he injected them and himself at
Advanced Integrated Medical Center in Oakland Park in November 2004, FDA
investigators said. An FDA inspector visited TRI in October 2004, but
executives denied having sold the substance for anything other than
permitted animal research, FDA officials said. According to a federal
affidavit filed in Fort Lauderdale, investigators have accused TRI of
continuing to sell the toxin and then trying to delete computer files of
sales records. No criminal charges have been filed against anyone involved
in the probe.

[Although no further cases of human botulism have been reported related to
the use of this illegally obtained botulinum toxin, it is important to
realize that 50 or so vials of the substance are out there and, if not
diluted appropriately, can cause overt botulism. It is also conceivable
that the vials could have wound up in the hands of individuals who might
intend to harm others. - Mod.LL]
