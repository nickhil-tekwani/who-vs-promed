Anthrax has hit Arua district again, with one person admitted to Pawor Health Center III in Palabok parish, Pawor subcounty in Arua district after being diagnosed with anthrax. The disease has also reportedly claimed 18 animals in the same area. Dr. Willy Nguma, the Arua District Veterinary Officer, says the disease has engulfed the entire Nile belt from Pakwach district. Dr. Nguma says the outbreak has also been reported in Rhino Camp, Rigbo, Uriama and Odupi subcounties. He attributes the spread of the disease to the sporadic rain patterns the district has been receiving.

Dr. Nguma says requests to the Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries ministries to provide vaccines to contain the disease have not yielded results. The anthrax outbreak in Arua district was 1st reported in November 2016, but cases were not confirmed until March 2017. Dr. Nguma has cautioned residents to refrain from eating meat of dead animals, saying it is the main source of spreading the disease in humans.

Dr. Patrick Anguzu, the Arua District Health Officer, says despite the availability of drugs to manage anthrax in humans, breaking the chain of transmission from animals to humans requires more support from the government. He says the district health and veterinary departments have instituted a single approach to tackling the disease, but the major hindrance is [lack of] resources to achieve their desired goal of breaking the chain of transmission.

Statistics from Arua District Veterinary Department show that 1087 animals have succumbed to the disease since 2016 and 248 people were recorded with swelling of their lymph as a result of the disease.

[This is a bad year for anthrax in Uganda, with livestock and human cases reported in a significant number of districts in 4 different regions of the country. Our previous report [29 May 2018 Anthrax - Uganda (06): livestock, human, WHO 20180529.5826415] had 10 human cases in Arua with cutaneous lesions, which is typical of exposure when butchering infected animals. An active livestock vaccination programme is the only way to prevent human cases, and it is very cost-effective. Publicity on the dangers of butchering and consuming sick and dead animals is at best only modestly successful, and the advice is soon forgotten. The absence of reports out of Uganda since May [2018] is not proof of the absence of disease. Unfortunately, we can presume that the disease continues to rage both in livestock and humans.

For a map of Uganda showing where these outbreaks are occurring, go to http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272668/OEW21-1925052018.pdf. Arua district is in the northwest corner of Uganda, bordering on DR Congo. - Mod.MHJ
