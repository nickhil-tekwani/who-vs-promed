[1] PAHO: endemic in Venezuela, regional vaccination urged

PAHO urges rapid increase in vaccination coverage to stop spread of measles in the Americas
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Endemic transmission of measles has been reestablished in one country in the region, but PAHO's other 34 Member States maintain their elimination status.

While 34 Member States of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) maintain their measles elimination status, endemic transmission of the virus has now been reestablished in Venezuela. To stop further spread of measles throughout the region, the Director of PAHO, Carissa F Etienne, has urged all countries to rapidly increase vaccination coverage.

"It is vital that we continue vaccinating in order to reach more than 95% of our children everywhere," said Etienne. "We must also strengthen national epidemiological surveillance and establish rapid response teams to expeditiously manage suspected cases, prevent new cases and halt outbreaks. These measures to sustain elimination were agreed to by Ministers of Health in 2017. These commitments must be renewed."

Measles circulation in other regions of the world has always represented an ongoing threat to the Americas, as imported cases can reintroduce the virus among unvaccinated individuals. In 2017, there were 149 142 cases of measles reported globally, with the Americas accounting for just 0.6% of all cases.

In July 2017, Venezuela reported the 1st cases of this current measles outbreak and confirmed that this outbreak was due to a virus strain that was originally reported in Asia and later in Europe. In 2018 as of 20 Aug, Venezuela has reported 3545 confirmed cases of measles, including 62 deaths. A further 10 countries in the region have reported a total of 1459 confirmed cases and 6 deaths.

In the Americas, coverage rates for the 1st dose of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine are currently less than 95%. In addition, lower immunization coverage has been observed in some municipalities and in specific settlements. Vaccination coverage rates for children age 5 years and under must be 95% or greater among all populations in order to maintain elimination.

PAHO and its partner agencies have been working with Venezuela to increase vaccination coverage, strengthen epidemiological surveillance and interrupt transmission. The organization has also mobilized financial resources to support the purchase of vaccines, other supplies, and technical cooperation activities to help Venezuela and other affected countries halt the spread of measles.

Measles elimination in the Americas
-----------------------------------
In 2016, the Region of the Americas became the first in the world to obtain the measles elimination certification, following years of concerted efforts to vaccinate children. A majority of countries in the Americas Region reported their last endemic cases more than 18 years ago.

However, the fact that a disease has been eliminated does not mean that it no longer exists, it simply means that it does not circulate in a specific area. A country is no longer considered to be measles free when the same type of virus has been circulating for more than 12 continuous months. The recurrence of endemic circulation of measles virus, as well as current outbreaks, is evidence of existing gaps in vaccination coverage, which must be urgently addressed.

[Measles is now endemic in Venezuela. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert Level 3 on 17 May 2018 for the country. This Level 3 Alert means USA citizens should avoid visiting Venezuela. This CDC alert says Venezuela is experiencing outbreaks of infectious diseases, and adequate health care is currently not available in most of the country. The CDC recommends all travelers to Venezuela be up to date on all recommended vaccines, such as the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.

A case of measles reported in Hennepin county [Minnesota] last month [July 2018] has not caused other infections -- ending fears that it would set off a larger outbreak, state health officials reported [Tue 28 Aug 2018].

But just as they were about to declare the all clear, another unrelated case popped up last week of 20 Aug 2018] , also in Hennepin county. Like the earlier case, this one involves an unvaccinated child who had traveled here from Africa and brought the infection along.

The cases underscore an international surge in measles, including an outbreak in Europe, that has health officials concerned in Minnesota. Even though the case from early August [2018] was contained and it appears that few people have been exposed to the new case, the deepening pool of infections worldwide has the potential to spark an outbreak in the United States among the pockets of children and adults who remain unvaccinated.

[...]

Minnesota's most recent case is a 2-year-old child who lived in Kenya and traveled to Minnesota for specialized medical care unrelated to measles. The child's measles symptoms became apparent on 20 Aug 2018.

"Thankfully the individual was not out and about with the general public, so there is minimal risk there," Ehresmann said. Measles can sometimes take 8-10 days to develop, but epidemiologists conservatively wait 3 weeks to see if other cases develop before issuing an all-clear. The clock on the 2nd case will run out on 14 Sep 2018.

The biggest concern, health officials said, is that an infected person will cross paths with someone who is unvaccinated. "Our state immunization rate is relatively high, but there are pockets of unimmunized individuals all over Minnesota," Stinchfield said. "This is not just a Hennepin county or newcomers issue."

The Somali-American community has been particularly vulnerable in recent years because measles vaccination rates for its 2-year-olds fell to about 42 percent after autism fears and distrust of medical professionals took hold.

Concerted outreach efforts during last year's [2017] outbreak boosted the rate to 59 percent.

"We are encouraged that there was a little bit of an increase, but we want to be clear that immunization rates need to be in the 90 to 95 percent range to prevent an outbreak," Ehresmann said.

The number of measles cases in the United States has grown steadily in recent years, from 86 in 2016 to 118 in 2017 and 124 so far in 2018. Worldwide, the number of known cases has jumped 55 percent, to 130 000, so far this year [2018].

The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas county (DOH-Pinellas) has reported 4 additional measles cases in Pinellas county.

These new cases increase the number of confirmed measles cases to 7 since the initial case was reported on 13 Aug 2018.

Local health officials say these cases are no longer contagious.

Prior to these cases, measles had not been reported in Pinellas county since 1998, said DOH-Pinellas.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most measles cases in the USA are related to international travel.

This means most measles cases are brought back to the USA by unvaccinated people who get infected during a trip to a measles endemic country.

Upon returning home, an infected person spreads measles to others. ...[more]
