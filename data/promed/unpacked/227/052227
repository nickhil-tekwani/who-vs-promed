I am still preparing a complete answer to Surgeon General Blanck. However,
I'd like to provide some information on these very important studies in
response to the question asked.
Two studies were conducted at Fort Detrick with MDPH-PA in rhesus monkeys
exposed to 255 to 900 times the LD50, using the Ames strain of aerosolized
anthrax, one of the vaccine resistant strains. These are the only studies in
primates that have attempted to duplicate the conditions that might be faced
during a BW attack, using MDPH-PA prophylaxis. The results were spectacular,
with nearly every immunized monkey surviving, and all the controls dying.
However, these results should be viewed carefully. First, although the
vaccine worked well against the Ames strain, it was not tested against other
"vaccine resistant" strains. Second, these results are far superior to the
results in humans, thus the findings may not carry over to humans. In the
only human field trial of the vaccine [involving occupational exposure -
MHJ, one fully immunized person developed cutaneous anthrax, as did two
partly immunized people. It is likely that many more would have succumbed
had they faced hundreds of times the lethal dose. Third, these findings were
presented to the International Workshop on Anthrax in 1995 as brief reports,
and published in its proceedings. But they have not been published elsewhere
and have therefore not been subject to careful peer review.
Because the Salisbury Medical Bulletin 1995, Special Supplement 87, pages
125-6 and 130 is difficult to find, I would be happy to supply copies to
interested readers.

[Firstly, the above are the views of Dr Nass and not necessarily those of
the moderator. Secondly, the enhanced status of Ames and other "vaccine
resistant" strains is based on the comparative challenge using Vollum as the
base line pathogen. Unfortunately, Vollum is defective and makes almost all
anthrax vaccines look good when it is used as the challenge organism, and
similarly makes other challenge strains look like killers. As long as the
correct adjuvants are used in the vaccine production all MDPH-PA-type
vaccines are essentially equicompetent against such challenges. Fortunately,
we have yet to discover what is the LD50 necessary to overcome fully and
partially MDPH-PA vaccinated individuals but successful simian protection
against the range of doses quoted above should provide a modicum of
confidence. People wanting copies of the 1995 proceedings can also contact
Peter Turnbull directly <peter.turnbull@camr.org.uk>. - Mod.MHJ
