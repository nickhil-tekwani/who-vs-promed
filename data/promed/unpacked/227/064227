Disease claims Battambang oranges
---------------------------------
Farmers in Banan district in Battambang have been unable to grow
oranges for 2 years due to a rare, highly infectious tree disease
that causes their leaves to mould rapidly. Just 3 years ago, the
farmland was flushed with the lush green colours of the orange trees.

But now there are hardly any orange trees left on the 30 000 hectares
(74 132 acres) of farmland in the district, and the leaves of the few
orange trees still left are no longer green but grey. Farmers have
turned to other crops after a rare disease known as "silver leaf
disease" started killing their orange trees 2 years ago after a
season of particularly heavy flooding.

According to Sath Sokhom, deputy of the Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Department in Battambang, there is nothing to be done about
the problem. "The land in Banan district is infected with silver leaf
disease, and it causes mould in the orange trees and also infects the
land. So when they grow new orange trees, they get infected," he
said. "We do not have the solution to help the farmers, so they
cannot grow oranges any more -- we suggest they should switch to grow
other crops," he said.

[The term 'silver leaf' is not commonly used for any disease of
citrus. A disease with this name caused by the fungus _Chondrostereum
purpureum_ is known for pome and stone fruit and some other tree and
shrub species, but so far no records seem to be available that this
fungus may affect citrus species. It is not clear which pathogen is
thought to be the cause of the problem on these orange trees. We
would be grateful for any additional information on the issue.
