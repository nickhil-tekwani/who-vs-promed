According to a report in the September 1998 issue of the Journal of
Virology [72:7367-7373., influenza viruses that originate in birds can
acquire the ability to recognize and bind to human cells while they are in
the respiratory tract of pigs. The findings support the notion that pigs
act as "mixing vessels" that alter avian virus strains so that they can
cause pandemics worldwide influenza epidemics that can be potentially
life-threatening to susceptible individuals. Influenza pandemics occurred
in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 1977.
Dr. Toshihiro Ito, was quoted as saying, "These findings help to explain
the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses and support the need for
continued surveillance of swine for viruses carrying avian virus genes."
Bird viruses are, according to this story, usually 100-fold less efficient
at replicating in humans and other primates, although a variety of both
human and avian viruses can infect pigs. In the new study, the researchers
found that cell receptors in the respiratory tract of pigs bind to both
human and avian influenza viruses.
The authors of the report were quoted as saying, "The evidence we present
supports the role of pigs as a source of potentially hazardous influenza A
viruses, arising through classical genetic re-assortment or a novel
adaptation to human virus receptors or perhaps through both mechanisms.
Thus, continued intensive monitoring of swine populations for avian-like
influenza viruses should be an integral part of global health planning."
