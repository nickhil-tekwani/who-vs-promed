Brucella Investigation Following High Number of Test Failures
-------------------------------------------------
Defra has imposed precautionary movement restrictions on a farm in
Derbyshire following a high number of brucella test failures.
A number of reactors have been identified in the dairy herd following
a herd blood test and routine test on milk samples. Samples from
reactors are undergoing cultural examination.
Veterinary advice was that 4 of the reactors should be culled.
Slaughter of the 4, with compensation, has now been carried out and
further testing will be done on lymph nodes to check for _Brucella_.
Sampling of the remaining reactors, who are in isolation, has taken
place and the blood and milk samples are under investigation.
Defra is also tracing any movements off the farm in recent months.
However, it is understood that the farm has been relatively
self-contained with few movements off the farm apart from to
slaughter. Testing has been undertaken on 2 premises under the same
management. There have been no abortions reported from the farm and
no other clinical evidence that Brucellosis has been identified.
_Brucella_ cultures are relatively slow-growing, and results may not
be available for at least 2 weeks. There is a possibility that the
initial test results could be due to a cross-reaction to the test
rather than infection.
Notes for editors
----------------
1. Brucellosis of cattle is caused by infection with the bacterium
_Brucella abortus_, which can also cause a disease of humans known as
undulant fever. In cattle, it causes abortion or premature calving of
recently infected animals; the foetus, placenta and uterine fluid
contain large quantities of _Brucella abortus_ bacteria, which can
affect other cattle coming into contact with an infected animal
around the time of calving. The organism continues to be excreted in
the milk; in the past humans were frequently infected through
drinking unpasteurised milk.
2. The last case of Brucellosis was in 2004 in Cornwall. Details of
the last press release dated 20 Jul 2004 can be found at:
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2004/040720d.htm>.
3. If slaughter is required, animals will be slaughtered under the
Brucellosis (England) Order 2000. Compensation is payable for
slaughter of reactors under the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (England
and Wales) Compensation (Amendment) Order 1998 [NB the parent Order
is the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (England and Wales - Compensation
Order 1978]. The maximum payable is calculated monthly based on the
average market price and for Mar 2005 is GBP 591 [USD 1105].
4. Article 10 of the Brucellosis (England) Order 2000 requires all
cattle farmers to report abortions and premature calving to the local
Animal Health office. Similar legislation is in place for Scotland
and Wales. Details of the disease [caused by infection with]
_Brucella abortus_ can be found on the Defra website at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2005//animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/brucellosis.htm>.
5. A fact sheet for farmers, detailing what they should do in an
outbreak is also available on the Defra website at:

Cows Culled Amid Fears of Disease Outbreak
-------------------
4 cows have been culled at a farm amid concerns of a potential
outbreak of brucellosis, it was revealed today.
The department for environment food and rural affairs (Defra) said it
had also imposed movement restrictions on the Derbyshire dairy after
23 animals failed tests for the contagious disease, which causes
premature abortions in cattle and can cause a fever in humans.
The 4 slaughtered cows showed stronger reactions to the routine blood
and milk tests than the rest of the herd, said a Defra spokesman.
The department was keen to stress more checks were needed to confirm
that the cattle were infected with the _Brucella_ bacteria because
initial results could show a cross-reaction to the test itself.
_Brucella_ can cause a disease in humans called undulant fever, but
this has only been contracted in the past, said the spokesman, by
drinking unpasteurised milk.
Cattle develop the disease when coming into contact with an infected
cow's placenta or aborted foetus.
Defra said it was too early in the tests process to identify the farm involved.
"At this stage it's only the initial test that shows this and it
could be a cross-reaction, so we won't normally give out any further
details until the further tests confirm or negate the problem," the
spokesman said.
It is understood that the farm has been relatively self-contained in
recent days, with few movements off the site apart from [cattle being
taken] to slaughter. Testing has been undertaken on 2 premises under
the same management. There have been no abortions reported from the
farm and no other clinical evidence that [_Brucella_ are present].
The farmer has been compensated for the culled animals.
_Brucella_ cultures are relatively slow-growing, said Defra, and
results from the further tests may not be available for at least 2
weeks. The last case of brucellosis was in 2004 in Cornwall.

[A similar newswire has been received from Mary Marshall.
Bovine brucellosis was absent in the UK from 1993 to 2002. In 2003,
_Brucella abortus_ was isolated from cattle in 4 herds in Scotland.
All the infected and contact cattle at risk of infection were
slaughtered. Reportedly, all 4 outbreaks were caused by the
importation of infected cattle.
In March 2004, a whole breeding beef herd was slaughtered in Cornwall
on the strength of a _Brucella abortus_ biovar 1 isolate from an
aborting cow. 3 other cows aborted with culture-positive vaginal
swabs or fetal stomach contents. A specialist epidemiological team
was set up to look into the source of the infection. The results of
the said investigation were published by DEFRA on 20 Jul 2004 (press
release 287/04).
The conclusion was that the infection had, most likely, been
introduced into the herd in Cornwall between Spring 2002 and Spring
2003 and that it was an isolated incident. The origin of infection
was never identified, for which 2 reasons were offered:
- The animal which introduced the infection may no longer be alive;
- Although the disease reached and became established in the herd in
Cornwall, it may not have persisted elsewhere.
The outcome of the current investigation into this suspected case is
anticipated within 2 weeks. - Mod.AS]
