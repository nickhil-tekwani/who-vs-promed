The Columbia County Health Department has confirmed a case of Powassan virus [infection], a tick-borne illness, in a county resident.

Dr. Ananthakrishnan Ramani, chief of infectious diseases and microbiology at Columbia Memorial Health, working with the state Health Department, reported the 1st case of the virus.

"The patient is recovering well," said Dr. Ramani, the medical director for the Columbia County Department of Health.

Powassan virus [causes] is a rare viral disease that can cause symptoms ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to life-threatening encephalitis. The disease remains extremely rare in New York, which has reported 29 cases to the Centers for Disease Control.

Columbia County Public Health Director Jack Mabb said preventative measures can work together for protection against tick-borne diseases. "It is important for residents to plan ahead before outdoor activities, be mindful of exposure while outdoors, and to remain vigilant in checking for ticks, both while outdoors and afterward for the best chance of prevention against tick-borne diseases."

[This case may represent the 1st case of the Powassan virus transmission season in New York state and New England.

Powassan virus is endemic in New York state, and cases occur there sporadically. The tick vector is the blacklegged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_.

It is good to learn that the patient mentioned above is recovering well. This is not always the case. Humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from the natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV is the causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness with 50 percent of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae. POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958 when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, Canada. In this case, POWV was isolated from the brain autopsy. There are 2 distinct genetic lineages of POWV now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and blacklegged tick virus (lineage II). Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 16 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. - Mod.TY
