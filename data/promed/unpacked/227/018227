At least 5 detainees have gotten sick in an apparent salmonellosis outbreak at a medium-security division of the Cook County Jail.

Detainees at the jail's Division 11, 3015 S. California Boulevard, "began experiencing symptoms of a gastrointestinal illness" last week [week of Sun 29 Apr 2018], according to a statement from the Cook County Sheriff's Office. Over the weekend [Sat 5-Sun 6 May 2018], 5 cases of salmonellosis were confirmed among the 54 detainees reporting symptoms.

Up to 2 of the detainees were hospitalized for their symptoms, the sheriff's office said. One has since been returned to the jail and the other was expected to be returned to the jail on [Tue 8 May 2018].

The sheriff's office, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and the Cook County Department of Facilities Management were "working closely with local health officials to identify the source of the salmonella bacteria," the sheriff's office said.

The Cook County Department of Public Health did not immediately provide further details [Tue 8 May 2018] afternoon.

[This outbreak is certainly likely to be foodborne. Many jail facilities in large cities have central locations for food preparations so outbreaks can affect multiple sites. It is possible that if all the cases were at one location that the cause was with issues with food storage after preparation.
