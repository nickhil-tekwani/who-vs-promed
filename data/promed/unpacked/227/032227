German stone marten diagnosed with bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
A stone marten on the German island of Ruegen has been infected with
the H5N1 bird flu virus in what is believed to be a case of the virus
jumping species, the country's national veterinary laboratory said.
The stone marten is a member of the weasel family and is the 1st
animal of this species to be reported as infected with the virus,
said Thomas Mettenleiter, the head of the Friedrich Loeffler
Institute. The virus has killed 3 cats on the same Baltic Sea island.
The cats are believed to have contracted the disease from eating the
wild birds, which brought the most dangerous form of H5N1 to Germany
in mid-February 2006.
The most pathogenic form of H5N1 can also kill humans.
The institute said the infected stone marten was found on the same
part of Ruegen as the cats.
Mettenleiter said that although the case marks the spread of the
virus to a new species, it does not mean that humans are at any
greater risk of contracting it.
"While this find signals that another mammal species has been
infected for the 1st time, the basic assessment of the epidemic
situation has not changed," he told reporters.

[The list of mammals reported so far to have been (naturally or
experimentally) infected by H5N1 includes the following 9 species:
Palm Civet (_Chrotogale owstoni Owston_), Domestic cat/feral cat
(_Felis domestica_), Cynomolgus macques (_Macaca fascicularis_),
Ferret (_Mustela putoris furo_), New Zealand white rabbit
(_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), Leopard (_Panthera pardus_), Tiger
(_Panthera tigris_), Rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), Pig (_Sus
domesticus_). For the locations, dates and references for seven of
these, see

The Stone marten (_Martes foina_, Family: Mustelidae, picture at

has become the 2nd mustelid in the list, joining its family member,
the ferret. - Mod.AS]

Serbia says H5N1 bird flu strain found in swan
-----------------------------------------------
Serbia confirmed on Thursday [9 Mar 2006] its 1st case of the deadly
H5N1 strain of bird flu in a swan found last week in the northern
Sombor region, close to the Croatian border.
The head of Serbia's veterinary directorate, Dejan Krnjaic, said the
result was confirmed by a reference laboratory in Weybridge, UK. He
said another swan found dead in western Serbia was also assumed to
have had H5N1.
In both cases, areas within a 10-km (6 mile) radius of where the
swans were found have been declared risk zones, and veterinarians
were monitoring all wild fowl within it. All domestic poultry in
Serbia was being kept indoors.

[3] Germany, Bavaria: wild birds

The number of H5N1 infected wild birds increases to 8 in Bavaria, Germany
-----------------------------------------------
H5N1 virus was confirmed today [8 Mar 2006] in a dead buzzard in
Wasserburg on Lake Constance (district Lindau), as well as in a mute
swan from the town of Landsberg am Lech, by the Friedrich Loffler
Institute (FLI). The buzzard and the swan were found on 28 Feb 2006
and 2 Mar 2006, respectively. They tested positive for influenza A
virus in tests by the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Agency
(Landesamt fur Gesundheit und Lebensmittelsicherheit, or LGL). Today,
both avians were confirmed by FLI as being H5N1-positive. The total
number of AI-infected wild birds found in Bavaria increases to 8, of
which 5 are already laboratory-confirmed to have the highly
pathogenic H5N1 virus type.
Since 16 Feb 2006, a total of 1666 samples from wild birds have been
sent to the LGL, of which 1383 have been analyzed for the virus. 17
have been found positive for influenza A. These samples are being
further characterized by the FLI. 8 samples were found H5N1-positive,
and the remaining 9 are still under investigation.
A map of the Bavarian locations where H5N1-infected wild birds were
found is displayed at
<http://www.stmugv.bayern.de/de/tierschutz/vogelgrippe/bayernkarte.htm>.
A table (in German) of the current standings for the results of all
samples can be found at

Firsthand, accurate ornithological information on this raptor species
found infected in Bavaria, including its candidate prey and suggested
route(s) of infection, will be helpful.
Italy reported to the OIE, on 22 Feb 2006, the identification of H5N1
in a buzzard, _Buteo buteo_; see
