West Nile virus - multi-country (World) - monitoring season 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------
Time period covered: 27 Oct-2 Nov 2019
Reusable maps and graphs from ECDC Communicable Disease Threats Report-Week 44, 2019

During the transmission season, expected to be from June-November 2019, ECDC monitors the occurrence of infections in EU/EEA and EU neighbouring countries and publishes weekly epidemiological updates to inform blood safety authorities of areas at NUTS 3 level (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 3) or GAUL 1 (Global Administrative Unit Layers 1) where at least one locally acquired human infection was reported that meets the EU case definition (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/945).

Update of the week
------------------
Between [25 and 30 Oct 2019], EU member states reported a total of 9 human cases: 4 in Italy, 2 in Romania, and one each in Germany, Hungary and Bulgaria. Two cases were reported from an EU neighbouring country, Turkey. A human case was reported for the 1st time from an area in Germany. This week, one death was reported by Bulgaria.

In the same time period, 7 outbreaks among equids were reported to the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS): 6 were in Germany and one in Spain.

Situation update
----------------
Between [25 and 30 Oct 2019], EU member states reported 9 human cases in Italy (4), Romania (2), Germany (1), Hungary (1) and Bulgaria (1). Two cases were reported from EU neighbouring countries, both in Turkey. A human case was reported for the 1st time from one area in Germany. This week, one death was reported by Bulgaria.

In the same time period, 7 outbreaks among equids were reported to the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) by Germany (6) and Spain (1).

Since the beginning of the 2019 transmission season and as of [30 Oct 2019], EU member states and EU neighbouring countries reported 452 human infections. EU member states reported 399 cases: Greece (222), Romania (66), Italy (46), Hungary (36), Cyprus (16), Bulgaria (5), Austria (4), Germany (2), France (2), and Slovakia (1). EU neighbouring countries reported 52 human cases in Serbia (27), Israel (10), Turkey (9) and North Macedonia (6).

To date, 45 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Greece (30), Romania (7), Italy (4), Cyprus (1), Bulgaria (1), North Macedonia (1) and Serbia (1).

During the current transmission season, 84 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Germany (29), Greece (21), France (11), Italy (8), Hungary (7), Austria (3), Spain (4) and Portugal (1). In addition, Germany reported 53 outbreaks among birds to ADNS.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is an RNA virus within the _Flaviviridae_ family, a member of the Japanese encephalitis virus serocomplex. Mosquitoes of the genus _Culex_ mainly and to a lesser extent _Aedes_ spp. and _Ochlerotatus_ spp. act as vectors.

Infection from WNV has been an important public health issue for many European countries, including Greece, since 2010. WNV circulation has been recorded in several countries across the European continent, both in Central Europe and in the Mediterranean basin.

Two main WNV genetic lineages have been reported by various research studies. Lineage 1 has been found in Europe, Africa, Middle East, America, Australia, and India, whereas lineage 2 has been initially recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/2450682/).

WNV is maintained in an enzootic cycle, transmitted primarily between avian hosts and mosquito vectors. The role of migratory birds in relation to the introduction of virus into Europe and the Mediterranean basin is clearly assessed by numerous studies in Spain, Israel, Poland, Romania and Czech Republic (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878979/).

One of the most clinically relevant features of WNV infection in humans is the large percentage of infected asymptomatic subjects, which is usually reported being more than 80% of the total of individuals infected. However, the viral load present in these asymptomatic subjects is not known. Nevertheless, in at least some of these asymptomatic individuals, infectious virus is clearly present and able to be transmitted via blood transfusion and organ transplantation (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14614154).

WNV appears to be expanding its geographical range in Europe and in the rest of the world, causing increasing numbers of outbreaks associated with human morbidity and mortality. Multiple de novo introduction of unrelated WNV strains has been demonstrated in Europe, raising concerns about the potential emergence of strains with increased virulence, and the limitations of current diagnostic tests in identifying novel and unexpected WNVs. Given this continuing unpredictability and the rapid development of epidemics, timely surveillance for WNV infections including veterinary and entomological monitoring, as well as molecular surveillance of emerging strains, is an essential effort. - Mod.UBA
