Alarmed at the spread of jaundice in [the western Odisha [or Orissa - Mod.LL] city of Sambalpur, the state government has decided to form a joint task force for taking concrete steps to contain the disease. The decision was taken during a visit here by state Housing and Urban Development Minister Pushpendra Singh Deo and Health Minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak to take stock of the situation.

Singh Deo said 5 water samples sent to the National Institute of Virology [NIV] in Pune for testing have tested negative. Stating that more and more jaundice cases were being reported every day, he said over 50 more water samples would be sent for laboratory testing soon. "Moreover, a joint task force will be formed to contain the disease," said Singh Deo, adding that 70 percent of water supply pipelines were running through drains in the city.

Health Minister Nayak said a public health team has already been stationed here and that free treatment and check ups for the patients have already been started.

It has also been decided to stop the PHED [public health engineering department] from supplying water to those areas of the city which have been badly affected by the disease and provide water from alternative source, he said.

Of the total 29 wards of Sambalpur municipality, 17 wards have been badly affected due to jaundice. 7 wards -- ward nos 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 20 -- are severely affected. As per an official survey conducted by the health department, 818 people of the city have been infected, and 10 persons have died due to the disease this year [2014].

[As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices in many developing countries, most children (up to 90 percent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not often experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare.

Because of this, the cause of this outbreak is likely to be the other food/waterborne form of viral hepatitis, hepatitis E. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E.

A recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in persons aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses has been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia. - Mod.LL
