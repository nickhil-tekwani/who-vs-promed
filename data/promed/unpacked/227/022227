[In this report, the majority of the fatal "acute encephalitis
syndrome" (AES) cases were due to Japanese encephalitis virus
infections. The number of AES cases due to scrub typhus, tuberculosis
and other etiological agents is not given. Previous reports have
associated AES cases with water-borne viruses, presumably
enteroviruses, but they have never been definitively diagnosed.
