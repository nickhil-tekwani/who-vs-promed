Transmission Potential of Influenza A(H7N9) Virus, China, 2013-2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
To determine transmission potential of influenza A(H7N9) virus, we used symptom onset data to compare 2 waves of infection in China during 2013-2014. We found evidence of increased transmission potential in the 2nd wave and showed that live bird market closure was significantly less effective in Guangdong than in other regions.

Conclusions
-----------
We found no evidence of reduced human-to-human transmission between the 2 waves. For a serial interval of 7 days [time delay between symptom onset in primary and secondary case-patients], we estimated that R0 increased in Zhejiang. Furthermore, the effectiveness of live bird market closures varied between regions; short-term closures were substantially less effective than interventions in other regions. These results emphasize the value of prompt and sustainable control measures during outbreaks of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection.

[To read the entire paper, go to Kucharski AJ, Mills HL, Donnelly CA, Riley S. Transmission potential of influenza A(H7N9) virus, China, 2013-2014. Emerg Infect Dis. 21(5). May 2015. http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2105.141137. At this time, it is ahead of print.

The investigators estimated the degree of human-to-human transmission by examining symptom onset data and exposure hazard from markets. They found evidence of a small but significant level of transmission between humans in the 1st and 2nd H7N9 waves, as has been suggested previously. They also confirmed that market closure is effective in reducing risk. However, they recognized that local market density could also influence the size of spillover hazard and, hence, effectiveness of interventions.

A(H7N9) was 1st recognized as a pathogen for humans in China in February 2013. It is asymptomatic in poultry, making control difficult. The 1st wave of infections ended with strict control of poultry markets. The virus became active again in a 2nd wave of infections in 2014. The new strains of H7N9 were genetically distinct from those in the 1st wave, evidence that the virus is evolving.

The concern over the spread of H7N9 and its potential to re-assort and evolve is high. In 2014, during the 1st wave of infections, 26 genotypes of H7N9 were noted to have emerged, and currently 48 genotypes are recognized. This represents a rapid expansion of genetic diversity (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14348.html). The threat H7N9 poses to public health will be further exacerbated if it spreads beyond China. Since 2013, there have been 644 cases of H7N9 reported, the last case reported at the end of March 2015 in Zhejiang province -- FluTrackers (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links). Little information on new cases is being reported by the government, so it is not clear whether cases have diminished tremendously or are not being reported.
