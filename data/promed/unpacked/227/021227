It sounds to me as though Infection with PMV1 (pigeon) [paramyxovirus-1,
also known as Newcastle disease - Mod.TG] should be considered in the
differential diagnosis of this condition. The virus appears to be
neurotropic, and problems with locomotion and flight are often reported in
affected birds in the UK.

[The clinical signs in these pigeons do cause one to think about END,
especially with the situation in California. However, it is much more
likely this was an intentional poisoning to eliminate the birds from the
area. The tissues are being tested for END, but the unofficial result is
negative for END. - Mod.TG]
