Rift Valley fever (RVF) has struck the Dodoma region of Tanzania
killing 10 people. According to Zawadiel Mchome, the Dodoma Regional
Administrative Secretary, Tanzanian authorities had already put the
Bahi and Chamwino districts under livestock quarantine. The 10
[deaths occurred] in the past month, he said [as he opened] a 2-day
workshop for stakeholders in the war against HIV/Aids in the Dodoma
region.
Mr Mchome has been the 1st regional official to confirm the existence
of the fatal disease (RVF) after efforts by journalists to [obtain
information about it] from other regional authorities failed. "We
have lost a number of people without knowing exactly what was behind
their deaths, until recently when we [established that] it was the
deadly RVF," he said. However, he could not reveal the names of the
deceased or their places of origin.
On the other hand, the Dodoma regional veterinary officer, Dr Samson
Mwanuko, said Bahi and Chamwino have been confirmed to have the
disease. Without releasing statistics, Dr Mwanuko said the 2
districts have been under quarantine since last Monday [12 Mar 2007].

These deaths may represent a westerly spread of the outbreak, but the
places of origin of the victims are not revealed unambiguously. -
