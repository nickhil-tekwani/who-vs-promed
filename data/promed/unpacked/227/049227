A 10-year-old Indonesian girl who died on Tuesday in the city of Bandung
was killed by the H5N1 avian influenza virus, a senior health official said
on Saturday [27 May 2006], citing results from a WHO-accredited laboratory
in Hong Kong. "The girl is confirmed [as a human case of avian influenza]
by the WHO as well as the local lab," I Nyoman Kandun, Director-general of
Communicable Disease Control, told Reuters.
The girl's 18-year-old brother, who also died on Tuesday, tested positive
locally for H5N1 this week, but was not considered a bird flu case by the
Hong Kong laboratory. "It's a borderline case, he tested negative for some
procedures. It may be because of the procedure of specimen collection,
handling, maybe the Hong Kong lab had problems. We had the same experience
before in another case," Kandun said.
This latest confirmation of the cause of the girl's death would bring the
death toll in Indonesia from avian influenza to 34, and the worldwide total
to 125.
Although the brother would not be classified as a case of H5N1, Kandun said
the teenager exhibited the same clinical symptoms as his sister. Dead
chickens were found in the village where they lived a few days before they
fell ill and the sick poultry may well have been the source of their
infection, he said.

since only one of the pair had been confirmed so far by independent testing
to be a confirmed case of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP]

A WHO-recognised laboratory confirmed 4 bird flu cases in Indonesia on
Saturday [27 May 2006], including a 10-year-old girl who died this week in
Bandung city [described in part 1 of this update - Mod.CP] and a
shuttlecock maker who is alive, a government official said.
"The girl is confirmed by the WHO," said I Nyoman Kandun, Director-general
of Communicable Disease Control. He added that the source of the girl's
infection was likely to be sick poultry in her village in Bandung in west
Java. The girl's 18-year-old brother, who also died on Tuesday, tested
positive locally for H5N1 this week, but was not considered a bird flu case
by the Hong Kong laboratory.
"It's a borderline case ... It may be because of the procedure of specimen
collection, handling, maybe the Hong Kong lab had problems. We had the same
experience before in another case," Kandun told Reuters. Though the brother
is not classified as a H5N1 case, Kandun said he exhibited the same
clinical symptoms as his sister. Dead chickens were found in their village
a few days before they fell ill and sick poultry may well have been the
source of their infection, he said.
[These 2 cases have been described also in part [1] of this post and the
same caution that this pair of siblings should not be identified as a
cluster at this stage, since only one of the pair has been confirmed as an
avian influenza case by independent testing. - Mod.CP]
The laboratory in Hong Kong, whose findings are considered definitive by
the global medical community, also confirmed H5N1 infection in the
18-year-old shuttlecock maker, who used to sort feathers in a factory in
Surabaya in east Java. He is alive in hospital. His condition was not known.
The 3rd person is a 43-year-old in Jakarta who is alive, and the 4th is a
39-year-old, also from the capital, who died, although it was not
immediately clear when. Confirmation of the source of the 2 deaths brings
the H5N1 death toll in Indonesia to 35, and the worldwide total to 126. [As
of 23 May 2006, the WHO cumulative total of confirmed human cases of H5N1
avian influenza in Indonesia remains at 42, 33 of whom have died. - Mod.CP]
Kandun considered the case of the siblings as Indonesia's 7th human bird
flu cluster since the disease found its way into chickens in the sprawling
archipelago in late 2003. [See reservations expressed above. - Mod.CP]
Indonesia's bird flu problem captured the world's attention this month
after the virus killed as many as 8 members of a family in a remote village
in Sumatra, one of Indonesia's largest islands in the far west. Health
experts and epidemiologists have narrowed the likely source of their
infection to poultry but they say limited human-to-human transmission may
also have occurred. But the WHO says genetic analyses of virus samples from
the Sumatran victims have not shown changes or traits that are known to
date to allow the virus to spread efficiently among people -- a necessary
precursor to the start of a pandemic. Some who died later had taken care of
those who fell sick earlier and may have been infected during close and
prolonged contact.
Kandun said victims in every one of the 7 [presumptive] clusters were blood
relatives -- which gives credence to a theory that people who are infected
by the H5N1 are genetically predisposed to it due to a unique make-up of
their respiratory tracts. "Maybe they have genetic susceptibility," he
said. Another observation that backs up the theory is that spouses were
never infected even though they had close contact with the Sumatran
victims. "If you look at 2 wives in the family, they were very close to the
sick members and they are not sick," Kandun said. "If efficient
human-to-human transmission was happening, nurses and other contact persons
must be sick."
Local health officials however have failed to detect live H5N1 virus in
samples collected from chickens in Sumatra -- which deprives Indonesia of
vital evidence to pin the source of infection to sick poultry. Kandun said
the government decided on Friday [26 May 2006] to collect more samples in
the area around where the Sumatran family lived.

Iran's Health Ministry said on Saturday [27 May 2006] the country had no
human cases of the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, dismissing statements by a
medical official and lawmaker that early tests showed a 3rd person had died
of avian influenza.
A senior medical official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that
preliminary tests in the northwestern city of Kermanshah showed a
30-year-old man died on Wednesday morning from H5N1 bird flu. He said this
would be the 3rd death after a 41-year-old man and his 26-year-old sister
were also shown by preliminary tests to have died of bird flu in
Kermanshah, which lies some 100 km (60 miles) from the Iraqi border.

FACTBOX: The 6 Phases of Pandemic Alert
-----------------------------------------
As of Fri 26 May 2006, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is not
considering raising its global bird flu alert level, although its
investigation into a family cluster in Indonesia continues, a senior WHO
official said on Friday.
Paul Gully, senior adviser to WHO's top bird flu official Margaret Chan,
told Reuters in an interview in Geneva: "Our feeling now is there is
nothing new that has happened which would make us want to consider moving
to level 4." The WHO uses 6 phases of pandemic alert to inform its 192
member states of the seriousness of the threat and the need to step up
preparations. It says the world is currently in phase 3: "A new influenza
virus subtype is causing disease in humans, but is not yet spreading
efficiently and sustainably among humans".
The following is a description of the 6 phases. Phase 4 is an important
warning signal when "clusters" of infected people are detected, while 6
marks the start of a pandemic. The decision to move from one phase to
another is made by the WHO leader after consultations with an external
board of experts.
PHASE ONE
Inter-pandemic phase -- Low risk of human cases.
PHASE 2
New virus in animals, but no human cases -- Higher risk of human cases
PHASE 3
Pandemic Alert -- No or very limited human-to-human transmission
PHASE 4
Clusters of human cases suggesting increased adaptability of the virus --
Evidence of increased human-to-human transmission
PHASE 5
Larger clusters of human cases over longer periods -- Evidence of
significant human-to-human transmission
PHASE 6
Pandemic -- Efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission

The 192-nation World Health Assembly today [26 May 2006] agreed to speed up
preparations for a possible bird flu pandemic by allowing the UN health
agency and member countries to establish a global warning system a year
early. The chief decision-making body for the World Health Organisation
(WHO) approved without debate a resolution allowing for countries to
immediately introduce a fast reporting system to guard against the start of
a possible flu pandemic.
The resolution, which said a key element of the system is the prompt
notification to WHO of human influenza cause by a new virus subtype, also
urged WHO to make sure a system is in place to co-ordinate response to
disease outbreaks and have a list of experts ready for rapid deployment.
The avian influenza warning system, originally foreseen in a new version of
the International Health Regulations approved by WHO members in 2005, had
been scheduled to begin operating on 15 Jun 2007. But the resolution said
countries could formally introduce it immediately because there is a
serious risk to human health, including the possible emergence of a
pandemic virus, arising from ongoing outbreaks in poultry of highly
pathogenic avian influenza.
It expressed concern that cases of bird flu continue to occur sporadically
in humans and that the virus had spread through the migration of wild
waterfowl to new areas and was predicted to spread further.
Dr Anders Nordstrom, who took over as acting WHO chief following the death
of Director-General Lee Jong-wook on Monday [22 May 2006], said the
resolution gives further impetus to progress already made against bird flu.
We expect now that we will be able to accelerate it even more, said
Nordstrom. But he said both countries and WHO needed to employ more people
in the effort and raise more money to pay for preparations. Money is not
flowing fast enough, Nordstrom said. So far, WHO has received only 5-6
million of its share of the 1 billion pledged for bird flu and pandemic
preparedness by the international community at a January [2006] meeting in
Beijing, Nordstrom said.
