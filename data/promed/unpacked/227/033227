In 2018, more than 40 wheat (_Triticum aestivum_) samples showing symptoms of leaf streak were collected in the Ukraine and tested for the presence of _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (_Tritimovirus_, WSMV). Despite the presence of symptoms and of the mite vector (_Aceria tosichella_), WSMV was not found, but transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of an emaravirus.

Further studies confirmed the occurrence [of] _High Plains wheat mosaic virus_ (_Emaravirus_, HPWMoV) in commercial wheat fields in 4 regions (Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kharkiv), where 56% of symptomatic samples (24 out of 43 tested samples) were HPWMoV-positive and approximately 50% were infected by both HPWMoV and WSMV.

Subsequently, HPWMoV was also detected in the Vinnytsia region, in 12 samples of maize (_Zea mays_) plants showing leaf streaking and mosaic. This is the 1st time that HPWMoV is reported from Ukraine and from the EPPO region.

[_High Plains wheat mosaic virus_ (HPWMoV; genus _Emaravirus_, not yet assigned to family or order) has previously only been reported from the Americas and Australia. It can affect wheat, maize, and related grasses. Symptoms in wheat are similar to _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_) and _Triticum mosaic virus_ (TriMV; genus _Poacevirus_) and usually appear in warmer weather. They may include yellow blotches, streaks and mottling on leaves, as well as severe stunting, excessive tillering, and possibly death of plants.

The 3 viruses may occur singly or in mixed infections. Co-infections can lead to synergistic increase of symptom severity and yield loss. The virus complex can cause major yield losses and is primarily transmitted by the wheat curl mite (_Aceria tosichella_). Infectious insects can be carried on air currents over long distances and affected plants often occur in patches or on the edges of a field, reflecting the movement of the vector.

Control of the mite vector is difficult. Disease management may include control of vector and virus reservoirs to minimise available inoculum, but relies mainly on use of cultivars with increased levels of resistance. However, development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult since each pathogen can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains.
