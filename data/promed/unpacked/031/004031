Many villagers in Meenakshipuram, Durairajapuram, Anaikaraipatti,
Visuvasa puram, Ammapatti, Sillamarathupatti and Silamalai in Bodi
block of Theni district were found to be suffering from high fever.
Diagnosis showed that many of them were suffering from chikungunya
[virus infection].

More than 1200 patients came to the Bodi Government Hospital in Theni
from Meenakshipuram, Durairajapuram and Anaikaraipatti villages. More
than 400 of them were found to be suffering from chikungunya [virus
infection]. Since the hospital has only limited bed strength, most of
them were treated as outpatients and asked to go home.

Many of them from Meenakshipuram are so ill that they are unable to
get back to their village and are waiting for admission. Only a
limited number of patients have been admitted to the hospital.
Patients from the villages come to the government hospital for want
of proper facilities in the primary health centres in their areas.
Bodi hospital itself is handicapped without adequate staff and proper
stocks of medicines.

Thirumurugan, block medical officer of Dombucherry, said that they
found an outbreak of chikungunya in Ammapatti village but they had
brought it under control. Now this ailment had spread in some
villages, including Meenakshipuram. Doctors have collected blood
samples and had sent them for analysis.

The Department of Health had taken various measures to check the
spread of this disease, including spraying of chemicals, fogging and
clearing waste materials. Special camps are also being organised in
villages to detect cases of chikungunya, the block medical officer said.

[The statement that blood samples were being sent to a laboratory for
analysis suggests that the chikungunya virus infections are being
diagnosed on clinical grounds. Laboratory results for confirmation
(or not) would be of interest and ProMED would appreciate receiving
this information.
