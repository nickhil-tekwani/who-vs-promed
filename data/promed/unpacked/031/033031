[This report confirms the Bluetongue virus to be serotype 1, which
indicates it is not related to the outbreak in northwestern parts of Europe.
As is the case for neighboring Morocco, which is currently being
affected by EHD (another related orbivirus spread by insect vectors),
the outbreaks are spread over a large portion of northern part of the country.
In contrast to previous reports, this official report contains
information only on sheep as was true for the previous official
report in July 2006 (Bluetongue, sheep - Algeria 20060726.2054). It
would be most helpful to confirm recent unofficial reports indicating
cattle are also being affected. - Mod.PC]
