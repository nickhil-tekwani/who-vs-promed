Oklahoma animal health officials have placed a mare under quarantine
after learning she had been exposed to a stallion carrying contagious
equine metritis. This is a disease that is treatable but can cause
infertility in mares and sometimes causes mares to abort their foals.

This disease was found in Kentucky last month [December 2008], and
traces have been established in a number of other states.

Dr. Becky Brewer, State Veterinarian, said it is important for horse
breeders to observe careful biosecurity and be sure to thoroughly
cleanse equipment used in artificial insemination. Artificial
insemination equipment is believed to be the primary cause of the
current outbreak.

[Since there are a number of states involved in the tracings of
potentially exposed animals, it is likely that Oklahoma has been
notified of some animals that may have been exposed. Certainly, there
will be careful testing. Readers are encouraged to see the moderator
comments in the previous postings, as they are thorough and
enlightening. - Mod.TG]
