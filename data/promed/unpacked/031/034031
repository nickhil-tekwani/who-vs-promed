A new virus may be responsible for most of the 62 deaths in a pig-borne
encephalitis outbreak in Malaysia, health officials and foreign experts
said Friday. They said only 18 deaths were confirmed to be from Japanese
encephalitis (JE) while the rest may have been caused by a new virus
[related to Hendra virus, named after a suburb in Brisbane, Australia
where it was identified in 1994.
"I would assume that the rest of the cases which are JE-negative may be
caused by the new virus," health ministry director-general Abu Bakar
Sulaiman told a news conference. "We are still investigating."
[Dr. Thomas Ksiazek, veterinary surgeon for the Atlanta-based Centers for
Disease Control, described the new virus as a "close relative" but
"certainly distinct" from the Hendra strain, which affected both horses and
humans in the Australia outbreak. "We are dealing with a new situation. It
is a new virus that is not exactly like Hendra," said Ksiazek, who arrived
Monday as part of a team of foreign technical advisors invited by the
government. The team, which also includes two Australian experts, would
help in laboratory investigation and diagnosis of the new strain, he added.
Based on the Australian experience, Ksiazek said the Hendra virus was not a
"horse disease" but was spread by fruit bats and rarely transferred to
livestock. Abu Bakar said the government was investigating the population
and movement of fruit bats but noted that past cases showed that the Hendra
virus was relatively difficult to transmit. He said JE virus, which is
carried by mosquitoes, was much harder to control than the new [virus,
which is spread through direct contact with the faeces of infected animals
or their body fluids.
Officials said investigations were being conducted on other livestock to
ensure that the virus did not spread beyond pigs.
The World Health Organisation's regional office for Western Pacific said
Friday it was ready to provide technical advice and mobilise additional
resources to help battle the outbreak. WHO collaborative institutions were
conducting "detailed serological and virological investigations (on samples
from Malaysia) that will provide a clearer picture of the dynamics of the
current outbreak." "New information indicates that both JE and a second
virus are circulating," it said in a statement to Bernama news agency.
The epidemic first broke out in pig farms in the northern state of Perak in
October and was reported to have killed 15 people before spreading to
Negeri Sembilan state in the southwest two months later.
The encephalitis outbreak has prompted a health scare and crippled
Malaysia's 1.5 billion ringgit ($395 million) pig-rearing industry.
Soldiers have so far killed more than 70,000 pigs in four villages in
Negeri Sembilan, the health ministry said. The mass culling operation,
which started Saturday, aims to kill some 335,000 pigs. Another operation
to kill 10,871 infected pigs in five farms in Perak state would begin
Saturday, officials said.
Veterinary services department director-general Nordin Mohamad Noor said
pig vaccination had been suspended amid fears that the new virus may be
spread to uninfected pigs and expose workers.
He said the virus could be contained simply by using soap and water
immediately after contact with pigs.
Experts were also investigating the mysterious deaths of 12 pigs at a farm
in Sepang in central Selangor state, bordering Negeri Sembilan where the
worst-affected villages are located. Reports said some families in Sepang,
which has 70 farms and some 80,000 pigs, had moved out amid fears that the
disease had travelled beyond Negeri Sembilan.
Malaysia, admitting that it was facing an emergency situation, said
Thursday it would create buffer zones around infected pig farms and
slaughter all pigs in the zones. As of late Thursday, a total of 66,228
people had been vaccinated and 156,065 houses and 7,732 farms disinfected.

[It is gratifying to see that the Malaysians are getting to the heart of
the epidemiologic matter. It will not be easier to end this nightmare.
No one knows that simple hand-washing will prevent infection but it
certainly cannot hurt to maintain a cleanliness barrier and to avoid or
eliminate fomites. - Mod.CHC
