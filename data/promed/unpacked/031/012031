State Vector-borne Disease Control Officer Dr Himanshu Jaiswar, while speaking to The Hitavada, said that to date [26 Aug 2018], a total of 8 Japanese encephalitis- (JE) positive cases have been registered across the state.

A few days back, a 3-year-old child died from JE. Health officials have already started investigations around the localities of positive patients. Concerned authorities have confirmed the presence of JE virus in the areas.

The department is taking all necessary measures to get control of the disease. Himanshu Jaiswar said that the state Vector-borne Disease Control Department is doing local entomological work, especially in areas of the JE patients. He said that the department is planning pig and mosquito sampling in the next few weeks and is asking for the help of veterinary surgeons. He said the department is asking the government of India to administer immunizations, as JE could be controlled with effective vaccination.

Japanese encephalitis is an infection of the brain caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Symptoms of JE may include headache, vomiting, fever, confusion, etc. This occurs about 5 to 15 days after infection.

JEV is generally spread by mosquitoes, specifically _Culex_ mosquitoes, pigs and wild birds, etc. It can be prevented by JE vaccine, which is both safe and effective, and also by avoiding mosquito bites.

[This is the active transmission season for JEV across northeastern and central India, including Madhya Pradesh state. There were JE cases reported earlier in June of this year (2018) in the state. However, cases are much more frequent in northeastern states in India, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Assam.

Avoidance of mosquito bites, as is usually recommended, is prudent, but vaccination is the best protective measure. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Control of vector mosquitoes is logistically difficult and expensive. There is no mention in the report above that the 8 cases had been vaccinated.

Frequently, in reports of JE cases in India, acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of undefined etiology is often mentioned, a minority of those hospitalized. In the 8 cases above, AES is not mentioned in the report above, so, apparently, the JE virus etiology of these 8 cases was laboratory confirmed. - Mod.TY
