During the course of the month of October [2022], in a Livestock Establishment of the Carlos Casares District, there was a sporadic outbreak of bovine anthrax. The general herd consisted of 1010 bovines, but the affected batch was that of heifers made up of 225 bovines, of which 15 died in a period of 12 days, although the animals were vaccinated (almost 11 months had elapsed).

This geographical area, during 2019, also suffered outbreaks of bovine anthrax. The acting veterinarian states that the clinical characteristics of the deaths were not the usual of anthrax since the animals examined were not showing bloodshed through natural openings or splenomegaly. This justified sending a metatarsal bone sample after the 5th death to carry out a bacteriological diagnosis from which _Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated and identified.

The dead animals were covered with lime and nylon over them and in this way (Controlled Covering) they will remain for 260 days until the reduction of organic material is completed. Cremation will then be undergone in place of the residual cadaveric material.

The herd (roundup Rodeo) was vaccinated with Sterne Strain. After 15 days in November [2022] and due to the sudden death of 2 additional bovines from the same batch, the diagnosis was reiterated and _Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated again. The national health authority intervened (SENASA) and applied the regulations Law 3959 in force, evaluating the vaccination of neighboring establishments. The health authority of the Province of Buenos Aires acted in the same way, applying Law 6703/61 and Resolution: MAA115/14, which requires the vaccination of cattle annually.

[The previous outbreak in Carlos Casares in 2019 is described in 4 Jul 2019 Anthrax - Argentina (02): (BA) cattle 20190705.6553661 and nothing unusual was noted. The only consistent pattern is of reluctant vaccination, both had been vaccinated 11 months earlier.

Ramon is very experienced with bovine anthrax in Argentina, and therefore his recognition of an absence of the usual signs -- extravasation of blood from the carcass and a 'normal' spleen -- should be taken as real and significant. This outbreak reminds me of a case seen by Peter Turnbull in the UK of a persistent udder infection with _B. anthracis_, with constant shedding but no other signs, if my memory is correct. Mutations occur, and if we are lucky, we observe them. Our thanks to Ramon for this report and to Susan for her translation. - Mod.MHJ
