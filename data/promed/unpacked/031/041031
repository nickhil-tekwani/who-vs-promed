Abkhazia closes border to stop spread of anthrax from Georgian villages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Rukhi-Natsuluku section of Zugdidi District (on the Abkhaz border) has
been placed under quarantine after several cases of human anthrax were
recorded in the area. The 4 residents of the village of Rukhi who have
contracted the disease are being treated in hospital in Zugdidi, while 30
others are under medical observation.
The authorities of the self-declared republic of Abkhazia officially
announced today that they had closed the Inguri bridge (linking Abkhazia
with the rest of Georgia) yesterday in order to prevent the spread of anthrax.
