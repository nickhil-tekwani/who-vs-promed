Iowa's 1st confirmed case of H5N2 is a turkey farm under contract with Tyson Foods, Inc.

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the US Department of Agriculture confirmed the presence of the virus in a flock of 27 000 turkeys at a commercial turkey farm in Buena Vista County, Iowa. The farm was quarantined, and the birds were culled.

"We test all Tyson-owned birds and any flocks that we purchase from 3rd parties for processing at our plants for the virus before those birds leave the farm, and we know the results before birds are processed," the company said in a statement.

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza (HPAI) in additional commercial turkey flocks in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. No human infections with the virus have been detected at this time. CDC considers the risk to people from these HPAI H5 infections in wild birds, backyard flocks, and commercial poultry, to be low.

USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed HPAI H5N2 in the following states and counties:

Roberts County, South Dakota (15 Apr 2015)
- Central Flyway
- 66 600 turkeys
Kandiyohi County, Minnesota (15 Apr 2015)
- Mississippi Flyway
- 152 000 turkeys
- 5th detection in the county
Stearns County, Minnesota (15 Apr 2015)
- Mississippi Flyway
- 67 000 turkeys
- 6th detection in the county
Otter Tail County, Minnesota (15 Apr 2015)
- Mississippi Flyway
- 21 000 turkeys
- 1st detection in the county
Roseau County, Minnesota (16 Apr 2015)
- Mississippi Flyway
- 26 000 turkeys
- 1st detection in the county
Barron County, Wisconsin (16 Apr 2015)
- Mississippi Flyway
- 126 700 turkeys
- 1st detection in the county

The affected premises have been quarantined and the premises and birds on the property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

Since the beginning of the HPAI H5 outbreaks, USDA has been committed to transparency in announcing these detections. Delivering factual, timely information is a priority for USDA. Because more detections are expected during the Spring migration, USDA will streamline its announcements through daily GovDelivery messages as well as continue posting the new cases on the APHIS website. And In the event of HPAI H5 detections in a new state and/or new flyway or detections of new strains, USDA APHIS will issue only a stakeholder announcement and post the findings on its AI website.

Highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu has struck turkeys on 4 more Minnesota farms plus 1 in South Dakota in an outbreak that has now affected more than 1.7 million Minnesota birds, officials said.

In an update today [17 Apr 2015], the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said that Otter Tail and Roseau counties in Minnesota have been affected for the 1st time. The virus felled birds in a flock of 21 000 turkeys in Otter Tail County, whereas a farm housing 26 000 turkeys was affected in Roseau County.

In addition, Stearns County reported its 6th H5N2 outbreak, in a flock of 67 000 turkeys. And Kandiyohi County logged its 5th outbreak, affecting 152 000 turkeys. Kandiyohi and Stearns are the top turkey-producing counties in Minnesota, while Otter Tail is fifth, according to data from the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. The state leads the nation in turkey production.

Roseau County is in the far northwestern part of the state, adjacent to Canada, marking by far the farthest north incursion of H5N2 in the state to date. Otter Tail, in the central western portion of the state, is also farther north than previous outbreaks.

A total of 14 Minnesota counties have now been affected by 26 farm outbreaks, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH). All told, 1 718 500 Minnesota turkeys have been affected since the outbreak began in the state in early March [2015].

All the Minnesota farms reside on the Mississippi flyway for migratory birds. Experts have said wild birds may play a role in H5N2 spread.

The affected farm in South Dakota, with 66 600 turkeys, is in Roberts County in the far northeast corner of the state, adjoining both Minnesota and North Dakota, which confirmed its first H5N2 outbreak a week ago.

South Dakota has now confirmed 5 H5N2 outbreaks in 5 counties scattered throughout the eastern half of the state. All the outbreaks occurred this month [April 2015], and all the affected farms lie along the Central US flyway.

Today's [17 Apr 2015] APHIS update also notes an outbreak among 126 700 turkeys in Wisconsin's Barron County. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection reported the outbreak yesterday [16 Apr 2015], numbering the flock at an even 126 000.

The APHIS update noted that federal and state authorities will follow the typical outbreak response steps of quarantining affected farms, depopulating flocks, and ensuring that affected poultry do not enter the food system.

H5N2 has also surfaced in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, and Montana since early March [2015], affecting more than 2.4 million poultry in central states. Earlier in the winter it hit several poultry flocks in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. A few detections in wild birds have been reported as well.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is asking successful wild-turkey hunters in the counties at the heart of the H5N2 outbreak -- Kandiyohi, Pope, Meeker, Swift, and Stearns -- to present their downed birds for sample collection starting on 20 Apr 2015.

Hunters can bring their turkeys to one of 4 locations, where officials will take swabs and collect information at hunters' vehicles, and hunters will be able to keep their birds, the DNR said in a press release today. Officials will notify hunters if their birds test positive.

"[Highly pathogenic avian influenza] has not yet been found in wild turkeys, but it has been found in domestic turkeys in these and other Minnesota counties," said Michelle Carstensen, PhD, DNR wildlife health program supervisor. "We chose those 5 counties to enlist the help of hunters because they have sufficient wild turkey populations."

The DNR also recommends that turkey hunters practice good hygiene while field dressing their birds and cook the meat to a safe internal temperature [165 deg F/74 deg C] to destroy any pathogens.

The press release emphasized that H5N2 avian flu is considered a low risk to people and there have been no human cases to date.

The H5N2 avian influenza virus is continuing to hopscotch through the Upper Midwest, as shown today [16 Apr 2015] by a report of Wisconsin's 2nd and 3rd outbreaks, in turkeys and backyard poultry at widely separated sites.

The 2 new outbreaks, combined with previous ones listed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), boost the count of poultry outbreaks of H5N2 in the United States since December [2014] to 43, with most of them having occurred in the Midwest since early March [2015]. 22 outbreaks have been in Minnesota, where more than 1.4 million turkeys have been lost to the virus and control efforts.

In Wisconsin, the virus struck a farm with 126 000 turkeys in the northwestern county of Barron, the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection reported in a statement. It also hit a flock of 40 backyard birds in Juneau County in the west-central part of the state.

Both sites are distant from Wisconsin's 1st outbreak, on a chicken farm in Jefferson County in the southeast, which was reported 3 days ago [13 Apr 2015]. That was the 1st commercial chicken farm to be hit by the virus, which has overwhelmingly favored turkey farms.

Wisconsin authorities said their response to the new outbreaks will follow the standard script, including quarantines of the sites, culling of the surviving birds, and testing of poultry at other sites nearby. "Officials are investigating how the virus entered the flocks and may not have answers for some time," the statement said.

Such answers have eluded investigators of all the H5N2 outbreaks so far. Officials say wild birds such as ducks can carry the virus and shed it in their feces without appearing sick, but scientists have not reported finding the virus in wild birds near any of the recent outbreak sites. The recent outbreaks have occurred in the Central and Mississippi flyways for migratory birds.

H5N2 has surfaced in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, the Dakotas, and Montana since early March [2015], as well as Minnesota and Wisconsin. Earlier in the winter it hit a few poultry flocks in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. A few detections in wild birds have been reported as well.

Meanwhile, poultry producers in the eastern United States are worried about the threat of an H5N2 invasion, according to an Associated Press (AP) report yesterday [15 Apr 2015]. It said the concern is that if the virus isn't already hiding somewhere in the Atlantic flyway, it could spread there when wild ducks fly south for the winter this fall [2015] or return north next spring [2016].

Government scientists speculate that when ducks and other migratory waterfowl from different flyways gather on northern breeding grounds this summer [2015], they could expose each other to the H5N2 virus, and then carry it back south this fall along several migration routes, perhaps including the Atlantic flyway, the story said. The flyway includes several of the country's top poultry producing states, such as Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, Delaware, and Maryland.

Hon Ip, PhD, MS, a microbiologist with the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, told the AP that researchers believe the spread of the Eurasian H5N8 virus from Asia to Europe and North America last year resulted from the mingling of migratory birds in northeastern Russia last summer. The H5N2 virus is a product of reassortment between the Eurasian H5N8 strain and viruses from North American wild birds.

One challenge scientists have in predicting how H5N2 may spread is that they don't have enough surveillance data from wild birds to prove they're the source yet, said Tom DeLiberto, DVM, PhD, assistant director of the USDA's National Wildlife Research Center, according to the AP. He said only 56 wild birds have tested positive for H5N8, H5N2, and a few similar viruses, and most were in the Pacific Northwest. Only 4 or 5 wild birds have tested positive in the Mississippi flyway, he said.

[This disease continues to spread in an almost unbelievably fast fashion. But most notable is the last paragraph of this last article. "Only 4 or 5 wild birds have tested positive in the Mississippi flyway."

I think this kind of data calls into question the notion that this whole disease has spread based solely on wild birds.

As I have said before, other avenues of transporting and spreading the disease need to be examined. - Mod.TG]
