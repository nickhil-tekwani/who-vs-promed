Soldiers cleared of bacterial disease
--------------------------------------
A group of North Queensland soldiers thought to have contracted
leptospirosis have been cleared of the disease. Leptospirosis is a
bacterial disease that can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver
failure, and respiratory distress.
Captain Andrew Bird, from 3rd Brigade headquarters, says a 3rd round of
blood tests on 14 Townsville-based soldiers has come back negative. He
says medical advice is that the soldiers suffered from the effects of a
bacterial disease called scrub typhus, which cause symptoms similar to
dengue fever.
"From what I've been briefed scrub typhus is caused by a mite, which is
normally picked up off the ground, and our soldiers spend a lot of time on
the ground," he said.

[This change in diagnosis illustrates the relatively nonspecific nature of
many infections. Initially thought to be leptospirosis, apparently the
serologic diagnosis of scrub typhus was made.
Scrub typhus is spread to humans as a zoonosis by the bite of the larval
stage of trombiculid mites (chiggers). The term scrub comes from the type
of local vegetation -- scrub -- between forests and cleared areas, where
the vector is found. The disease is also referred to as tsutsugamushi fever.
The organism, _Rickettsia tsutsugamushi_, or _Orientia tsutsugamushi_,
causes natural disease in eastern Asia and in the western Pacific. In any
area, because of high rates of transovarian transmission in the mite,
highly focal areas of high risk exist.
Symptoms are often nonspecific, but severe headache and myalgias (common in
rickettsioses), and an eschar with regional lymphadenopathy, can be helpful
in diagnosis in endemic areas. The diagnosis can be made serologically,
although early treatment (doxycycline) may blunt the antibody response.
Weil and Felix described the classical assay for rickettsial antibody
detection in 1916. The methodology took advantage of heterophilic
(cross-reacting) antigens of members of the genus _Rickettsia_ and several
species of the Gram-negative bacillus Proteus. In the Weil-Felix test,
bacteria of _Proteus vulgaris_ OX-19 agglutinate with sera of the infected
with the typhus group organisms as well as from the Rocky Mountain Spotted
Fever (RMSF) organism _Rickettsia rickettsii_. Cells of _P. vulgaris_ OX-2,
on the other hand, agglutinate with sera from individuals with spotted
fever infection, except RMSF. The OX-19 agglutination is seen in epidemic
typhus, but usually not in Brill-Zinsser recrudescent disease. _P.
mirabilis_ OX-K can be similarly used in the serological diagnosis of scrub
typhus. Because of the relatively poor sensitivity and specificity of this
test, more specific assays can be used for diagnosis, including complement
fixation antibodies. Dip-stick ELISA assays (1) and PCRs (2) have now been
added to potential diagnostic tests.

I would recommend the following textbook as a reference for detailed
clinical descriptions of scrub typhus. I found my copy at a used book
store in New Orleans several years ago:
