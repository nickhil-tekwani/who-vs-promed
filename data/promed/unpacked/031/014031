The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reported 42 cases of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the ongoing outbreak, Jessica Ilunga, spokeswoman for the country's Ministry of Public Health said on [Tue 15 May 2018].

The DRC ministry of health publicly declared the beginning of the EVD epidemic on [8 May 2018].

The World Health Organisation (WHO) in a press statement on [Mon 14 May 2018] said that from [4 Apr to 13 May 2018], a total of 39 Ebola virus disease cases had been reported in DRC, including 19 deaths.

"The latest numbers until [13 May 2018] are: 42 cases, including 2 confirmed; 21 probable and 19 suspected. The majority of the cases are in the health zone of Bikoro; others are reported in the health zones of Iboko and Wangata," Mrs. Ilunga said.

The spokeswoman added that all people with confirmed or suspected EVD would be moved to the Ebola treatment centres as soon as the facilities were ready. Mrs. Ilunga stated that a key feature of the government's response to the current Ebola outbreak would be vaccination.

This will be the first time that DRC includes vaccination in its national EVD response plan.

The spokeswoman noted that government was trying to prevent the spread of EVD by carrying out screening tests at the airports and other entry points to Mbandaka, capital of the Equateur Province. The Ebola-hit Bikoro, Iboko, and Wangata health zones are located in the Equateur province. "In order to prevent the spread of the virus to the neighbouring urban centres, the ministry has set up surveillance checks at all entry points of the city of Mbandaka. Now our health agents monitor the temperature of all people travelling to and from Mbandaka by air, sea and land.

Furthermore, the ministry is working with health authorities in other urban centres near Mbandaka, including Kinshasa and Kisangani, to prepare contingency plans in these cities as well," Ilunga said.

[Mbandaka is a port city of 1.2 million people. "The possibility of the virus spreading is huge," says virologist Yap Boum, who works with Doctors Without Borders (MSF) noting that while Ebola is incubating undetected--which can take several weeks--the victim is already infectious. - Mod LK]

Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on [Tue 15 May 2017] issued a travel warning for the Democratic Republic of Congo, citing a new outbreak of the Ebola virus there.

In its Level 2 travel advisory, the CDC cautioned against travel to the affected areas and urged people to stay away from wildlife if such visits cannot be avoided and to take preventative measures against infection. ...-more

Citing the World Health Organization, he said that although the outbreaks were limited to remote areas, there was no way of determining the scope of the problem because of the scant epidemiological and demographic information in the African country.

Under the CDC's 3-tier system, a Level 3 travel advisory warns against all non-essential travel to the listed areas, Level 2 urges travelers to the affected areas to be on their guard against infection, and Level 1 advises travelers to take precautions.

Gabon, where Ebola has already arisen many times and killed many people in the past, has taken seriously the threat of a possible spread of the epidemic from the DRC. The country has decided to reactivate its Ebola Response Committee to be ready. ...-more

Gabon has also raised the alert with the National Agency of National Parks (ANPN), responsible for raising awareness of the population to take action in case they find dead animals in the forest: "Sick animals, including the gorilla can be found dead and people may eat them. We said that any type of animal found dead in the forest must be reported in order to inform us and investigate it."

The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has directed Nigerian airlines, especially those operating international and regional destinations, to be vigilant in the screening of passengers before they are allowed to board flights to the country. This is aimed at preventing travellers who have Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) from coming to Nigeria.

NCAA gave the directive in a circular with ref no. NCAA/DG/AMS/Vol.1/196, dated [11 May 2018] and dispatched to all operating airlines. In the circular, the regulatory authority informed the domestic operators of the outbreak of EVD in the Democratic Republic of Congo on 8 May 2018.

[Instructions are provided how the pilot should proceed in any suspected case of communicable disease aboard the aircraft - see URL.

The agency also directed airlines to refresh the knowledge of their crew members in the handling and communicating with ATC of any suspected case of communicable disease on board, or any suspected infected human remains].

The epidemic of Ebola presents risks, according to the WHO representative in the Congo, Dr. Fatoumata Binta Diallo, for some departments of the Congo. -Brazzaville and some countries in the region.

"The epidemic has erupted in Equateur; the localities of Mbandaka and Bikoro are very close to the Likouala department, specifically the city of Liranga. As such, the WHO has declared some countries at very high risk. These are the Congo, the Central African Republic, all those countries that are bordering the DRC and especially this area [Congo]. We are on full alert, we are already in a position to prepare and respond quickly,..."she said.

The Equateur region in the DRC is bordering the department of Likouala. The 2 regions, whose populations exchange daily, are separated by the Ubangi River which leads to the Central African Republic.

"We have identified, in our country, the risky departments that are the Likouala, the Cuvette, the Plateaux, the Pool, even Brazzaville," said the representative of WHO in Congo. "For this, we reactivated the coordinating committee for the fight against epidemics that brings together the representatives of the departments involved and different partners " she added.

The contingency plan provides, among other things, for case management; to strengthen hygiene measures, epidemiological surveillance, mobilization, information and communication.

[Bikoro is in a very remote area of a country that has poor road infrastructure; it is situated on a lake connecting the highly trafficked Congo and Ubangi rivers. From there, people infected with Ebola can hop boats to major cities like the DRC's capital Kinshasa or nearby Brazzaville -- a potential public health nightmare officials are trying to prevent quickly.

Brazzaville, city (commune), capital, and river port of the Republic of the Congo and former capital of French Equatorial Africa, is situated on the north bank of the Congo River below Malebo (Stanley) Pool, across from Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its population is estimated to exceed 1.8 million. Over a third of the population of the Republic of Congo lives in the capital.

[Summary of key points on vaccine from report. - Mod LK]
Vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV, first tested in 2015 in the waning months of the massive Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Ira Longini, a biostatistician at the University of Florida who helped run that trial, notes that 7500 people were given the vaccine.

A total of 4000 doses of the vaccine have been shipped to the DRC -- with another 4000 to follow soon. The World Health Organization is coordinating the vaccination effort.

Ring vaccination protocol being applied. The vaccine was found to be 100 percent effective for those who received it. Even if everyone in the ring is not vaccinated, the trial showed a cut in overall transmission by about 75 percent.

Vaccine is still awaiting licensing, so governments need to give special permission for it to be used. Merck, which produces the vaccine, will be donating it. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the British-based charity the Wellcome Trust, and the British government have jointly contributed $4 million to carry out the campaign.

[It should be noted that vaccines will also be administered to local and international health care workers and front-line workers in affected areas as well as the regions expected to be at risk should the outbreak continue to spread (See ProMED Ebola update (08): summary, emergency plan, vaccine, roads 20180515.5797415). This is key to protection of vulnerable individuals working to control Ebola virus transmission in the population, even if they have available to them personal protective equipment. - Mod.LK]

During the West Africa outbreak, researchers -- from the World Health Organization, Guinea's Ministry of Health, Public Health England, and other international partners -- worked together to help set up a clinical trial to test the vaccine. In 2015, they published striking preliminary results in the Lancet, showing that everyone who got the shot immediately after contact with an Ebola victim didn't get the virus.

A year later [2016], they unveiled their final results, also in the Lancet, and they were just as amazing. The vaccine was tested in nearly 12 000 people in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Among the 5837 people who got the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded. By comparison, there were 23 cases in the control group that had not gotten the vaccine.

In 2016, the public-private vaccine partnership GAVI paid Merck to stockpile doses of the vaccine, and helped fund Merck's regulatory effort to collect more data on the shot and get it approved.

To date [May 2018], health officials have never been able to deploy the vaccine quickly enough at the start of an outbreak. Just last year [2017], an outbreak of Ebola inthe DRC ended before the vaccine needed to be given out.

This year [2018] is different. At the request of the DRC's government, the vaccine is about to have its 1st early field test at the outbreak's epicenter in Bikoro, in the country's northwest Équateur province.

"In our experience, for each confirmed case of Ebola there are about 100-150 contacts and contacts of contacts eligible for vaccination," [WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic] said. "So it means this 1st shipment would be probably enough for around 25-26 rings - each around one confirmed case."

The outbreak was 1st spotted in the Bikoro zone, which has 31 of the cases and 274 contacts. There have also been 8 cases and 115 contacts in Iboko health zone.

The WHO report said 1500 sets of personal protective equipment and an emergency sanitary kit sufficient for 10 000 people for 3 months were being put in place.
