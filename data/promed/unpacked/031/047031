Specified risk material found in Irish beef
--------------------------------------------
Specified risk material (SRM) has been found in a consignment of boxed
bone-in beef from the Republic of Ireland. SRM is that part of the animal
most likely to contain BSE infectivity. Under European law, SRM must be
removed and disposed of safely.
The SRM breach was discovered during an inspection by the Meat Hygiene
Service (MHS) on 21 Nov 2002. A consignment of 56 loins of beef were each
found to contain vertebral column. Vertebral column from bovine animals
aged over 12 months (including dorsal root ganglia but excluding the
vertebrae of the tail and the transverse process of the lumbar vertebrae)
is SRM and must be removed when the beef is cut into pieces smaller than a
quarter carcass.
The consignment was unloaded at Norish Foodcare Ltd, a licensed coldstore
in Brierley Hill, West Midlands. The receiving company was not responsible
for the problem.
The vertebral column should have been removed when the meat was being cut
up at the Irish cutting plant, Vanstar Ireland Ltd in Jamestown, Co
Leitrim, before its dispatch to the UK.
This is the 39th SRM breach found in non-UK origin beef since 01 Jan 2001
and the sixth case involving Irish beef. However, it is only the second
case concerning vertebral column in boxed beef. All the other cases
involved spinal cord.
In Ireland, 24 animals out of 383 918 healthy animals tested positive for
BSE during the period January - September 2002.
The entire consignment in this latest case has been detained under the
Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations (1996) for
disposal under the supervision of the MHS. The Chief Veterinary Officer for
Ireland and the European Commission have been notified of this breach.

Plant illegally burned BSE-infected carcases
--------------------------------------------
Politicians yesterday called for an inquiry into the use of animal
incinerators across Scotland after hearing warnings that they could be
illegally burning BSE-infected carcasses. The move comes after it emerged
that one incinerator in Glasgow had burned 2 BSE carcasses even though it
was not licensed to do so.
Yesterday, Ross Finnie, the environment minister, confirmed that the
burnings had taken place at the Carntyne plant, which local residents are
campaigning to have closed down. Homeowners in the city's East End have
voiced concerns about health issues arising from the incinerator's
operation and have raised the subject in a petition to the Scottish
Parliament. Now the Parliament's environment committee has backed a report
from one of its members calling for a review of the issue north of the Border.
Only 2 plants in Scotland are allowed to burn BSE-infected carcasses while
permission for the other 6, including Carntyne, rule this out. But as tests
on cattle for BSE can take between 10 and 14 days, most carcasses are
burned before the results come back.
Mr Finnie told the committee reporter yesterday that this situation has led
to 2 known incidents in which BSE-infected cattle have been burned at
Carntyne between September 2001 and March 2002.
The plant, which reopened after a 4-year closure in May 2002, had
originally been licensed to burn BSE-infected cattle, but was forced to
stop after the previous owner, Westcot Hides, breached government
regulations on emissions.
The report, outlined to MSPs [Members of Scottish parliament] on the Mound
yesterday, said it was believed that plants across Scotland were
"circumventing planning conditions".
The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), the environmental
watchdog, had already responded by setting incinerator temperatures at 850C
to destroy the BSE prion, the report added. It stated: "There is little
merit setting a planning condition that the planning authority cannot
enforce and which in practice SEPA enforces. The reporter therefore
recommends that SEPA should have a statutory role in the process for
regulating BSE."
The report continued: "The reporter recommends that SEPA should assume that
all animal carcass incinerators in Scotland may be burning BSE-infected
cattle and license and regulate incinerators on that basis."
More than 47 500 people lived within a one-mile radius of the Carntyne
incinerator, which is thought to be the only one in the UK to operate in an
urban area. There are 117 schools and colleges, 12 nursery schools, 2
hospitals, 23 nursing homes, and 34 health centres as well as doctors'
surgeries within the area.
Last year, 5 months after the plant was reopened, it was forced to close
for 3 months following complaints from residents that the smell and ash
from there was affecting them.
However, Sacone Environmental, which runs the Carntyne plant, was granted
permission by SEPA to burn cattle again just before last Christmas. No one
from Sacone Environmental was available for comment last night.

Restaurant managers held over UK beef imports
----------------------------------------------
French prosecutors yesterday detained 4 senior managers of the Buffalo
Grill restaurant chain under suspicion of illegally importing British beef
infected with mad cow disease.
Among those being held in custody for questioning were Christian Picart,
chief executive. The others were the head of the company's purchasing arm
and 2 managers from its Districoupe unit, which supplies meat to the
group's 260 restaurants across Europe.
They were detained as part of a 2-year judicial inquiry to investigate
complaints of "manslaughter, involuntary injury, and placing the lives of
others in danger" from victims of CJD, the human variant of BSE, or mad cow
disease.
In France 4 people have died from CJD, and a fifth person is believed to
have the disease. There have been 117 confirmed and probable deaths in
Britain from CJD.
France banned imports of British beef in 1996. The ban was lifted in
October 2002, more than 2 years after the European Union had lifted its
ban, prompting Britain to take France to the European Court of Justice.
There have been suspicions that cheap British beef found its way on to the
French market in the early period after the ban was imposed.
French police are understood to have found that 2 of the victims of CJD
regularly dined at Buffalo Grill restaurants. The company denied it had
illegally imported beef. "A group as big as ours cannot allow itself to do
that. It would be suicidal and fatal."

BSE meat may be riskier to humans than first thought
----------------------------------------------------
New research suggesting that the risk of catching variant CJD from the meat
of infected cattle and sheep may be higher than previously believed is to
be examined by government scientific experts.
Professor Stanley Prusiner, the American scientist who first discovered
prions, the proteins suspected of causing the fatal brain illness, has
disclosed that mice infected with scrapie have been found to have
unexpectedly high levels of prions in their muscles.
Professor Prusiner said this raised the "obvious worry" that cows and sheep
could be similarly affected. Scrapie is a brain disease of sheep similar to
BSE, which causes vCJD in humans.
The Department of Health said yesterday that all new research into vCJD and
BSE was assessed by its committees of experts, principally the Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory Committee [SEAC]. "We would ask them to assess the
validity of any new findings, including tests, before we decide how we
ought to respond to them," a spokeswoman said.
Until now, levels of prions in infected cow and sheep meat and muscle
tissue were always believed to be low enough to make them safe. Dangerous
levels are only normally found in the brain and spinal cords of animals.
However, the new tests being pioneered at the University of California in
San Francisco are far more sensitive and have discovered higher
concentrations than have previously been found. While describing the
findings as significant, Professor Prusiner has stressed that the levels
are still a hundredfold less than those found in brains. But as the
scientist who received the Nobel prize for his discovery of prions,
Professor Prusiner's work will be treated with considerable respect.
There is no clear scientific evidence yet that, however high the prion
level is, the meat and muscle tissue is likely to infect consumers. Others
tests where different types of infected animal body parts are injected into
rats have shown that while brain and spinal cord do cause the animals to
develop vCJD, meat and muscle tissue do not.
Professor Prusiner also called for testing of everyone in Britain to
establish the true extent of the disease, which has killed 117 people since
1995. Some estimates have put the eventual death toll at 100 000. He also
argued for testing of all cows and sheep entering the food chain, since
many were being slaughtered before they showed any symptoms.
Currently, the only accurate tests for vCJD are on brain and spinal tissue
and can only be made after death. Scientists are working on blood tests to
enable mass screening, but these are still some way from being confirmed
for use.
The Government would tread carefully before launching a mass screening
programme. Although resolving the uncertainty at the heart of the vCJD
controversy would help health service planning, it would cause alarm among
those found to be incubating a disease that can take up to 40 years to
develop and could lead to compensation claims. Tests would help to prevent
those with the disease from infecting others through surgical instruments
or blood donations.

[SEAC, established 10 years ago, is required to provide scientifically
based advice to relevant official authorities, including the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the Department of Health (MOH)
and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) on matters relating to spongiform
encephalopathies, taking into account the input of other bodies with
related responsibilities. This experts' committee is composed of 13
members, including 3 scientists from other countries (Australia,
Switzerland, and the USA). SEAC's current (since August 2001) chairman is
Peter G Smith, Professor of Tropical Epidemiology at the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Prof Stanley Prusiner's advice has been
sought by SEAC on various TSE-related issues. The research mentioned by
Prof Prusiner has been published by P.J.Bosque et al in Proc Natl Acad Sci
U S A 2002 Mar 19;99(6):3812-7. The abstract can be seen at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11904434&dopt=Abstract>.
One of the other issues discussed during the recent SEAC meeting in London
(14 Nov 2002) was an FSA-funded project that seeks to determine whether
infectious prions can be detected in the milk of cattle experimentally
infected with the BSE agent. The final report, conclusions and
recommendations of this important research, which started in Sep 2000, are
expected at the end of 2004. SEAC will hold its next periodic meeting on 11
Feb 2003. Information on SEAC meetings and relevant documents can be found at
