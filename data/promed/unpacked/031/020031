An infant has been hospitalized at Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center in Bnei Brak [Tel Aviv district], after the 3-week-old baby was diagnosed with the measles.

The hospital confirms that the 3-week-old infant contracted the disease from his mother, who was not vaccinated, and was diagnosed with measles. The mother likely caught the measles from another family member who was also not vaccinated.

This is the youngest person to be hospitalized with the measles in Israel.

According to a 9-month study conducted by Israel's Ministry of Health, cities with large haredi populations suffered the highest number of measles cases in an outbreak that has infected thousands of people.

Of the 2040 cases of measles reported in the last 9 months, 874 cases occurred in Jerusalem, 266 in Beit Shemesh, 149 in Tzfat, 97 in Bnei Brak, and 95 in Beitar Illit.

Israel's 2nd-most populous city, Tel Aviv, recorded 52 cases, while the small ultra-Orthodox community of Or HaGanuz in the north reported 22. Kiryat Ye'arim, an ultra-Orthodox town near Jerusalem, suffered 19 cases.

Just 2 patients were reported in Haifa, Israel's 3rd-largest city, and only 4 in Rishon Letzion, Israel's 4th-largest city.

The Health Ministry's data showed that 614 patients were aged 1-4 years old; 399 between the ages of 5 and 9; 358 infants under the age of 1; and 265 between ages 10 and 19, meaning that 80 percent of the cases were reported in patients aged 19 and younger.

Jerusalem has attempted to stop the spread of measles by expanding the opening hours of children's health clinics, with special ambulances being dispatched to haredi neighborhoods to make vaccination as convenient as possible.

Madagascar has been experiencing a measles outbreak since early October 2018. The outbreak started in the urban health district of Antananarivo Renivohitra (in the heart of the capital city, Antanarivo) on 4 Oct 2018, when 3 measles cases were confirmed at the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar (IPM) by serology. The disease then spread to other health districts (Tanà South, Tanà North, and Ambohidratrimo) in Analamanga region (where the capital city is located) and subsequently to other parts of the country. The Ministry of Public Health formally declared the measles outbreak on 26 Oct 2018.

As of 18 Nov 2018, a total of 3239 measles cases have been reported, of which 182 were confirmed immunoglobulin M (IgM) positive and 3057 were epidemiologically linked. No deaths have been reported to date. A total of 23 districts (out of 114) in 12 regions (out of 22) are currently in epidemic phase. The urban health district of Antananarivo-Renivohitra is the most affected, accounting for 84% (2730) of all reported cases. The other health districts with high numbers of cases are Ambatondratrimo (6%, 200), Antananarivo-Atsimondrano (3%, 91).

The remaining health districts have fewer cases. The current measles outbreak has occurred at a time when there is some resurgence of plague in the country, straining the public health response system. The ongoing political election, with the risks of social tensions and conflict, has also downgraded the response to these public health events. (WHO, 23 Nov 2018)

[It is interesting that a paper published in June 2018 looking at measles outbreak risk in Madagascar concluded: "Combining ... estimates of the age profile of immunity in the population with an age-structured model of transmission, we further predicted the risk of a measles outbreak and the impact of mitigation strategies designed around supplementary immunization activities. The direct and indirect estimates of age-specific seroprevalence show that current measles susceptibility is over 10%, and modeling suggests that Madagascar may be at risk of a major measles epidemic."

This is exactly what has happened several months after this publication was released.

Local health personnel were dispatched to a remote mountain village in Malapatan [Sarangani province] town to contain a measles outbreak which killed at least 20 people and hospitalized 100 others.

Gov. Steve Solon said medical personnel from the Provincial Health Office have been deployed to Barangay Upper Suyan in Malapatan town where some 20 children have died due to measles while 100 others were hospitalized over the past weeks.

Boyet Ogan, village chief of Barangay Upper Suyan, said the outbreak of the disease was detected during the first week of this month when 3 children died after they were afflicted with measles.

He said right after the death of the 1st victims, several measles-stricken victims in several far-flung sitios have also died the following weeks.

The municipal health office of Malapatan town is still conducting assessment on the extent of the affected areas since Barangay Uper Suyan is a remote village located at the boundary of Sarangani and Davao Occidental.

Rescue and emergency teams had to walk for several hours before they reach the area which is a known bailiwick of the New People's Army.
