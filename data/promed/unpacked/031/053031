In the Region of the Americas, between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 21 of 2020 [1 Jan-23 May 2020], a total of 1 645 678 cases of arboviral disease were reported. Of those, 1600 947 (97.3%) were dengue cases, 37 279 were chikungunya cases, and 7 452 were Zika cases (figure 1 [all figures available at the source URL above]).

In the Region of the Americas, the total number of cases of arboviral disease reported in 2020 as of EW 21 of 2020 represents an approximate 10% relative decrease compared with the same period in 2019, which was an epidemic year (figure 2).

Between EW 1 and EW 21 of 2020, a total of 7452 cases of Zika have been reported, including one death (reported in Brazil), in the Region of the Americas.

The highest proportions of cases in the Region were reported in the following countries: Brazil with 6387 cases (86% of cases in the Region), Bolivia with 537 cases (8.4%), and Guatemala with 133 cases (2%). Since its 1st detection in Brazil in March of 2015, local transmission of Zika has been confirmed in all countries and territories in the Americas, except for continental Chile, Uruguay, and Canada. In 2016, a total of 651 590 cases were reported, and a significant reduction in transmission was observed in [subsequent] years (figure 5 [Distribution of reported cases of Zika by epidemiological week. Region of the Americas, 2019-2020 (up to EW 21 of 2020)]).

- Ireland (Dublin): congenital, ex Brazil. 11 Jun 2020. (confirmed) 1st baby born in Ireland with congenital Zika infection. The baby's mother was in her native Brazil during the 1st trimester of pregnancy; Zika virus was detected in her blood at 11 weeks into her pregnancy but was no longer detected at 31 weeks' gestation. At birth, the baby was diagnosed with severe microcephaly, but the examination was otherwise normal. At 14 months the baby developed epilepsy, quadriplegic cerebral palsy, visual impairment, and showed severe global developmental delay.

[2] Brazil: antibody decline
Date: Thu 18 Jun 2020

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus within the Flaviviridae family. After decades of circulation in Asia, ZIKV was introduced to Brazil in 2014-2015, associated with a rise in congenital malformations. Unlike the genetically related dengue virus (DENV), ZIKV constitutes only one serotype. Although assumed that ZIKV infection may engender lifelong immunity, the long-term kinetics of ZIKV antibody responses are unclear. We assessed long-term kinetics of ZIKV NS1-IgG response in 144 individuals from 3 different subpopulations: HIV patients, tuberculosis patients and healthy individuals first tested in 2016 and retested 1.5-2 years after the 2015-2016 ZIKV epidemic in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, using a widely distributed NS1-based commercial ELISA. The seropositivity in 2016 reached 59.0% (85/144, 95% confidence interval (CI) 50.7-66.7%), and decreased to 38.6% (56/144, CI 31.3-47.0%) 1.5-2 years later. In addition, the median ZIKV NS1-ELISA reactivity for individuals that remained positive in both timepoints significantly decreased from a ratio of 4.4 (95% CI 3.8-5.0) to 1.6 (95% CI 1.6-1.9) over the 2-year interval (Z: - 6.1; p  less than  0.001) irrespective of the subpopulation analyzed. Initial 2016 DENV antibody response was non-significant between groups, suggesting comparable DENV background. The high 20.6% seroreversion suggest that widely used serologic tests may fail to account a considerable proportion of past ZIKV infections in flavivirus endemic countries. In addition, ZIKV immunity might be shorter-lived than previously thought, which may contribute to local ZIKV resurgence once individual immune responses wane sufficiently to reduce community protective immunity in addition to birth and migration.

[This report raises 2 important questions: does the decline in Zika antibody reflect a decline in immunity (and reappearance of susceptibility)? Or does it reflect a lower level of sensitivity of the commercial ELISA test used in the study? It would be interesting to see a comparison of ELISA titers with the sensitive and specific plaque-reduction neutralization test. The important question is if the individuals whose antibody titers decreased were again susceptible to Zika virus infection. It would be interesting to monitor the individuals in the study to determine if they become infected again. - Mod.TY]

[3] Microcephaly and collagen
Date: Thu 25 Jun 2020

Zika virus can hamper vital collagen development in the brains of babies whose mothers were infected with the disease while pregnant, new research reveals, as the search for a vaccine continues. Collagen is crucial to the circulatory system, as it regulates the compression of blood vessels. A large amount of the collagen found in the human brain is located inside vein tissue. The research findings could explain the deaths of babies with microcephaly, a birth defect that causes a baby to be born with a smaller head and often smaller brains that may not have developed properly.

"In a previous study we saw that mothers with a rare mutation in their collagen genes had more chances of having babies with microcephaly if they got infected with Zika virus. In this study we found out the virus affects collagen-forming genes in fetuses," says Renato Aguiar, a researcher at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and lead author of the study, published in Science Signaling [9 Jun 2020]. "These 2 factors combined lead to very severe cases of congenital Zika syndrome and infant death."

In early 2015 Brazil experienced a Zika virus outbreak and 6 months later the association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly was reported, the World Health Organization says. Outbreaks and evidence of transmission have appeared throughout the Americas, Africa, and other regions of the world.

This year [2020], Brazil's Ministry of Health has been notified of more than 3500 probable Zika virus cases.

[The abstract of the report that the above article draws on states, "We observed that collagens were greatly reduced in expression in CZS [congenital Zika syndrome] brains at both the RNA and protein levels and that neonates with CZS had several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in collagen-encoding genes that are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta and arthrogryposis. These findings were validated by immunohistochemistry and comparative analysis of collagen abundance in ZIKV-infected and uninfected samples. In addition, we showed a ZIKV-dependent increase in the expression of cell adhesion factors that are essential for neurite outgrowth and axon guidance, findings that are consistent with the neuronal migration defects observed in CZS. Together, these findings provide insights into the underlying molecular alterations in the ZIKV-infected brain and reveal host genes associated with CZS susceptibility."

[4] African lineage comes to Brazil

[published online ahead of print, 2020 Jun 1]. Int J Infect Dis. 2020; S1201-9712(20)30397-0. doi:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.090
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
- The Brazilian sequence ZIKV lineage proportion changed across 5 years.
- The automated surveillance system helps identify ZIKV molecular epidemiology.
- A new lineage emerged in Brazil and could be a potential risk of a new epidemic.

Abstract
--------
There is currently no system to track the emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) subtypes. We developed a surveillance system able to retrieve sequence submissions and further classify distinct ZIKV genotypes in the world. This approach was able to detect a new occurrence of ZIKV from an African lineage in Brazil in 2019.

[Results and discussion]
------------------------
Our approach also identified the emergence of 5.4% of all sequences from 2019 classified as African lineage (in January and in May). The difference in the distribution of these proportions over time was statistically significant, revealing a substantial change in ZIKV sequence submissions (figure 1B). These African lineages were isolated from 2 different regions of Brazil: South, from the Rio Grande do Sul (Almeida et al, 2020) and Southeast, from Rio de Janeiro (Alencar et al, 2020) and were from 2 different sources: one was isolated from the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito species (Alencar et al, 2020) and the other from _Alouatta guariba_, a monkey species (Almeida et al, 2020). The geographic distance between these 2 different regions of Brazil is more than 1500 km [932 mi]. The distinct localities and different sources of isolation are of concern and suggest that this African lineage could have already been circulating in Brazil for a significant period. Note that the phylogenetic-based typing tool confirmed the classification.

[This report provides evidence that an African lineage of Zika virus had become established in Brazil in at least 2 locations. With the Almeida et al. (reference below) finding that lineage in 9 howler monkeys they raise the possibility that this Zika virus lineage is maintained in a sylvan (forest) transmission cycle involving the monkeys in much the same way that yellow fever is in Brazil. That means that eradication of Zika virus there will not be possible with currently available technology. This is not good news.
