Warning - Health Hazard Alert - Gefilte fish may contain dangerous bacteria
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is warning the public not to
consume gefilte fish sold at Sobeys retail store located at 441 Clark Ave.
West, Toronto, Ontario, because these products may contain the bacteria
responsible for botulism, a foodborne illness in humans.
The affected products are sold in an aluminium foil tray enclosed in a
rectangular box bearing a Hebrew label and an English ingredient list. All
product codes are affected by this alert.
The following information appears with the English ingredient list;
Gefilte Fish, 4 pcs, 400 g, Kosher for Passover (Parve), product of Israel,
UPC 7 290002 475019, and Gefilte Fish, 2 pcs, 350 g, Kosher for Passover
(Parve), UPC 7 290002 475033
The importer, B.H. Kosher Products, Montreal, Quebec, is voluntarily
recalling the affected products from the marketplace.
Botulism is a life-threatening illness caused by the build-up of toxins
produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. Food contaminated with _C.
botulinum_ will not look or smell spoiled. Consumers should dispose of the
remaining product immediately or return products to the point of purchase
for a refund. There have been no reported illnesses associated with the
consumption of these products.
The CFIA is monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.
For more information, consumers and industry can call the CFIA at one of the
following numbers:
In the province of Quebec 1-800-561-3350;
or
In other provinces and territories 1-800-442-2342.
