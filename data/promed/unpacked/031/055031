Panic hit the outskirts of Paraguay's capital Asuncion Wednesday [13
Feb 2008] as thousands of people raced to get yellow fever
vaccinations after 2 cases, one of them fatal, were uncovered [near]
the city.

The Health Ministry's Sanitary Surveillance Director Gualberto Pinanez
said Wednesday [13 Feb 2008] that the 2 "urbanized" yellow fever cases
"can almost be confirmed" in San Lorenzo, 20 km from Asuncion.

On 8 Jan 2008, a San Lorenzo resident [man], 25, died from apparent
yellow fever and his neighbor, [a woman], 39, is seriously ill at
Asuncion's Clinics Hospital, suffering from similar symptoms.

If confirmed, these would be the first 2 "urban" yellow fever cases in
the country [and in South America. - Mod.JW].

Paraguay's Health Ministry has recognized 5 yellow fever cases since
early 2008, but all of them occurred in rural districts of the San
Pedro (central) state. Additionally, a farmer from the same region
died in early February [2008] at a hospital in Asuncion with yellow
fever symptoms, but the final official results are yet to be announced.

The cases spread fear among residents in the neighborhood of Laurelty,
San Lorenzo, Wednesday [13 Feb 2008]. In response, the authorities
dispatched a number of medical brigades to vaccinate people who live
within a one-km radius of the victims' homes. But the vaccines ran
out within a few hours due to the massive demand.

Paraguay's Health Ministry's Immunization director Victor Caceres
moved to reassure the residents, saying that around 700 000 doses will
come from Brazil and Peru within a few days, and the Pan American
Health Organization (OPS) also promised to provide vaccines.

Meanwhile, Paraguay's Health Vice Minister Antonio Barrios called on
residents to help fight yellow fever by destroying the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito's breeding places, as they spread [YF] as well as dengue.
Barrios said there are a lot of those breeding places in many
neighborhoods of Asuncion, according to data obtained from dengue
surveys. There was an outbreak of dengue in 2007, with 27 000 infected
people and 17 deaths.

[Urban YF is YF that is transmitted in a town or city by the urban
mosquito vector _Aedes aegypti_. The other cases in Paraguay (and in
Brazil so far) have all been infected in rural areas. It is hard to
see how a vaccine that will arrive "within a few days" and takes 10
days to produce its full effect will do anything to stop this urban
epidemic if it has already started. Cities in Brazil and Argentina,
take note and be prepared.

Regarding statements in the media that the last YF deaths in Paraguay
were in 1904, Paraguay informed WHO that it had 9 cases, 3 of them
fatal, in 1974 - see:
