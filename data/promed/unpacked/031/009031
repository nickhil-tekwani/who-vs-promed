Genetically modified poliovirus and herpes simplex virus destroy gliomas
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that vaccination has almost wiped out poliomyelitis, scientists may be
able to harness the much-feared poliovirus to eradicate virtually
untreatable brain tumors. Researchers at Duke University in the United
States have genetically modified poliovirus to stop its devastating effects
on normal human cells, but the modified virus can still enter and destroy
cancer cells. In experiments in mice, a single injection of the genetically
modified poliovirus destroyed entire glioma tumors within days. In humans,
gliomas respond poorly to surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; life
expectancy from diagnosis is usually about one year.
Mathias Gromeier presented [these findings] at the American Society for
Microbiology in Orlando, Florida, on Mon 21 May 2001. He said: "The virus
had very surprising properties. It had lost its ability to cause
poliomyelitis in humans [mice?], but retained excellent killing potential
for malignant glioma cells." The virus not only worked when injected
directly into the brain, but also apparently had the ability to migrate to
the brain even when injected into other parts of the body.
A team in Scotland led by Professor Moira Brown at the Southern General
Hospital in Glasgow has treated gliomas with herpes simplex virus - the
type normally associated with cold sores. Their virus has been genetically
modified to prevent it from replicating in normal human cells, but allowing
it to do so in tumor cells. Unlike the Duke University work, the herpes
simplex virus research is more advanced, with human trials well underway.
So far, results have been encouraging, with a number of patients surviving
far beyond what would normally be expected for glioma. Professor Brown
said: "Glioma is a cancer which is very hard to treat, and there is very
little else we can do for these patients. In the first trial, we treated 9
patients, and 3 of them are still alive, and now we are treating another 12
patients."

[These reports illustrate that genetic modification of viruses can have
beneficial as well as potentially hazardous consequences. Nonetheless,
these developments could have implications for the surveillance and control
of infectious diseases in the community, if, say, a modified poliovirus was
introduced into therapy prior to successful conclusion of the campaign for
global eradication of wild strains of poliovirus. - Mod.CP]
