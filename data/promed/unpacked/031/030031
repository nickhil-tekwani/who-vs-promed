Monkeypox Infections In Animals: Interim Guidance for Veterinarians and Pet
Owners
------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been working
closely with state and local health department and other partners to
investigate cases of monkeypox virus infection among humans who had direct
or close contact with recently purchased ill prairie dogs, a Gambian
rat, and a rabbit that was housed in a veterinary clinic with an ill
prairie dog.

As of 7 Jun 2003, at least 6 persons with probable monkeypox infection have
been reported to be veterinarians or staff at veterinary hospitals.

Human monkeypox is a rare zoonotic viral disease that occurs primarily in
the rain forest countries of central and west Africa. In humans, the
illness produces a vesicular and pustular rash similar to that produced by
smallpox.

The incubation period from exposure to fever onset is about 12 days. In
humans, case-fatality ratios in Africa have ranged from 1 to 10 percent
(for additional information about monkeypox, see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3/hutin.htm>).

These interim guidelines will be updated as new information becomes
available and after consultation with additional public health partners.

In the current outbreak, illness in animals has been reported to include
fever, cough, blepharoconjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, followed by a
nodular rash. Some animals have died while others reportedly recovered.

The types of animals that may become ill with monkeypox are currently
unknown; as a precaution, all mammals should be considered susceptible at
this time.

Pet owners who suspect their animal may have an illness compatible with
monkeypox should immediately isolate the animal from humans and other
animals and contact their state or local health department. In most cases,
evaluation by a veterinarian will be recommended. Owners should notify the
veterinarian before transporting the animal to the clinic so that
appropriate infection control precautions can be implemented prior to arrival.

Owners should consider wearing a mask and gloves when handling the animal.
The animals bedding should be collected and bagged and brought with the
animal to the veterinary clinic for disposal as medically regulated waste.

Soiled bedding should not be disposed of as household trash. Following
identification of an animal with suspect monkeypox in a household, any
animals (including dogs and cats) who may have come in contact with the
sick animal should be closely observed for signs of illness for a period of
1 month following the last date of exposure. Contaminated household
surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. Standard household
cleaning/disinfectants may be used in accordance with manufacturers
instructions.

Transport of the ill animal to a veterinary clinic should be done by a
single individual to limit unnecessary exposure. At the time of animal
transport, the owner should also transport the sick animals bagged bedding
for disposal. Care should be taken to minimize driver exposure during
transport. During transport animals should be confined in a closed
container such as a cardboard box. If available, the animal should be
confined in a separate compartment of the vehicle, such as the bed of a
pickup truck. Following transport, the area of the vehicle where the animal
was confined should be cleaned and disinfected. Standard household
cleaning/disinfectants may be used in accordance with the manufacturers
instructions.

Veterinarians examining sick prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or other
mammals that may have come in contact with a suspected monkeypox case,
should consider the diagnosis of monkeypox infection. Animals that
currently appear healthy but have been implicated as a probable source of
infection for a human case should also be treated as a suspected case of
monkeypox. All suspected cases of monkeypox in animals should be reported
immediately to state or local health department officials.

Veterinarians who have been notified of an arriving animal with suspected
monkeypox should admit the animal through a separate entrance to a private
room and place it in isolation; the animal should not be admitted to an
open waiting room.

When examining or euthanizing sick rodents, lagomorphs, and exotic pets,
especially prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or any ill mammal known to
have been in contact with a case of monkeypox, the following precautions
should be used:

* Hand hygiene after all contact with a sick animal and contaminated surfaces.
* Use of gown and gloves for any contact with the sick animal and
contaminated surfaces.
* Eye protection (e.g. goggles or face shield) if splash or spray of body
fluids is likely.
* Respiratory protection including a NIOSH-certified N95 filtering
disposable respirator for entering the exam room. If N95 respirators are
not available for health-care personnel, then surgical masks should be worn.*
* Contain and dispose of contaminated waste in accordance with
facility-specific guidelines for medically regulated infectious waste.
* Handle used patient-care equipment in a manner that prevents
contamination of skin and clothing. Ensure that used equipment has been
cleaned and reprocessed appropriately.
* Ensure that procedures are in place for cleaning and disinfecting
contaminated environmental surfaces. Any EPA-registered hospital
detergent-disinfectant currently used by health-care facilities for
environmental sanitation may be used. Manufacturers recommendations for
dilution (i.e., concentration), contact time, and care in handling should
be followed.
* Laundry (e.g., towels, clothing) may be washed in a standard washing
machine with warm water and detergent; bleach may be added but is not
necessary. Care should be used when handling soiled laundry to avoid direct
contact with contaminated material. Soiled laundry should not be shaken or
otherwise handled in a manner that may aerosolize infectious particles.

All animals with suspected monkeypox infection should be humanely
euthanized to prevent further spread of the disease. Humane euthanasia
options include pentobarbital injection or gas chamber using isoflurane or
halothane for most animals. For small rodent species such as mice, cervical
dislocation may be considered if performed by a trained person.

CDC is not currently recommending euthanasia of asymptomatic animals that
may have been exposed to other infected animals. Exposed asymptomatic
animals should be confined to the home and not allowed to come into contact
with other animals. They should be observed for development of signs
compatible with monkeypox for one month. Should such signs develop, the
animal should then be evaluated and euthanized if indicated.

Currently, CDC is not routinely requesting animal samples for testing.
However, specimens can be collected and stored for possible future testing.

Consultation with the state epidemiologist and state health laboratory is
necessary for samples to be sent to CDC for testing.

Prior to euthanasia, whole blood in EDTA tubes or serum can be collected
and refrigerated at 4 deg C. CDC is not recommending necropsies of animals
except in Biosafety level 3 laboratories by persons recently vaccinated
with vaccinia. Instead, the entire carcass may be preserved by freezing at
­70 deg C, or submersing in 10 percent formalin and injecting the body
cavity with as much formalin as it will hold.

For more information, contact your state or local health department or the
CDC Emergency Operations Center 770-488-7100. Additional information and
recommendations will be released as they become available. Updated
information will be available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox>.

* Respirators should be used in the context of a complete respiratory
protection program in accordance with OSHA regulations. This includes
training and fit testing to ensure a proper seal between the respirators
sealing surface and the wearers face. Detailed information on respirator
programs, including fit test procedures can be accessed at:
<http://www.osha.gov/sltc/etools/respiratory>.

Where possible, a qualitative fit test should be conducted for N95
respirators; detailed information on fit testing can be accessed at:
<http://www.osha.gov/sltc/etools/respiratory/oshafiles/fittesting1.html>.
