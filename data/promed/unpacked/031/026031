Today [Thu 17 Mar 2017] the municipal health office of Lagangilang reported that 15 residents had developed symptoms of anthrax disease, believed to be derived from eating their [sick] buffalo. The ill residents suffered skin inflammation, cutaneous sores, chest tightness, and "pagdurumi" [??? - Mod.MHJ].

Earlier, the residents said they had butchered a dead buffalo and then they ate it. It is also possible the said animals [??? - Mod.MHJ] died because of anthrax but the authorities have been unable to sample the meat.

Explanation by Abra Veterinary Office is that anthrax is a disease caused by the bacteria of _Bacillus anthracis_ [from spores in the ground - Mod.MHJ]. It often affects animals like buffalo.

The health office is awaiting the results of laboratory tests on the blood of the [human] victims to determine whether their disease is anthrax.

With thanks to Maja Carrion and Susan Baekeland for organising this translation for me. At some point in the next few days the anglophone news sources in the country may have a report, with or without further details.

Recoveries of this pathogen from human clinical cases can present problems. My late friend and colleague Benyamin Cherkasski claimed that you would be lucky to confirm 30 percent of cases. He said that the best samples were from drawing fluid out from underneath a skin lesion; obviously with pneumonic anthrax one can draw bloody fluid from the thoracic cavity. A specific problem with human cases is that they can present themselves at a hospital after having self-medicated on antibiotics and as the organism is usually very sensitive to such they have the signs and symptoms, the toxins, but not the pathogen. And the toxins can still kill them.

Carelessly eating dead carabao (buffalo) is, unfortunately, a very common cause for human anthrax in the Philippines. Livestock anthrax in the country is much more frequent than the official reports reveal, especially in the north, Luzon, which includes Abra. - Mod.MHJ
