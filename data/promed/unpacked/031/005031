Local health officials think adults are unknowingly responsible for the latest outbreak of a severe childhood respiratory disease. A total of 35 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have been reported since 1 Jan 2012 in Hillsborough County. The 112 cases reported statewide so far indicate a possible spike not seen in several years, according to the Florida Department of Health.

The Hillsborough cases cropped up in the homes of 7 local families, said Warren McDougle, epidemiology program director at the Hillsborough County Health Department. In one case, an adult infected 6 children in the family who did not have vaccinations, he said. "Pertussis has gotten in the adult population, and for them the experience is not unlike other respiratory illnesses where they cough and cough," he said. "It's not as severe as it is for children."

This year-round illness is spreading beyond Florida. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reports recent outbreaks in Montana, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington State. Cases could exceed the 27 550 reported in 2010, officials said.

St Matthias Parish School in Milwaukee is dealing with a large cluster of pertussis (whooping cough) cases. The case count stands at 17 as of Thu 19 Apr 2012.

Paul Biedrzycki with the Milwaukee County Health Department says pertussis is highly contagious and the antibiotics not only cure the students, but those most susceptible for contracting the illness or developing complications. Of the infants who contract whooping cough, 70 per cent are hospitalized. In February 2012, a baby less than a month old died from the illness. Biedrzycki says the best prevention is vaccination, although the vaccine is not a 100 per cent guarantee an individual will not contract the illness.

"It's all about vaccinating the siblings who are generally school age, or the adults who provide care to infants and toddlers as soon as possible, to interrupt the chain of transmission within the household or community setting," Biedrzycki said.

In 3 months there have been 55 cases of pertussis in Milwaukee (from January 2012 to March 2012). In all of 2011, there were 59 cases. Back in 2004, there were 1400 cases in Milwaukee.

A total of 34 cases of whooping cough have been reported in Polk County. Of the confirmed cases, 31 are students, said Rick Kozin, public information officer for the Polk County Department of Public Health. Only one of the pertussis cases was outside of Des Moines, but that case was in the Des Moines area. The 1st confirmed case was in mid-March [2012], he said.

One of the individuals who has a confirmed case of pertussis has been hospitalized. However, Kozin stressed that officials have not yet determined if that illness was what led to the need for hospitalization.

Kozin said the department did a vaccination clinic last week [week of 9 Apr 2012] at Des Moines Lincoln High School and administered 234 vaccinations. Of the confirmed cases, the majority have been in students, but the cases range from infant to middle-aged, he said.

Kozin said it's important for those experiencing symptoms to be checked out by a doctor.

The San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department is investigating 2 recent cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, in infants less than one month old. The department said cases in this vulnerable group are of special concern, and will need to take preventative measures.

Back in 2010, San Luis Obispo County had the highest rate of whooping cough cases in the state.

Health officials say an outbreak of pertussis has been reported in Cache Valley.

Bear River Health Department officials say 7 confirmed cases have been detected, with 2 other probable patients being treated. The outbreak started a week ago when medical tests confirmed 2 5th grade students at North Park Elementary in North Logan had the disease.

Health officials said so far the outbreak is isolated to students at North Park Elementary. They said students who have not completed the proper series of vaccinations and booster shots against pertussis may be required to stay home by school officials.

[Recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines in the USA have continued to expand in efforts to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized like the ones described in the Wisconsin and California reports. The use of the vaccine in pregnant women further expands these recommendations. It is likely, given the limited number of contacts infants less than one month have, that the reservoir of the infant was a family member.

The increasing susceptibility in older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop", after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem, but it is increasingly clear that _Bordetella pertussis_ clones are being selected by the acellular vaccine, against which we are no longer as well protected with the current vaccines. - Mod.LL]
