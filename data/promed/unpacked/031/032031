Anthrax stalks Midnapore, 3 dead.
-------------------------
Including a 3-year-old girl, 3 persons have already died due to the
disease, at Mangalbandi in Garbeta 3 block. A total of 22 others of
Nabakola, Garanga, Buramara, Nepura and the adjoining villages have been
afflicted and are under treatment, Dr Sujan Khamrai, block medical officer,
Salboni, who visited the areas, said. Also dead from
anthrax are 18 cattle and one goat in the area. However, Dr Khamrai told
The Statesman that the disease in under control now.
[Among businesses, the milkmen of the area are the hardest hit, as in
panic neither the sweet and tea shop owners nor the residents are taking
milk. Milk has vanished from the markets here for the past 10 days.
Quintals of milk are perishing everyday. Many tea shop owners have stopped
their business, Mr Arobinda Shai, an eminent resident of Chandrakona said.
Mrs Beethi Roy, a public health nurse who conducts health work in the
villages, told The Statesman that all the affected belonged to tribal
communities, who consumed the flesh of a dead cow in Chandmura village.
Those who handled the cow's dung and flesh also contracted the disease.
Even 2 [men from Nabakola, who bought [the cow's skin and tanned it, were
affected, Mrs Roy added. She said, massive disinfection steps have been
taken in all the villages and the cattle have also been vaccinated by the
district veterinary department staff. The people of Nabakola have decided
not to eat beef for the next 3 months, as a precautionary measure.
Dr Khamrai said, it was for the fourth time that this rare [sic variety of
anthrax has broken out in the country since 1990, when an anthrax outbreak
was reported from Mysore, followed by outbreaks in Haryana and Salboni in
2000. Mr Arabinda Shai said the authorities should undertake wide campaign
to remove panic from the people's mind, particularly when the disease has
been checked. That would save the small shop owners and the large milkmen
community of the area, who thrive on milk sale, he felt.
Meanwhile in Kolkata, the state animal resources development minister, Mr
Anisur Rahman, told The Statesman, "I am yet to be officially informed
about the outbreak of anthrax in parts of Midnapore district. But, I will
look into the matter with urgency, if the situation demands."
[Dr. Satadal Das adds: Outbreak of anthrax may be related to decreased
population of vultures in the locality. I recently observed that about 25%
of them are sick in this area. They excrete more uric acid (average 0.172 g
per gram of dried stool) and their stool contains plenty of bacteriophages.

[This account is typical of what I have been informed privately by a number
of ProMED-mail members is the chaotic 'control' of this disease in India at
the
local and regional levels. The disease is in fact enzootic in a broad band
from Tamil Nadu in the south to West Bengal in the northeast. Vultures, on
balance, had a beneficial impact through their rapid consumption of
carcasses in spite of the environmental contamination involved and the risk
of water contamination when they subsequently bathed. Unfortunately their
numbers are now much reduced. Our thanks to Dr Das for forwarding this
report. - Mod.MHJ

Cattle disease affects a human
-----------------------
KOLAR: A case of anthrax disease affecting a man has been reported from
Kolar. Dr K. Borappa of R.L. Jalappa Hospital said a 45-year-old farmer
from Sidlaghatta's Alagurki village was admitted to hospital last week
following ulcer-like wounds on [his hands. Also, he had edema swelling in
both legs and his blood vessels were in a compressed state. The patient was
suffering from high fever compounded with pain.
Fearing more cases of anthrax breaking out from the village where the case
was reported, a team of doctors headed by Dr Sridhar, head of the
department of community medicine, rushed to Alagurki village and screened
the villagers. Dr Borappa told The Times of India that 20 sheep have died
of anthrax and added: "Anthrax is a communicable disease. Any person coming
in contact with carcasses of animals is sure to contract the disease. To
guard against the spread of anthrax, carcasses should be buried deep into
the earth."
He said the district administration has been asked to take measures in and
around Sidlaghatta taluk to check the spread of anthrax.

[Kolar is in south-eastern Karnataka, east of Bangalore and just north of
Tamil Nadu. From an ongoing discussion with Dr. Kumar Auqamuthu it has
become clear that the disease is widespread in livestock and humans in the
region. Some outbreak clusters adjoin tanneries, on which the environmental
and industrial governmental controls are modest. In spite of Dr. Borappa's
advice, it is better to burn anthrax carcasses than bury them. The latter
can just provide an ongoing nidus of contaminated soil. - Mod.MHJ
