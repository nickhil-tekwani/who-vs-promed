At least 39 people in central New Jersey and on Long Island, NY were
infected, 2 of them critically, with _E. coli_ [O157:H7] bacteria in
an outbreak of food poisoning in November 2006 that has been traced
to the Taco Bell restaurant chain, health officials in NY and NJ said
yesterday, 4 Nov 2006. It was the nation's most serious outbreak of
this disease since mid-September 2006, when the bacteria, linked to
packages of contaminated spinach grown in California, killed 3 people
and infected more than 200 in 26 states.
Taco Bell, which serves burritos, quesadillas and other Mexican
specialties in 5800 outlets in the USA and generated sales of $6.2
billion in 2005, voluntarily closed one outlet in South Plainfield,
NJ, where 20 customers and 2 workers became infected, and 8 other
restaurants on Long Island, in what it called a temporary precaution
to sanitize and restock outlets where the _E. coli_ had been traced.
Epidemiologists in NJ and NY said that no new cases had been reported
since Wed, 29 Nov 2006 but that they were continuing to monitor the
situation. Taco Bell said it was cooperating with state
investigators, who were still searching for the ingredient that
carried the contamination. "Health officials have indicated that
there is no immediate threat and whatever may have occurred has most
likely passed through the system," said Greg Creed, Taco Bell's president.
Some health officials acknowledged that an announcement of the
contamination had been delayed in NJ for several days, in part over
concerns for possible overreaction by the public. Some critics
questioned the delay.
Carol Tucker Foreman, head of the Food Policy Institute at the
Consumer Federation of America, said the delay had obviated a swift
inspection of other outlets in the chain, which buys food in bulk.
There are 204 Taco Bell restaurants in New York State, and 86 in New Jersey.
"I don't know why they didn't make that immediately known, and I
don't know why they didn't do rush inspections of every other Taco
Bell in the area," Ms. Foreman said. "They purchase huge amounts of
everything from a few suppliers. If you've got contaminated anything
in one of their restaurants, you've got it in many. That's the nature
of fast food."
In the latest outbreak, which sickened victims in the last 2 weeks of
November, New Jersey health officials yesterday, 4 Dec 2006, reported
25 confirmed cases and a dozen more listed as probable infections,
most of them linked to Taco Bells in Middlesex and Somerset Counties.
New York officials reported at least 14 cases in Nassau and Suffolk
Counties, and most of the patients had eaten at Taco Bell outlets.
The most serious cases involved 2 NJ children who developed a
condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can permanently
damage the kidneys. A 11-year-old boy with kidney damage remained in
critical condition at Newark's Beth Israel Hospital, but the
condition of a 5-year-old girl was upgraded yesterday. Five people in
New Jersey and 4 on Long Island remained hospitalized.
"We have a significant, serious outbreak going on here," said David
A. Papi, director of the Middlesex County Public Health Department.
While the outbreak was still under investigation, he said officials
believed the infections had stemmed from food, not workers, at Taco
Bells in South Plainfield, Edison and Franklin Township, all of them
owned by the same individual, whose name was not released.
The franchises in Edison and Franklin Township were not closed
because the danger most likely has passed, Dr. Fred M. Jacobs, the
New Jersey health commissioner, said at a news conference in Trenton.
"Whatever happened went through already," he said. "My assumption is
that the outbreak is over if there are no new cases since 29 Nov 2006."
In Suffolk County, NY, where 11 cases were reported, Dr. David G.
Graham, the acting health commissioner, said infected patients had
eaten at Taco Bells in Patchogue, Deer Park, Port Jefferson Station
and Riverhead, and that all 4 outlets had been temporarily closed as
a precaution.
In Nassau County, NY, where 3 cases were reported, Taco Bell
responded to a request by health officials and temporarily closed
outlets in the Roosevelt Field shopping mall, and in Hicksville,
Hempstead and East Meadow, where victims had eaten.
Dr. Abby Greenberg, director of disease control for the Nassau County
Health Department, noted that the infections there had all occurred
in Nov 2006. "There is no indication of ongoing problems," she said.
The outbreak in the New York metropolitan area apparently began in
the 3rd week of Nov 2006 among a score of people who ate at a Taco
Bell off Route 287 in South Plainfield, which was closed Thu, 30 Nov
2006. Tests showed that 2 workers also were infected, although they
exhibited no symptoms.

[Now that the fast food chain is clearly implicated, since there is
distribution of food from central locations to individual
restaurants, it is not at all surprising to see the number of cases
growing in various locales. Since a number of locations are involved,
and perhaps more, the NJ workers may well have been infected by the
food rather than infecting the food. - Mod.LL]
