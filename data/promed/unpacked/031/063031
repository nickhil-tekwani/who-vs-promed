The number of malaria patients has sharply increased this month [June
2007] among communities of Burmese refugees and migrants on the
Thailand-Burma border, said a senior medical worker in Mae Sot,
Thailand. "More than 50 malaria patients come to the clinic every
day, and half of them have to be hospitalized for proper treatment,"
said Khin May, a senior medic at the Mae Tao Clinic in Mae Sot, which
provides health services to Burmese communities in Mae Sot and also
inside Burma.
"Since last month [May 2007], the hospital has accommodated more than
300 malaria patients. With no doubt, there will be more patients
coming," Khin May told The Irrawaddy on Mon 11 Jun 2007.
Another staff member said the clinic treated more than 8000 malaria
patients last year [2006]. 30 of them died from the illness.
Breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes emerge during the
rainy season, according to Shoklo Malaria Research Unit, based in Mae
Sot.
The Shoklo facility is a field station attached to the faculty of
tropical medicine at Bangkok's Mahidol University and part of the
Welcome-Oxford-Mahidol University Research Programme.
Seven Burmese have died from malaria near the Three Pagodas Pass, on
the border with Thailand's Kanchanaburi Province.
A local resident said the outbreak will probably get worse this year
[2007] because of a lack of healthcare services, hospitals and
clinics. Several health organizations and NGOs used to operate in the
area in past years, but several -- including Medecins Sans Frontiere
-- have since pulled out, leaving local residents more concerned
about the threat of malaria and other ailments.
The current increase in malaria cases has created a shortage of
medicine and available space at Mae Tao, run by Dr Cynthia Maung. "We
do not have enough medicine or space for all of the people who come
to the clinic," says Khin May. "Last week, when there were too many
patients, we were rushing to buy medicine at local markets."
Health officials in Burma maintain that the military government has
made improvements in the treatment and prevention of malaria, which
has been designated as a major communicable disease of national
concern.
According to a press report by the Chinese news agency Xinhua on Mon
11 Jun 2007, Burma's Ministry of Health claims that malaria morbidity
and mortality rates in the country have dropped since 1988-89.

[ProMED reported on the malaria situation in Myanmar in August 2006,
and no new data on the number of cases and fatalities are available.
The WHO health report on Myanmar for 2006 lists malaria as causing
approximately 7 percent of total registered morbidity and mortality:

ited.pdf>.
If an increasing number of cases imported from Myanmar are treated in
Thailand, this is a strong indication that malaria is increasing in
Myanmar. ProMED will be happy to post any further information
available. - Mod.EP]
