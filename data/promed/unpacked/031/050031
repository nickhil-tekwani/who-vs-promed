In this posting on Newcastle the statement is made:
"Newcastle disease is not transferable to humans..."
This is not the case, however. Those individuals in close association with
infected birds can have conjunctivitis, lung congestion, epiphora, chills,
fever, and pharyngitis. Transmission is by aerosol or the fecal-to-oral
route. The incubation period is short, 1-2 days.
Because of the necessity of close association with birds, this can be an
occupational illness of poultrymen, abattoir workers, game bird raisers
and veterinarians.
The Newcastle agent stands out in my mind because of my first course in
veterinary microbiology where we were warned about the zoonotic potential
of the organism!

Two issues arising from the Fresno Bee article of 30 June -
Occasional human
infections occur with conjunctivitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis and
tracheitis. Infections may become quite severe and lead to some lasting
impairment of vision. Person to person transmission of ND virus was
suspected during the 1971-72 Californian outbreak.
ND
virus remains infectious in bone marrow and muscles of slaughtered chickens
for at least 6 months at minus 20 degrees Celsius and for up to 4 months
at refrigerator temperatures. The importation of the virus to various
countries in frozen chickens has occurred.

[Mea culpa! I should have caught both of these. Thank you gentlemen for
your corrections. At one time in the UK when there was a large commercial
duck industry in Norfolk, one of the ways that the local MAFF vets knew
that ND was about was that the people working in the poultry processing
plants would complain of (human) ND symptoms. - Mod.MHJ
