A desperate hunt is underway for the vaccine of a highly infectious rabbit virus that has killed 400 pets in Britain in the last 6 months. Owners are being warned of a new mutated strain of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD-2) that kills pet rabbits within days and has no UK vaccine.

The deadly virus, which has almost no symptoms, may have affected 2000 rabbits already, with a further 1.3 million unprotected pets at risk. The current death toll of the virus, 1st reported in the UK in 2014, is believed to be unrepresentative of the reality, as up to 80 percent of unforeseen deaths are unrecorded. Neill Gardner, chairman of the British Rabbit Council, has said the vaccine is expected to be licensed next month.

RHD-2 spreads through people, animals and bedding for rabbits - like hay - with the only vaccines having to be imported from France and Spain. The mutated disease was 1st recorded in France in 2010 and targets domestic and wild rabbits. It came to Britain 2 years ago [2014] and there have been cases from Devon and Cornwall to the Scottish Highlands. Most of the country's 1.2 million pet rabbits are at risk. Since March, RHD-2 has been recorded across Cheshire, Devon, Leicestershire, Shropshire, Worcestershire, Leeds and Moray. It is believed to have particularly affected Devon and Cornwall.

Richard Saunders, a Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund veterinary expert said the 'vast majority' of owners didn't know about the virus. He added that a number of vets were also unaware - or didn't deem it necessary to vaccinate the rabbits.
Higher temperatures were also said to help spread the disease. 'The biggest worry about this virus is that it is endemic - it spreads slower than it kills so it creeps around the country in a more sinister pattern than the 1st strain,' he told the Telegraph.

Vet's Klinic in Swindon said that rabbits could catch the disease through contact with other infected animals, through people who have contacted infected animals and through biting insects.

Vaccines are easily accessible for the original virus - rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) - which was 1st reported in the UK in 1992. For RHD-2 some vets with access to the vaccines are offering vaccinations for rabbits. They are charging between 25GBP and 30GBP [approx. 33 and 40USD] for domestic rabbit owners, who only need 1 dose.

RHD is a highly infectious and fatal disease which affects wild and domestic rabbits. The original strain of RHD is endemic in the UK but was brought under relative control by vaccination in the 1990s. In November 2015, the new strain of RHD was 1st confirmed in the UK. Although less virulent than RHD-1, RHD-2 is more difficult to diagnose in the early stages, meaning rabbits can carry the disease for a longer period. RHD-2 is common in mainland Europe, particularly in France where it was 1st identified in 2010.

Peter Smith, and his 15-year-old daughter Claudia saw 10 of their rabbits die within just 3 days at their home in Morpeth, Northumberland, last September [2015]. The chartered accountant, 47, said: "I was in the kitchen, which isn't too far from where our rabbits are kept, and I heard an almighty squeal. There were no outward signs whatsoever." Mr. Smith said both young and adult rabbits died, concluding that the deaths didn't seem to have a distinctive pattern.

Hazel Elliott, a member of the British Rabbit Council's governing body, said European vaccine firms were applying for licenses in the UK, but was unclear as to when they would get them.

The outbreak of RDH-2 has forced the closure of show competitions in Devon, Cornwall and Cheshire. "The fear factor is we don't know how it's spreading," said Neill Gardner, chairman of the British Rabbit Council (BRC) told the BBC. Mr. Gardner added: "With the former strain there was usually a visible sign, like bloody discharge from the nostrils."

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes. Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

RHD-2 is a variant form of the original RHD-1 virus and differs in the following ways:

- Rabbits infected with the RHD-2 virus typically DO NOT show the symptoms that are common with RHD-1 infection so it is far more difficult to diagnose from simple observations.
- Death from RHD-2 occurs later and over a longer period of time than RHD-1: typically this is 3-9 days following infection and can last up to 5 days, instead of 2-6 days infection and lasting 3-4 days as generally observed with classical RHD-1. Although this is marginal it is important to note from a quarantine perspective.
- Only following post-mortem examination will initial diagnosis be possible, however further tests are required to definitively confirm RHD-2, which is now recommended for unexplained deaths.
- In mainland Europe, RHD-2 is now very common particularly in France where it was first identified in 2010 and spread country-wide where it was mainly transmitted through the wild rabbit population with cross-over with domestic rabbits. In Italy it has not spread very wide given the differences in wild rabbit population density. A research study has been published that describes the proliferation in RHD-2 in France since 2010 and of relevance to the current situation in the UK.
- Although RHD-2 is less virulent than RHD-1, its difficult early diagnosis means it is more challenging given rabbits can carry the disease for a longer period of time without any visible signs of infection. Hence diagnosis of RHD-2 presents a new challenge for the UK.
