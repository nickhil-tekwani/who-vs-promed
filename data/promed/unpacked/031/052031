Yukoners are being asked to keep an eye out for pertussis (whooping cough) after 5 cases have been confirmed in the territory.

The acting chief medical officer of health, Dr. Sharon Lazeo, said all 5 cases link back to the Yukon Native Hockey Tournament, which took place in late March 2012. All those who are ill were either participants in the tournament or family members of participants. The outbreak is also directly linked to the current outbreak in British Columbia where there is a confirmed case.

"We have begun contact tracing for all the individuals who may have come into contact with the Yukon case and the one case in BC," said Lazeo in a release. Lazeo said parents should keep an eye out for signs of the illness in children.

[The increasing susceptibility in older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop," after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem, but it is increasingly clear that _Bordetella pertussis_ clones are being selected by the acellular vaccine, against which we are no longer as well protected with the current vaccines. - Mod.LL
