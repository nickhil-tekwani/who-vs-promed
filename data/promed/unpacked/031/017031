Russia: Outbreak of Meningitis Recorded in Novodvinsk
(Arkangelsk)
--------------------------------------------------
18 cases of enteroviral infection were registered in Novodvinsk
during the period Wed 3 Sep to Mon 29 Sep 2003. 12 cases of
serous meningitis were confirmed by serological analysis.
According to Viktor Sosnizkiy of the Epidemiological Surveillance
Center, no fatal cases were registered.
Sosnizkiy explained that these were cases of serous meningitis
and not purulent meningitis, which often has a fatal outcome.
The rise in infection can be explained by the disease's seasonal
character. We can talk about a meningitis outbreak only after 10
registered cases occur in the same district, whereas an epidemic is
[declared] when the number of cases is 10 times greater. For
example, in the Sverdlovsk region, an epidemic was not declared
even although 200 cases of meningitis were registered.
Most of the infected are children. According to Sosnizkiy, the
children probably contracted infection after swimming. The fact that
the epidemic occurred in September can be explained by the long
incubation period of the illness. According to Sosnizkiy, enteroviral
infections [resulting in meningitis] are caused by coxsackieviruses
or echoviruses.
Meningitis morbidity has been sporadic during recent years. The
disease starts acutely, with high fever, severe headache, and
frequent vomiting not associated with food intake. Symptoms [of
meningitis] can be observed on the 2nd and 3rd day of the illness.
Patients with this condition should be hospitalized and spinal
puncture may be required [for diagnosis].

Russia: Meningitis Epidemic Warning in Moscow
---------------------------------------------
Pre-school and elementary school children in Moscow will be
vaccinated because of the increase in meningitis cases, according
to the Moscow Center for Sanitary Epidemiological Surveillance.
According to an epidemiologist, there were 230 cases of meningitis
in Moscow during the last 8 months. This is almost 2 times more
then average but is less then the epidemic threshold.
The steepest rise in (droplet-borne) disease is observed in
autumn-winter, and if the necessary prevention measures are not
undertaken, there is the threat of epidemic. Vaccination [is
recommended but not compulsory]. Obligatory vaccination is
implemented after 2 or more cases of meningitis occur in a
kindergarten or elementary school. The final decision on
vaccination will be made by local officials. If they decide not to
vaccinate, parents can vaccinate their children for a fee of 500
rubles.

[About 1/2 to 3/4 of cases of meningitis are caused by viruses. The
etiologic agents are predominantly enteroviruses (echoviruses,
coxsackieviruses, and poliovirus), and less frequently mumps virus
(transmitted by droplets and fomites), herpes simplex virus, and
adenovirus. In some countries viral meningitis may be associated
with certain arboviruses. Consequently there is no specific vaccine
applicable to all cases of meningitis. It is presumed that in the
outbreaks described above, poliomyelitis virus vaccine is being
employed, with the aim of inducing some degree of cross-protective
immunity.
Cases of enteroviral infection are commonest in summer months
and in the first 10 years of life. Transmission of infection is
predominantly by the fecal-oral route, likely the case in the
enteroviral meningitis outbreaks described above. The prognosis
for viral meningitis is good and recovery is usually complete. Viral
meningitis is sometimes referred to as aseptic, lymphocytic, or
serous meningitis because of the predominance of lymphocytes in
the cerebrospinal fluid.
The distinction between an outbreak and an epidemic is arbitrary,
varying according to situation, circumstance, and local usage. -
