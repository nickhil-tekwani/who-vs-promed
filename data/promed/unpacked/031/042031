Re: Progressive inflammatory neuropathy, pork plant workers - USA
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hypothesis:
----------
The compressed-air devices could have created water-lipid emulsion
droplets, acting as an immune enhancing adjuvant (analogous to
Freund's Adjuvant) that could have made brain tissue more immunogenic.

Furthermore some very small droplets may have reached velocities high
enough to penetrate healthy skin without being noticed. This could
explain that most/all cases worked close to the device. Inhaled
droplets may have reached more workers.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Engel for his comments.

Certainly high-pressure compressed air systems can be used to deliver
immunogens into the skin. Whether the brain tissue particles were at a
high enough velocity to accomplish this here is unclear and this
Moderator would guess they were not. The development of droplets
containing antigen, however, can accomplish a similar result by
exposing antigen-sampling cells in the mucosal surfaces of the
gastrointestinal or respiratory tract. - Mod.LL]
