_Acidovorax citrulli_ in Greece with findings on tomato
-------------------------------------------------------
_Acidovorax citrulli_ (EPPO A1 List) is the causal agent of bacterial fruit blotch disease of cucurbits. In Greece, it was first detected causing fruit blotch in watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_) in 2005, and further outbreaks were then detected in 2006 and 2008 (EPPO RS 2009/216).

The detection of _A. citrulli_ in symptomatic tomato seedlings (_Solanum lycopersicum_) in 2 transplant houses [was reported] in June 2019 and April 2020. Tomato leaves presented necrotic black spots, often with chlorotic haloes. Economic losses were considered to be serious, as 20-30% of seedlings were diseased. _A. citrulli_ had previously been detected on tomato and eggplant (_S. melongena_) in Israel [see link below].

The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Greece informed EPPO that in watermelon cultivation, only sporadic infections have been reported. The finding on tomato occurred in the region of Central Macedonia, and all tomato seedlings were destroyed. Tracing back studies are being conducted to identify the origin of this outbreak.

[Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB) caused by _Acidovorax citrulli_ (Ac) is an economically important disease of cucurbit crops (family Cucurbitaceae) worldwide, with yield losses of up to 90% reported in watermelon. Several genetic groups have been identified for isolated strains which vary in host preferences within the cucurbit family. Symptoms on fruit may include spots, lesions and cracks; white bacterial ooze from the lesions; general fruit; young fruit are most susceptible. Leaves may develop brown lesions, and infected seedlings may collapse. Disease development is favoured by warm, humid conditions.

The bacteria can be spread with or on seed, and this is considered the main mode of spread between areas. They can also be spread by water (including crop irrigation), mechanical means (including animal and human activities) and infected plant materials (including crop debris). Disease management may include crop rotation, cultural measures (removal of pathogen reservoirs) and phytosanitation (for example, disinfection of farming tools). Chemical control may be effective, especially in glasshouses. Use of certified clean seed or transplants is essential. Disease susceptibility of commercial cucurbit cultivars varies.

In solanaceous hosts, Ac reports have been few and were mostly connected to infected or contaminated seeds. In host range studies, symptoms were produced on leaves of tomato, aubergine and capsicum, but not on their fruits. Strains of Ac isolated from tomato in Israel (link below) have been shown to belong to the group II of strains which are mainly found in watermelon (genus _Citrullus_).

The related _A. avenae_ can affect a number of mainly grassy hosts, including cereal crops such as maize, millets, sorghum, oats, sugarcane and rice.
