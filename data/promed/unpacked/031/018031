An outbreak of a rare disease spread by mice has prompted a warning
by health authorities for local farmers to cover up. 4 cases of
leptospirosis have been confirmed in the Murrumbidgee Local Health
Network.

Public health director Tracey Oakman said the mouse borne disease has
similar symptoms to the common flu. Ms Oakman said farmers are
particularly susceptible in the mouse plague, as the infection happens
when open wounds come in contact with mouse urine. "It's really
important, if people do have cuts they can make sure they cover them,"
she said. "I know gloves are difficult for farmers, or bandages, but
try and avoid best you can coming into contact with soil and water and
mud that have urine in it."

Ms Oakman said it was not normally seen as far south in New South
Wales but mouse numbers are up this year [2011] because of all the
rain. It's important that people do go to the doctor with
leptospirosis because you can get kidney failure, jaundice, and
meningitis and bleeding on the lungs as a complication," she said.
"Many people do end up in hospital after it, so if they're unwell,
please go and see a doctor to diagnose it and a blood test will
diagnose it."

[The following is extracted from ProMED-mail post, Leptospirosis,
canine - Australia (NSW) (06) 20000508.0704, that concerned an
outbreak of leptospirosis in dogs in New South Wales, Australia in the
autumn (April) of 2000, the same time of year as the current
outbreak:

"Outbreaks occur in this same locality every 10 years or so,
seemingly in autumn -- 2000, 1990, mid 1980s, 1973. ...
Epidemiologically it would seem to indicate a wildlife reservoir such
as rodents and/or bandicoots contaminating surface water with infected
urine. The autumn we are having was mild and wet. We know leptospires
survive outside the host in the dry summer for about half an hour, and
they are susceptible to frost -- so the only opportunity for their
survival for an extended time is during a damp warm autumn, such as
recently experienced -- it is rapidly passing. The organisms are also
susceptible to slightly acidic conditions, so soil pH is important (it
survives in a narrow range of pH 6.5-8.5)."

Leptospirosis occurs worldwide and frequently follows flooding after
heavy rains. The Murrumbidgee River basin, where the current outbreak
is occurring, experienced major flooding in December 2010; the river
drains much of southern New South Wales and all of the Australian
Capital Territory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murrumbidgee_River).

The following on leptospirosis has been extracted from moderator ML's
comments in ProMED-mail Leptospirosis - Australia: (QL) alert 20110121.0246:

"Leptospirosis is caused by exposure to _Leptospira_ bacteria, in
fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been
contaminated by urine of animals chronically infected with one of the
several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.
Rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the usual reservoirs for this
organism. ... For a history of leptospirosis in Australia, see
ProMED-mail moderator MPP's comments in ProMED-mail Leptospirosis,
military personnel - Australia (QLD) 20050322.0824.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors
or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings
(such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers,
trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers,
dairy farmers, or military personnel. Also leptospirosis is a risk
during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming,
canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve
exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine
from leptospire-infected animals, as well as a risk from household
exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Most patients with leptospirosis have a non-specific mild, flu-like
illness. Some patients develop severe disease with myocardial,
pulmonary, renal, or hepatic involvement. Multi-organ failure,
thrombocytopenia, and bleeding may develop. Severe infection may be
fatal in 5-40 per cent of cases."
