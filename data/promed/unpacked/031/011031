After weeks of investigation, scientists have identified the source of a
rare strain of bacteria that infected at least 73 B.C. residents - most of
them young children - last fall. An outbreak of _Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis_ is so rare investigators had to rely on the traits of a
similar strain of bacteria to track it down.
The source turned out to be a batch of pasteurized whole milk delivered to
stores late last October or early November.
In the last decade, only a handful of outbreaks of the bacteria have been
reported worldwide, most in Japan. "Yersinia is what we would call an
emerging bug," said Dr. Murray Fyfe, associate director of epidemiology for
the B.C. Centre for Disease Control. "We don't know much about it, and in
this case, the outbreak was
essentially over when we heard about it. "We do know that outbreaks are
generally much bigger than what we detect."
The researchers' article detailing the outbreak and the search for the
source will be published in the June issue of the Canadian Communicable
Disease Report.
The bacterium, which has no relation to tuberculosis, cause infection in
the bowel. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, lower abdominal pain and
diarrhea. The infection can mimic appendicitis and some people may think
they are suffering with a bout of food poisoning or stomach flu. Most
people recover without treatment, although some may experience joint pain
for weeks or months.
The B.C. outbreak lasted for the month of November and affected residents
of the Vancouver area and Fraser Valley, with a few cases reported in
Prince George. More than half of the cases occurred in children under age
three.
Federal food inspectors have also investigated the outbreak, which was
traced to a dairy processing plant in the Vancouver area. Because milk is
perishable and the expiry date had long passed when it was identified as
the source, inspectors were unable to find the bacteria. They do know
contamination occurred after pasteurization.
