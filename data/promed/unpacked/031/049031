It seems that Northeast India's tussle with African swine fever [ASF] is not over yet. After killing thousands of pigs in 2020 in Assam, it has turned towards Mizoram. The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research in Bhopal has confirmed the recent deaths of pigs in Mizoram to be caused by ASF.

ASF was 1st detected in Mizoram on 21 Mar 2021 at Lungsen village, prompting the creation of Rapid Response Teams in all the districts of the state by the Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Dept. On 16 Apr 2021. The Chief Secretary of Mizoram was informed of the onset of the dreaded swine disease after its confirmation.

Immediately, the Mizoram Animal Husbandry & Veterinary department, invoking "The Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act of 2009," declared Lungsen as Infected Zone.

So far, ASF has been confirmed in 9 districts of Mizoram, namely Siaha, Lawngtlai, Lunglei, Serchhip, Aizawl, Khawzawl, Hnahthial, Champhai, and Mamit. Several localities of Capital Aizwal too have been declared as Infected Zones.

Last year [2020], ASF took pockets of Arunachal Pradesh and the whole of Assam under its grip. Thousands of pigs either died of the disease or were culled. The piggery sector of the neighboring state was crippled, with entire pig farms becoming empty.

The scenario is getting repeated in Mizoram as well. Officials from the Animal Husbandry & Veterinary department have reported that an over 100 million Indian Rupees [USD 1.36 million] loss has been incurred by pig farmers in the state. Official records state that between 21 Mar and 9 Jun 2021, 5546 pigs have died from ASF. Another 227 deaths of pigs are suspected from ASF as well.

ASF has no known cure yet. Neither has it any vaccine. Its mortality rate is nearly 100%. Extremely contagious, it is not harmful to humans, but it is suspected that humans can be carriers. Veterinary protocols dictate that pigs dead of ASF must be buried deep in the earth. The Mizoram State Veterinary Dept. has advised pig farmers to do so to stop the spread of the disease.

[African swine fever [ASF] was 1st (unofficially) reported in India in late February 2020. The 1st report to the OIE took place in May 2020. The outbreaks were located in the northeastern states Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Since then, several additional outbreaks have been reported, spreading and entering another northeastern state, Meghalaya. Mizoram became, in August 2020, the 4th state to be affected [ProMED-mail archive no. 20200820.7698561].

Mizoram borders, on its south, Bangladesh and the ASF-affected Myanmar.

Large parts of Asia have already been affected by ASF, including China, the world's leading pork producer, which shares borders with India.

The FAO/OIE virtual global event "Stop ASF: Public and private partnering for success," is due to go live on 21 and 28 Jun 2021 (1.5 hour/day). For the event's agenda and other relevant information, please go to http://www.fao.org/3/cb4552en/cb4552en.pdf. - Mod.AS
