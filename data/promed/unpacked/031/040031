The sanitary jurisdiction II indicated that to date, there have been no [officially] registered cases of West Nile [virus infections] in the city [Ciudad Juarez], stated Alejandro Suarez, city epidemiologist.

"We await results from the National Laboratory for 18 suspected cases of the disease; we have 41 probable cases, of which 23 were negative. Also, we continue surveillance so that when we receive a report [of a suspected case], personnel from vector [control] go to fog [with insecticides] the home as well as the environment of the patient," explained Suarez.

As for the patient who we presume was infected by the West Nile virus, we report that the area where the individual lived was fogged this past 17 Sep [2012], but we will come back there again in order to reduce risk, while we rule out that the disease is positive [or not for West Nile virus infection].

The official exhorted the populace to report the emergence of mosquitoes so that the city [vector control personnel] can go there and fog the neighborhood.

It is very important to keep the land, gardens and yards clean of things such as tires and objects that are not in use that can retain water that result in mosquito breeding sites. Recommendations for the community to avoid the presence of mosquitoes are:
- Keep your yards and gardens clean of trash
- Discard trash (throw away all objects that are broken or not used)
- Do not permit the accumulation of water in puddles because these are ideal mosquito breeding sites.
- In case you need to be outdoors, use insect repellants.

The main symptoms of West Nile virus [infection] are:
- High fever
- Vomiting
- Abdominal pain
- Headache and stiff neck

[Ciudad Juarez is a border city immediately south of El Paso, Texas. Texas is experiencing the highest number of human West Nile virus (WNV) infections in nearly a decade. There have been 2 fatal WNV infections in El Paso as of 6 Sep 2012 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120908.1285815), so it would not be surprising if virus transmission has spilled over the border into Mexico. However, until substantiated by positive laboratory results, the occurrence of WNV infections in Ciudad Juarez is considered unconfirmed. The city health officials are wise to have put in place a rapid vector control response team, and advised the community to eliminate mosquito breeding sites and avoid mosquito bites. ProMED would be interested in receiving information concerning the test results that are pending. - Mod.TY
