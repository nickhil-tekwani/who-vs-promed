FSIS: Handle ground beef products properly
-----------------------------------------------
The USA Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection
Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert to remind consumers
to ensure that meat products are fully cooked and properly handled
before they are consumed.
FSIS has received reports of 14 illnesses caused by _E. coli_ O157:H7
with matching microbiological profiles. There is no link to a
specific product, but illnesses from this pathogen can be associated
with consumption of raw or undercooked ground beef. Illnesses have
been found in California, Iowa, New York, Ohio, Michigan, Rhode
Island and Wisconsin. These illnesses occurred over a 6-month period,
beginning in September 2005 through March 2006, and FSIS is working
closely with State and local health officials to determine the
exposure that led to illness.
Therefore, FSIS wants to remind all consumers of the proper handling
and cooking of meat products. Safe steps in food handling, cooking,
and storage are essential to prevent foodborne illness. Consumers
should follow the 4 guidelines to keep food safe:
1. Clean: Wash hands and surfaces often. Wash your hands with warm,
soapy water for 20 seconds before and after handling food. Wash your
cutting boards, dishes, etc. with hot, soapy water after preparing
each food item. Wash fruits and vegetables with cold water before
using. There is no need to wash or rinse meat or poultry.
2. Separate: Don't cross-contaminate. Separate raw, cooked, and
ready-to-eat foods while shopping, preparing, or storing. Never place
cooked food on a plate which previously held raw meat, poultry, or
seafood.
3. Cook: Cook food to proper temperatures. To be sure bacteria and
pathogens are destroyed, cook ground beef products to 160 F. Use a
food thermometer to be sure!
4. Chill: Refrigerate promptly. Refrigerate or freeze perishables,
prepared foods, and leftovers within 2 hours or sooner.

[Matching microbiological profiles (presumably genetic matches)
occurring over 6 months and scattered across the USA suggest a common
reservoir that is nonperishable, such as frozen ground beef rather
than unpasteurized milk or produce. ProMED awaits more information
regarding this investigation. - Mod.LL]
