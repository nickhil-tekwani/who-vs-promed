New Hampshire public health officials are working to find the source of ground beef that has caused a dozen people to be infected with _E. coli_. Authorities said in a statement Fri 22 Jul 2016, that since June 2016, 12 people have come down with the same strain of _E. coli_ after eating ground beef. Those people ate ground beef at several different places, and state and federal officials are working to identify the specific source.

"The Division of Public Health Services [DPHS] is working with our federal partners to investigate the source of the ground beef that is causing people in New Hampshire to become ill," said Marcella Bobinsky, Acting Director of DPHS, in a statement. "Ground beef is a known source of _E. coli_ and it is important for people to avoid eating under-cooked ground beef whether at home or at a restaurant."

Health officials say New Hampshire residents are not at risk of contracting _E. coli_ as long as they make sure their food is properly cooked.

[Although not specifically stated, the outbreak is likely caused by one of the enterohemorrhagic strains of _E. coli_ since ground beef is the prototypic reservoir for this zoonotic infection.

The organism literally burst on the microbial scene with the outbreak related to a chain of fast food establishments in 1982 in the USA and was reported in 1983:

Riley LW, Remis RS, Helgerson SD, et al: Hemorrhagic colitis associated with a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype. N Engl J Med. 1983; 308(12): 681-5; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198303243081203.

Abstract
--------
"We investigated 2 outbreaks of an unusual gastrointestinal illness that affected at least 47 people in Oregon and Michigan in February through March and May through June 1982. The illness was characterized by severe crampy abdominal pain, initially watery diarrhea followed by grossly bloody diarrhea, and little or no fever. It was associated with eating at restaurants belonging to the same fast-food restaurant chain in Oregon (P less than 0.005) and Michigan (P = 0.0005) and with eating any of three sandwiches containing three ingredients in common (beef patty, rehydrated onions, and pickles). Stool cultures did not yield previously recognized pathogens. However, a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype, O157:H7, that was not invasive or toxigenic by standard tests was isolated from 9 of 12 stools collected within 4 days of onset of illness in both outbreaks combined, and from a beef patty from a suspected lot of meat in Michigan. The only known previous isolation of this serotype was from a sporadic case of hemorrhagic colitis in 1975. This report describes a clinically distinctive gastrointestinal illness associated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, apparently transmitted by undercooked meat." - Mod.LL
