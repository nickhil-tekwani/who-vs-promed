White leaf disease hits some sugarcane farms in northern Thailand
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Incidents of white leaf disease have been found on some sugar cane
farms in the Northern Thailand region, but good rainfall volumes have
kept the disease in check so far. The white leaf is currently less
severe than it could potentially be, as it spreads more readily during
drought, an official at the Office of the Cane and Sugar Board said.
The northernmost region accounts for more than a third of Thailand's
sugar cane crop.

However, if farmers don't destroy the affected crops, the disease
could spread and potentially reducing yields from the new and ratoon
crop -- cane that grows from previously harvested stubble.

Crushing of the new crop -- due to begin in November [2011] -- could
be lower if the disease spreads and causes extensive crop damage.
Traders estimate that white leaf disease causes around USD 30 million
in losses for Thailand's sugar cane sector a year.

[Sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma (SCWL) (16SrXI Rice yellow dwarf
taxonomic group, type member _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma oryzae) has been
reported from Africa, South, and South-East Asia causing a very
destructive disease of sugarcane. Symptoms include single, white or
cream stripes parallel to the midrib in the early stage, later
extending to the entire length of the leaf. Chlorotic leaves are found
especially in the spindle portion and the tillers. In the late stages,
plant vigour decreases and stunted stalks, absence of side shoots on
the upper part of infected stalks and abnormal tillering may occur.
Symptoms may be masked at low temperature but reappear as the
temperature rises.

SCWL is transmitted by the leafhoppers _Matsumuratettix
hiroglyphicus_ and _Yamatotettix flavovittatus_ and is also readily
spread by infected setts. No alternative reservoir hosts are known.
Disease management primarily relies on the removal of infected plants
and use of clean planting material. The phytoplasma may be eliminated
from contaminated setts using heat therapy methods prior to planting,
and vector control may also be attempted. Sugarcane lines resistant
SCWL are being developed using host resistance found in wild
_Saccharum_ species.

SCWL phytoplasmas appears to be more closely related to Sugarcane
grassy shoot phytoplasma (as yet unclassified) than to phytoplasmas
causing white leaf symptoms in some grasses.
