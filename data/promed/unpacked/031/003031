The health ministry of Namibia announced this morning [Wed 20 Dec 2017] the death of one person from hepatitis E virus while 26 others tested positive for the virus in Windhoek. According to health minister Bernard Haufiku, 8 more cases are pending as authorities are still waiting for results.

"All 26 patients are from the Windhoek district, but from different residential areas. 16 are from Havana, 6 from Goreangab Dam, while the rest are from Hakana, Greewell Matongo, and Ombili," he said. Haufiku further said the transmission of the virus is through faecal contaminated water and environmental contamination due to poor sanitation. The minister could however not say in which location the death has occurred.

The ministry, in collaboration with the WHO and UNICEF has called on any person with acute illness typically including acute jaundice, dark urine, anorexia, malaise, extreme fatigue, and right upper quadrant tenderness to visit their nearest health facility.

[Borrowing Mod.YA's comment from the original ProMED/EAFR post on this outbreak, "Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). The virus is transmitted via the faecal-oral route, principally via drinking contaminated water. The virus is shed in the stools of infected persons, and enters the human body through the intestine. Usually the infection is self-limiting and resolves within 2-6 weeks. Occasionally a serious disease, known as fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) develops, and a proportion of people with this disease can die (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/).

"This disease happens because there are several ways for oral-fecal transmission of disease to occur in Africa. Broken sewer lines that get their effluents washed into homes are very common in many African communities; the lack of proper toilets and treated piped borne water cause these diseases. Fixing these problems will go a long way in resolving the outbreak of diseases like Hepatitis E.
