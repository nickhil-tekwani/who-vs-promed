-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to offer the following comments on this posting.

The limitations of the phylogenetic analyses based on the assumptions
used in the evolutionary model and a limited number of available
sequences, as performed by Smith et al. (1), are generally well-known
and accepted by those working in this field -- it is rarely possible
to obtain and sequence all the relevant samples/sequences of the
pathogen concerned over the period under investigation.

Yet the problems of missing data cuts both ways. In their
characterisation of the 1918 influenza virus, Taubenberger's team also
analysed relatively few sequences of a virus that may have killed
anything between 20-40 million people (2,3). Thus, one could argue
that the few sequences of the 1918 virus obtained could just be
representative of a limited number of human cases caused by a
specific, pure avian H1N1 influenza virus (like the relatively few
human cases of avian H5N1 cases which have occurred in the presently
far more widespread global H1N1/2009 pandemic).

Whilst influenza sequences may never be available from before 1918,
drawing a parallel with our now 12-year experience with avian H5N1
influenza never efficiently crossing over into the human population
(Smith et al. suggest that the various gene components of the
pre-pandemic viruses could have circulated for 2-15 years before
emerging as a pandemic strain), it makes it less and less likely that
a purely avian influenza virus could have crossed over into the human
population with such a high level of transmissibility to cause the
1918 pandemic.
