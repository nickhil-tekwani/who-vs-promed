Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: testing at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) on samples from outbreaks number BC-2014-NAI-001 and BC-2014-NAI-002 was performed: RT-PCR and partial sequencing of the H and N gene segments indicates a poly-basic cleavage site in H5 consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and the virus being a H5N2 avian influenza virus with an IVPI [intravenous pathogenicity index] of 2.96-2.98. The CFIA has also confirmed H5 avian influenza virus in 3 additional farms (outbreak number BC-2014-NAI-003, BC-2014-NAI-004 and BC-2014-NAI-005) with clinical signs. Farms from outbreak number BC-2014-NAI-001, BC-2014-NAI-002, BC-2014-NAI-003 and BC-2014-NAI-004 have been humanely depopulated. At this point, this event is limited geographically to a portion of the Fraser Valley in the southern fringe of the province of British Columbia. Infected premises were quarantined by the CFIA and a stamping out policy is being implemented, as described in the Notifiable Avian Influenza (NAI) Hazard Specific Plan. The Canadian Notifiable Avian Influenza Surveillance System (CanNAISS) is an ongoing surveillance system built to demonstrate absence of NAI in poultry in Canada. CanNAISS results and epidemiological investigation to date are supporting that there is no evidence of infection outside of the Fraser Valley in British Columbia. On 8 Dec 2014, the CFIA established a primary control zone in the area where the disease has been identified. The primary control zone is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the United States border, on the north by Highway 16, and on the east by the border between British Columbia and Alberta. Additional information on the zone and the restrictions in place are available at http://www.inspection.gc.ca/an.imals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/statement-2014-12-08/eng/1418073266291/1418073267337.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 3 Dec 2014 / Positive
Birds / virus isolation / 4 Dec 2014 / Positive
Birds / Virus sequencing / 4 Dec 2014/ Positive
Birds / intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) test / 6 Dec 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The following information was obtained from the link provided in the epidemiological comment section of the report, http://www.inspection.gc.ca/an.imals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/statement-2014-12-08/eng/1418073266291/1418073267337: "In order to prevent the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza in British Columbia, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has established a primary control zone in the area where the disease has been identified.

The Province of British Columbia and the poultry industry support this decision and are working together with the CFIA to implement it.

Avian influenza is highly contagious between birds and can spread rapidly. Because southern British Columbia has a high concentration of poultry operations, the primary control zone covers an area beyond the premises that are currently affected.

The primary control zone is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the United States border, on the north by Highway 16, and on the east by the border between British Columbia and Alberta. A map is available on the CFIA website at http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/primary-control-zone/eng/1418041742117/1418041743149.

The primary control zone is divided into 3 disease control zones: infected, restricted, and security.
- The outer boundary of an infected zone is up to 3 km [2 mi] from any known infected premises.
- The restricted zone is established surrounding the infected zone and measured based on the epidemiology of the disease in order to prevent the spread of avian influenza (3 km to 10 km [2-6 mi]).
- The security zone is the remainder of the primary control zone (beyond 10 km [6 mi]).

The 3 zones represent relative levels of risk and movement restrictions vary accordingly. Most of the restrictions apply to the infected and restricted zones because of the greater potential that the virus can spread.

The movement restrictions apply to:
- captive birds (including but not limited to poultry, fowl, and pet birds);
- poultry products or by-products;
- anything that has been exposed to captive birds (which could include but is not limited to feed, vehicles, equipment, or clothing).

All movement of captive birds in and out of, and through this zone is strictly controlled and requires a permit from the CFIA (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/primary-control-zone/permits/eng/1418042485013/1418042485919). The movement restrictions also apply to poultry products and by-products and material that has come into contact with captive birds.

Avian influenza viruses do not pose risks to food safety when poultry and poultry products are properly handled and cooked. Avian influenza rarely affects humans that do not have consistent contact with infected birds. Public health authorities stand ready to take precautionary measures as warranted.

Poultry farmers are urged to take an active role in protecting their flocks by employing strict biosecurity measures on their property, and immediately reporting any suspicious symptoms to the CFIA."
