From: Dr Irene Lai <iwlai@attglobal.net>

My colleague in the International SOS Delhi office contacted Dr Shaukat
Kamal, assistant director, NICD (National Institute of Communicable
Diseases ), Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, to get further information on this
posting.
The information received is that at Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, there have
been 26 confirmed deaths attributed to Japanese encephalitis infection.
There are 128 cases detected so far in this region between 16 Jul 2004 till
today (21 Sep 2004). In addition, in the Sitapur district, the mystery
fever is again suspected to be Japanese encephalitis. However, this report
is yet to be confirmed.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Irene Lai for initiating an
investigation to provide follow-up on this ongoing outbreak of "undiagnosed
deaths" in Uttar Pradesh. Of note, the symptom complex originally described
in the newswires in our 1st posting (see reference below) were: fever,
"shivering", followed by dysentery and vomiting. If Japanese encephalitis
is confirmed as the etiology of this outbreak, it serves as a further
reminder of the non-specific nature of gastroenteritic symptoms when
formulating differential diagnosis lists for the etiologies of "undiagnosed
outbreaks" from newswire reports. Japanese encephalitis, a
vaccine-preventable disease caused by a flavivirus, is endemic to and
occurs annually in this region of India. Case fatality rates (CFR) have
been reported in the range of 10 to 40 per cent -- the newswire reports of
this outbreak give a CFR of 48 per cent, while the figures provided by Dr
Lai yield a CFR of 20 per cent. We await final confirmation of the etiology
of this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
