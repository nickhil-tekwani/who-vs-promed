[Outbreaks were reported in Boukoumbe in 2007 and 2009. The true situation in Benin is unclear, as there is a history of under-reporting. Boukoumbe is on the northern border with Togo and not distant from the outbreaks there. We can assume that the same modes of livestock management occur in these adjoining regions and with the same basic epidemiology of this disease. If you know one, you will know the other. Why the surviving member of this small herd was slaughtered is unclear. It is an unnecessary act in a number of 3rd world countries. If the authorities can mobilise 2000 doses of vaccine, they could presumably have treated this animal with antibiotics on the presumption that it might have been incubating disease, and before leaving the area, could have vaccinated it.

It is a stone's throw from the Togo border.

There are no ProMED reports of anthrax in Benin, but there are 2 for neighbouring Togo; see below. - Mod.MHJ
