[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- the scope of
the occasional ProMED-mail updates has been broadened to include other
prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on other forms of
CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of Mon 7 Nov
2011 has risen to 175. One definite/probable patient remains alive, so
the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive)
is 176.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD
outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was
28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9
in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, 1 in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in
2010, and now 4 so far in 2011.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2011
--------------------
During 2011 so far [as of 7 Nov 2011], there have been 132 referrals,
67 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 2 cases of GSS, 7 cases of familial
CJD, 4 cases of vCJD, and 3 cases of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2865 referrals, 1282
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 175 cases of vCJD, 90 cases of familial
CJD, 68 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 45 cases of GSS.

[2] Alzheimer's a prion disease?
Date: Wed 5 Oct 2011
Source: Medical News Today [edited]
http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/235493.php


The brain damage seen in some cases of Alzheimer's disease could have
its roots in an infectious prion-like disease, such as that seen in
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow) and its human form
[variant] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), according to an
international study published this week in the Journal Molecular
Psychiatry that was led by the University of Texas Medical School at
Houston in the US.

The researchers injected a small amount of Alzheimer's human brain
tissue into the brains of mice bred never to develop this kind of
brain alteration and found the animals gradually developed the disease
and that it spread to other parts of the brain.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of senile dementia. It
affects memory, thinking and behavior, and gets worse with time. The 2
main hallmarks of the disease are build-up in the brain of misfolded
amyloid beta protein, and twisted fibers of tau protein.

In the US, there are 5.4 million people with Alzheimer's disease,
where according to the Alzheimer's Association, it is the 6th leading
cause of death and the only cause of death among the top 10 in the US
that cannot be prevented, cured or even slowed.

90 percent of cases are of the sporadic type, that is they appear to
occur in a random way (not like cases of infectious diseases that
spread).

Although there is compelling evidence that build-up of misfolded
amyloid beta is a major factor in the disease, we know very little
about what might trigger this in otherwise normal proteins, except
that in prion diseases like mad cow disease and [variant] CJD, the
damage is also due to accumulation of misfolded versions of otherwise
normal proteins. Prions are infectious misfolded proteins (the word
prion comes from the 1st 2 letters of protein and the last 3 of
infection).

Senior author Dr Claudio Soto, professor of neurology at The
University of Texas Medical School at Houston, said in a statement:
"The underlying mechanism of Alzheimer's disease is very similar to
the prion diseases. It involves a normal protein that becomes
misshapen and is able to spread by transforming good proteins to bad
ones. The bad proteins accumulate in the brain, forming plaque
deposits that are believed to kill neuron cells in Alzheimer's," he
added.

For their study, Soto and colleagues injected brain tissue from a
confirmed Alzheimer's patient into mice, which, without exposure to
such material, would never develop these alterations. They also
injected a similar amount of brain tissue into a 2nd group of
similarly bred mice, except in that group (the controls), the injected
tissue came from someone who did not have Alzheimer's. The results
showed that none of the control mice went on to develop signs of
Alzheimer's, while all those injected with Alzheimer's brain tissue
developed plaques and other hallmarks of the disease.

"The accumulation of [amyloid beta] deposits increased progressively
with the time after inoculation, and the [amyloid beta] lesions were
observed in brain areas far from the injection site," write the
researchers. They conclude that these findings suggest some of the
typical brain abnormalities seen in Alzheimer's disease "can be
induced by a prion-like mechanism of disease transmission through
propagation of protein misfolding."

This could have "broad implications" for understanding the underlying
mechanisms that trigger Alzheimer's and may help develop ways to
prevent and treat the disease, they added. "We are currently working
on whether disease transmission can happen in real life under more
natural routes of exposure," said Soto.

The abstract reads: "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of
senile dementia, is associated [with] the build-up of misfolded
amyloid-B (AB) in the brain. Although compelling evidence indicates
that the misfolding and oligomerization of AB is the triggering event
in AD, the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of AB
accumulation are unknown. In this study, we show that AB deposition
can be induced by injection of AD brain extracts into animals, which,
without exposure to this material, will never develop these
alterations. The accumulation of AB deposits increased progressively
with the time after inoculation, and the AB lesions were observed in
brain areas far from the injection site. Our results suggest that some
of the typical brain abnormalities associated with AD can be induced
by a prion-like mechanism of disease transmission through propagation
of protein misfolding. These findings may have broad implications for
understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the initiation
of AD and may contribute to the development of new strategies for
disease prevention and intervention."

While these experiments associate the development of an
Alzheimer's-like disease in laboratory mice with the presence of
amyloid-B deposition, they do not shed light on the origin of the
initial misfolding form of the amyloid-B protein. - Mod.CP]

Editorial: The European Response to BSE: A Success Story By Herbert
Budka, Member and Vice-Chair of EFSA's Panel on Biological Hazards
(BIOHAZ)
------------------------------------
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, "mad cow disease") was
officially 1st reported in November 1986 in the UK. It became quickly
interpreted as a likely counterpart in bovines of scrapie, the
paramount transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE, prion disease)
in sheep and goats. A landmark epidemiological study by John Wilesmith
and co-workers (Wilesmith et al., 1988) identified in 1988 cattle
feedstuffs containing ruminant-derived protein (meat-bone meal, MBM)
as source for the evolving epidemic that numbered almost 185 000
diagnosed cases in total in the UK and a further 5500 elsewhere in the
EU, with some 2 million infected bovines estimated to have entered the
human food chain in the UK. The 1st UK response was a ban on feeding
MBM to ruminants, as a measure that significantly curbed but did not
eliminate the epidemic.

A likely link between BSE and the human disease variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was published in early April 1996
(Will et al., 1996), followed by a media outbreak of apocalyptic
scenarios sketching a man-made disaster of then unpredictable
proportions. Health authorities were frantically acting to limit
damage from BSE not only to human health, but also to agriculture,
economies, political credibility and public confidence. In the UK, the
Phillips Inquiry (Lord Phillips et al., 2000) took 2.5 years to accrue
insight into why and how the BSE saga developed. The key conclusions
depicted BSE as a consequence of intense farming practices, with
significant shortcomings in the way things were done, with sensible
measures taken that were not always timely and adequately implemented
and enforced, and implicitly guided by the belief that BSE was not a
real threat to human health. Moreover, there was too much secrecy and
unjustified reassurance by governmental bodies in order to protect the
agricultural industry.

Almost simultaneously with publication of the Phillips Report, the 2nd
public BSE crisis started in 2000 when 1st results of active BSE
surveillance on the European continent confirmed scientists' opinion
that political claims of "freedom from BSE" in several countries were
wishful thinking rather than reality. As a result, the EU TSE
Regulation of 2001 laid down a comprehensive set of harmonised rules
for the prevention, control and eradication of TSEs, including an
EU-wide total ban on the feeding of animal proteins to farmed animals.
More or less independent national food safety authorities were now
established in most EU countries, and the need to separate risk
assessment from risk management could no longer be ignored.

Since the 1st BSE crisis of 1996, the European Commission (EC) has
embarked on a science-guided response, establishing a TSE/BSE ad hoc
Group of their Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) that provided up to
2003 a plethora of opinions on all aspects of BSE and other TSEs (SSC,
1997-2003). The SSC was a risk assessment and risk advisory body,
separated from risk management, which remained with the EC Directorate
General for Health & Consumers (DG SANCO). From December 1997, the SSC
adopted their 1st important documents on the scientific basis to
protect human health from BSE, such as the definition of tissues
containing most of infectious TSE agents (prions), termed Specific
Risk Materials (SRM). Regrettably, politicians in several EU Member
States (MS) were then unwilling to translate this into legislation,
still sticking to their "freedom from BSE" illusion. It was only after
a delay of almost 3 years that the EU-wide SRM ban, the most important
measure to protect public health from BSE, was implemented. Since
2003, EFSA has taken over the role of science-based advice to the EC
on BSE/TSE-related matters, with the BIOHAZ Panel producing an equally
impressive amount of opinions and reports (EFSA, 2003-2011) as the
former SSC. As a whole, these scientific risk assessments -- 1st by
the SCC, then by EFSA -- and their translation into adequate measures
by national and EC risk managers were the basis of the European
response to BSE, which has been a spectacular success story. This is
evident from quantitative data on both the animal and human disease.
1st, the prevalence of BSE as detected by current surveillance has
come down steadily in the EU to a trickle, from several thousands of
cases in the early 2000s, to 44 in 2010 in the EU (11 in the UK) (OIE,
2011). Secondly, surveillance of vCJD in the UK indicates that the
epidemic, having reached a peak in the year 2000 when there were 28
deaths, has declined to a current incidence of about one
diagnosis/death per year (Andrews, 2011). Clearly, it is now time to
be reassured but still too early for complacency (Budka et al.,
2008).

Given the quantitative indicators of what seems, in the EU, to be the
near-extinction of the animal epidemic and control of cattle-to-human
transmission, is there anything left for concern?

Unfortunately, there is. With BSE, the global disease burden is far
from clear in countries with less well-developed surveillance. In
humans, the potential for continuing person-to-person spread by blood
and blood products remains a problem as seen with the 4 cases of
transfusion-associated vCJD infection to date (Andrews, 2011). With
BSE and other TSEs in animals, the recognition of the wide diversity
of prion strains in the field, including 3 new forms of animal TSEs
(L-type Atypical BSE, H-type Atypical BSE and Atypical scrapie), has
complicated disease diagnosis and surveillance, as well as scientific
assessment of their potential risks to humans. EFSA and the European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recently delivered a
scientific opinion on any possible epidemiological or molecular
association between TSEs in animals and humans (EFSA Panel on
Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) and ECDC, 2011). This opinion confirmed
Classical BSE prions as the only TSE agents demonstrated to be
zoonotic so far, but the possibility that a small proportion of human
cases so far classified as "sporadic" CJD are of zoonotic origin could
not be excluded. Moreover, transmission experiments to non-human
primates suggest that some TSE agents in addition to Classical BSE
prions in cattle (namely L-type Atypical BSE, Classical BSE in sheep,
Transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) and Chronic wasting disease
(CWD) agents) might have zoonotic potential. In particular, the L-type
Atypical BSE agent might be similarly or even more virulent to humans
than the Classical BSE agent. While humankind has been in contact with
the major TSE of small ruminants for centuries, there is no
epidemiological evidence to suggest that classical scrapie is
zoonotic; however, experimental transmission data on humanised mice
and non-human primates have been very scarce so far.

What does this mean for the future? The decline of the BSE epidemic
seen by 2005 led to consideration of some relaxation of costly BSE
control measures as depicted in the EU TSE Roadmap (EC, 2005), and
will inevitably be followed by further relaxation as already outlined
in another EU TSE Roadmap 2 of 2010 (EC, 2010). It remains critical
that current levels of consumer protection are maintained and all
future changes from well established and highly effective current risk
management measures are based upon sound scientific advice that EFSA
will continue to provide.

Which old issues will remain, and which new issues will become
relevant? For Atypical BSE, the most widely accepted hypothesis is
that of a spontaneously arising ("sporadic") disease in relatively old
bovines. If this holds true, it will be impossible to eradicate such a
disease which originates de novo; probably, we then have to live
forever with a ban on SRMs, in particular the central nervous system
(CNS), of older cattle. Given our insufficient knowledge about the
true prevalence of atypical animal prion strains in the field, it will
be important to continue and improve the systematic surveillance of
animal TSEs, and to refine our diagnostic and laboratory methods and
experiments. As some scientific data suggest that there is probably no
absolute molecular barrier to transmission of TSE agents between
mammalian species (EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) and ECDC,
2011), the issue of a zoonotic potential of prions is likely to remain
with us for some time. For human TSEs, including sporadic CJD, it will
be important to continue systematic surveillance that should be able,
as clearly shown with vCJD in the past, eventually to identify
emerging new phenotypes or new prion strains. In sum, at a time when
many scientists and most decision makers are no longer interested in
prions and their risk, it will be prudent to stay vigilant, although
this must be in a way that is balanced with other risks to human and
animal health. In the risk assessment area, this will continue to be a
challenge for EFSA in the years to come.

[4] vCJD risk analysis
Date: Tue 1 Nov 2011
Source: Daily Mail [abbreviated & edited]
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2055904/Could-face-return-CJD-Experts-fear-lie-dormant-thousands.html


New evidence collected by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) suggests
that one in 4000 people who were eating meat before 1996 is probably
carrying [the vCJD prion]; after that date, cattle infected with mad
cow disease were, theoretically, removed from the food chain).

Other estimates have suggested that as many as 15 000 people
nationwide could be affected [i.e. carry the vCJD prion]. While this
is in line with a previous survey, the latest findings suggest vCJD
might be more prevalent in older people. The findings -- which
received little publicity when published a few weeks ago -- are
mid-way results of a programme testing 30 000 samples of tonsil and
appendix tissue removed during routine operations across the country
[see part [4] of ProMED-mail Prion disease update 2011 (08) 20110905.2710, and part [5] of Prion disease update 2011 (09) 20111003.2983]. The aim was to look for evidence of "silent" or
symptom-free infection, though scientists admit the method used in the
tests cannot identify vCJD with total accuracy.

Until recently, a definite diagnosis of the disease in people who have
the symptoms could be made only after death, because brain tissue
analysis was required. However, John Collinge, a professor of
neurology and a leading expert at the UK Government's CJD research
unit at University College, London, has developed a blood test which
can check whether the disease is present by detecting evidence of the
so-called prions or infectious proteins known to cause the disease
(see part [6] of ProMED-mail Prion disease update 2011 (02) 20110211.0473). He believes the number of people infected could be as
high as one in 1000 and says the CJD situation is "very worrying
indeed."

Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), 1st
emerged in Britain in 1986 as a result of "cannibalism," when beef
offal was fed to cattle, which are natural grass-eaters. The proteins,
called prions, that cause BSE were found in large quantities in the
brains, spinal cords and spleens of cattle (although they were also
subsequently discovered in meat tissue). When animal carcasses were
ground down to form feed stuff for other cattle, prions were passed
on. They then colonised the brains of the cattle which ate them, and
were passed to humans via cheap, mechanically recovered meat -- such
as processed sinews and offal that were used at the time in school
dinners and baby food. In humans, the prions triggered the development
of a new form of fatal human dementia called new variant CJD, which
was 1st identified in 1996.

Prions are basically faulty versions of healthy proteins in brain and
nervous tissue that then induce their neighbours to become faulty. As
a result, the brain cannot function: all signals are disrupted or shut
down completely, leading to almost certain death.

By the mid-1990s, when vCJD fears were at their height, up to 3.5
million people were believed to possibly be affected. The risk
appeared to be greater in younger people, although the reason isn't
clear. But as new cases failed to materialise, it was considered that
the danger had passed. However, the new data from the Health
Protection Agency suggests the rate of infection is much higher than
currently thought.

But it is not only the threat of a wide-scale re-emergence of the
infection that worries experts. There is also the possibility of a new
generation being exposed to the disease, as a result of a European
Union decision to change the rules on animal feed.

The new concern is not cattle, however, but pigs and chickens. Earlier
this summer [2011], the European Commission announced it was relaxing
the ban on using animal remains in livestock feed. From next year,
chicken meat will be used in pig feed and vice versa, to cut costs for
farmers who otherwise have to rely on expensive imported soya beans
for growth-promoting protein-based animal foods. Although CJD emerged
from beef, experts say there is evidence of related diseases affecting
other meat-producing animals if they are forced into cannibalism.

Normal sterilising techniques do not remove the abnormal proteins
which cause vCJD from surgical or dental instruments because they
survive high temperatures. There have been at least 6 transmissions
from hospital operations and 4 cases of CJD infections passed from 3
different blood donors. All those infected in these ways have died.

A spokesman for the NHS Blood Service said it was in talks with
Professor Collinge about using his test to screen the 7000 blood
donations collected daily across the country but could not say when
the work would be done to develop a tool capable of bulk screening.
Professor Collinge says blood will certainly already have been donated
by infected donors. "I think the possibility of a lethal infection in
one in 4000 blood donors is very worrying. People wouldn't accept that
level of risk if it was HIV."

The Government's experts have extrapolated the Health Protection
Agency's data and suggested at least 15 000 people are carrying vCJD,
though they agree the exact figure is unknown, and other experts
believe up to 60 000 could be affected. Meanwhile, Azra Ghani,
professor of infectious disease epidemiology at London's Imperial
College, says the potential harm from symptom-free vCJD carriers is
impossible to predict. "It's a waiting game with any new infection. We
just don't know if these people will be infectious or not."

[The monthly CJD statistics released by the French Institut de Veille
Sanitaire have not been updated since 26 May 2011. Up to that date, a
total of 25 cases of confirmed or probable vCJD had been recorded in
France since records began in 1992. There was one case in 1996, one in
2000, one in 2001, 3 in 2002, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in 2006, 3 in
2007, 2 in 2009. There have been none in 2010 and 2011. Therefore,
these reports will no longer be posted routinely in ProMED-mail,
unless a new case of vCJD is diagnosed.

The US National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center's "Table
of cumulative case numbers" has not been updated since 19 Aug 2011.
Since no cases of vCJD have been recorded in the USA up to that time,
routine reports will likewise be discontinued. - Mod.CP]
