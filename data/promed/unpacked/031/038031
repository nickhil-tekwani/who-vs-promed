Bird Flu outbreak is identified in the Altay Region of Siberia (Russia)
-------------------------------------------------
According to the news agency "Interfax Siberia", the local veterinary
department has announced on Wednesday [12 May 2004] that the disease was
discovered in pigeons. Pigeons can transfer this virus, which is regarded
to be lethal for birds, to chickens.

The city is on quarantine while additional preventive measures have been
launched. This includes a ban upon export of eggs and poultry for sale. The
quarantine will be extended until 22 May 2004, and if necessary longer.
