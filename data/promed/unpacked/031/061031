[The following commentary is excerpted from http://www.fao.org/ppr/en/:

"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), also known as sheep and goat plague, is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants. Once introduced, the virus can infect up to 90 per cent of an animal herd, and the disease kills anywhere from 30 to 70 per cent of infected animals. The PPR virus does not infect humans.

PPR was 1st described in 1942 in Cote d'Ivoire. Since then, the disease has spread to large regions in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Today, a total of 76 countries in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent have confirmed PPR within their borders, and many countries are at risk of the disease being introduced. These regions are home to approximately 1.7 billion head -- roughly 80 per cent -- of the global population of sheep and goats.

FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) are mobilizing the international community around a new global initiative: the fight to eradicate PPR by 2030. FAO's ultimate goal is to facilitate the eradication PPR and to sustainably improve small ruminant production in order to benefit food and nutrition security and strengthen the livelihood resilience of rural women and men."
