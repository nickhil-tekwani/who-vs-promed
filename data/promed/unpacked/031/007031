Cutaneous infection caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ in Larissa, Thessaly, Central Greece, July 2012 [edited]
--------------------------------------------
A Stefos1, et al. Department of Medicine and Research Laboratory of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Thessaly, Thessaly, Greece

In July 2012, a confirmed case of cutaneous anthrax infection in a stockbreeder in the prefecture of Larissa, Thessaly, Central Greece was reported. The investigation revealed 5 related deaths in animals (2 dogs and 3 sheep). Control measures have been taken immediately in order to prevent further spread in humans and animals.

Epidemiological investigation
The stockbreeder was contaminated after having handled the slaughtered sheep due to direct contact with the infected animal. He had flayed the animal together with his wife and then fed 2 dogs with the contaminated meat. These dogs died during the next day. After 36 hours, the specific anthrax cutaneous lesions appeared on the exposed area of the stockbreeder's skin. Since 7 Jul 2012, 2 more sheep have died in the same herd. No other death occurred in this or any other herd in the same village (Tsabournia).

It can be assumed that the stockbreeder's wife was also exposed to the spores of the infected animal. However, she did not present any signs or symptoms of infection and is now under post-exposure prophylactic treatment.

Control measures
The stockbreeder's wife hasn't developed any symptoms during the maximum incubation period of 15 days but is currently receiving post-exposure prophylaxis. The residents of the village (Tsabournia) have been informed about this case in order to recognise early clinical symptoms of anthrax, and they were advised to seek medical treatment immediately if anthrax was suspected. The local health centre and general practitioners are aware of this need for careful monitoring. Special directions have been given to the stockbreeders of Tsabournia regarding the use of protective equipment. The local Veterinary Authority has taken measures for the correct disposal of animal carcasses, including disinfection of contaminated material and decontamination of the environment. Mass vaccination of 7000 animals is currently in progress.

Background Information
The number of reported human cases remained at around 25 cases per year during a 10-year period (1995-2004) and has since decreased even more (2005: 10 cases, 2006: 16 cases, 2007: 5 cases, 2008: 3 cases, 2009: 14 cases). In the last 4 years, several reports of anthrax infections in heroin drug users have been reported in European countries.

Until 1979, Greece, particularly the northern part of the country, was considered as an enzootic zone for anthrax. Although the number of animal outbreaks between 1970 and 1979 had declined to almost a quarter of that of the previous decade (1960-1969), there were 300 outbreaks a year, mostly involving sheep. During this period, there were 8475 sheep and 1675 bovine losses in 3669 separate outbreaks. During the same period, 482 human anthrax cases occurred in the country, and all patients were from rural areas. The highest incidences were observed in the prefectures of Aetoloakarnania, Evros, Ioannina, Larissa, Rodopy and Thessaloniki. Since then, strict control measures have eliminated the disease, and only sporadic cases in animals and humans have been reported. According to the epidemiological reports from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only 38 confirmed human cases of anthrax were reported between 1994 and 2010. However, it should be stated that although anthrax is included in the notifiable diseases, and every suspected case should be reported to the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP), there is some degree of underreporting, and the low number of reported cases does not allow general conclusions regarding the accurate incidence trend.

Thessaly is a rural region located in Central Greece and includes 4 prefectures (Karditsa, Larissa, Magnesia, Trikala). The estimated number of goats and sheep in this region is above 2 million. The large majority of them (more than one million goats and sheep) are farmed in Larissa prefecture. According to the records of the local Veterinary Authority of Larissa, 3 outbreaks of anthrax have been reported in Larissa in the past 35 years (in 1978, in 2000, and in 2006) (unpublished data). All of them occurred in [flocks] kept in 2 villages (Livadi and Tsabournia) situated at a distance of 35 km from each other in the area of Elassona, Larissa prefecture. Approximately 90 animals were affected in total, and the outbreaks were contained after correct disposal of animal carcasses and vaccination of exposed animals. According to the epidemiological data of the Veterinary Authority, no case of anthrax in animals or humans has ever been declared in the other 3 prefectures of Thessaly.

In 1978, anthrax infection was confirmed in animals of 3 different herds in Tsabournia. However, no human infection has been reported. Vaccination and appropriate control measures have been taken; since then until the incident described here, no other anthrax case in animals or in humans has been reported.

[In the past few years, the human incidence in rural Greece has fallen to modest numbers, at last. For too long, the livestock and human incidence in Greece was far too high. They are to be congratulated. But it is a fragile situation and could easily revert to what it was, and out of sight of the authorities if the disease is under-reported. One of the problems with sheep diseases is that conditions are missed, and control can be slack because sheep are perceived to be kept by the poor and not the rich, by women and not by men. Disease control responses are seldom triggered by the single sheep, or 2 or 3, found dead, and then one is behind the curve.

Dogs are normally fairly resistant to this disease, but cases occur as probably in this instance, when the 2 dogs had access to the viscera of the butchered sheep. Traditionally, we used to see canine anthrax in retired foxhounds kept by the hunt staff. The fox hunts depend(ed) [the present situation of fox hunting in the UK is obscured] on dead stock contributed by the local farmers. And these carcasses would be butchered by the huntsmen and fed to the pack of hounds. In the US, it has occurred when a veterinarian necropsying a carcass hasn't tied up his dog, essentially the same circumstances. - Mod.MHJ
