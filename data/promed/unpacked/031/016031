Bali's provincial government will consider mass vaccination of cats
following the death of a 13-year-old Buleleng girl from rabies
following a cat bite. It was the 1st recorded human rabies case
involving a cat. She was bitten 3 months ago while trying to separate
her pet cat and a stray cat that were fighting and died 10 days ago
in Buleleng General Hospital, Singaraja. [Reported previously in
ProMED-mail post: "Rabies, human - Indonesia (04): (Bali)". - Mod.CP]

The government said at the weekend [22-23 May 2010] the mass cat
vaccination programme would be implemented immediately, ahead of
results of laboratory tests to confirm rabies. Government spokesman
Ketut Teneng said if the tests indicated rabies had spread to cats a
culling programme might be implemented along the same lines as that
directed at stray dogs. The government still had a target of a
rabies-free Bali in 2012.

Teneng said it was now vital to raise public awareness of the rabies
risk to people from dogs, cats, and monkeys. He said on Sunday [22
May 2010] that the provincial government had vaccinated 280 000 dogs
and killed about 78 000 in culling programmes to eliminate rabid or
possibly rabid animals.

The provincial health office says on latest figures 57 people have
died after being bitten by dogs and 26 of these tested positive for
rabies, an [almost] invariably fatal disease once symptoms appear.
The health office has recorded 44 000 human vaccination courses
following dog bites since rabies was first confirmed as present in
Bali in November 2008 after several unexplained deaths with
rabies-like symptoms in the Ungasan area of the Bukit.

[Since the death of the 13-year-old Buleleng girl from rabies
following a cat bite, reported previously in ProMED-mail on 17 May
2010, the officially acknowledged human death toll from rabies virus
infection has increased from 50 to 57. (It is not clear if the latter
figure includes the single death from cat bite).

Considerable progress has been achieved in control of rabies in dogs
by an island-wide programme of vaccinating and culling dogs, and the
vaccination of cats is becoming a new priority. Since its appearance
in Bali in 2008 rabies has spread to all regencies of the island
except Jembrana in the northwest, which is still officially free of
the disease. Tabanan is the worst affected regency. The government
had a target now of achieving a rabies-free Bali by 2012.
