[American foulbrood (AFB) is an infectious disease of the larval stage of the honey bee _Apis mellifera_ and other _Apis_ spp, and occurs throughout the world where such bees are kept. _Paenibacillus larvae_, the causative organism, is a Gram positive bacterium that can produce over one billion spores in each infected larva. The bacterium is a round-ended, straight and sometimes curved rod, which varies greatly in size (0.5 microns wide by 1.5 to 6 microns long), occurring singly and in chains and filaments; some strains are motile. The sporangia are often sparse in vitro, and the ellipsoidal, central to subterminal spores, which may swell the sporangia, are often found free. The spores are extremely heat stable and resistant to chemical agents. Only spores are capable of inducing the disease. See the OIE terrestrial manual, Chapter 2.2.2 on AFB at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.02_AMERICAN_FOULBROOD.pdf (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014).

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to Infection of honey bees with _Paenibacillus larvae_ (American foulbrood) are spelled out in chapter 9.2. of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_paenibacillus_larvae.htm.

Given the worldwide decline in bee populations, the OIE has dedicated its latest Bulletin to this issue (Bulletin no 2, 2014: "Protecting bees, preserving our future," available at http://tinyurl.com/lv2ly6o).
