The FDA, along with CDC, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and state and local partners, is investigating a multistate outbreak of hepatitis A infections in the USA and Canada potentially linked to fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo and HEB, purchased between 5 Mar 2022 and 25 Apr 2022.

Currently, the potentially affected FreshKampo and HEB products are past shelf life. People who purchased FreshKampo and HEB fresh organic strawberries between 5 Mar 2022 and 25 Apr 2022 and then froze those strawberries for later consumption should not eat them. These products were sold at the following retailers, including, but not limited to
- Aldi
- HEB
- Kroger
- Safeway
- Sprouts Farmers Market
- Trader Joe's
- Walmart
- Weis Markets
- WinCo Foods

If you are unsure of what brand you purchased, when you purchased your strawberries, or where you purchased them prior to freezing them, the strawberries should be thrown away.

Epidemiologic and traceback data show that fresh organic strawberries sold as FreshKampo and HEB brands that were purchased between 5 Mar 2022 and 25 Apr 2022 are a likely cause of illness in this outbreak. The traceback investigations show that cases in California, Minnesota, and Canada report having purchased fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo or HEB prior to becoming ill. Illness onset dates range from 28 Mar 2022 - 30 Apr 2022.

As this investigation is ongoing, additional products may be included. More information will be provided in this advisory as it becomes available.

Recommendation
Consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not sell, serve, or eat any fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo or HEB if purchased between 5 Mar 2022 and 25 Apr 2022. People who purchased the fresh strawberries and then froze those strawberries for later consumption should not eat them. They should be thrown away. Currently, the potentially affected product is past its shelf life. If you are unsure of what brand you purchased, when you purchased your strawberries, or where you purchased them from prior to freezing them, the strawberries should be thrown away.

If consumers who purchased fresh organic strawberries branded as FreshKampo or HEB between 5 Mar 2022 and 25 Apr 2022 ate those berries in the last 2 weeks and have not been vaccinated against hepatitis A, they should immediately consult with their healthcare professional to determine whether post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is needed. PEP is recommended for unvaccinated people who have been exposed to hepatitis A virus in the last 2 weeks, because vaccination can prevent a hepatitis A infection if given within 14 days of exposure. Those with evidence of previous hepatitis A vaccination or previous hepatitis A infection do not require PEP.

Contact your healthcare provider if you think you may have symptoms of a hepatitis A infection after eating these fresh organic strawberries, or if you believe that you have eaten these strawberries in the last 2 weeks.
