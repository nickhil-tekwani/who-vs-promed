FAO WRLFMD Genotyping Report of 20 Nov 2015, FMDV type O, Morocco, BATCH: WRLFMD/20154/00030, 3 samples
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The report addresses the following 3 genotyped samples from Morocco (all received at WRL on 12 Nov 2015):
WRLFMD Ref No // locality, region // collection date // species // topotype // strain
----------------------------------------------------------------------
O/MOR/1/2015 // Bouhmame village, Sidi Bennour province // 28 Oct 2015 // bovine // ME-SA // Ind-2001d
O/MOR/2/2015 // Bouhmame village, Sidi Bennour province // 28 Oct 2015 // bovine // ME-SA // Ind-2001d
O/MOR/3/2015 // Bouhmame village, Sidi Bennour province // 28 Oct 2015 // bovine // ME-SA // Ind-2001d

All the 10 most closely related viruses, presented in a table (available at the source URL above), belong to the strain/genotype FMDV O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d.

The most closely related reference virus was found to be O/BHU/3/2009 (topotype ME-SA, strain Ind-2001d). Details of the other 9 listed reference strains, can be found at the source URL above.

[The published WRLFMD genotyping results indicate that the current event is caused by the same FMDV O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d lineage which has spread since 2013 from the Indian sub-continent into United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, and later and more widely, into North African countries (Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and, currently, Morocco).

In the September 2014 issue of the monthly FMD situation report, a summary of vaccine matching data generated at WRLFMD was published. It addressed 5 vaccine strains of which only one fully matched the Indian field strain, 2 were "borderline", and 2, which had been included in the mass vaccinations, failed to match the Algerian and Tunisian isolates. According to the results of these matching tests, including Libyan, Nepali, Saudi, UAE, Algerian, and Tunisian isolates, the highest matching results were obtained with O/TURK/5/09, followed by O-3039 and O/TAW/98 (see table 8 in "Global FMD Situation", EUFMD, SEP 2014, available at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/Final_September2014.pdf).

According to Morocco's recent report to the OIE, the vaccine applied there includes vaccine strains Manissa (which did not match O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d) and O-3039, which is regarded as relatively matching. - Mod.AS
