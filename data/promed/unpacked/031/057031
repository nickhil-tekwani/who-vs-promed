Abstract
--------
Colorado tick fever virus is transmitted by _Dermacentor andersoni_ ticks. In Canada, these ticks are found in the southern regions of British Columbia (Rocky Mountains) and Alberta, as well as southwestern Saskatchewan. Colorado tick fever should be clinically suspected in patients presenting with a biphasic febrile illness and leukopenia following tick exposure in the appropriate geographic area.

Case
----
A 65-year-old male presented to a tertiary-care hospital emergency department in Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) on [11 Apr 2017], with new onset of fever. The patient had been hiking in southwestern Saskatchewan near Fox Valley from [31 Mar to 2 Apr 2017]. He reported several tick bites at that time; 4 days after returning to Winnipeg ([6 Apr 2017]), he developed acute onset of fever, chills, and myalgias. He also complained of reduced appetite and watery diarrhea. He received azithromycin empirically as an outpatient and symptomatically improved over the following 48 hours. However, on [11 Apr 2017], he had a recurrence of fever, reduced oral intake, and diarrhea. He also had a syncopal episode while sitting on the toilet at home.

Given the history of a biphasic febrile illness with associated leukopenia in the setting of a recent tick exposure while hiking in an area with established populations of _Dermacentor andersoni_ ticks, the possibility of infection with Colorado tick fever virus (CTFV) was also considered. An ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid- plasma sample obtained from the patient 8 days after the onset of signs and symptoms was subsequently sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Diagnostic and Reference Laboratory, Arbovirus Diseases Branch in Fort Collins, CO, where CTFV RNA was detected by a real-time RT-PCR assay.

Discussion
----------
Colorado tick fever, also referred to as mountain fever and mountain tick fever, is a tick- borne illness caused by CTFV. CTFV is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus that belongs to Coltivirus genus in the Reoviridae family of viruses. Colorado tick fever is not a new disease. It was originally described in 1930 by Becker, but possible cases have appeared in the published literature as early as 1855 (1). The rocky mountain wood tick, _D. andersoni_, is the principle vector of the CTFV. In nature, the virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving transmission between the larval and nymphal stages of the tick and their mammalian hosts, which typically include small mammals, ground squirrels, and rabbits, among others. Transstadial transmission also occurs once a tick acquires the virus. Humans generally become infected from the bite of an adult tick as this is the life stage that most frequently bites people. CTFV has a similar distribution to its main vector, _D. andersoni_. The vector is generally found at an elevation of 1200-3300 m [4000 - 10 800 ft] above sea level and is particularly prevalent in the Rocky Mountain region. In the U.S., cases have been identified in more than 14 states, but most of the human cases have occurred in residents of Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Oregon, Colorado, and Idaho. In Canada, the distribution of _D. andersoni_ includes the southern regions of British Columba (Rocky Mountains) and Alberta, as well as southwestern Saskatchewan. Only one clinical case of Colorado tick fever acquired in Canada has been published in the literature. However, serosurveys conducted in the 1960s among residents of British Columbia found that a small number of individuals were positive by the complement fixation serology test, suggesting possible previous exposure.

[This is the 1st ProMED-mail report of Colorado tick fever virus infection, although the above report cites a reference indicating that CTF virus infections have been relatively rare, with the incidence in the USA from 2002 through 2012 as 0.02 per million people. ProMED-mail readers interested in the details of this case can access them at the above URL. Additional background information about CTF, its distribution in the USA, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment is available from the CDC web site (https://www.cdc.gov/coloradotickfever/). This site also has images of male and female _Dermacentor andersoni_ ticks.
