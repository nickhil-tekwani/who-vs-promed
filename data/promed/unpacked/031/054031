A horse in Weld County was euthanized after testing positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA), according to the Colorado Department of Agriculture.

The facility where the horse was kept has been placed under quarantine and the remaining horses at the location are being tested and monitored.

Dr Keith Roehr, the State Veterinarian, said EIA is most commonly spread by biting flies, such as horse flies and deer flies, and since it is still early in the Colorado fly season, the risk of transmission to other horses is relatively low.

Horses must be tested annually for EIA before they can be transported across state lines, and the Weld County case was detected during routine testing.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture said EIA is not curable, so affected horses have to be euthanized.

The disease cannot be spread to people, only to horses, mules and donkeys.

There have only been a small number of cases of EIA in the United States, and the last case in Colorado was that of a horse at Arapahoe Park in 2015.

["Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal."

Fly control is very important, in the barn and on the animal.

"It is recommended that horse owners implement an EIA control plan for their premises. All horses should be tested every 12 months as part of a routine health program. More frequent testing may be indicated in areas that perennially have a high incidence of EIA. Owners of equids entering shows or competitive events should present proof to event officials of a negative EIA test. All new equids introduced to a herd should have a negative EIA test before entry or be isolated while tests are pending. Vector control practices, including application of insecticides and repellents and environmental insect control, should be implemented. Good hygiene and disinfection principles should be maintained to prevent iatrogenic infection of horses with contaminated needles, syringes, or equipment."
