Enteroviral meningitis outbreak in Komsomolsk-on-the-Amur nears end
-------------------------------------------------------------------
"The serious viral meningitis outbreak among children in the city of the
Komsomolsk-on-the-Amur [located in the Primorsk Region of Russia has
[terminated, and the situation is stabilizing", said the chief [public
health physician of the city, Yuri Luzin. According to his [statement the
last child will be discharged from hospital in 7-10 days time. Today there
are [still more than 50 people in hospital. No new [cases of viral
meningitis have been reported within the past week.
Mass vaccination conducted on the first day of the new [school term in all
schools in the city has [had the desired effect} stated Yuri Luzin. Using
anti-poliomyelitis vaccine physicians have stopped the spread of the
infection among children attending junior schools, who were the most
affected group during the outbreak. A total of 550 children of different
ages contracted viral meningitis in the city of the Komsomolsk-on-the Amur
since the epidemic broke out in June.

[The rationale for administration of poliomyelitis vaccine to control
aseptic meningitis is not explained. It can hardly have done any harm as a
public health measure, but its relevance to control of this epidemic is
unclear. Aseptic meningitis is a common manifestation of enterovirus
infection. In this outbreak echovirus type 17 has been implicated. Although
non-paralytic poliovirus infection often manifests itself as aseptic
meningitis, the use of poliovirus vaccine to control an outbreak of aseptic
meningitis is an unusual procedure of dubious worth since there is no
serological relationship between echovirus 17 and poliovirus. - Mod.CP
