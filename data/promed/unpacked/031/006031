On [11 Jul 2020], an outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] was diagnosed by the Guangdong Provincial Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center, affecting swine. The outbreak is located in Leizhou City, Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province. There were 131 pigs in the batch, 39 were ill and 1 died. After the detection of the epizootic, the local authorities are doing a good job in dealing with it according to the technical requirements for prevention and control and relevant plans.

[An outbreak of FMD was reported earlier this year (2020) from Chongking, affecting cattle. FMDV serotype O was identified (20200602.7418942).

China's earlier FMD outbreaks were reported during 2018, the 2 last ones in October of that year, in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. During the previous 9 months of 2018, namely January to September, the disease was reported from the administrative divisions (provinces) Anhui, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Mingxia, Shanxi, Xinjiang and Yunnan. Cattle, sheep and pigs were affected. In all of the affected provinces, FMD virus serotype O was identified; in Guizhou, serotype A was reported in addition to serotype O.

Though no outbreaks have been reported during 2019, all the said outbreaks, reported to the OIE separately for each administrative division during 2018, maintain their status "continuing" (not a single one "resolved").

Swine are regarded as the most prolific emitters of the FMD virus and may spread it significant distances by air infecting susceptible animals, if the required meteorological and climatic conditions prevail.

Complementary information on the current outbreak affecting swine in Guangdong, in particular the FMDV serotype involved, is anticipated. - Mod.AS
