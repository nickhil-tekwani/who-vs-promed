Health authorities are investigating a national outbreak of salmonellosis that has struck 156 people, mostly in Hampshire [England, UK]. Public Health England [PHE] said there have been 55 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis in Hampshire, 25 in London, 33 in Cheshire and 43 in the West Midlands. Cases have also been seen in Austria and France. In the case of Hampshire, 32 of the cases were linked to The Real China restaurant in Eastleigh, which voluntary closed last month [July 2014]. It has since reopened.

In Cheshire and Merseyside, 31 cases were connected with an outbreak at a Chinese takeaway [restaurant]. Of the 43 cases in the West Midlands, 34 were connected with the Birmingham Heartlands hospital outbreak, which led to the closure of 8 wards. The cases occurred as isolated clusters over several months and were dealt with locally. They are now being reassessed under a national investigation as being potentially linked, said PHE.

"We are working with our colleagues across PHE, at the Food Standards Agency, in local authorities and with other public health organizations in Europe to investigate the cause of this outbreak," said Dr Paul Cleary, a consultant epidemiologist leading the PHE investigation. "We are making good progress and hope to have more conclusive evidence shortly."

PHE said genetic testing methods revealed that all of the cases are infected with closely related strains, indicating that the cause of the illness is from a single source. A health official said it was too early to specify this source. Some food and environmental samples from catering outlets have tested positive for salmonella with the same genetic profile as seen in the outbreak cases, said PHE.

In France, 49 people have been affected.

[Serotype Enteritidis is often associated with undercooked eggs or egg products. The posting seems to imply that the food is not at fault but rather the sanitary practices of the food handler. Given the serotype, it is likely that the reservoir was uncooked eggs or sauce made from raw eggs, and the food handler was implicated for inadequate cooking or poor kitchen hygiene techniques rather than the food handler being infected and, by poor hand washing, contaminating the eggs and/or sauce.

Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. However, most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected Grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation and are contaminated with the bacteria before the eggshell is formed. - Mod.LL
