The Sonora state's Department of Health reported the number of people with symptoms of foodborne illness from eating sushi increased to 26. All those affected reported having eaten the sushi products at the "Rodriguez" branch of the "Que Rollo Sushi" chain of restaurants. In 2013, the company was the cause of more than 200 illnesses and it covered the costs of almost all those affected.

The latest update from of the Secretariat of Health reported 11 intoxicated people, with 15 new cases in less than 24 hours. An active search for people affected has been in place since 2 Apr 2014, to determine the magnitude of the problem and take the necessary measures. As part of the investigation 26 cases have been detected in public and private hospitals.

In its report, the health department noted that the patients sought medical assistance at hospital emergency services. Of the total cases, 5 required hospitalization; 3 of them have been released and 2 remain hospitalized but stable. The most frequent symptoms have been vomiting and diarrhea.

The department reported that last [Wed 2 Apr 2014] the State Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks (Coepris) received a complaint from 2 people who contracted a gastrointestinal infection after eating sushi, which is why the department is working in the verification, sampling of food, and search for cases. "The results of laboratory tests will make an important contribution to determining whether this food establishment was responsible for the cases of poisoning and, if so, the appropriate legal measures will be applied," the commission stated.

[In 2012, there was a large outbreak involving almost 400 people in the USA, due to salmonellosis acquired from "tuna scrape" made into "spicy tuna" which was imported from Asia. The etiology of the outbreak reported here is unclear but outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to fish consumption are uncommon and are more likely to be related to contamination of the fish after they are caught. It is also possible that, if the sushi continues to be implicated, another ingredient in the sushi such as a spice, a vegetable, or seaweed wrapping could be the vehicle. - Mod.LL
