A new outbreak of widespread "madness", known as "Grisis Signis"
among native Central American tribes, is affecting native Miskito
communities on the northern Caribbean Nicaraguan coast, and health
authorities have not offered any scientific explanation for this phenomenon.
The information, published today by "El Nuevo Diario" newspaper,
indicates that this region of the country is also suffering famine
caused by a plague of rats that devoured crops. It adds that at least
31 native persons in the northern Caribbean coast had been affected
by "Grisis Signis", which provokes attacks of violence and hysteria.
Saul Miranda, head of the health center in Waspam, the main
municipality on the Coco River at the Honduras border, told the
newspaper that 21 cases were detected in the Raiti community, 729 km
northeast of Managua. He added that 4 additional cases were detected
in the community of Santa Fe, while in Krin Krin village, indigenous
leaders reported 6 ill persons.
The illness causes seizures and hallucinations, affecting only
Miskito natives, who interpret the affliction as the result of a
curse or sorcery. Those affected become quite strong, attacking
households and becoming violent when somebody tries to disarm them.
Some walk around the villages armed with sticks and machetes,
sometimes returning to their homes after having been absent for some
days. The only way in which affected persons return to normal is by
taking herbs given to them by a traditional healer ("curandero"), but
after the episode they do not remember anything at all.
During other outbreaks [a similar outbreak was reported in October
2003], Health Ministry authorities have not offered any scientific
explanation for this illness.
Meanwhile, Coco River communities have been suffering for many months
from famine caused by a plague of rats, which devoured their crops,
and they have also been affected by floods caused by the recent
tropical storms and hurricanes. Government authorities, with support
from the World Food Program (WFA), have brought food and support for
these communities that have been historically affected by natural disasters.

[There are a number of possible causes for this type of psychosis.
Among those related to infectious disease are brucellosis (Annesley
PT. Schizophreniform psychosis with chronic brucellosis. Br J
Psychiatr 1968; 114: 353-4), leptospirosis (Marshall RB, Scrimgeour
G. Schizophreniform psychosis associated with leptospirosis. N Z Med
J. 1978 Sep 13;88(619):212-3), and Lyme disease (Fallon BA & Jenifer
A. Nields JA. Lyme disease: a neuropsychiatric illness. Am J
Psychiatry 151:11, Nov 1994 pp.1571-1580).
Bur since in the current cases the symptoms are associated with a
food shortage, the victims could be eating old stocks, contracting
mycotoxicosis from ergot, which was associated with the witch trials
at Salem, Massachusetts, USA, because of its psychoactive properties;
see ProMED post 19961022.1786.
Aggression is a symptom of Korsakoff's psychosis, caused by primary
thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency or beri-beri, which occurs when
there is an inadequate dietary intake of thiamine; see ProMED post
20031111.2791 Thiamine deficiency, infant formula - Israel.
It is strange that it is only Miskito Indians that are affected;
perhaps an anthropologist reader could provide some insight? - Mod.JW]
