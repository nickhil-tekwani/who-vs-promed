Alarm over single AIDS case is challenged by questioners
--------------------------------------------------------
New York City's health commissioner, Thomas R Frieden, had barely stepped
away from the microphone on 11 Feb 2005 after announcing the discovery of a
possibly new and deadly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strain when the
storm started. More than a week later, it has not abated.
One group of scientists not involved in the research was quick to dismiss
the news as isolated to one man and unworthy of alarm. Other scientists
said not enough research had been done to warrant a public health
announcement, and accused Dr Frieden of excessive haste. Gay activists
worried that Dr Frieden's use of the announcement to emphasize safe-sex
practices would set up gay men as culprits, reviving a concern as old as
the disease. Long-standing rivalries among top AIDS researchers resurfaced,
and one of the researchers who discovered the possible strain was accused
of using a test developed by a company to which he had close ties.
To those who expect government officials to keep diseases at bay, it might
seem surprising that a public health announcement about a deadly virus
would be attacked, but AIDS is not like tuberculosis or polio. From the
moment that HIV was discovered, it caused political chasms and profound
disagreements among experts, and in recent weeks the virus seemed to be
proving that it could still be treacherous and surprising, both as a deadly
disease and a political fuse.
"The old jealousies, rivalries and big egos," said Kevin Robert Frost, vice
president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, when asked why the
response was so furious. "Scientists in general react negatively to news by
press conference." At one level, the reaction illustrates the intense
competition among scientists and their institutions to communicate new
findings and get credit, crucial in obtaining money to expand their
research. Many experts have been involved in the field for years, and in
some cases their professional disagreements have developed into the
animosities and outright personal hatreds that are common in academia.
Nonetheless, scientists, skeptics by nature and training, have a
fundamentally different role than public health officials, who often have
to take emergency measures to stop the spread of disease.
As a result, some research scientists said the appearance of a possible
drug-resistant and virulent strain of the virus in one 46 year old man
meant little. The man's immune system might have been compromised by the
crystal methamphetamine he had taken, they said, or the virus could have
rapidly led to full-blown AIDS for other reasons that needed additional
investigation before the public was alerted. "This is a non-story," Dr Paul
Volberding, director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of
California, San Francisco, said in an interview, noting that the pace of
change from HIV to AIDS depended not only on the virus but also the
patient. "There have been many cases of rapid progression. The New York
case is only that, a case report."
But public health officials said that with the battle against AIDS possibly
on the verge of a new phase, where drug-resistant strains become harder to
treat, Dr Frieden was right to go public. Dr Alfred Sommer, dean of the
Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, said
health officials often did not have the luxury of waiting for full
scientific information before acting. "For most things we do, we do not
have ironclad proof one way or the other," he said.
Dr Frieden said that his initial announcement clearly contained cautions
and unknowns, but that his actions were necessary given the potential
public health effects. "We had enough clinical and scientific information
to warrant making the announcement because of the immediate implications
for the community, and for doctors practicing in New York City," he said.
"We run the risk of either being a dollar short and a day late, or shouting
fire in a crowded theater," said Dr Michael T Osterholm, director of for
the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of
Minnesota. "The question is," he said of Dr Frieden, "is he a prophet today
or is he a prophet 10 years from now?"
The debate is likely to grow louder beginning tomorrow in Boston when 3800
of the world's top AIDS experts are to meet in a conference to discuss an
array of new scientific findings. Long after the deadline for submissions
of reports had passed, the doctors who handled the New York City case, Dr
David D Ho and Dr Martin Markowitz, asked for a waiver to discuss the
findings about the possible strain they had made at the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center in Manhattan. After much wrangling, the organizers of the
meeting agreed to hold an unusual special session for the disagreement
about the city's announcement.
But scientists were not the only ones upset about the city's actions. Some
gay activists asserted that Dr Frieden was using the possible new strain as
a scare tactic to get gay men to practice safe sex, an accusation he
denied. Charles King, the president of Housing Works, an AIDS support
group, said the announcement could be used to demonize the gay lifestyle
and accused Dr Frieden of having wanted to change regulations regarding HIV
testing for a long time.
The Community HIV/AIDS Mobilization Project, based in New York, said the
link between the spread of the possible new strain and the use of crystal
methamphetamine was unproven, and suggested that the city had ignored the
"underlying issues" behind the spread of the virus, like discrimination,
poor housing and unemployment. "Rather than increasing awareness of the
risks of unsafe sex and crystal use, the Health Department risks
stigmatizing gay men as crazed drug addicts carelessly or wantonly
spreading a killer bug," Community HIV/AIDS Mobilization Project said in a
statement. "In this case, the Health Department seems to offer little to
the understanding of the root causes and potential solutions to drug use
apart from the discredited strategy of Nancy Reagan, 'Just say no.'"
Martin Delaney, the founding director of Project Inform, a nonprofit AIDS
foundation, said the city had been needlessly alarmist. "By pushing this
out early, the public health department set off panic nationwide, before
the scientific community had a chance to see the scientific data," Mr
Delaney said.
Several gay activists said Dr Frieden was motivated, in part, by a close
relationship with the Aaron Diamond Center, a charge that city officials
dismissed as ridiculous. The center was created in 1988 to study the basic
science of AIDS as a joint venture of the city's Health Department, the New
York University School of Medicine, and the Aaron Diamond Foundation, a
philanthropic organization. Upon becoming commissioner in 2002, Dr. Frieden
joined the center's board, as had all his predecessors since the founding
of the institution. Health Department officials say he has no financial
interest in the center.
Dr Ho, then a relatively unknown 37 year old researcher fresh from Harvard
and UCLA, was hired to run the center in 1989 and immediately attracted
attention. With more money at his disposal than most other research
institutions, Dr Ho became the object of envy as top-flight scientists
lined up to join his center. Within a few years, Dr Ho's team won
international publicity, challenging long-held theories about AIDS and
reporting new evidence about the way the AIDS virus works in the body.
However, Dr Ho has been criticized for trumpeting findings that other
scientists say later proved wrong. For instance, Dr Ho and colleagues
strongly suggested, without explicitly stating it as fact, that a treatment
with drug cocktails could cure AIDS by eradicating the virus from a
patient's blood. Since then, it has become clear that the virus lurks in
hidden sanctuaries in the body, making it all but impossible to eradicate
HIV with currently licensed drugs.
Critics have also charged that ViroLogic, the lab that did some of the
testing for the Diamond Center and the Health Department in the most recent
case, is using the case to promote its services. The Monday after Dr.
Frieden's Friday news conference, ViroLogic issued a news release calling
attention to its work performing the test for drug resistance. Dr. Ho, who
was quoted in the release, serves on the scientific advisory board of
ViroLogic. His brother, Sidney Ho, does marketing work for the company and
once was the head of its communications department. William D Young, the
chairman and chief executive of ViroLogic, said there was no effort by Dr
Ho to promote ViroLogic through this case. He said the company's scientific
advisers "are very aware of their scientific reputations and that's
paramount to them. At some times I prefer them to be promotional but they
are not." Mr Young said ViroLogic issued the news release to make the
public aware of its role in the testing and its extensive nature. Dr Ho
said that he has disclosed all of his ties to the company and that any
suggestion of impropriety was false.
After Dr Frieden disclosed the case, reports of similar cases quickly
emerged, some of which had been published earlier. For example, Dr Julio
Montaner, a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia in
Vancouver, reported in 2003 in the scientific journal AIDS that 2 men with
a highly drug-resistant strain of HIV might have progressed rapidly to
AIDS. [See also comment below. - Mod.CP]. Dr Ho did not contact Dr Montaner
about the case until 3 days after Dr Frieden's news conference. Dr Ho said
he had searched standard databases for similar cases but did not find Dr
Montaner's report. After being made aware of the cases and looking into
them, he said there were similarities but also significant differences.
"Our case was much more dramatic in the history of progression and
resistance," Dr Ho said. Dr Ho, for his part, said, he was accustomed to
criticism, but insisted, "We did the right thing in this case."

[The question unresolved is whether the 2 phenomena -- triple drug
resistance and accelerated progression to AIDS -- are related. It may be
that the patient has been infected by a rare HIV variant that transmits
poorly and is present at such low frequency that it has not been detected
previously. Similarly, it is possible that the rapid progression to AIDS
may be a feature of the patient's genetic make-up rather than a property of
the virus. It was reported earlier (but not mentioned in the above report)
that the patient had not been treated with anti-retroviral drugs; if this
is the case, selection of multiple drug-resistant variants in the index
patient is unlikely.
The work of Dr Julio Montaner's group at the St Paul's Hospital and the
University of British Columbia has been referred to previously in
ProMED-mail (see: HIV, multi-drug resistant - Canada (British Columbia)
20010810.1892). Research workers at St Paul's documented about a half-dozen
cases in 2001 of newly infected people whose strain of the virus is
resistant to all 3 classes of anti-HIV drugs. It is common for AIDS
patients to develop a resistance to some of the drugs they are taking, and
5 to 10 per cent of new infections in the US involve a form of HIV
resistant to some types of drugs used in treatment of AIDS. But there had
been only a handful of reported cases in the world in which a person was
newly infected with a type of HIV resistant to all 3 drug classes. In most
of those cases, it was concluded at the time that in becoming triple
drug-resistant, the virus had mutated in a way that made it less effective
and less dangerous. - Mod.CP]
