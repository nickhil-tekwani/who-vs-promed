Follow-up report No. 2
Text of an e-mail received on 8 November 1998 from Dr Sultan Al-Khalaf,
Deputy Director General, The Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs and
Fish Resources (PAAF), Safat:
End of previous report period: 16 April 1998 (see Disease Information, 11
[15, 54, dated 17 April 1998).
Active surveillance for Old World screwworm has been on-going in the main
livestock production areas and at the border quarantine stations since the
first case was detected in late November 1997. The Insect Control
Department of the Ministry of Health has also been carrying out fly
surveillance, including for _Chrysomya bezziana_, throughout the country.
No case of Old World screwworm has been detected in Kuwait since the cases
reported on 19 March 1998. The situation has remained the same even after
many weeks of suitable climatic conditions in autumn 1998. Furthermore,
_only Chrysomya albiceps_ was detected during this period.
Kuwait has, therefore, been free from Old World screwworm since 19 March 1998.
