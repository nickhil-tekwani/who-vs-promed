A 15-day quarantine has been implemented in regard to the First Tsvetovo village of the Kursk oblast, where yesterday, on 21 May 2013, anthrax was diagnosed in a dead heifer. As reported by the press service of the Ministry of Emergencies of the region, the import, export, and movement of animals are prohibited during the whole time of quarantine.

[Veterinary] specialists have conducted a clinical inspection of all animals to identify any with [signs] of the disease and completed a compulsory vaccination of the village livestock, 64 cattle, 49 sheep and goats, 2 horses, and animals which were previously vaccinated in 2012.

4 persons live at a private farm where the animal died from anthrax. All people passed through disinfection. Medical controls and preventive measures were organized, including the vaccination of the farm animals: 30 cows, 10 pigs, and 5 sheep. All these animals had been vaccinated in 2012.

According to Marina Lebedeva, head of the station for animal disease control of the Kursk region, thanks to the prompt veterinary response, any threat of spread of the disease and human exposure have been eliminated.

The acting head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations in the Kursk region, Colonel Sergey Sharov, said that: "Education and all the necessary preventive measures were conducted with the population of the village, where a quarantine zone was established. Two disinfection barriers were established from the street to the affected farm. Currently, there is a sufficient supply of medicines available in the Kursk region for conducting the necessary vaccination."

According to information of the Veterinary Administration of Kursk region, the affected animal was 14 to 16 months old and had been vaccinated against anthrax twice, in May and October of the previous year, 2012. Re-vaccination had been scheduled for October 2013. The carcass was burnt, and the burial place was concreted over. Specialists carried out a mechanical cleaning of the area with the destruction of the remnants of the litter, fodder, and low-value inventory; buildings, structures, and vehicles in the focus of infection were disinfected.

At present, the work to establish the source of contamination of the animal is under way. Soil and water samples from the pasture, a pond, and the farmstead were taken for analysis at the Veterinary Laboratory for Detection of Pathogens.

An earlier IA Regnum report said that on 21 May 2013, anthrax had been clinically diagnosed in a dead cow in one of the private holdings in the village of First Tsvetovo in the Kursk region. Laboratory studies have confirmed this diagnosis.

[Our thanks to Sabine for finding this report and Natalia for translating the Russian news report.

Immunity to anthrax, whether from a clinical exposure or from vaccination, is temporary, lasting at best 9 months. This is why it is wise to vaccinate livestock each spring before the summer anthrax season. That there was a measure of cover probably explains why just one animal was affected and not more. But it is early days yet.

The oblast of Kursk is on the western border of Russia with the Ukraine: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk, but probably better seen in this map of the Ukraine: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/ukraine.gif. - Mod.MHJ]
