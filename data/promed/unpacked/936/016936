A red tide outbreak in South Padre Island is causing harm to both human and marine population. A toxin is released by red tide when algae inside water are triggered to [re]produce rapidly. Red tide is an algal bloom, which is caused by marine plankton that 'bloom' during the warm months of summer.

Jason Straub, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Brownsville [Texas], said that it will take a month for them to completely eradicate toxic algae out of the area. The red tide killed a large number of fish [on Sun 27 Sep 2015], but the count was [lower than in previous] years. Tony Reisinger, Texas AgriLife's extension agent for coastal and marine resources with Texas Sea Grant, said that because of favorable winds, the aerosol effect was also eased up on the Island over the weekend [26-27 Sep 2015].

Fresh fish washed ashore at Beach Access Nos. 5 and 6 and a few large red drum fish washed ashore at Isla Blanca, said Mr Reisinger. "I just hope that the wind remains west-northwest. The wind has been a blessing because if the wind is blowing offshore the aerosol, which is a spray of water droplets, gets blown back offshore rather than onto the island."

Particle filter masks can be used as a way to protect from aerosol affect. It works by restricting the water droplet of aerosol to pass through it and enter into respiratory system. Officials said that though the use of the particle filter mask is not the best way to prevent aerosols, it could act as a better solution to prevent effects of aerosol.

Officials advise asthmatic patients to avoid red tides areas especially during its peak season, August and October.

[Red tide or harmful algal blooms (HABs) are events in which single-celled protists, dinoflagellates, proliferate rapidly and accumulate in the water column. These events are associated with wildlife mortalities, because under certain circumstances these organisms can produce potent toxins. Normally these toxins enter the food web when they are consumed by filter feeding animals, such as clams, oysters, mussels, in which the toxins bioaccumulate.

One interesting note is that both people and dogs can be sensitive to the spray effects associated with a red tide bloom. Dogs react in much the same fashion as people, with eye irritation, nose, and respiration irritation, and some dogs will have inflamed ears, and irritated skin.

Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin, it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.

The _Alexandrium_ genus is found in coastal waters high in nitrogen content. These organisms produce a neurotoxin, like many of the organisms capable of causing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The neurotoxin is considered fatal for humans consuming contaminated shellfish and may be dangerous to humans and animals who swim in waters that are "blooming" with the organisms. Ocean spray containing the organisms may also cause illnesses, including rashes and eye irritation in people. Some species of this genus are capable of causing "red tide" that may be visible for long distances along a coastline.

PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially on both the east and west coasts of the United States. Produced by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.

Alexandrium blooms generally do not involve large-cell accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be invisible below the water surface. Low-density populations can cause severe problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are important when considering mitigation and control strategies.

Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine life. _K. brevis_ is a marine dinoflagellate common in Gulf of Mexico waters, and is the organism responsible for Florida red tides. The toxin it produces is called brevetoxin, which can cause neurotoxic poisoning.

Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for several days.

Previously, the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of dinoflagellates. Its new name -- _Karenia brevis_ -- was chosen in honor of Dr Karen Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St Petersburg, Florida.

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild, and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases, death may occur in 2 to 25 hours. - Mod.TG
