The European Union summary report on trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[From the exhaustive report (162 pages) we herewith copy, for subscribers' convenience, the abstract and the segments addressing selected zoonotic issues of interest. - Mod.AS]

1. Abstract
This report of the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of the zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2013 in 32 European countries (28 Member States and 4 non-Member States). Campylobacteriosis was the most commonly reported zoonosis. After several years of an increasing European Union (EU) trend, the human campylobacteriosis notification rate has stabilised. In food and animals no EU trends were observed and the occurrence of Campylobacter continued to be high in broiler meat at EU level. The decreasing EU trend in confirmed human salmonellosis cases observed in recent years continued. Most Member States met their Salmonella reduction targets for poultry. In foodstuffs, the reported EU-level Salmonella non-compliance in fresh poultry meat decreased. Human listeriosis increased further, showing an increasing EU trend in 2009-2013. In ready-to-eat foods Listeria was seldom detected above the legal safety limit. Also during 2009-2013, a decreasing EU trend was observed in confirmed yersiniosis cases. Positive findings for Yersinia were mainly reported in pig meat and products thereof. The number of confirmed verocytotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_ (VTEC) infections in humans increased. VTEC was reported from food and animals. A total of 5196 food-borne outbreaks, including water-borne outbreaks, were reported in the EU. Most food-borne outbreaks were caused by Salmonella, followed by viruses, bacterial toxins and Campylobacter, whereas in 28.9 percent of all outbreaks the causative agent was unknown. Important food vehicles in strong-evidence food-borne outbreaks were eggs and egg products, followed by mixed food, and fish and fish products. The report further summarises trends and sources along the food chain of tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, _Coxiella burnetii_ (Q fever), West Nile virus and tularaemia.

2. Tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_
a. Humans
Tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ is a rare infection in humans in the EU, with 134 confirmed human cases reported in 2013. The case numbers in the EU have been stable in the last 2 years. There was no clear association between a country's status as officially free of bovine tuberculosis (OTF) and notification rates in humans. The EU notification rate in 2013 was 0.03 cases per 100 000 population.

b. Animals
At the EU-level, the proportion of cattle herds infected with or positive for _M. bovis_ remained very low (0.68 percent of the existing herds). The distribution of _M. bovis_ across EU is, however, heterogeneous with a prevalence ranging from absence of infected/positive animals in many OTF regions to a prevalence of 12.1 percent in the non-OTF regions of the United Kingdom (England, Northern-Ireland and Wales). In the non-OTF regions, the number of herds infected with, or positive for, _M. bovis_ was similar to in 2012 and no major changes were observed within the non-OTF MS or parts thereof.

3. Brucella
a. Humans
Brucellosis is a rare infection in humans in the EU with 357 confirmed cases reported in 2013. The highest notification rates and the majority of the autochthonous cases were reported from Mediterranean countries that are not officially brucellosis-free in cattle, sheep or goats. No significant increasing or decreasing trend of human brucellosis could be observed at the EU level in the last 5 years. 70 percent of the human brucellosis cases had been hospitalised, but only one fatal case was reported in 2013.

b. Foodstuffs
There were no Brucella-positive findings in the surveillance samples of cheeses, other dairy products and raw milk from cows and other animal species, reported by 2 Mediterranean MS.

c. Animals
A further decreasing tendency was observed in the prevalence of both bovine and small ruminant brucellosis within the EU. In 2013 brucellosis remained a rare (bovine brucellosis) or very low frequency (ovine and caprine brucellosis) event at the EU level. Both bovine and small ruminant brucellosis cases of infected or positive herds are mostly reported by 4 Mediterranean MS Italy, Portugal, Greece and Spain. Bovine brucellosis was also reported by Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom in 28 cattle herds. Almost all non- officially brucellosis-free (non-OBF) MS and non-officially _Brucella melitensis_ free (non-ObmF) MS reported fewer positive and/or infected herds than in 2012.

d. Brucella food-borne outbreaks
In 2013, 4 weak-evidence Brucella outbreaks (involving 7 hospitalised cases) were reported by 2 MS. No strong-evidence outbreaks were reported. The occurrence of these outbreaks illustrates the health risk related to consumption of food contaminated with Brucella.

4. Trichinella
a. Humans
In 2013, 217 confirmed trichinellosis cases were reported in the EU. The EU notification rate decreased by 17.7 percent compared with 2012 and was 0.05 cases per 100 000 population in 2013. The highest notification rates were reported in Romania, Latvia and Bulgaria. The temporal trend of trichinellosis in the EU in 2009-2013 was greatly influenced by a number of smaller and larger outbreaks with peaks often occurring in January. One death due to trichinellosis was reported in 2013.

b. Animals
Ten MS reported positive findings in farm animals. In pigs, a total of 357 positive findings were reported out of 154 397 532 animals tested (0.0002 percent) and the vast majority originated from pigs not raised under controlled housing conditions. Positive findings were mainly reported by eastern EU MS. From a total of 7908 farmed wild boars tested, 2 Mediterranean MS reported one positive finding each. No positive findings were reported from 176 497 horses tested in EU.

The overall EU proportion of Trichinella positive samples of hunted wild boars was 0.1 percent and originated mostly from eastern EU MS. Most of the Trichinella-positive reporting in wildlife other than wild boar was done by eastern and north eastern EU MS, in 11 different animal species. Throughout the past years, the highest proportions of positive samples were from raccoon dogs followed by bears. Trichinella is found in large parts of Europe as overall 19 MS and 2 non-MS reported positive findings.

c. Trichinella food-borne outbreaks
In 2013, a total of 22 outbreaks caused by Trichinella were reported, whereof 20 supported by strong evidence. As in the previous years, pig meat was the most commonly reported food vehicle.

5. Echinococcus
a. Humans
In 2013, a total of 811 echinococcosis cases, of which 794 were laboratory confirmed, were reported in the EU. The EU notification rate was 0.18 cases per 100 000 population which was a decrease of 5.7 percent compared with 2012. An increasing number of cases were reported to be infected with _E. multilocularis_ (alveolar echinococcosis) throughout the 5-year period 2009-2013. In contrast, the number of cases reported to be infected with _E. granulosus_ (cystic echinococcosis) decreased in the same period. Two deaths due to _E. multilocularis_ were reported in 2013.

b. Animals
_E. multilocularis_ was reported at low level in foxes by 4 MS. Czech Republic reported an increase in prevalence of _E. multilocularis_ during 2005-2011, as well as Slovakia during 2010-2013. Four MS reported almost all the positive findings of _E. granulosus_; mainly from domestic animals.

6. Toxoplasma
Animals
In 2013, 14 MS and 2 non-MS provided data on Toxoplasma in animals. Positive findings were detected in pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, wild boars, deer, water buffaloes, and some other wildlife animal species.

7. Rabies
a. Humans
In 2013, one travel-associated case of rabies was reported from the Netherlands. The patient was a 51-year-old male and died after exposure to an unknown source in Haiti.

b. Animals
In 2013, 783 animals other than bats tested positive for either classical rabies virus or unspecified Lyssavirus, in reporting countries. The number of cases reported in 2013 increased compared with 2012, when 712 cases were detected in animals other than bats. In addition, 6 MS reported rabies cases from bats.

8. Q-fever
a. Humans
In 2013, a total of 648 confirmed cases of Q fever in humans were reported in the EU. The EU notification rate was 0.17 per 100 000 population. The highest notification rate was observed in Hungary (1.37 cases per 100 000 population) where an outbreak occurred in 2013.

There was a decreasing EU trend of confirmed Q fever cases in 2009-2013. Two deaths due to Q fever were reported by Germany and Latvia in 2013. This resulted in an EU case-fatality rate of 0.61 percent among the 335 confirmed cases for which this information was reported.

b. Animals
All but 3 of the 17 reporting MS found animals testing positive to _Coxiella burnetii_ (Q fever) in their cattle, sheep or goat populations in 2013. A positive pig herd was also reported by one MS. Compared to the previous years, no general trend was observed as regards the number of samples tested and the number of samples positives.

9. West Nile virus
a. Humans
In 2013, a total of 250 cases of West Nile fever in humans were reported in the EU. The EU notification rate of locally acquired and travel-related cases was 0.08 per 100 000 population. There was an overall 0.01 increase in the notification rate compared with 2012 (238 cases). The highest notification rate was observed in Greece (0.78 cases per 100 000 population), as in previous years; however, case reporting varied between countries.

Case numbers in the mostly affected countries have varied from year to year, but more and more areas are affected. 16 deaths due to West Nile fever were reported by Greece, Italy and Hungary in 2013. This resulted in an EU case-fatality rate of 3.4 percent among the 227 probable and confirmed cases for which this information was reported (90.8 percent of all cases).

b. Animals
Although the number of tested animals increased in 2013 as compared to the previous year, there were less than half as many cases detected in 2013 as compared to 2012. Presumed acute infections in animals [IgM or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive samples] were reported only by some of the Mediterranean countries and by the Czech Republic and Hungary.

10. Tularaemia
a. Humans
In 2013, a total of 279 confirmed cases of tularaemia in humans were reported in the EU. The EU notification rate was 0.07 cases per 100 000 population which was a 65.3 percent decrease compared with 2012. Notification rates vary however across countries and within each country over time. The highest notification rate was observed in Sweden (1.13 confirmed cases per 100 000 population) as in previous years.

There was a decreasing (not significant) EU trend of confirmed tularaemia cases in 2009-2013, and no deaths were reported.

b. Animals
Occurrence of _Francisella tularensis_ was reported by one MS in wild hares.

11. Other zoonoses and zoonotic agents
Findings of _Taenia saginata_ cysts in bovine carcases were reported at very low to rare level by 2 MS. In addition one MS investigated the presence of _Taenia solium_ cysts in pig carcases but no positive findings were reported.

Rare occurrence of Sarcocystis in bovine carcases was reported by one MS.

12. Food-borne outbreaks
In 2013, a total of 5196 food-borne outbreaks, including water-borne outbreaks, were reported in the EU. Overall, 43 183 human cases, 5946 hospitalisations and 11 deaths were reported. The evidence supporting the link between human cases and food vehicles was strong in 839 outbreaks.

The largest number of reported food-borne outbreaks was caused by Salmonella (22.5 percent of all outbreaks), followed by viruses (18.1 percent), bacterial toxins (16.1 percent), and Campylobacter (8.0 percent). For 28.9 percent of the outbreaks the causative agent was unknown. Apart from the above mentioned markedly decreasing trend in annual total number of Salmonella outbreaks within the EU during the 6-year period 2008 to 2013, the number of outbreaks due to bacterial toxins increased by 58.9 percent, from 525 to 834 outbreaks, in the same time period. Reported Campylobacter food-borne outbreaks decreased compared to 2012, while there was an increase in the outbreaks caused by viruses.

As in the previous years, the most important food vehicles in the strong-evidence outbreaks were eggs and egg products followed by mixed food, and fish and fish products.

Of particular note was the multinational hepatitis A virus (HAV) outbreak occurred in 2013 in several EU/EEA countries, and associated with the consumption of berries and berry products.

In 2013, 9 strong-evidence water-borne outbreaks were reported in the EU. Five different pathogens were detected from these 9 outbreaks: calicivirus (Norovirus, Norwalk-like virus), verocytotoxigenic _E. coli_ (VTEC O128), _Cryptosporidium parvum_, _Cryptosporidium hominis_ and Salmonella. For 3 water-borne outbreaks the causative agent was unknown.
