Out on a fall day in Duluth [Minnesota], we saw plenty of people walking their dogs. [A Lakeside resident], said she and her lab/great dane mix go out in the woods daily.

But dog owners should know that there's an outbreak of distemper in Duluth. The serious and contagious virus affects foxes, raccoons, and skunks, and can spread to your dog. There is no known cure.

We spoke with Animal Control Officer Carrie Lane on [Mon 5 Oct 2015]. "The outbreak started last year [2014] in West Duluth, and has spread east now to Lakeside."

Folks have been calling them about sick animals in their yards. "They may look tame and want to play, but you should not pick them up or pet them. They can still bite you, and if they do and we don't catch the animal, then you would need rabies shots," Lane said. Rabies is rare, she said, but the risk is still there.

You may be seeing more raccoons hit and killed on the side of the road. Lane said that it is out of character for them to be moving around during the daytime, and that it's likely the ones being hit have distemper.

They've tested 6 animals, 2 raccoons, 2 foxes, and 2 skunks, and they were all infected with canine distemper.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Animals showing the same signs might be rabid. In Minnesota, rabies is more frequent in skunks. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats, and ferrets in the area up to date.
