Current status
--------------
For information about JEV and animals visit the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment website [https://www.outbreak.gov.au/current-responses-to-outbreaks/japanese-encephalitis].

There are 32 human cases of JEV in Australia; 20 have been confirmed with definitive laboratory evidence:
- New South Wales (8)
- Queensland (2)
- South Australia (3)
- Victoria (7)

The other 12 are probable cases where the person has been linked epidemiologically and/or has symptoms of the disease and has laboratory suggestive evidence*:
- Queensland (2)
- South Australia (5)
- Victoria (4)
- NSW (1)
* laboratory suggestive evidence is strongly indicative of JEV but cannot entirely rule out other related flaviviruses like Murray Valley Encephalitis (MVE).

Sadly, 3 people have been reported to have died of JEV. One in New South Wales, one in South Australia and one in Victoria.

Why is there an alert
---------------------
Declaration of a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance:

On 4 Mar 2022, Australia's acting chief medical officer, Dr Sonya Bennett, declared the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) situation a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance. She determined a national approach was required in relation to coordination of health policy, interventions and public messaging.

The declaration was made under the Emergency Response Plan for Communicable Disease Incidents of National Significance, in consultation with the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.

JEV is a nationally notifiable disease in both humans and animals.

What we are doing
-----------------
A national working group of communicable disease, vaccine and arbovirus experts has been established.

The working group will support Australia's response to the JEV situation. This will include:
- mosquito surveillance and control measures;
- identification of those at direct risk, and for the rollout of vaccines;
- public health communications regarding mosquito protection will target affected communities.

The Australian government's health and agriculture departments are working very closely with their state government counterparts to ensure a swift and coordinated response.

[The above report from the Australian government Department of Health provides a current overview of the Japanese encephalitis (JE) situation in the 4 affected states. A working group covering the entire affected area will provide an interdisciplinary integrative approach for dealing with this rapidly moving situation. Previous reports that ProMED received did not mention surveillance of vector mosquitoes. The above report now does as well as control measures to be undertaken. Surveillance to detect JE virus-positive mosquitoes in areas of documented human and pig infections as well as places outside of these localities will provide timely information necessary for determination of risk of infection for people and animals and for planning of vaccination efforts. - Mod.TY
