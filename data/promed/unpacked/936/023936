Panama Detects New Dengue Carrying Mosquito
-------------------------------------------
PANAMA CITY: The Panamanian authorities announced on Wed 6 Nov 2002 that
they had detected a new species of mosquito considered by specialists as
more dangerous than _Aedes aegypti_, the carrier of dengue fever.
Panamanian Public Health Director Esteban Morales said the newly detected
mosquito, which is called _Aedes albopictus_, exists both in rural and urban
areas, and it is thought likely to have arrived in the country through
transport containers from other countries.
Both _Aedes albopictus_ and _Aedes aegypti_ spread the same sort of viral
disease [i.e. dengue fever] with symptoms of fever, muscle and abdominal
pains and, at the worst, hemorrhaging. It is reported that _Aedes
albopictus_ also has the ability of transmitting [dengue fever] virus to its
descendants.
The official explained the vector was spotted at the crowded neighborhood of
Tocumen, east of Panama City. "If we don't eliminate breeding grounds, then
we'll have a serious epidemic," the official warned. He also announced
inspections will be undertaken in other parts of the country to determine
the presence of the new species.
To date, 500 cases of classic dengue fever and 3 of dengue hemorrhagic fever
have been reported in this country of 2.8 million inhabitants, according to
official figures
