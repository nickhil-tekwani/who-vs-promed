[The current epizootic of lumpy skin disease [LSD], a cattle vectorborne disease caused by a capripoxvirus, previously one of OIE's List A diseases, reportedly started in the northern part of the West Bank during the 2nd week of March 2013. It was preceded by an LSD epizootic in adjacent northern Israel, which had started on the Lebanese-Syrian border in mid 2012, spread steadily in a south western direction, and eventually -- in March 2013 -- was also observed in the West Bank.

The total number of outbreaks in Israel, as reported in an immediate notification and 10 follow-up reports (the last one submitted to the OIE on 20 Mar 2013) has reached 94. An animated map, produced by the Israeli Veterinary Services on 3 Apr 2013, showing the gradual spread of LSD in Israel's beef and dairy cattle herds since the start of the epizootic in mid 2012, is available at http://www.moag.gov.il/agri/files/kateret_or_03042013.ppt.

Since the end of March 2013, Israel has intensified its vaccination programme, using 2 vaccines (for details, see ProMED-mail archive 20130319.1594378). According to information available in the last 3 weekly reports of the chief veterinarian of Hachaklait* (in Hebrew; dated 20 Apr, 28 Apr, and 4 May 2013), no new outbreaks have been observed since 20 Apr 2013. This, in contrast to the situation in the West Bank, as described in the follow-up report above: out of the 49 LSD outbreaks in 7 districts (see interactive map at the source URL above), 30 new outbreaks started between 15-25 Apr 2013, of which 22 were holdings with less than 10 bovine animals each.

*"Hachaklait", Clinical Veterinary Services (a mutual society cooperative owned by the farmers, which covers about 90 per cent of Israel's dairy cattle industry and a large proportion of the country's beef herds).

The continuous spread of LSD in the Palestinian Authority (West Bank) might be related to the incomplete vaccination: reportedly, 14 365 animals have been vaccinated so far, while the total cattle population is estimated to be almost twice as large. - Mod.AS
