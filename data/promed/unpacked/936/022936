A Queensland researcher says medical authorities should be on the
lookout for signs of the disease leptospirosis, particularly among
young backpackers. The disease, which can be fatal, is spread by
animal urine and was once thought to only affect farmers [in Australia].

University of Queensland (UQ) researcher Colleen Lau says seasonal
farm workers [and] European travelers are also susceptible to the
disease. She says clinicians do not always pick up the signs.
"Clinicians in northern Queensland are often quite aware of this
infection because it's relatively common there," she said. "But [if]
someone has gone backpacking somewhere and they come back to a
doctor's surgery in Sydney, they might just not think about it." Ms
Lau says the illness is also known as "canecutters disease.''

She says the disease is now appearing in seasonal workers on banana
farms and canefields as well as travelers from developing [sic]
nations. "What we are trying to do is alert clinicians to the fact
that there are more and more people with 'lepto' who are not your
classic male farmer," she said. "[The] earlier treated, the better
your outcome is."

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by exposure to several
types of the _Leptospira_ bacteria, which can be found in fresh (not
salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated by
infected animal urine. Leptospirosis affects humans and a variety of
animals including dogs, cattle, pigs, and rodents. Chronically
infected animals excrete leptospires in their urine. _Leptospira_
enter the body through open sores or wounds in the skin, or through
mucous membranes. People can also contract leptospirosis by drinking
water that has been contaminated by the urine of an infected animal.
Leptospirosis occurs worldwide in warm climates. Outbreaks can follow
higher rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent
numbers.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for many people who work
outdoors or with animals, for example, workers in wet agricultural
settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse
workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fish
workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Also leptospirosis is a
risk during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water
swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that
involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by
urine from leptospire-infected animals, as well as household exposure
to infected pet animals or rodents
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/leptospirosis_g.htm>).

Leptospirosis also been reported in city dwellers in the absence of
recognized occupational or recreational exposure in, for example, the
USA (Vinetz JM, Glass GE, Flexner CE, Mueller P: Sporadic urban
leptospirosis. Ann Intern Med. 1996; 125(10): 794-8; available at
<http://www.annals.org/content/125/10/794.full>

and Japan (Koizumi N, Muto M, Tanikawa T, et al: Human leptospirosis
cases and the prevalence of rats harbouring _Leptospira interrogans_
in urban areas of Tokyo, Japan. J Med Microbiol 2009; 58: 1227-30;
abstract available at
<http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/58/9/1227>).

These urban cases were presumably acquired by exposure to infected rat
urine or contact with urine of infected dogs (Wong ML, Kaplan S,
Dunkle LM, et al: Leptospirosis: a childhood disease. J Pediat 1977;
90: 532-7; abstract available at
<http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(77)80361-2/abstract>).

No data for leptospirosis are available for the USA since 1995, when
leptospirosis ceased to be a nationally notifiable disease
(<http://www.leptospirosis.org/topic.php?t=44>), although it is still
reportable in some states. See
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eId/vol10no3/03-0431.htm>
for a recent discussion of leptospirosis in California.

Symptoms typically appear about 10 days (range 2-30 days) after
infection (<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/220563-overview>).

The following is extracted from Mod. ML's comments in a prior
ProMED-mail post, archive number 20091016.3561 (see below):

More than 90 percent of patients with leptospirosis have a mild,
self-limited illness, with fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, cough, pharyngitis, [red eyes], skin rash, and muscle pain
especially in calves and lumbar region, which is rarely fatal. About
10 percent develop a more severe illness with myocardial, pulmonary,
renal, or hepatic involvement that may be fatal in 5-40 percent. In
recent studies of patients admitted to hospitals, about 20 percent die
(see <http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/513767> and
<http://www.psmid.org.ph/vol31/vol31num4topic1.pdf>).

Leptospirosis is usually treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone
intravenously for severe disease and doxycycline or amoxicillin for
milder disease; penicillin therapy may be complicated by a
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction [temporary worsening of clinical status in
patients undergoing anti-infective treatment, when large quantities of
toxins are released into the body as bacteria die). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
Efficacy of antibiotic therapy when used late in the course of the
disease may be limited by the immunologic causation of the 2nd phase
of this illness. For a review of leptospirosis, see Levett PN:
Leptospirosis. Clin Microbiol Rev 2001; 14: 296-326, available at
<http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/14/2/296>.

Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be
effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments
(Takafuji ET, Kirkpatrick JW, Miller RN, et al: An efficacy trial of
doxycycline chemoprophylaxis against leptospirosis. N Engl J Med 1984;
310: 497-500, abstract available at
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/310/8/497?ijkey=c555d2c8fdfb7b88656e1de2fa9564b234ac08ad&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha>).

Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental
situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease
(such as: swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or
disease, swamp fever and mud fever). Canecutter's disease apparently
got its name from leptospirosis that occurred among mainly immigrant
canecutters in Queensland, Australia in the 1930's; infected canefield
rats, present in large numbers during the wet summers of the early
1930's, spread the disease through their urine (see
<http://libcom.org/history/1934-queensland-canecutters-strike>).

The numbers of farm workers and travelers in Queensland who have now
developed leptospirosis is not specified in the news release above.
