According to the mayor [of] Palos Blancos [municipality], 60 to 70 per cent of the papaya crops in [a number of] municipalities of [the department of La Paz] are being affected by a plague. Papaya is one of the most cultivated products throughout this area.

This plague has affected a large number of hectares, he said. "The plague begins to dry the plants before the fruit grows. We still don't know what kind of pest we are dealing with. Last week [week of 11 Jul 2016] National Service [Senasa] came to take samples, but they haven't shared their results with us."

[The area] also produces citrus fruits, which, just like the papaya crops, are also being affected by an unknown plague and have been inspected by Senasa officials.

[A number of diseases have been reported on both papaya and citrus in the region. While there are some fungal and bacterial pathogens that have a wide host range, it is more likely that more than one crop disease is affecting the area. However, insect pests could be involved as well. Reliable diagnosis on both hosts will be essential for disease management.

A crop disease survey in Bolivia in 2013 has reported _Papaya ringspot virus_ and _Citrus tristeza virus_ in the respective crops (ProMED-mail post 20130504.1690667).
