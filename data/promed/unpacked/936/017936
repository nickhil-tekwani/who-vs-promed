A Galveston Bay oyster outbreak in Texas has sickened dozens of people in that state and also in Florida, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). A recall of all oysters that were harvested in the TX 1 area of southeastern Galveston Bay has been ordered. No other species of seafood are affected by this recall. The recall includes oysters on the half shell and shucked oysters that were harvested there from 17 Nov 2022 through 7 Dec 2022.

The area was closed on 8 Dec 2022 after receiving reports from health departments in both Texas and Florida that people who ate oysters harvested from TX 1 were getting sick. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. No illness onset dates have been reported, and no hospitalizations have been reported at this time. And there is no information yet on what pathogen has caused this outbreak. In the past, raw oyster outbreaks have been linked to several different types of pathogens, including _Vibrio_, sapovirus, norovirus, and even _Shigella_ and _E. coli_. Public health officials are collecting water samples from that area for testing. They are also trying to determine when the area may safely reopen for harvesting.

Consumers who purchased Texas oysters since 17 Nov 2022 should check the packaging to see if the shellfish were harvested in that area. If the oysters are unpackaged, contact the seller to find the source. Restaurants should contact their distributors for information, and any oysters from TX 1 should be discarded. If you have eaten Galveston Bay oysters harvested from the TX 1 area and have been ill with these symptoms, see your doctor. You may be part of this Galveston Bay oyster outbreak.

[Perhaps 2 of the earliest pathogens associated with uncooked shellfish are hepatitis A and typhoid fever.

Another potential etiology not often discussed is diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP). DSP "is a gastrointestinal illness caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins produced by marine dinoflagellates belonging to the genera _Dinophysis_ spp. (_D. fortii_, _D. mitra_, _D. rotundata_, _D. tripos_, _D. acuta_, _D. norvegica_, and _D. acuminata_) and _Prorocentrum_ spp. (_P. lima_, _P. maculosum_, _P. concavum_, and _P. hoffmannianum_). The DSP toxins, including okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), and dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3), belong to the larger group of lipophilic toxins which also includes the azaspiracid, yessotoxin, and pectenotoxin group toxins."

The term "diarrhetic shellfish poisoning" is often used for the illness, but this moderator prefers to use "diarrheal shellfish poisoning" to avoid any confusion between the almost homophones of "diarrhetic" and "diuretic."

DSP is often mistaken for norovirus-like disease. It is treated with rehydration, and affected individuals usually recover in 1 to 2 days. DSP diarrhea is the most commonly reported symptom (92%), closely followed by nausea (80%) and vomiting (79%), with onset 30 minutes to 12 hours from ingestion. Cooking or freezing does not destroy the toxin. DSP is most commonly found in shellfish in Europe and Japan but can appear anywhere and bears consideration with the appropriate epidemiology. - Mod.LL
