RI shuts down U.S. medical laboratory
------------------
The U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit number 2 (NAMRU-2) laboratory in
Jakarta will be temporarily shut down because it offers "little
benefit" to Indonesia, Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said
Thursday [25 Sep 2008].

"They are not allowed to conduct any activities anymore. The term is
suspension, but there are no activities at all now," she was quoted
as saying by Reuters.

Siti, Indonesia's senior-most medical official, said she staunchly
opposed the medical lab and called for its closure, arguing that it
did not benefit national interests and even compromised national security.

Siti said the lab refused to share all of its findings with the host country.

Indonesia and the U.S. ceased negotiations on the future of the lab
in June [2006] after officials and legislators proved unable to agree
whether the lab, active since 1970, should continue its operations in
Indonesia.

The Indonesian Foreign Ministry said the temporary closure of the lab
was not contentious as negotiations between the 2 sides were ongoing.

"As long as we are still negotiating a new umbrella agreement for
NAMRU, the termination of activities is no problem," Foreign Ministry
spokesman Teuku Faizasyah told The Jakarta Post by phone from New York.

The halt in activities does not mean the lab will be closed
permanently as the contract with Washington to operate the lab has
not yet terminated, another Indonesian Foreign Ministry official said.

"We still have a contract. Although it was terminated in 2000, then
President Abdurahman Wahid revived it," ministry director general for
relations with America and Europe Retno P. Marsudi said.

The U.S. and Indonesia have yet to resume talks since the June [2008]
negotiations breakdown, she said.

The negotiations were complicated by an international dispute over
how to share crucial bird flu samples.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt has said the
quarrel over Indonesia's refusal to share its samples of the H5N1
avian influenza virus with the rest of the world has spilled into the
NAMRU talks.

Siti earlier forbid samples of the virus to be shipped outside of
Indonesia, citing that rich nations and pharmaceutical companies
would benefit by using the samples to develop vaccines that poor
countries would not be able to afford.

Many international observers have said NAMRU is central to
Indonesia's early efforts to track mutations of H5N1, which is feared
may become transmissible among humans with the potential for it to
sweep the world in months and kill millions.

Indonesia has suffered 112 deaths from the virus, making it the
country with the highest death toll.

Indonesia has halted the activities of a U.S. naval medical lab in
Jakarta following a dispute over the terms of a contract, the health
minister said on Thursday [25 Sep 2008].

The U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2 [NAMRU-2] has been key to
efforts to track bird flu in Indonesia, the country with the most
human deaths from the H5N1 virus.

But a memorandum of understanding allowing the lab to operate in
Jakarta expired 2 years ago and was not renewed, as a dispute arose
over Indonesia's sharing of samples of H5N1 with the rest of the world.

"They are not allowed to do any activities anymore," Health Minister
Siti Fadillah Supari told Reuters by phone. "The term is suspension,
but there are no activities at all now."

Earlier in April [2008], she said the lab was not very beneficial to
Indonesia because it refused to share all its findings with the host country.

Retno Marsudi, Indonesian directorate general for America and Europe
relations, said the contract with Washington to operate the lab had
not been terminated.

A U.S. embassy spokesman in Jakarta declined to comment.

Indonesia ordered hospitals and labs in the country to stop supplying
bird flu samples to the American lab early this year [2008] and now
only reports bird flu cases in humans to the public every 6 months, a
move some scientists say could lead to delays in containing outbreaks
of the disease.

Jakarta has also refused to share bird flu samples, saying it wants
guarantees from richer nations and drug makers that poor countries
would get access to affordable vaccines developed from their samples.

International health experts say it is vital to have access to
samples of the constantly mutating H5N1 virus, which they fear could
change into a form easily transmissible among humans and sweep the
world in months, killing millions of people.

Indonesia has suffered 112 casualties from the virus.

[From the 2nd newswire above, it is unclear whether all activities of
the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2 [NAMRU-2] are suspended or
just the activities surrounding avian influenza virus, albeit the
article in the Jakarta Post seems to strongly suggest that all
activities are presently suspended.

NAMRU-2 has been collaborating with the Indonesian Ministry of
Health, the Indonesian National Institute of Health Research and
Development, and the Indonesian Center for Disease Control. These
joint activities have included collaborative research on diseases of
public health significance and in disaster relief in the wake of the
2004 Sumatra tsunami and the 2005 Central Java earthquake. Research
activities have included the field of emerging infectious diseases,
diarrheal disease morbidity and mortality, with studies to identify
bacterial and viral etiologic agents of acute diarrhea, monitoring
antimicrobial resistance of bacterial agents associated with
diarrhea, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and febrile illnesses,
evaluations of field applicable diagnostic assays, studies on all
components of malaria, vaccine development, vectors, antimalarials,
and, within the field of virology, arboviruses such as dengue,
chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever
viruses, such as hantaviruses, and HIV vaccine development.

NAMRU-2 is collaborating in other countries in Southeast Asia,
including Viet Nam, Laos, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, and
Cambodia, and a satellite laboratory was opened in Cambodia to
conduct regional infectious disease outbreak research and diagnostic
laboratory support. In a region with a limited laboratory support
network, its presence has been considered a tremendous asset to the
region. - Mod.MPP]
