Seven cases of Escherichia coli O157 infection with dates of onset in the
latter half of September, four of whom required admission to hospital, have
been reported by a health authority in the south east of England. The three
primary cases are known to have consumed unpasteurised cream from a small
local farm. E. coli O157 has been isolated from the stools of four
secondary cases (relations of those initially affected), and isolates from
all seven cases have been identified as of phage type 2 by the PHLS
Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens. Further molecular studies are in progress.
Supplies of the cream have been withdrawn from sale, no further stocks are
being distributed, and a pasteurisation notice has been served. E. coli
O157 has not so far been isolated from samples of the cream. Case finding
has identified no further cases. The local Veterinary Investigation Centre
is investigating the farm and herd.
Half of the 20 cases identified in four previous incidents of E. coli O157
infection associated with un- or inadequately pasteurised dairy products in
England required hospital admission and four developed haemolytic uraemic
syndrome (HUS) (1-4). Untreated milk was identified as the cause of an
outbreak in the Sheffield area in 1993 (1), in which seven cases were
identified and isolates from the milk and from patients were
indistinguishable. In 1996 isolates from three cases in West Yorkshire were
indistinguishable from an isolate from a bottle of unpasteurised milk in
the house of one of the cases (2). Another outbreak in 1996 consisted of
nine cases and three asymptomatic excreters in north west England: all six
primary cases had drunk milk from a particular farm, whose pasteurisation
plant was found to be faulty (3). Earlier this year a 12 year old boy in
south east England developed HUS after eating cheese made with
unpasteurised milk (4).
