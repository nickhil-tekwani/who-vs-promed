Russian bird flu advances, Kazakhs say virus deadly
---------------------------------------------------
In Kazakhstan, which shares a long border with Siberia, the
Agriculture Ministry confirmed that the virus found in birds was the
deadly H5N1 strain.
The ministry, which reported an outbreak of avian flu on 4 Aug 2005,
said a quarantine was in place in the affected area near the
Golubovka village in northern Kazakhstan's Pavlodar region.
Kazakhstan, roughly the size of Western Europe, with a population of
just 15 million people, sought to play down fears of a growing
problem.
"The epizootic situation in (Kazakhstan's) poultry farms is safe,"
the agriculture ministry said. "As of 9 Aug 2005, there have been no
reports of new outbreaks of the disease among poultry or wildfowl in
the republic."
It added that officials were testing wildfowl in the many lakes and
reservoirs near the village of Golubovka. A quarantine was also in
place in the village of Vinogradovka, where bird flu was earlier
reported and where 345 poultry had been culled, it said.
