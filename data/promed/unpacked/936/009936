Whole Genome-Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis of a Historical Collection of Bacillus anthracis Strains from Danish Cattle.

Abstract
----
_Bacillus anthracis_, the causative agent of anthrax, is known as 1 of the most genetically monomorphic species. Canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing and whole-genome sequencing were used to investigate the molecular diversity of 11 _B. anthracis_ strains isolated from cattle in Denmark between 1935 and 1988. Danish strains were assigned into 5 canSNP groups or lineages, i.e. A.Br.001/002 (n = 4), A.Br.Ames (n = 2), A.Br.008/011 (n = 2), A.Br.005/006 (n = 2) and A.Br.Aust94 (n = 1). The match with the A.Br.Ames lineage is of particular interest, as the occurrence of such lineage in Europe is demonstrated for the 1st time, filling an historical gap within the phylogeography of the lineage. Comparative genome analyses of these strains with 41 isolates from other parts of the world revealed that the 2 Danish A.Br.008/011 strains were related to the heroin-associated strains responsible for outbreaks of injection anthrax in drug users in Europe. 8 novel diagnostic SNPs that specifically discriminate the different sub-groups of Danish strains were identified and developed into PCR-based genotyping assays.

[This is a very interesting paper using 11 archived cultures collected 1935-1988. During the years 1900-1930, around 100 cases of bovine anthrax were reported annually in Denmark, declining to fewer than 10 cases annually after 1950. The last reported case of bovine anthrax in Denmark occurred in 1988. Their only recent cases were in relation to contaminated heroin.

Like other European countries, Denmark would have acquired strains of _B. anthracis_ through the importation of contaminated bones, hides, wool, and hair. The home base for the Ames strain is Inner Mongolia, China, and therefore it is interesting that Denmark did have it, presumably via some imported industrial product from China, as had the US; its appearance in Texas was in contaminated bone meal, probably from infected livestock downstream of a wool or hair mill in New England. For a discussion on the origins of these various Danish strains, members are encouraged to read the full paper. - Mod.MHJ
