Viet Nam: Family test negative for bird flu, positive for pneumonia
-----------------------------------------------
Health officials on Tue 2 Jan 2007 declared that the 4 Vietnamese family
members tested negative for bird flu. They were admitted to the hospital
because they were suspected to have bird flu after eating sick chickens.
The doctor at Nam Can Hospital in the southern province of Ca Mau said that
all the required tests were conducted thoroughly and found that they did
not have flu. Thousands of ducks and chickens were killed and a few areas
were disinfected after the 1st case of bird flu was suspected on 11 Dec
2006 in Ca Mau, Bac Lieu and Hau Giang, the 3 provinces of the Mekong delta.
"They tested negative for the H5N1 strain of bird flu," said Phan Van Tu,
chief virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City. "They were
suffering from pneumonia." Viet Nam has not witnessed any human cases
infected with bird flu, even though the 1st outbreak of H5N1 [in poultry]
was seen in August [2006].
Poultry transport across the border has been tightened by the government,
especially in the provinces bordering China. According to the government,
the consumption of poultry increases during the Lunar New Year festival,
and the chances of bird flu spreading at that time are greater.
Viet Nam is known for its extensive usage of poultry vaccination, using
careful surveillance methods, and various other methods of curbing bird flu
in the country since 42 human deaths out of 91 cases were reported [between
late 2003 and the end of 2005] due to H5N1 bird flu virus.
Bird flu is characterized by fever, coughing, decreased white blood cell
counts and damaged lungs. The symptoms of pneumonia are cough with greenish
or yellow sputum, a high fever that may be accompanied by shaking chills,
shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, a sharp or stabbing pain, either
felt constantly or felt worse during deep breaths or coughs.
Sometimes, people may cough up blood, experience headaches, or develop
sweaty and clammy skin. Loss of appetite, fatigue, blueness of the skin,
nausea, vomiting, and joint pains or muscle aches are other symptoms. If
_Legionella_ causes pneumonia, there might be abdominal pain and diarrhea,
while if caused by tuberculosis or _Pneumocystis_, there might only be
weight loss and night sweats.

[This report supports our previous belief that no human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection have been confirmed in Viet Nam during
the past year, despite the reappearance of bird flu in poultry in 3
southern provinces of Viet Nam (see ProMED-mail references below).
It is possible that the family described in this report is the same as that
recorded as unconfirmed previously in "Avian influenza, human (194) - Viet
Nam: NOT 20061231.3663." If so, there are only 2 suspected cases awaiting a
final verdict. - Mod.CP]
