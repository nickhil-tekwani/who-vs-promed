First Report of Fusarium Wilt of Lettuce Caused by _Fusarium
oxysporum_ f. sp. _lactucae_ in Arizona.
M. E. Matheron, University of Arizona, Yuma Agricultural Center, Yuma
85364; and S. T. Koike, University of California Cooperative
Extension, Salinas 93901. Plant Dis. 87:1265, 2003; published on-line
as D-2003-0806-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 23 Jul 2003.
A new wilt and root rot disease was observed in 6 and 11 commercial
fields of lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_) in western Arizona during the
fall of 2001 and 2002, respectively. Distance between infested sites
ranged from approximately 0.5 to 39 km. 5 head lettuce cultivars as
well as a red leaf lettuce cultivar were affected.
Disease symptoms included yellowing and wilting of leaves, as well as
stunting and plant death. The cortex of the crown and upper root of
infected plants usually was decayed and reddish brown. Disease
symptoms first appeared at the time of plant thinning and continued
to develop up to plant maturity. _Fusarium oxysporum_ was
consistently isolated from symptomatic plant roots.
Seeds of cv. Lighthouse were planted in nonsterile vermiculite within
3.0-cm-square x 7.0-cm-deep cells in a transplant tray and thinned to
a single plant per cell. When the first true leaves were emerging, 10
individual seedlings were inoculated with a single-spore isolate of
_F. oxysporum_ recovered from diseased lettuce root cortex tissue.
Inoculum was prepared by growing the fungus on potato dextrose agar
in 100-mm-diameter x 15-mm-deep plastic petri dishes at 28 deg C with
a 12-h photoperiod under fluorescent light. Once the fungus
completely covered the agar surface, 50 ml of sterile distilled water
was added to the dish, and the mycelia and conidia on the surface
were scraped off the agar and suspended in the water. This fungal
suspension was decanted, and a 2-ml aliquot containing 180 000 CFU
was pipetted into the vermiculite near the stem of each lettuce
seedling.
10 plants grown in noninfested vermiculite served as uninoculated
controls. After inoculation, plants were maintained in a growth
chamber at 28 deg C with a 12-h photoperiod under fluorescent light
for 3 weeks. Symptoms of yellowing, wilt, vascular decay, and often
plant death developed during the incubation period on all inoculated
plants but not on control plants.
_Fusarium oxysporum_ was consistently reisolated from inoculated
plants but not from uninoculated plants. The experiment was repeated
and yielded the same results.
A wilt and root rot disease of lettuce attributed to _F. oxysporum_
f. sp. _lactucae_ was first reported in Japan in 1967 (3) and
subsequently in the United States (San Joaquin Valley of California)
in 1993 (2), and Italy in 2002 (1). The researchers of the U.S.
report did not cite the earlier work from Japan and described the
pathogen as _F. oxysporum f. sp. lactucum_. The Arizona isolate used
to demonstrate pathogenicity was of the same vegetative compatibility
group as an isolate of the pathogen from lettuce in California
reported in 1993.
Several companies grow and harvest lettuce in Arizona and California.
At the end of production and harvest in the fall, tractors,
implements, and harvesting equipment are transported from the San
Joaquin Valley in California to western Arizona. The similarity
between the isolate of _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _lactucae_ from western
Arizona and the San Joaquin Valley of California suggest a possible
introduction of the pathogen into Arizona from California, perhaps on
soil adhering to farm equipment.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of _F. oxysporum_ f. sp.
_lactucae_ infecting lettuce in Arizona.

[In USA, Fusarium wilt [Fw] of lettuce was first found in lettuce
fields in Fresno County near Huron, CA in 1990 and subsequently in
Yuma County, AZ in 2001-2002 in Watsonville, CA. Fw spores can remain
in soil and infected crop material for many years. 11 new infected
lettuce fields were found in the 2002-2003 season in Arizona.
Scientists at the Yuma Agricultural Center have noted varietal
differences in susceptibility to Fw. Crop losses were 95, 75, 60, 50,
and 18 percent in head lettuce, butterhead, greenleaf, redleaf, and
romaine, respectively. Gross income for head lettuce producers was
$329 million dollars (US) in 2001. Recommendations for disease
management include preventing spread of contaminated soil on field
equipment and planting in fields known to be free of the pathogen. A
search for genetic resistance to Fw has begun. - Mod.DH]
