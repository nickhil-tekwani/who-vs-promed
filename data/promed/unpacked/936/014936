There have been 88 000 cases of malaria in Venezuela
----------------------------------------------------
The increase in the number people infected with malaria is an epidemic, with the number of cases more than 55.3 percent higher compared to the same period last year [2014].

Malaria in children under 10 years of age increased 75.6 percent since 2011 (5420 cases) and 2014 (9206 infected) and is expected to increase 138.9 percent by the end of 2015.

The high burden of malaria worries doctors. One example is the Sifontes municipality, Bolivar state, where 88.48 percent of the cases originated.

There is a complex dynamic of malaria transmission in Venezuela and an increased risk of expanding the areas of transmission, it was said.

Other data showed that up to [29 Aug 2015], of the 9631 cases imported from Bolivar, 6777 were _Plasmodium vivax_; 1440 _P. falciparum_ and 2480 mixed infections. Add to that a growing number of imported cases from Colombia, Guyana, Brazil and other countries (987 to week 35 of 2015).

To monitor the progress of the disease, experts recommend strengthening the system of registration and surveillance of malaria, supervised treatment, and similarly disclosure of the logging cases from states with high transmission.

[Many reports have indicated an increasing risk of malaria in Venezuela over the recent years. The lack of proper resources to implement control is most likely the main reason. This includes impregnated bed nets, spraying and availability of antimalarial drugs.

Bolivar state is located in the south of Venezuela and includes part of the Amazon.
