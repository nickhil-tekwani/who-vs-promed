[The West Nile virus season in the United States is effectively over. No new
cases are reported by New York State, which is the only State to continue
weekly reporting. No further information on the additional human case
reported by New York State on 1 Dec 2000 is given in the current Update. The
US Department of Agriculture Report on the outbreak covers the period up to
Fri 1 Dec 2000, and remains as posted in West Nile virus surveillance - USA
(52). - Mod.CP

This week, no new West Nile virus positive cases were reported.
A correction of the location of one West Nile virus positive bird changed
the totals for 2 New York City boroughs (Staten Island is now 60, and Queens
is now 30).
The total number of West Nile virus positive specimens from New York State
for this year is 1271 dead birds, 358 mosquito pools, 2 sentinel chickens,
8 live wild birds, 14 bats, 24 horses, 2 cats, 2 raccoons, 3 domestic
rabbits, 3 squirrels, 1 chipmunk, and 14 humans cases.
The New York State Map of West Nile virus positive results has been updated
to cover the period 1 Jan 2000 through 15 Dec 2000.

Note of clarification: This text report and the New York State summary map
reports West Nile virus positive results. Encephalitis or severe neurologic
symptoms were not present in all of the human, bird, and mammal positive
West Nile virus "cases". A number of the birds and mammals had no clinical
signs of West Nile virus infection at all; they were asymptomatic
surveillance specimens.
