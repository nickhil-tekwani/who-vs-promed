[This is the 1st time that Iraq reports a H5N8 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza strain, this immediate notification confirms and complements the information published in ProMED-mail 20180106.5541979.This strain has been reported also by Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Although in Afghanistan the neuraminidase has not yet been characterized for the HPAI isolate recently reported, given the HPAI H5N8 reported events in the area, there is a good likelihood that this strain may also be an H5N8 subtype.
