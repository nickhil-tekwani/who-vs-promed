[1] WHO global update

Update number 336 (based on data up to 17 Feb 2019)
---------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns. For more information on influenza transmission zones, see https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/Influenza_Transmission_Zones20180914.pdf

Summary
-------
In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere influenza activity continued to increase.

- In North America, influenza activity continued to increase in the United States of America, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as the dominant subtype, followed by influenza A(H3N2).
- In Europe, influenza activity remained elevated across the continent and was reported as widespread in most of the countries. Influenza A viruses co-circulated.
- In North Africa, influenza activity remained elevated.
- In Western Asia, influenza activity peaked is some countries and increased in other, with all seasonal influenza subtypes co-circulating.
- In East Asia, influenza activity appeared to decrease overall, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominating.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity remained elevated overall with influenza A viruses predominating.
- In the Caribbean, Central American countries, and the tropical countries of South America, influenza and RSV activity were low in general.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels, with the exception of some parts of Australia where influenza activity remained above inter-seasonal levels.
Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 115 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 4 Feb 2019 to 17 Feb 2019 (data as of 1 Mar 2019 05:22:16 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 220 347 specimens during that time period. 74 302 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 73 225 (98.6%) were typed as influenza A and 1077 (1.4%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 19 600 (65.2%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 10 447 (34.8%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 82 (26.2%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 231 (73.8%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for use in the 2019-2020 Northern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on 18-21 Feb 2019 in Beijing, China. It was recommended that egg based quadrivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09 - like virus; an A(H3N2) virus to be announced on 21 March 2019*; a B/Colorado/06/2017- like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); and a B/Phuket/3073/2013 - like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). It was also recommended that the influenza B virus component of trivalent vaccines for use in the 2019-2020 northern hemisphere influenza season be a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus of the B/Victoria/2/87-lineage.

* In light of recent changes in the proportions of genetically and antigenically diverse A(H3N2) viruses, the recommendation for the A(H3N2) component has been postponed.

The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System), FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[Overall, high influenza activity was reported in most of the northern hemisphere, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as the dominant influenza A subtype and mainly influenza B-Victoria lineage for influenza B. No novel viruses were detected in the reporting period. - Mod.UBA]

More than 2500 cases of seasonal [influenza A(H1N1)], also known as swine flu, were recorded in just one week in India, between [24 Feb-3 Mar 2019], according to a report by the National Centre for Disease Control [NCDC]. It also shows that 17 366 cases and 530 deaths were recorded in the country until [3 Mar 2019].

The number of cases reported in the 1st 2 months of the year [2019] is much higher than the 14 992 cases recorded in the entire year in 2018. Last year [2018], 1103 deaths had been reported. The high number of cases this year [2019] could be because more people are getting tested, experts said.

"H1N1 is just like any other seasonal influenza, but because people hear about it in the news and are aware they ask to be tested. Also, H1N1 is the only flu for which there is a test available in the hospitals. So the higher numbers could be because of more testing rather than a higher number of cases in the community. This could also be the reason why the number of deaths is lower," said Dr Ekta Gupta, additional professor of Virology, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), Delhi.

Of the 530 deaths that have been reported so far, 254 were from just 2 states -- Rajasthan and Gujarat. These 2 states have also reported the highest number of cases.

So far, 4317 people in Rajasthan and 3408 people in Gujarat have tested positive for H1N1. With 3134 cases, Delhi is not far behind. Of the total, 408 cases were reported this week [week of 4 Mar 2019] in the national capital. This shows a declining trend, with the highest increase over a week being 609 cases reported 2 weeks ago. "Prolonged winters in Rajasthan and Delhi could also be the reason for the higher number of flu cases being reported," said Gupta.

The numbers could further go up during the monsoon when India experiences another peak of seasonal influenza cases.

Doctors say that the transmission of flu can be prevented by following proper hand hygiene, staying away from crowded places if possible, and staying at home and taking rest if a person has a fever. Most people recover on their own without any treatment. The young, the old, pregnant women, and people with health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney or liver disease, may need to take Tamiflu if they have a fever.

A very small percentage of people need hospitalisation if they develop respiratory symptoms. Annual flu vaccines are recommended for those at risk.

[Individuals at high-risk for developing influenza-associated complications should receive the influenza vaccine annually. Influenza antiviral medications are recommended for treatment and prophylaxis (specific indications only) in addition to influenza vaccine (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm).

Seeking treatment early in the course of the disease, particularly for individuals in high-risk groups, is important to manage influenza-associated complications and help reduce mortality. - Mod.UBA
