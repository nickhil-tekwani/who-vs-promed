[C] Update 37 - WHO extends its SARS-related travel advice to Beijing and
Shanxi Province in China and to Toronto Canada 23 Apr 2003 [edited]
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_23/en/>
As a result of ongoing assessments as to the nature of outbreaks of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing and Shanxi Province, China,
and in Toronto, Canada, WHO is now recommending, as a precaution, that
people planning to travel to these destinations consider postponing all but
essential travel. This temporary advice, which is an extension of travel
advice previously issued for Guangdong Province and Hong Kong SAR, China
will be reassessed in 3 weeks.
Subsequent information from the Chinese government about the magnitude of
the SARS outbreaks in Beijing and Shanxi Province has been reviewed by WHO.
This assessment has considered the size of the outbreak, including both the
number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases, the extent of
local chains of transmission, and evidence that travellers are becoming
infected while in one area and then subsequently exporting the disease
elsewhere. On the basis of this assessment, WHO is extending its 2 Apr 2003
travel advice to include Beijing and Shanxi Province.
Using the same criteria, WHO has assessed the SARS situation in Toronto,
Canada. The outbreak in this area has continued to grow and has affected
groups outside the initial risk groups of hospital workers, families,
visitors, and other close person to person contacts. In addition, a few
people with SARS, now in other countries in the world, appear to have
acquired the infection while in Toronto. On the basis of this information,
WHO is also including Toronto in the extension of its SARS-related travel
advice.
This advice will be re-examined in 3 weeks time, which is twice the maximum
incubation period of SARS. The WHO travel advice is issued in order to
protect public health and reduce opportunities for further international
spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February [2003],
that has spread along the routes of international air travel. As of 22 Apr
2003, a cumulative total of 3947 cases had been reported from 25 countries
on 5 continents. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS
and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.
The SARS situation is assessed daily to determine whether other areas need
to be included in the travel advice and if additional precautionary
measures are required.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 23 Apr 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 23 Apr 2003, there are an additional 24 patients confirmed to
have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.
They include 4 healthcare workers (2 from Princess Margaret Hospital, one
from Prince of Wales Hospital, and one from Caritas Medical Centre). The
remaining 20 are other patients and contacts of patients with atypical
pneumonia.
A total of 522 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 61 were discharged today.
There are also 133 recovering patients who are in convalescence and
preparation for discharge. 110 patients are receiving treatment in
intensive care units.
6 patients died in Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (AHNH), Princess
Margaret Hospital (PMH), and Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) This brought to
105 the total number of deaths relating to atypical pneumonia.
The 6 deceased, aged from 34 to 81, include 4 men and 2 women. 3 of them
have a history of chronic disease. [There were 2 deaths in otherwise
healthy individuals under the age of 50 - Mod.MPP]
Cumulative no. cases / total no. discharged patients / total no. deaths*
Health care workers of hospitals/clinics and medical students 335/ 124/ ?
Patients, family members & visitors: 1123/ 398/ ?
Total: 1458 **/ 522/ 105
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of chronic
diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage
of infection.
** There are 133 recovering patients in convalescence.
[A daily SARS bulletin with epidemiological information on the outbreak in
Hong Kong is available at the Hong Kong Department of Health website
<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm>. The epidemic curve current as of 22 Apr
2003 presents the number of cases by date of onset. Numbers of cases peaked
with dates of onset 24 and 25 Mar 2003. The shape of the curve suggests
decreased transmission over the past week, but caution should be exercised
in interpretation, as it is too soon to draw firm conclusions, given
delayed presentation of cases to the health sector, "non-classical" (if one
can use this term here) presentation of symptoms, and other possible
variables that might influence the appearance of new areas of transmission.

SARS situation update 23 Apr 2003 [edited]
---------------------------------
As of 23 Apr 2003, 58 SARS patients remain in hospital. There are 3
additional SARS cases reported today. One case of SARS died today -- a 74
year old male inpatient of Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Ward 58.
The 3 additional cases are:
- a 28 year old female staff nurse from National University Hospital (NUH),
who was a contact of the NUH SARS patient admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003,
transferred to [Tan Tock Seng Hospital] TTSH on 9 Apr 2003, and who died on
12 Apr 2003;
- a 60 year old woman who is a friend of a probable SARS case; and
- a 68 year old woman; investigations are still underway to determine her
source of infection.
Update on Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market (PPWM)
There are no new probable cases linked to the Pasir Panjang Wholesale
Market. There are 14 suspected SARS cases linked to the market who have
been admitted, comprising 8 people with direct links to the market (1
worker and 7 visitors) and 6 of their family members. Among the family
members are 2 children, aged 18 months and 10 years.
Update on Jurong Shipyard workers
A 47 year old Malaysian who lived and worked in Singapore was admitted to
Alexandra Hospital on 12 Apr 2003 for pneumonia and later transferred to
intensive care at TTSH, where he died on 13 Apr 2003. He had travelled to
Pontian, Johore from 24 to 30 Mar 2003 to attend his father's funeral and
returned to Singapore on 31 Mar 2003. He was a welder in Jurong Shipyard.
Laboratory investigations have revealed that he had a pneumococcal blood
infection and postmortem samples of the lung, spleen, intestine, and lymph
nodes were negative for coronavirus. His death has been determined to be
non-SARS related.
It was reported that another Malaysian Jurong Shipyard worker, who lived in
Johore, was classified by the Malaysian health authorities as an imported
SARS case from Singapore. His last day in Singapore was on 25 Mar 2003, and
he became ill on 11 Apr 2003. It is therefore unlikely that he was infected
in Singapore, as this would give an incubation period of 17 days.
Investigations have revealed that the 2 cases are not linked to each other.
Update on the admissions and discharges (SGH cluster)
The SGH cluster of infection in Wards 57 and 58 could be traced to the
Chinese man in his 60s who was previously discharged from TTSH and
re-admitted to SGH Ward 57 on 24 Mar 2003 and subsequently to Ward 58 on 29
Mar 2003. On 5 Apr 2003, a cohort of staff from Wards 57 and 58 were noted
to have low-grade fever. As part of the isolate-and-contain strategy, the
decision was made to transfer all inpatients from Wards 57 and 58 to TTSH.
At the same time, a team consisting of doctors from the Department of
General Surgery, nurses, and Allied Health workers moved over to TTSH to
continue the care for these patients.
On 14 Apr 2003, it was noted that 3 patients in a cubicle in Ward 74 had
fever. As a precautionary measure, the decision was made to transfer all
patients from Ward 74 to TTSH. Again doctors and nurses accompanied the
patients in the move. So far, none of the patients have become probable
cases and the staff remained well. Since the transfer, no new cases have
developed in SGH thus far.
A total of 166 health care workers, patients, visitors, and contacts were
admitted to TTSH as a result of the SGH cluster of infections. Of these, 52
are probable, 65 are suspect, and 45 are under observation. 4 patients are
non-SARS. 88 of this cohort have been discharged, leaving 70 still in
hospital. There were 8 deaths, of whom 5 had multiple medical illnesses.
A summary of the SARS cases to date:
Discharged: 114
Hospitalised: 58 (including 18 in intensive care)
Deaths: 15 + 2 (pending further post mortem test results)
Total: 189
Suspected: 95 (including 5 children below 18)
Under home quarantine orders: 2467

Taiwan SARS Update 23 Apr 2003
------------------------------
As of 3:00 PM on 23 Apr 2003, there were 205 possible SARS cases reported:
38 probable, 50 suspected, 88 excluded, and 29 pending cases. Compared with
the previous day, this represents an increase of 9 probable cases,
considered to be a small cluster that occurred in a hospital. Since most
patients were considered to be infected on B8 and A7 wards, Taiwan CDC
immediately asked the hospital to follow the Hospital Infection Control
Guidance for SARS and to take all precautionary measures, including
requiring health care workers to wear masks, disinfecting the hospital,
stopping medical service for new patients, treating SARS suspected cases in
the negative pressure rooms, isolating people who were in close contact
with SARS patients, implementing handwashing and health education, etc. In
an effort to contain the outbreak, Taiwan CDC has issued home quarantine
orders for 12 family members and 61 health care workers. Visitors to the
Hoping Hospital during the last 3 weeks are urged to watch for symptoms and
call the toll-free hotline (0800-024582) for immediate medical assistance
should symptoms arise.
In accordance with WHO guidelines, 21 of the 38 probable cases and 31 of
the 50 suspected cases have been discharged to home quarantine, while the
remaining 17 probable cases and 12 suspected cases are still being cared
for in negative pressure rooms. A total of 110 possible SARS cases have
been discharged from hospitals.
Taiwan CDC announces that an Amoy Garden (Hong Kong) resident came to
Taiwan and was identified as a probable SARS case. She was discharged from
hospital without fever for 3 consecutive days and took flight BR857 at 6:27
pm on 22 Apr 2003 back to Hong Kong. Since she has not completed 14 days
home quarantine (ordered in accordance with the guideline for patients
discharged), Taiwan CDC urges passengers who were on the same flight to
watch for symptoms and seek immediate medical assistance should symptoms arise.
As of 2:00 PM on 23 Apr 2003, a total of 1980 close contacts of probable
SARS cases had been given home quarantine notifications; 1639 of them have
completed their quarantines.

Summary of SARS cases, Canada 22 Apr 2003
-----------------------------------------
Since 21 Apr 2003, one additional probable case of SARS has been reported
in Canada (as of 22 Apr 2003). A total of 140 individuals who meet the
probable case definition and 184 who meet the suspect case definition of
SARS have been reported, including 14 deaths. In addition to British
Columbia and Ontario, which are reporting probable cases, Alberta,
Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island are also reporting
suspect cases of SARS (Table 1).
At the present time, the case fatality rate in Canada is estimated at about
4.3 per cent of probable or suspect cases (14 of 324 probable or suspect
cases). Most of the case fatalities have occurred in patients with
underlying illness, and nearly all were elderly patients over the age of 70
years.
Table 1: Cumulative number of SARS cases reported in Canada: 22 Apr 2003
Province/Territory: probable cases (1) / suspected cases (1) / deaths
British Columbia: 4 / 47 / 0
Alberta: 0 / 5 / 0
Saskatchewan: 0 / 1 / 0
Ontario: 136 / 125 / 14 (2)
New Brunswick: 0 / 2 / 0
Prince Edward Island: 0 / 4 / 0
Total: 140 / 184 / 14
(1)These people may be excluded the probable or suspect case list if
another cause is identified to fully explain their illness
(2) 13 of 14 deaths were probable cases, while 1 was a suspect case.
Another death, not included in this total count, was a 46 year old woman
who died in the Philippines on 13 Apr 2003. It is believed she may have
contracted SARS while in Toronto.
A summary of the current status of probable cases of SARS in Canada as of
22 Apr 2003 is presented in Table 2. 65 individuals have been discharged
(46.8 per cent) and of the 59 individuals currently in hospital, 49 (83.1
per cent) are improving or in a stable condition. In addition, nearly all
of the suspect cases reported in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta,
Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island have either recovered
or are presently recovering.
Table 2: Currently known reported status of probable cases of SARS in
Canada: 22 Apr 2003
(n=139, excludes 1 whose status is unknown)
Current Status: Number (per cent) Probable Cases
Hospitalised: 59/139 (42.4 per cent)
Improving: 14/59 (23.7 per cent)
Stable: 35/59 (59.3 per cent)
Critical/Deteriorating: 5/59 (8.5 per cent)
Unknown: 5/59 (8.5 per cent)
Discharged (1): 65/139 (46.8 per cent)
At Home (2): 2/139 (1.4 per cent)
Deaths: 13/139 (9.4 per cent)
Total number of probable cases whose current status is known: 139 (100 per
cent)
(1) Includes cases who have either recovered or are recovering
(2) Refers to individuals who have never previously been hospitalised.
The current evidence suggests that respiratory droplet transmission,
requiring close contact with a case of SARS, is the predominant mode of
transmission. The mean incubation period is 5 days (median 4 days, range 2
to 10). This estimate is based on data available from 42 probable or
suspect cases with a single known contact with a SARS case.
In the province of Ontario the majority of cases have been associated with
specific transmission settings, such as household, hospital, and specific
community groups or settings. As of 18 Apr 2003, a total of 20 probable and
11 suspect cases of SARS have been identified in a religious community
cluster. 4 members of the index family who are members of the religious
group had contact with a SARS case in the emergency room of a Toronto
hospital on 16 Mar 2003. 3 of them developed SARS after the exposure, and
the infection subsequently spread through their extended family. Key
transmission settings include a mass held on 28 Mar 2003, attended by about
500 members; a seminar on 29 Mar 2003, where 250 members were registered; a
funeral visitation for the index case held on 3 Apr 2003; as well as other
social gatherings during and after these dates. Currently, 14 members of
the index family, 3 health care workers, and 14 other religious group
members are affected. As of 12 Apr 2003, all members of the religious group
were quarantined, in an effort to contain any further spread within this
social network. Case finding and contact tracing efforts in the group are
continuing.
Travellers who have returned from an affected area in Asia and their close
contacts account for the remaining cases in Ontario and the other
provinces. The number of probable cases by reported symptom onset date and
type of exposure (where known) is provided [in Figure 1 at

[As of today a total of 4288 cases, with 251 deaths, have been reported to
WHO. In the 24 hours since the last WHO update, 343 new cases have been
reported of which 306 were from China, 24 from Hong Kong, and 8 from
Taiwan. Information from the Taiwan CDC update suggests that this latest
cluster of cases in Taiwan occurred in the health care setting.
A teleconference briefing held at WHO Geneva today discussed the newly
revised travel guidelines, which include additional areas in China (Beijing
and Shanxi province) as well as Toronto, Ontario, Canada to the list of
areas to which people should consider postponing non-essential travel due
to SARS transmission in the community. The rationale given for including
Toronto in this current travel warning mentioned that Toronto was
implicated in an exportation leading to a cluster of 5 cases in health care
workers in an as-yet-unidentified country. We await further details on this
occurrence. Other information provided in this briefing includes numbers of
cases for selected areas in China (daily update figures present the total
number of cases reported from China, and not by province or other
administrative jurisdiction such as city). According to this information,
Beijing has reported a cumulative total of 482 cases with 25 deaths and
confirms there is evidence of local transmission. Shanxi has reported a
cumulative total of 120 cases with 7 deaths and confirms there is evidence
of local transmission as well.
