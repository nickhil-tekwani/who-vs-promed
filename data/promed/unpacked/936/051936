[As of Fri 27 Sep 2019, there are 82 cases of legionellosis associated with the Mountain State Fair that was held in western North Carolina between 6-15 Sep 2019 in Fletcher, a town in Henderson County (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher,_North_Carolina). The fair draws about 190 000 people each year (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Mountain_State_Fair).

95% of the cases have Legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of the infection, and 5% have Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form of the infection. The species of _Legionella_ is not specified; however, the usual pathogen in the US is _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1. The source of the outbreak has not as yet been identified.

The prior news article posted by ProMED-mail reported that all 25 Legionnaires' disease cases reside in counties that immediately surround the location of the fair (Legionellosis - USA (20): (NC) fatal, agricultural fair susp. 20190927.6698517). Currently, the 82 cases come from 13 North Carolina counties. Although most cases reside in western North Carolina counties, some cases reside in counties in the middle of the state, and some cases reside South Carolina. A map showing the location of the North Carolina counties can be found at https://geology.com/county-map/north-carolina.shtml.

Travelers to an event such as a state fair typically disperse to their homes, widely separated from one another and perhaps at a very great distance from the source of infection, before developing symptoms, so that a cluster of cases of Legionnaires' disease in travelers associated with the same source may not be readily appreciated. A travel history is essential and should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms. - Mod.ML
