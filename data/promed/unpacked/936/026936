VULTURE DIE-OFF - INDIA, PAKISTAN, NEPAL (03)

In response to the RFI on the vulture die-off in Asia, I can provide some
information regarding the situation in Pakistan.
The investigation into population declines of the Oriental White-Backed
Vulture (_Gyps bengalensis_) in Pakistan is being primarily conducted by
the Peregrine Fund, a USA-based conservation organization, and the
Ornithology Society of Pakistan, with logistical support from Bahauddin
Zakariya University and the and the Pakistani National Council for
Conservation of Wildlife. Field studies over the last 2 years in the Punjab
Province indicate significant population declines (up to about 80 percent)
associated with high adult mortality rates (11-27 percent). Approximately
75 percent of the dead adult vultures have visceral gout, which in birds is
due to either primary or secondary renal insufficiency. High rates of
gout-associated mortality occur throughout the year, with moderate peaks in
the fall and spring, and with occasional mortality clusters.
The diagnostic work is primarily being coordinated by myself at Washington
State University. To date we have exported and examined the tissue of 35
birds with gout to try and identify the cause of renal disease.
Histopathology indicates acute nephrosis and visceral gout, with minimal
inflammation and no evidence of chronicity. Most cases have no other
significant lesions. Testing for known causes of renal disease and/or acute
death in birds have been negative in 33 of the 35 cases: specific causes
ruled out include infectious bronchitis virus, avian influenza, toxic
levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, toxic or deficient levels of
copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc, organophosphate toxicity,
carbamate toxicity, and organochlorine toxicity. Virus isolation, electron
microscopy on intestinal contents, and bacteriology have also been
negative. The cause of death in the other 2 vultures with gout were
infection with _Mycobacterium avium_ and presumptive organophosphate toxicity.
Although there is clearly a significant problem with the Pakistani
vultures, a cause has not been established. In Pakistan we feel that the
epidemiology and laboratory findings are consistent with either a toxic or
infectious disease, and currently we maintain both as working hypotheses.
Both field work and laboratory investigations are ongoing.

[The loss of vultures is serious and can result in the spread of diseases.
ProMED-mail discussed this issue several times and posted on the vulture
die-off in India on a couple of occasions (see references). We do not yet
know what is killing the vultures. At first no one took it seriously until
the death numbers were increasing dramatically. Vultures are very resistant
to anthrax and therefore serve as natural sanitation of the disease,
particularly in the cases of wild animals or animals that are seldom
observed for signs of illness. By taking the deceased vultures out of the
country, we may learn what the cause of death is, but we run the risk of
spreading the virus or prion or whatever the cause of death is. - Mod.TG]
