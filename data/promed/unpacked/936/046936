The number of people reporting getting sick at the Wurzbach Road location of Pasha Mediterranean Grill has increased.

The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District released the latest figures Friday afternoon, 7 Sep 2018, showing 255 reports of people getting ill, far more than the initial estimate of 60-plus cases since 5 Sep 2018. 12 people have been hospitalized. Officials said they have laboratory evidence of salmonellosis for 14 of the 255 people. Others are still being tested.

Metro Health reports that it has received at least 200 calls so far, and more are expected from those who believe they may have been affected. They are being urged to call 311 to report their illness so that Metro Health can confirm and track those cases. They're also advised to seek medical treatment as soon as possible to avoid becoming dehydrated and having to go to the hospital. The medical community is being told to test for salmonellosis if their patients complain of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps.

Dr. Colleen Bridger, Metro Health director, said although the agency knows that salmonellosis is the culprit, "We don't know where it came from, food handlers, or whether it came from the food that was being served, or both." She said salmonella bacteria are the result of food that is not properly stored, prepared, or served at the right temperature. She said it also can be spread if the food handler or server is sick and doesn't properly wash their hands.

Bridger said her inspectors have been at the restaurant every day this week, working with the restaurant management and its staff. "The restaurant has been extremely willing to work with us," Bridger said. "They've done everything we've asked them to do." After it was found the restaurant's refrigeration wasn't cold enough, she said it was closed briefly until refrigerators reached the proper temperature.

Bilal Deiri, Pasha's director of operations, said that inspectors have been "walking us through the process, advising us of all we should do, how to handle everything." He said none of their 3 other locations experienced any problems, and this is the 1st time in the restaurant's 10-year history that this has come up. Deiri said he and other employees are eating the food they prepare to see what effect it will have, but so far, he said, everyone's fine.

Deiri said he is still very concerned about the welfare of those who fell ill after eating at the Wurzbach location.

Bridger said Metro Health's job is to reduce the risk to the establishment and "get them through this as quickly as possible to avoid more people from getting sick."
