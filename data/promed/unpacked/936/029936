In Mexico the measles vaccination program has included revaccination in
childhood and teenagers because a short life with high account [amount? of
antibodies in the children was observed. In 1989-90 Mexico [experienced a
measles outbreak in which children and teenagers were affected.
What about the vaccine lot? Was it really well preserved? Sometimes vaccine
potency is low [due to bad management.
We do not know what ages the mothers had in Vanga.

The surprise of these doctors in the DR Congo is a surprise to me. For over
20 years, it's been known that infants who receive the measles vaccine
whilst still having placental measles antibodies in their blood may not
develop sufficient antibodies to measles even if they later contract the
disease themselves. This means that they may not have antibodies to pass on
to their own infants, who will be born vulnerable and will get measles at an
earlier age -- as evidenced by this and many other outbreaks.
The reason that these babies are getting measles at such a young age is
because their mothers received the measles vaccine. Pure and simple.
Vaccinating earlier will not help -- it will only exacerbate the situation
for future generations of children born without protection.
I hope that these babies are being given Vitamin A because that has been
shown to be a very effective treatment for children (especially children
living in third world conditions) who may have severe cases of measles.
