At least 4 European countries have been affected by a _Salmonella_ outbreak with investigators as yet unable to determine the source. A total of 13 people have fallen ill in Iceland, 8 in Denmark, 1 in Sweden and an unknown number of people were also ill in the Netherlands and Belgium. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) was informed about the outbreak by national authorities.

In September 2021 in Iceland, there was an increase in reports of _Salmonella_ infections. Further investigations found they were the same type of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium. Samples were sent to Statens Serum Institute (SSI) in Denmark for sequencing. Overall, 13 individuals were diagnosed with this type of _Salmonella_ infection, including 7 women and 6 men. The average age was 55 and the range was 21 to 72 years old, according to Iceland's Directorate of Health.

Onset of symptoms was from 4 Aug 2021 to 2 Sep 2021, but most became ill from 27 Aug 2021, leading officials to believe that the outbreak has ended. These individuals lived across the country but mainly in the southwest of Iceland. Telephone interviews were conducted with those infected, and they were asked about risk factors and food consumption in the days before illness. However, the infection has not yet been traced to a specific food. In September and October 2021, 3 other people were diagnosed with _Salmonella_ Typhimurium in Iceland but sequencing revealed it was a different type than the outbreak strain. A sequencing device has also been bought, making it possible to sequence microorganisms in the country in the future instead of sending samples abroad.

Icelandic cases are closely related to _Salmonella_ Typhimurium infections in the Netherlands, which were reported to the ECDC in September 2021. Several other countries have also recorded infections with the same strain, including Denmark and Belgium, but it is not known how many people are sick in total.

Denmark registered 8 cases with sample dates from 27 Aug 2021 to 5 Oct 2021. The cases are from several regions in the country. Five are female and 3 are male in the age range from 20 to 76 years old. The investigation did not reveal any hypothesis to the source of infection.

Sweden has one case related to the outbreak. The patient is a 4-year-old girl with onset of disease in mid-September 2021 and no international travel history.
