2000/046G - Texas pepper begomovirus
------------------------------------
Why: Texas pepper begomovirus came to our attention as causing an emerging
disease of capsicum and tomato in the Americas.
Where: First described on capsicum in Texas (US) by Stenger et al. (1990).
The virus is reported in Mexico (Coahuila, inaloa, Tamaulipas), Guatemala,
USA (Arizona, Texas) (Polston & Anderson, 1997) and also in Costa Rica,
Honduras, Tabasco state in Mexico (internet).
Distribution: Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico (Coahuila, Sinaloa,
Tabasco, Tamaulipas), USA (Arizona, Texas). Mixed infections with Chino del
tomate and pepper huasteco begomoviruses have been found.
On which plants: Capsicum (_Capsicum annuum_), tomato (_Lycopersicon
esculentum_). Tobacco (_Nicotiana tabacum_) is also reported as a natural host.
Damage: Symptoms on capsicum are leaf curling, malformation, vein clearing
and stunting. Symptoms on tomato are leaf curling, mosaic and stunting.
Polston & Anderson (1997) noted that the disease was first seen in Texas in
1987, but outbreaks lasted only for a few years. Nevertheless, the disease
was still important in Tamaulipas (Mexico). Little data is available on the
incidence of the virus in the field.
Transmission: Transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_.
Note: The virus tentatively called pepper jalapeño, occurring on capsicum
in Sinaloa and other states of Mexico is considered as a strain of Texas
pepper begomovirus (Torres-Pacheco et al., 1996).
Pathway: Infected tomato and capsicum plants, fruits?, viruliferous _B.
tabaci_ from countries where Texas pepper begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Tomato and capsicum are important crops in the EPPO region,
both indoor and outdoor. Data on disease incidence is lacking. The vector
is present in many parts of the EPPO region.
