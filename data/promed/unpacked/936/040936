MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE, INVASIVE - UK (2): SUMMARY 1995
======================================================
Source: PHLS CDSC [Public Health Laboratory Service, Communicable
Disease Surveillance Centre, London, UK]:
Communicable Disease Report, CDR Weekly 1995 5 (51):291 (22 Dec. 1995)

Clusters of invasive meningococcal infection in schools:
A total of 1662 cases of invasive meningococcal disease were notified to the
Office of Population Censuses and Surveys in the first 49 weeks of 1995.
The PHLS Meningococcal Reference Unit received isolates from 1250 cases in
the first 50 weeks of 1995.
Schoolchildren and young adults (5 to 24 years) account for a large
proportion of cases since the beginning of October. During this period, 39
cases (5 deaths) have been associated with 13 clusters in schools. Three of
these clusters have been identified as outbreaks due to Neisseria
meningitidis serogroup C. Immunisation with meningococcal vaccines may help
to control such incidents, but closing schools does not aid their
management. Current meningococcal vaccines are not, however, recommended
for routine immunisation. Those that are currently available are
ineffective in children under 2 years of age (who are at greatest risk),
provide only short term immunity in older children, and do not protect
against group B organisms, which cause 60% to 75% of invasive meningococcal
disease.
