Biosecurity: New threat to potato, tomato crops
-----------------------------------------
[Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) has infected tomato crops in New
Zealand.] The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) reported it has
completed a survey of tomato crops and confirmed that spindle tuber is
present at 3 sites in the North Island and one in the South Island. [This
is the first report of spindle tuber in New Zealand. The viroid infects
both tomato and potato].
[The disease] first came to MAF's attention in May, 2000 when a grower
reported symptoms of a suspected exotic disease. MAF's national advisor on
plant pest surveillance, Barney Stephenson, said at that time samples were
taken but the viroid was not detected. A Dutch scientist visiting New
Zealand collected samples and tests in the Netherlands confirmed the
presence of the viroid. MAF then responded by carrying out a major survey
of tomato crops near the affected area.
According to Dr Stephenson, the industry must decide what to do. He says
that the most likely way the disease got into the country was through
imported seed contaminated with the viroid, and that there was no way of
detecting it.

[Viroids have been classified into 6 genera; Apscarviroid, Avoviroid,
Cocaviroid, Coleviroid, Hopstuviroid, and Pospiviroid. PSTVd is the type
member of the Pospiviroid genus. It is unfortunate that no information is
available on the test procedure that was employed in the Netherlands. A
general description of a sensitive assay for PSTVd is available at the USDA
web-site:
