The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [on 5 Oct 2016] that animal health officials in Wisconsin have confirmed 7 additional cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in horses in that state.

"All of the horses have been euthanized or died on their own," the EDCC's notice said. "All are non-vaccinates or under-vaccinated."

The recently confirmed cases include:
an unvaccinated 8 year old quarter horse mare from Waupaca County, which was staggering and went down vocalizing with her tongue out. She was euthanized [on 21 Sep 2016];

an 11 year old quarter horse mare from Langlade County which had not been vaccinated this year [2016] became nonambulatory with a wry neck and began to suffer a seizure. She was euthanized [on 25 Sep 2016];

a 2 year old quarter horse mare from Monroe County which was either unvaccinated or under-vaccinated exhibited head-pressing, lethargy, and ataxia (incoordination). She was euthanized [on 18 Sep 2016];

a yearling thoroughbred filly from Chippewa County which had not been vaccinated this year initially presented [24 Sep 2016] as febrile (had a fever), depressed, lethargic, and weak with nystagmus (involuntary eyeball movement) and seizure-like activity. She went down [26 Sep 2016] and died [27 Sep 2016];

an 8 year old miniature horse mare from Eau Claire County, which was under-vaccinated (she might have been vaccinated 5 years ago); she presented [26 Sep 2016] with, depression, a decreased appetite, circling to left, twitching, and head-pressing, and was described as wobbly. She went down late on [28 Sep 2016] and was euthanized [29 Sep 2016];

a 13 year old unvaccinated percheron mare from Taylor County began showing signs of disease including hind-limb weakness and stumbling on [23 Sep 2016]. She went down and was euthanized on [24 Sep 2016];

a miniature horse from Forest County with an unknown vaccination history.

These new cases bring Wisconsin's total to 17 confirmed positive EEE cases in Wisconsin horses this year [2016].

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 per cent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

The clinical signs of EEE can be consistent with other important neurologic diseases such as rabies, West Nile, and equine herpesvirus-1; therefore, it is important to work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the two-shot vaccination series within a three- to six-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

A horse in Chippewa County [Wisconsin] has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a virus transmitted by mosquitoes. The state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection reported the positive test results. There have been no reported cases of EEE found in humans since 2011, the department added.

"Presence of an EEE positive horse confirms that there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the EEE virus that can transmit the virus to people and other animals," the Chippewa County Public Health Department wrote. The virus is not transmitted person to person.

Horse owners can have their horses vaccinated to prevent the disease. Common signs of an animal with the virus include signs of depression, droopy eyelids, loss of appetite and blindness.

The Health Department recommends limiting the time animals are outside at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active. The department also suggests trimming tall grass and keeping animals away from standing water.

[Vaccination is the single best prevention. Couple that with mosquito repellents for horses and your pet is much better protected. Responsible pet ownership means it is necessary to prevent disease in your animal whenever possible.
