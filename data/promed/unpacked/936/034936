[This outbreak is located in the center of Switzerland quite some
distance from the outbreak reported earlier this month (May 2011]) in
St Gallen in the Northeastern part of the country. While cases being
located near each other is not an important factor epidemiologically
with a transmissible encephalopathy there is no indication the 2 cases
are related. However, we do not expect many cases of BSE at this time,
if any, and therefore there should be good surveillance for additional
cases now in order to help determine if there is anything unusual
going on.

The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map appended to the
OIE WAHID report referenced above or via the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
