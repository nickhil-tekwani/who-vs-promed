AP Clarifies Anthrax Overseas Story
-------------------------------------------
In an 20 Oct 2001 story about global anthrax fears, The Associated
Press quoted Argentina's health minister, Hector Lombardo, as
saying a Carnival cruise [line brochure from Miami tested positive for
anthrax spores. The Health Ministry has since said the mailing
promoted a Carnival cruise but that it did not know who was
responsible for the mailing. Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines says it
did not send any promotional material directly to Argentina, but
Carnival's name did appear in a mailing by an independent distributor
promoting cruises and other products from various companies.
On Thursday [25 Oct 2001, Argentine health officials said the anthrax
spores found on the travel brochure were of a harmless strain, akin to
those used in anthrax vaccinations for livestock.

[The livestock Sterne (34F) vaccine is freely available in all countries. It
has been used before, see the events of Las Vagas some 3-4 years ago
when it was sold as a field isolate to a gullible private researcher.
Unfortunately we will see it more often now in the hands of hoaxers.
We have found that it has an unfortunate capacity to float around and
contaminate laboratories, as we have identified it in a number of
archived collections from various institutes [even though labelled as a
field isolate, and is why we never ever use it. Laboratory hygiene is
absolutely vital if you must use this vaccine in research. - Mod.MHJ
