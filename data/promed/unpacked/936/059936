Goss's wilt in corn
-------------------
A new disease is showing up in Manitoba corn fields. "Goss's Wilt is
a bacterial infection that we first identified here in Manitoba last
year [2009]," explains Wilt Billing, agronomist. "It originated from
down in Nebraska and is spreading very rapidly across the
corn-growing regions of North America. It can prove to be a very
yield-limiting disease."

Once the bacteria are present, there's nothing a producer can do
except grow resistant varieties and minimize crop residue, on which
the bacteria survive.

"We're currently conducting a survey across the province to see how
much this disease is affecting us," says Billing. "It's basically
here to stay. We'll have to start managing for Goss's Wilt from now
on." He says they're also in the midst of screening to determine
which varieties offer the most resistance.

[Goss's wilt and blight of maize is caused by the bacterium
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _nebraskensis_. It is a persistent
and economically serious disease of susceptible maize hybrids in
several states of the USA, but its occurrence in Manitoba appears to
be the 1st report outside the US.

The bacterium can also affect some grasses, which may serve as
pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms include systemic wilting and/or leaf
lesions and blighting. Infection of leaves, stems, and roots occurs
primarily through wounds (mechanical, hail, or insect damage), and
plants are susceptible at all growth stages.

The pathogen is seed transmitted and overwinters on crop debris and
maize kernels. Disease management includes cultural practices to
minimise inoculum, crop rotation, and use of resistant crop varieties.

Other subspecies affecting different hosts are found elsewhere,
including _sepedonicus_ (potato ring rot) and _michiganensis_
(bacterial canker of tomatoes), which cause severe yield losses on
their respective hosts.
