[The 2 outbreaks are situated in north-western Switzerland, in the zone close to the triple border junction Switzerland/Germany/France. The 2 positive animals have been infected, according to the "epidemiology" section in the report, by "vectors". This may have taken place due to the, probably windborne, introduction of infected culicoides from neighbouring France, where BTV-8 has been circulating during the summer and autumn months of 2017 (and in previous years). This circulation may still be ongoing there.

A map of France, issued by the Ministery of Agriculture, presenting the BTV-8 situation in France as updated [Thu 2 Nov 2017], is available at http://agriculture.gouv.fr/liste-des-departements-et-des-communes-classes-en-zone-reglementee-fco.
The main cluster of the new BTV-8 outbreaks reported in France since [Wed 24 May 2017] (yellow circles) is situated in eastern France, many of them adjacent to the border with Switzerland.

The report includes, among the coltrol measures applied, "stamping out". This may refer to the culling of 2 PCR-positive animals out of the 148 susceptible on the 2 affected farms.

The definition of "stamping out", according to the glossary in OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, is:

"stamping-out policy means a policy designed to eliminate an outbreak by carrying out under the authority of the Veterinary Authority the following:

"a .the killing of the animals which are affected and those suspected of being affected in the herd or flock and, where appropriate, those in other herds or flocks which have been exposed to infection by direct animal to animal contact, or by indirect contact with the causal pathogenic agent; animals should be killed in accordance with Chapter 7.6.;

"b .the disposal of carcasses and, where relevant, animal products by rendering, burning or burial, or by any other method described in Chapter 4.12.;

"c. the cleansing and disinfection of establishments through procedures defined in Chapter 4.13".
(see athttp://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=glossaire.htm).

Testing all cattle in the affected herds has provided the authorities with the reasoning to refrain from culling other animals in the same holdings. Bluetongue virus spreads, under natural conditions, exclusively by vectors (culicoides), not by direct contact. It will be interesting to note if the animals in the 2 holdings had been vaccinated. The solitary infection of just 2 animals out of 148, remains to be clarified. - Mod.AS
