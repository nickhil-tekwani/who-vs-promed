Afghanistan: Foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the north
-------------------------------------------
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has confirmed that
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is killing 1 in 3 newborn lambs in
northern Afghanistan. "On a national scale, an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease would debilitate cattle which plough wheat
fields in the "breadbaskets" of western and northern Afghanistan and
till soil in irrigated valleys, seriously threatening food security,"
an FAO spokesman, Etienne Careme, told IRIN from the Afghan capital,
Kabul, on Monday.
FMD spreads through contact between animals in places such as
markets. The sick animals have sores on their feet and in their
mouths, so they cannot drag a plow. This condition keeps them out of
action and can cause a food crisis in the families who own them.
A joint team from the FAO and the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture and
Animal Husbandry (MAAH) is currently carrying out investigations in
the affected province of Baghlan, where the infection first broke out
and then spread to Konduz, Takhar, Samangan, and Balkh. "We don't
have figures concerning the disease yet, but in the next few weeks,
we along with MAAH will be given an update on statistics," Careme
said.
There are also cases of Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR, also known
as goat plague, a rinderpest-like disease of goats and sheep
resulting in erosive stomatitis, enteritis, pneumonia, and death) in
small ruminants, especially sheep, with a mortality rate of up to 85
percent. There are cases of enterotoxaemia and pasteurellosis.
Most Afghan farming households depend on cattle -- usually a single
ox -- to plow their wheat fields at planting time. A small flock of
sheep or goats, perhaps 6 or 7, represents a household's savings, and
the offspring and animals' products are sold to raise cash in an
emergency.
Stopping the spread of the disease is crucial in order to save the
livelihoods of millions of people. With flocks of up to 300 sheep,
nomadic tribes, which depend on the animals for their skins, meat,
and wool, would be the hardest hit.
"We have vaccines, but not enough, and it is a critical situation,"
Careme said. The FAO has appealed for 6 million USD to deal with the
crisis, of which 2 million is needed for an immediate project to
bolster government monitoring of trans-boundary animal diseases at
livestock markets, along borders, and to respond to outbreaks.
Strict measures are already in place in Europe to stop the spread of
FMD, and herds of cattle with the disease have been slaughtered. In
the UK, one of the hardest-hit countries, about 7 million animals
were killed in 2001, destroying thousands of farmers' livelihoods and
costing the nation about 14 billion USD.

[This outbreak remains "suspected" until it has been confirmed at a
laboratory. Information on the FMD virus type(s) involved is of
immediate importance. Typing should facilitate the vaccine decision.
Afghanistan is a member of the OIE, but since 1996 no reports on the
epizootic situation, including the incidence of list-A animal
diseases, have been available. During 2001, 4 samples were received
at the World Reference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright; FMD virus
type Asia 1 was identified. - Mod.AS]
