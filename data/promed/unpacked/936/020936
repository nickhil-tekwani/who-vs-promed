Oyster disease - _Haplosporidium nelsoni_, Prince Edward Island
-----------------------------------
An oyster disease never reported before in Canada has spread from one part
of Cape Breton to another part of the island, and into 2 sites in the
province of Prince Edward Island, federal fisheries scientists confirmed
last week.
American (eastern) oysters _Crassostrea virginica_ are infected with the
microscopic parasite _Haplosporidium nelsoni_, [which causes] MSX disease.
The [parasite] is not harmful to humans, but federal Fisheries Minister
Robert Thibault has said the whole multimillion dollar oyster industry in
the Maritime provinces could be at risk should MSX disease spread into the
Gulf of St. Lawrence or Prince Edward Island. The original diagnosis of MSX
disease was made by the Shellfish Health Unit, Gulf Fisheries Centre of
Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Moncton. The diagnosis was confirmed on 18
Oct 2002 by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in the USA.
Shipments of live oysters have been halted and a surveillance program is
underway to determine the geographical extent of infected oyster stocks.
Efforts to contain the disease and prevent spread to other oysters within
Nova Scotia and the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence are ongoing.
Scientists hope the parasite will be discouraged by colder water
temperatures as winter sets in. Oyster aquaculture is a $1 million
(Canadian) industry in the Bras d'Or Lakes. Oyster growers have suffered
financial losses since a halt was called to oyster movements. One local
harvester told The Halifax Herald he lost 85 percent of his harvestable crop
this season. Oysters take about 5 years to mature. The source of the MSX
infection is unknown.
Cases of abnormal mortality [in] oysters destined for live transfer between
Atlantic provinces are routinely examined by shellfish health pathologists
at the Gulf Fisheries Centre. No evidence of this parasite has been detected
in any of these investigations over the last 15 years. The MSX disease has
the potential to wipe out 85 to 90 percent of oysters in an area, as it did
in the 1950s in the Chesapeake Bay [USA], when it was brought in from Asia.
