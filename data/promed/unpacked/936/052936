Veterinarians across Central Florida are warning dog owners to get their pets vaccinated because of a spike in influenza.

The dog flu spreads quickly and veterinarians told Channel 9's Jeff Deal that if owners go to someplace like a dog kennel or dog park, they recommend the vaccine.

[AJ] takes her 8-month-old dog, to the dog park every day. "She's got a whole crew she likes to hang with," AJ said. She said the dogs share everything, but she hopes the flu isn't one of them. "I'd never heard of the doggie flu. I'm a medical student. I'm pretty familiar with the human flu, but not the dog flu," she said.

Underhill Animal Hospital recommends most dog owners vaccinate against it. "If they board here, we require the influenza vaccine," said Dr Jill Rymut-Andrade, with Underhill Animal Hospital.

Rymut-Andrade said the canine flu first became a problem in northern states, but it's starting to show up in Florida.

Dogs can be sick up to 4 days before signs like fever, sniffing and coughing.

Rymut-Andrade said even cats are getting the virus.

The vet said if the flu is left untreated, fewer than 10 percent of dogs will die from it. The flu makes them very miserable, just like when people get the flu.

[The state of Florida can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5067007,4729 . A county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/florida-county-map.gif. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

This can be a serious disease that spreads easily between dogs. Owners should be extremely cautious of taking dogs to dog parks and other canine social events, when boarding, or even going to the groomers. Also as the outbreak seems to be just beginning, there is no information on which of the 2 types of canine influenza (CI) this is.

"CI, or dog flu, is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the US, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the United States, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain. In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia -- specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the US." (https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx)
