A community outbreak of legionnairesÂ’ disease
---------------------------------------------
On 5 Oct 2000, an increase in the number of cases with atypical pneumonia
was notified to the regional health authorities of Galicia by a hospital in
Vigo. On 9 Oct 2000, 5 cases of legionnaires' disease were diagnosed on the
basis of _Legionella pneumophila_ urinary antigen tests. An epidemiological
investigation undertaken to study the possible outbreak resulted in the
identification of 28 cases (21 men and 7 women; age range 30 to 79 years),
3 of whom died. The first case became ill on 18 Sep 2000 and no cases with
dates of onset since 1 Oct 2000 have been notified.
Preliminary enquiries on 10 Oct 2000 revealed a relationship with visiting
and living in a certain area of the city. A hospital-based matched case
control study was carried out on 11 Oct 20000 with 17 cases and 37 controls
to test this initial hypothesis. A case was defined as a person who
developed pneumonia and had a positive urinary antigen test.
The study confirmed that living, working, or walking in the area near the
hospital was associated with illness (odds ratio 4.29; 95% confidence
interval 1.6-18.0). Exposure to this same area and the absence of any other
potential source focused the investigation on the possibility of
contamination from cooling towers. One clinical isolate and water samples
of cooling towers from the area were sent to the National Reference
Laboratory. All the cooling towers in the suspected area have been
disinfected. Up until now no source has been implicated. Intensified
surveillance is continuing.
