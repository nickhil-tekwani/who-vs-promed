At least 16 animals died at the ranch El Guayabo due to intoxication
after eating sorghum shoots that allegedly contained cyanide, said
Celestino Gutierrez Cervantes, president of the Local Livestock
Association.

Gutierrez said that before the rainy season, he had warned colleagues
in the sector of the risk that the sprouts and the threshed sorghum
might pose to animals, but apparently there were lapses among those
who care for livestock. "The fresh shoots of germinated sorghum
contain a substance that includes cyanide, which the plant produces
naturally, and care must be taken because cases of intoxication are
almost certain," he said.

In addition to the 16 dead cattle reported in El Guayabo, cases were
also detected in El Progreso, but no animals died, he said.

The same situation occurs with sudangrass regrowth, so a new warning
was issued to the producers to take precautions in the coming days
with the sprouting brought by the rains.

Cervantes Gutierrez clarified that this problem has nothing to do with
the risk of poisoning in cattle from the consumption of corn forage to
which chemical desiccants were applied before threshing, a practice
widely used by farmers because of the delay in the agricultural
cycle.

[Plants in the genus _Sorghum_ may accumulate prussic acid. Prussic
acid, hydrocyanic acid, and hydrogen cyanide are all terms relating to
cyanide poisoning. The _Sorghum_ spp of plants and other common plants
may accumulate large quantities of cyanogenic glycosides, (a sugar
compound with cyanide attached), which are located in the outer tissue
or epidermal layer of the plant.

An enzyme resides in the inner or mesophyll leaf tissues. When an
event stresses the plant, such as frost, drought, drought followed by
rain and a sudden burst of growth, or trauma to the plant, the
mesophyll portion of the plant or leaf releases the enzyme, which
breaks down the cyanogenic glycosides releasing the cyanide compound
and the sugar. The sugar makes the plant tasty and cyanide makes the
plant deadly.

Sadly, this is not an uncommon event. Forages that are high in prussic
acid may be used for hay if they are given adequate drying or curing
time. The amount of time needed depends upon the level of the prussic
acid in the environment as well as the ambient temperatures and
humidity.

If the field is cured and baled, the regrowth of the plants may also
be toxic for the reasons mentioned previously.

Times of drought, just after a frost, rapid growth after a rain, or
regrowth of the plant following cutting are all times to be cautious
with these plants. - Mod.TG]
