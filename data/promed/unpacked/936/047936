Abstract
-----------
Coronaviruses have caused 3 major epidemics since 2003, including the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In each case, the emergence of coronavirus in our species has been associated with zoonotic transmissions from animal reservoirs (1,2), underscoring how prone such pathogens are to spill over and adapt to new species. Among the 4 recognized genera of the family Coronaviridae, human infections reported so far have been limited to alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses (3,4,5). Here we identify porcine deltacoronavirus strains in plasma samples of 3 Haitian children with acute undifferentiated febrile illness. Genomic and evolutionary analyses reveal that human infections were the result of at least 2 independent zoonoses of distinct viral lineages that acquired the same mutational signature in the genes encoding Nsp15 and the spike glycoprotein. In particular, structural analysis predicts that one of the changes in the spike S1 subunit, which contains the receptor-binding domain, may affect the flexibility of the protein and its binding to the host cell receptor. Our findings highlight the potential for evolutionary change and adaptation leading to human infections by coronaviruses outside of the previously recognized human-associated coronavirus groups, particularly in settings where there may be close human-animal contact.

[The role of animals in transmission of coronaviruses to humans is a topic of considerable interest currently. Porcine deltacoronavirus causes a serious disease in swine characterized by malabsorptive diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, and high mortality. It occurs around the world in large-scale and small swine production situations. It is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, so people, especially children living in close contact with affected pigs, could be exposed. The fact that 2 virus lineages of the viruses detected in plasma were identified in the tested samples indicate that the 3 children were indeed infected. The above evaluation indicates that the virus spike glycoprotein may permit binding with human cell receptors. If swine-to-human swine deltacoronavirus transmission is a common occurrence, it seems puzzling that it has not been described before. Perhaps no one has been looking. - Mod.TY

With porcine deltacoronavirus having been introduced to the North American swine herd in 2014 and subsequently spreading across significant portions of it, the likelihood that it causes widespread, severe disease in humans seems unlikely as it would have been a new pathogen not only to pigs, but to the humans working on those farms (age demographics may play a role since children are likely to have less direct contact with swine on large, US operations). However, as Mod.TY notes, it may be a case of not looking for it and/or not recognizing it as the cause of diarrheal and/or febrile disease in humans. Serologic studies of swine farm workers would help illuminate how infectious the virus truly is especially on farms with acute and/or chronic deltacoronavirus circulation occurring. One also wonders if the circulation of porcine respiratory coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and/or porcine endemic diarrhea virus (all of which predated the introduction of delta coronavirus) offered some level of immunity to swine farm workers, much like some of the seasonal human coronaviruses have provided against SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.JH
