Japanese encephalitis spreads in northern Viet Nam
--------------------------------------------------
The number of children in Viet Nam's northern region hospitalized for
Japanese encephalitis has increased by 20 to 30 per cent compared with last
year's [2004] same period, reported Hanoi's Central Hospital of Pediatrics
on 19 Jun 2005. The number of infected cases has risen to 200 patients
since the start of May 2005, said the hospital. More than 10 children are
hospitalized a day on average, it added.

About 80 per cent of the total admitted cases are for type-B Japanese
encephalitis, said the hospital. Children under 5 are usually most
vulnerable to the brain inflammation virus, but the hospital said it still
received a number of older children.

Typical symptoms of the disease include sudden fevers, headaches, vomiting
and unconsciousness. The provinces with the highest infection rate have all
been supplied with vaccines, according to the Preventive Health Bureau
under the Ministry of Health.
