North Korea has denied rumors that avian influenza or hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD) is spreading in the country, a radio report said on Tuesday
[10 Jun 2008]. The North's health authorities notified the World Health
Organization (WHO) that there has been no single case of bird flu or HFMD
reported to the authorities this year [2008], the Washington-based Radio
Free Asia said.

The denial came in response to a report published a week ago by South
Korean aid group Good Friends, claiming that a mysterious epidemic
suspected to be bird flu or HFMD has been spreading in North Korean towns
bordering China. The disease has already taken the lives in recent months
of many North Korean infants already suffering from malnutrition caused by
food shortages, the group claimed, citing unnamed North Korean doctors in
the border area.

WHO has rendered technical and monetary support to North Korea to help
prevent possible bird flu outbreaks since the communist state was hit by
the deadly disease in 2005. No new case has been reported since then. Jai
Narain, the director for communicable diseases at WHO's South East Asia
office in New Delhi, was quoted as saying that the international body is
working closely with the North Korean health authorities to prevent any
potential bird flu outbreak and that Pyongyang has submitted related
reports to the organization on a regular basis.

The France-based OIE (Office International des Epizooties, World
Organisation for Animal Health) also said that the North's latest report to
the office included no information or reports of any bird flu outbreaks,
the radio reported. North Korea has inoculated poultry against bird flu to
prevent the spread of the virus from neighboring South Korea, according to
the North's state-run news media.

South Korea has slaughtered over 8 million birds since early April 2008,
when bird flu broke out there for the 1st time in more than a year. But no
South Korean has died of bird flu. HFMD, meanwhile, has struck over 10 000
people resulting in 26 fatalities, all of them children, in recent months
[in China - Mod.CP], according to Chinese media reports.

[Previously, on 4 Jun 2008, ProMED-mail carried Yonhap and Radio Australia
reports that a mysterious disease, diagnosed variously as avian influenza
or HFMD, was spreading through certain towns in the border region between
North Korea and China (see: Undiagnosed fatal disease: North Korea
20080604.1791). The source of the information was the South Korean
humanitarian agency, Good Friends, which reported that the outbreak had
mainly affected state-run daycare centres and kindergartens, with patients
showing flu-like symptoms before succumbing. Despite the current North
Korean denial, detailed reports of a disease outbreak in the region persist
(see: North Korea Today, No. 137, Fri 6 Jun 2008 at
<http://goodfriendsusa.blogspot.com/2008/06/north-korea-today-no-137.html>).

Further information from independent sources in the region would be
appreciated. - Mod.CP]
