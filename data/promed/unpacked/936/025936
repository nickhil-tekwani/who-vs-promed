A Weld County family restaurant chain temporarily closed its Fort Lupton and Dacono locations [Thu 22 Feb 2017] after being linked to a salmonellosis outbreak with 21 confirmed cases, according to the Weld County Department of Health and Environment. Burrito Delight restaurants were determined to be the source of the outbreak, which expanded from 8 to 21 confirmed cases this week, including 12 people who reportedly ate food from Burrito Delight at Aims Community College in Greeley at 2 catered events.

As of [Mon 26 Feb 2018], cases of salmonellosis linked to Burrito Delight had been reported in 5 counties. Weld County had 14 cases; Larimer County had 3; Boulder County had 2 cases and there were 1 case each reported in Morgan and Adams County, the health department said. A total of 4 people have been hospitalized.

As many as 9 people who ate food at an Aims event on [Tue 13 Feb 2018] and 3 people who dined at a [Tue 6 Feb 2018] event were confirmed to have salmonellosis. "We've reached out to more than 470 people who attended those events at Aims to ask them to fill out a survey," said Kelly Martinez, the county's health communications supervisor.

In addition, 5 cases of salmonella [infection] were reported in customers who dined in at the restaurant, and 4 cases reported for people who took carryout food to go. A total of 20 of the confirmed cases, as of [Tue 27 Feb 2018], were traced to the Fort Lupton location at 1230 Denver Ave; 1 case was linked to the Dacono location at 819 Carbondale Dr.

The state's department of health and environment contacted the Weld County Department after 4 or 5 salmonella reports from customers at Burrito Delight earlier in February 2018. The health department inspected the Fort Lupton location on [Thu 22 Feb 2018] and rated the restaurant "fair". The restaurant had received a "marginal" rating in September 2017 and had been re-inspected in October 2017.

Inspectors, on [Thu 22 Feb 2018], reported finding evidence of employees drinking during shifts with open cups, eggs stored in a manner that might cause cross contamination, refrigerated food temperature higher than 41 deg F [about 5 deg C] and evidence of rodents or insects, according to the inspection report. The company, Burrito Delight, LLC, has been registered as owned by Jose Lezama with the Colorado secretary of state's office since 2007. Patch.com was unable to contact anyone at the restaurant for comment.

The restaurant's owners were "very cooperative and are working with us to identify the sources of the outbreak," Martinez said. In order to reopen, the restaurant must perform a series of steps, Martinez said. No employee who has a confirmed case of salmonella may work at the restaurant, including those in a 5 week quarantine to see if symptoms arise. Both locations must go through a thorough disinfection process and the whole restaurant must be sanitized under the supervision of a food safety consultant, Martinez said. Any food left in storage must be thrown out, she said.

At this point, there is no danger to the public because both restaurants are closed, the Weld County health department said.
