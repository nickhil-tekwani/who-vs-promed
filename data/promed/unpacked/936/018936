More than 5 million children have lost a parent or caregiver during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a modeling study published yesterday [24 Feb 2022] in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (https://bit.ly/3vnrKVt). The study by an international team used updated excess mortality and fertility data to model increases in minimum estimates of COVID-19 orphanhood and caregiver deaths in 20 countries from 1 Mar 2020 to 31 Oct 2021. Orphanhood was defined as the death of one or both parents, and caregiver death included parental death or death of a custodial or co-residing grandparent. The team's original study had estimated that, from 1 Mar 2020 to 30 Apr 2021, 2 737 300 children had experienced a COVID death of a parent or caregiver.

The updated estimate found that, from 30 Apr 2021 to 31 Oct 2021, the number of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood or caregiver death increased 90%, from 2 737 300 children to 5 200 300 children. Over the entire 20-month period, 491 300 children aged 0-4 years, 736 800 children aged 5-9 years, and 2 146 700 children aged 10-17 years were estimated to have experienced COVID-19-associated orphanhood. Globally, 76.5% of those children lost a father, and 23.5% lost a mother.

The total number of orphaned children ranged widely across the 20 countries, from 2400 children in Germany to 1 917 000 children in India. Per capita, the highest rates of orphanhood were in Peru (8.28 per 1000 children) and South Africa (7.22).

The study authors say the data suggest the surge of parent and caregiver deaths "must be urgently addressed with sustainable and scalable solutions, and integrated into coordinated and collaborative global, regional, and national strategies."

"Such support should focus on 3 core components: preventing caregiver death through equitable COVID-19 vaccine coverage, containment, and treatment; preparing families that are safe and nurturing to support affected children (such as through kinship care, foster care, and adoption); and protecting children using evidence-based strategies to reduce risks of poverty, childhood adversity, and violence," coauthor Susan Hillis, PhD, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a Lancet press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/944436).

"These strategies will help save lives now and put the programmatic and financial infrastructure in place on a global scale to secure a better future for children and families around the world."

Interpretation
--------------
"Our findings show that numbers of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death almost doubled in 6 months compared with the amount after the first 14 months of the pandemic. Over the entire 20-month period, 5.0 million COVID-19 deaths meant that 5.2 million children lost a parent or caregiver. Our data on children's ages and circumstances should support pandemic response planning for children globally." - Mod.LK]

US skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) faced sharp employment losses during the pandemic -- particularly in counties with a large infection burden -- and did not rebound like other healthcare sectors, finds a study today [25 Feb 2022] in JAMA Health Forum (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2789521).

In the study, a team led by RAND Corp. researchers examined the effect of COVID-19 on the US healthcare workforce in 2020 and the 1st half of 2021, a time of elevated health risks, burnout, and childcare disruptions. "While federal programs have provided financial assistance to hospitals and institutions, the net effect of these forces on healthcare employment levels and wages has not been examined," the researchers wrote.

The team analyzed industry- and county-level data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages to measure changes in employment and average wages among employees of physician and dentist offices, home healthcare, hospitals, SNFs, and combined other facilities.

Healthcare employment fell from 22.2 million in 2019 to 21.1 million in the 2nd quarter of 2020, a 5.2% drop (compared with a 9.0% decline in all industries) but rebounded to 21.8 million in the same period in 2021. Average healthcare wages rose at a lower rate than other industries (5.0% vs 6.7% in 2020 and 1.5% vs 6.9% in 2021).

The largest declines in employment in 2020 were in dentists' offices (10.0%) and SNFs (8.4%), while the smallest declines occurred in hospitals (2.5%) and physicians' offices (4.6%). Other healthcare sectors rebounded to prepandemic employment levels in 2021, but SNFs saw even more declines (13.6% relative to 2019) despite having the largest wage increases (9.5% in 2020 and 6.3% in 2021).

The adjusted 2020 SNF employment level relative to 2019 was 105.2% among counties with the lowest quintile of COVID-19 infections and 90.4% among those in the top 20%. Counties with the lowest physician-to-population ratios tended to have higher adjusted employment levels in physicians' offices (107.8% vs 97.9%) and dentists' offices (110.1% vs 98.4%).

"Future research is needed to understand if organizations are demanding fewer workers or fewer workers are willing to work at healthcare positions," the authors wrote. "Overall, our results imply that intensified early efforts are needed to protect the healthcare workforce in future pandemics."

[2] Mask guidance
[A] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Date: Fri 25 Feb 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/cdc-eases-covid-19-mask-guidance-adds-metrics-future-use


As expected and amid a steadily declining omicron surge, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today [25 Feb 2022] updated its indoor masking guidance, which would ease indoor use for most parts of the country, according to new baseline measures.

The CDC urges states and cities to still look at COVID-19 caseloads when considering masking. But it adds 2 new metrics for assessing whether to trigger the measure: hospitalization levels and hospital capacity.

Most states have already dropped their mask mandates, reflecting a transition to voluntary use in people who want to lower their risk of spreading or contracting the virus. Hawaii as the only state with mandates still in place.

The move comes at the tail of a downslope of the nation's worst COVID-19 surge, fueled by the much more transmissible omicron variant. At a briefing today [25 Feb 2022], CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said the updated guidance comes at a time when the risk is getting lower because of widespread immunity and added that the CDC has been considering shifting to the metric system for some time.

When asked about potential political pressure from governors who have already phased out their mask mandates, Walensky said the guidance intersects with policies that are winding down.

Greta Massetti, PhD, MPH, with the CDC's COVID-19 incident management team, said the guidance comes with a regularly updated map of the country that reflects the metric status, with a 3-tiered recommendation, ranging from low (vaccination and testing when sick), to medium (additional precautions for high-risk people), to high (everyone should wear a high-quality mask indoors). More than half of counties are currently in the low and medium ranges, down from one-third a week ago.

CDC officials said their recommendation for schools are the same as for communities, signaling the end of a universal masking recommendation that the CDC has had in place since July 2021. They also emphasize that anyone who wants to reduce their risk of contracting the virus should feel free to use a mask.

Walensky said no one knows what the future holds for the pandemic. "We want to give people a break when levels are low with the ability to reach for them [masks] again." Today's new guidance doesn't apply to public transportation, for which a masking recommendation remains in place until at least 18 Mar 2022.

In other US developments, a new study from the CDC and its partners looked at household transmission of the omicron variant, finding the highest attack rates in instances where index patients weren't vaccinated and who didn't isolate or mask to limit the spread in their homes.

The study enrolled 183 households in 4 locations: Chicago, Milwaukee, Connecticut, and Utah. The study is based on telephone interviews with people with sequence-confirmed omicron infections and was published today [25 Feb 2022] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7109e1.htm).

US COVID-19 markers continue to decline, with 65 491 cases reported yesterday [24 Feb 2022] compared with 84 793 the previous day, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. Deaths, a lagging indicator, are declining slower and are still near the peak levels of the delta wave last fall [2021].

Parts of Asia continue to battle late omicron surges, with Hong Kong's cases topping 10 000 for the 1st time, reflecting another steep rise, according to the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202202/25/P2022022500683.htm).

South Korea's daily cases dipped below 170 000, but health officials don't expect daily cases to peak until the middle of March [2022]. The number of critically ill people spiked from 581 to 655 today [25 Feb 2022], and deaths have doubled over the past week, according to The Korea Herald, which cited data from Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220225000202).

Elsewhere, New Zealand -- another part of the world experiencing a late surge -- reported a sharp rise in cases today [25 Feb 2022], with the new daily record topping 12 000. The daily total doubled from the day before (https://www.1news.co.nz/2022/02/25/sharp-increase-sees-12011-new-covid-19-community-cases-in-nz/).

https://www.statnews.com/2022/02/25/cdc-issues-long-awaited-new-guidance-on-when-to-wear-masks/


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued long-awaited new guidance Friday [25 Feb 2022] on when Americans should consider wearing masks to protect themselves against COVID-19. Under the new guidance, roughly 70% of the US population can now contemplate removing their masks.

The guidance lays out a system that designates individual counties as being at either low, medium, or high risk from COVID-19. Roughly 62.6% of counties -- home to 71.7% of Americans -- fall into the low- and medium-risk categories.

The new system moves beyond sheer numbers of new cases to look at how well the healthcare system in each county is holding up. The idea, the CDC said, is to focus on minimizing severe disease and ensuring that hospitals are able to cope with COVID cases while still delivering standard care.

The designations will be based on key metrics at a county level, using data counties provide to the CDC on an ongoing basis. Those include the rate of COVID cases that require hospitalization and the percentage of beds in hospitals that are occupied by people who have COVID. If immunity from vaccination or prior infection holds and fewer people who contract COVID develop severe disease, more counties would move into the low-risk designation. But if a new variant emerges that causes more severe illness, rising hospitalizations would trigger a return to a recommendation to wear masks.

"None of us knows what the future may hold for us and for this virus. And we need to be prepared, and we need to be ready for whatever comes next," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a press briefing Friday [25 Feb 2022]. "We want to give people a break from things like mask wearing when our levels are low, and then have the ability to reach for them again should things get worse in the future."

Most people living in counties where the risk is designated as low or medium are not being urged to wear masks, though people who are at high risk from COVID-19 and who live in counties listed as being at medium risk should talk with their healthcare providers about whether they should wear a mask.

People who live in counties where the risk is designated as high -- currently 28.2% of Americans -- should wear masks in indoor public settings, including schools, the guidance states. The guidance comes as jurisdictions across the country have lifted mask mandates or have announced plans to lift them.

Though the guidance will give people in much of the country a green light to take off their masks in public settings, the CDC noted that they may choose to continue to wear masks. "If you are more comfortable wearing a mask, feel free to do so," Walensky said.

The agency also noted that people who have tested positive for COVID, who have COVID-like symptoms, or who have been exposed to someone with COVID should wear a mask, regardless of the risk level in their county.

The new guidance also updates CDC recommendations on mask wearing in schools. Up until now, the agency has recommended that masks be worn in schools; with the new guidelines, the CDC is only recommending mask wearing in schools in counties that are designated high risk.

Under the new system, COVID-prevention recommendations for people living in low- and medium-risk counties are effectively that they should be vaccinated and boosted, and should get tested for COVID if they are sick with COVID-like symptoms. In the medium-risk settings, people who are immunocompromised or who have chronic health conditions should discuss the merits of mask wearing with their doctors.

AMA statement on CDC COVID-19 updates
-------------------------------------

Statement attributable to:
Gerald E. Harmon, MD
President, American Medical Association

Today's [25 Feb 2022] updated recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reflect a new approach for monitoring COVID-19 in communities. Vaccines work; they are effective in preventing severe COVID, hospitalization and death. And we urge all Americans to stay up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccines, including getting a booster dose, when eligible.

But even as some jurisdictions lift masking requirements, we must grapple with the fact that millions of people in the United States are immunocompromised, more susceptible to severe COVID outcomes, or still too young to be eligible for the vaccine. In light of those facts, I personally will continue to wear a mask in most indoor public settings, and I urge all Americans to consider doing the same, especially in places like pharmacies, grocery stores, on public transportation -- locations all of us, regardless of vaccination status or risk factors, must visit regularly. Although masks may no longer be required indoors in many parts of the United States, we know that wearing a well-fitted mask is an effective way to protect ourselves and our communities, including the most vulnerable, from COVID-19 -- particularly in indoor settings when physical distancing is not possible.

Wearing a mask, physical distancing, and staying home if you're sick are small, but important protective measures that can help us all stay safe. While the omicron surge has declined, COVID-19 is not gone. We must remain adaptable and vigilant in confronting this unpredictable virus.

[3] Hong Kong: COVID surge
Date: Thu 24 Feb 2022

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/24/hong-kong-china-help-covid-surge


Hong Kong has invoked emergency powers so that doctors and nurses from mainland China can join its efforts to fight what it said was a "dire epidemic situation" as the omicron variant of the coronavirus sweeps across the densely populated territory. Authorities on Thursday morning [24 Feb 2022] reported 8674 new cases, nearly all of them locally acquired.

"Hong Kong is now facing a very dire epidemic situation, which continues to deteriorate rapidly," the government said in explaining its need for the emergency powers. The outbreak is expected to "continue to escalate exponentially and go beyond the epidemic control capacity" of the territory's administration, meaning "Hong Kong's healthcare system, manpower, anti-epidemic facilities and resources, etc will soon be insufficient to handle the huge number of newly confirmed cases detected every day."

The Chinese territory is one of the world's most densely populated places with many families living in tiny high-rise apartments that make it impossible for people to isolate themselves. It has been hit hard by the omicron wave, which slipped through the defences of its stringent quarantines and contact tracing that had kept the virus at bay since the pandemic began 2 years ago.

There have been nearly 50 000 cases confirmed over the past 14 days, and China's President Xi Jinping has told Hong Kong to take "all necessary measures" to suppress the outbreak. Hong Kong is building temporary medical facilities to help deal with the surge in COVID-19 cases amid resentment at its commitment to a China-style zero COVID policy.

The powers "will provide a legal framework for the [government] to render the necessary emergent support to Hong Kong in a more effective and expeditious manner," the Hong Kong government statement said.

The territory has made its already tough restrictions even tougher as it tries to stamp out its worst outbreak of COVID-19 since the virus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan 2 years ago. It is also due to begin compulsory testing of its 7.4 million people next month [March 2022], part of the so-called "dynamic zero COVID" strategy that mimics mainland China's response to the virus.

A group of mainland Chinese experts are currently in Hong Kong to advise on the pandemic response, and are helping in the construction of emergency medical facilities to cope with the expected influx of patients.

Despite increasing resentment among Hong Kong residents at the government's draconian approach, a "vaccine passport" also came into force on Thursday [24 Feb 2022], with everyone aged 12 and older required to have at least one COVID-19 vaccination. People will need the pass to access a wide range of places, including supermarkets.

A global total of 9508 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 23 Feb 2022 to late 24 Feb 2022). The 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 73 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 37of the 73 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 from the South East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 14.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 11.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 32.4% decrease in daily reported cases and an 11.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report registered over 1.63 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 433.60 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.95 million reported deaths. There has been a downward trend in the number of cases and deaths globally; however, transmission levels are still quite high. - Mod.UBA]
