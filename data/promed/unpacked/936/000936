There's been a second outbreak of avian influenza, on another poultry farm
near Tamworth in northern New South Wales.
A further 30,000 layer hens will be destroyed and buried in the next few
days, taking the total to 150,000 birds destroyed on two separate farms in
the Tamworth district after Australia's fifth-ever outbreak of the disease
was discovered earlier this week.
More than one million eggs from the chickens involved in the latest
outbreak have also been destroyed at two hatcheries in Sydney.
Despite the latest discovery, New South Wales Agriculture's Chief Vet, Dick
Jane, says they still have disease under control. He says "the thing is
that we have surveillance in place to make sure that it hasn't spread.
We've found that it had [spread to one property, [and that means our
surveillance is working. So if there are further cases, we should find
them very quickly."

[Of course, one hopes this outbreak will simply be stamped out and
surveillance will be a key element in such an effort. It is also extremely
valuable in limiting the number of premises involved as newly infected
premises don't pass the disease on when there is adequate surveillance.
Unfortunately, surveillance only helps after the disease has spread and
there is no indication in this report how the avian influenza spread to the
second farm (the first farm outbreak investigation indicated spread from
waterfowl). - Mod.PC
