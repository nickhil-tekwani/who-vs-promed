A two-year-old boy who died three days after developing a fever is believed
to have had a virus which killed more than 50 people in Taiwan last year.
**************
Mak Kwok-hang, a Department of Health consultant in community medicine,
said the boy's cause of death and the source of the disease was not
confirmed, although tests indicated he had EV71.
**************
The toddler is the first person in Hong Kong suspected to have died of
enterovirus 71 (EV71).
His three-year-old sister and four other toddlers have also been infected
with hand-foot-&-mouth disease -- a typical manifestation of EV71. Test
results on them will be available next week.
Health chiefs warned parents to take hygiene precautions and seek medical
advice if their children developed fever or rashes associated with
hand-foot-&-mouth disease.
The peak season for the disease -- spread generally through poor toilet
hygiene, but also through water droplets or direct contact with saliva --
is approaching. The toddler had suffered fever, coughing and vomiting on
May 11. His family took him to a doctor who sent him home with medicine.
The toddler's health did not improve and he was taken to a hospital
casualty department on May 13, where he was treated and discharged. But the
next day his condition deteriorated and he had a rapid pulse, difficult
breathing and his face turned blue. He was admitted to the intensive care
unit of the same, unnamed hospital and died that evening.
"We are still waiting for a full postmortem report. EV71 is not uncommon in
children, especially those five or below. But usually the patients
recover," said Dr Mak.
"We don't know the cause of death in this case. Fatal cases are usually
caused by neurological complications and in this case the boy could have
suffered complications."
The Health Department has checked the boy's family and found his sister,
who went to the same nursery in New Territories West, was also infected.
Four classmates -- two boys and two girls aged two and three -- showed
symptoms of hand-foot-&-mouth disease. All have recovered.
Dr Mak said it was not certain if the virus was the same type that swept
Taiwan last year, killing at least 55 people, many of them children.
There have been four confirmed cases of EV71 this year. The boy and his
sister were listed as suspected cases until full test results were
available.
Last year there were 60 confirmed cases, five of whom had neurological
complications. All recovered.
Hand-foot-&-mouth disease is increasingly being regarded as a common,
usually mild, childhood condition like mumps and chicken pox. It can be
caused by viruses which result in rashes, generally appearing four to six
days after exposure. Generally it clears within a week, but when caused by
EV71 complications can occur, including viral meningitis and encephalitis.
The Health Department said good personal hygiene was the best prevention.
[Byline: Shirley Kwok
[During 1997, there was an outbreak of fatal myocarditis among children in
Malaysia (Sarawak) during which Enterovirus 71 was one of the viral agents
identified. During 1998 there were outbreaks of Enterovirus 71 in Taiwan
and South China including Hong Kong. Enterovirus 71 is one of the agents
associated with hand foot and mouth disease. During the outbreaks in
Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong there was significant mortality due to
complications, including encephalitis and myocarditis. The finding of a
case now in Hong Kong is of concern that a new epidemic cycle may be
starting. Of note, there are more than 30 ProMED-mail postings covering
the Enterovirus 71 outbreaks in Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong. I would
encourage ProMED-mail readers who would like more information to check the
ProMED-mail archives and read the postings.
In addition, there is an excellent website by Dr. M. Vadivale covering all
aspects of Enterovirus 71 and the outbreaks with links to many other sites
with information.
