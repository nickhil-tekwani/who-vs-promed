The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has received a
report of an additional case of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in a
resident of Kingston, Jamaica.

This brings the total number of recent cases to 2, suggesting that
the outbreak that started in September 2006, resulting in 370 cases
by June 2007, is still continuing.

As a result, CDC is reinstating the recommendation that US travelers
to Kingston, Jamaica take malaria preventive medication
(prophylaxis). This recommendation is expected to be temporary and
does not apply to other areas of Jamaica. Jamaica is a country where
malaria is not considered endemic and malaria transmission does not
normally occur.

The Ministry of Health in Jamaica has responded to these latest cases
with heightened surveillance for malaria cases, measures to control
mosquitoes (larviciding and spraying), and educating the local population.

CDC recommends anti-malarial medication for travelers who stay
overnight in Kingston, Jamaica only. This recommendation is expected
to be temporary. For additional information about health
recommendations for travel to Jamaica, visit CDC's Travelers' Health
webpage, Health Information for Travel to Jamaica at
<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/destinationJamaica.aspx>.

Additional information about malaria can be found at the CDC Malaria homepage

Health-care providers needing assistance with diagnosis or management
of suspected cases of malaria should call the CDC Malaria Hotline:
770-488-7788 (M-F, 8 am-4:30 pm, Eastern Time). For consultation
after hours, call 770-488-7100 and ask to speak with a CDC Malaria
Branch clinician.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[ProMED reported one case of _P. falciparum_ malaria on 15 Oct 2007.
It seems that the outbreak has almost been stopped, but it is
difficult to assess the situation without knowing the total number of
cases at the moment. If the report implies that there have only been
2 cases since June 2007, it looks very promising, but these data are
missing from the report. - Mod.EP]
