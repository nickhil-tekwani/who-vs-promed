2000/039 Situation of _Erwinia amylovora_ in Spain (edited by - Mod.DH)
In Spain, _Erwinia amylovora_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest), the bacterium
causing fire blight disease, was first found in 1995 in Pais Vasco in the
province of Guipuzcoa in an orchard of cider apple (see EPPO RS 96/107).
The disease later spread towards the northeast, 25 foci being detected in
1996 and 1997, essentially on cider apple. It was then found throughout the
province of Guipuzcoa. The disease has been reported subsequently in other
provinces (Navarra [1996, Gerona [1997, Segovia [1996, and Huesca [1998,
1999). The disease also occurs on pear, and _Pyrancantha_ sp., an
ornamental shrub, appears to be commonly infected in some provinces.
Eradication measures have been used to limit spread. The pattern of
appearance of fireblight
foci in Spain suggests that in many cases new foci are linked to the
introduction of infected plant material. Efforts will continue to limit the
spread of the disease

[Fire blight is difficult to control. A combination of chemical and
biological control, dormant pruning, prevention of excessive tree vigor,
and the use of resistant root/stock combinations is needed. The
possibility of insects as vectors of the pathogen is being investigated. -
