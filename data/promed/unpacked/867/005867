4 children developed _E.coli_ infections after visiting an open farm where
visitors have been prevented from handling eggs, it emerged on Friday.
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said the children visited the National
Trust's Wimpole Hall Farm near Cambridge in April 2005 and became ill. The
National Trust confirmed the infection cases on Friday night.
Earlier this week the National Trust said it had stopped visitors to the
farm from handling newly laid eggs. The trust said it made the decision
following advice from the HPA.
Experts from the HPA established earlier this week the _E.coli_ infection
came from Wimpole Hall Farm. However, the trust did not initially announce
details of the infections, which came to light when a BBC journalist
visited the farm with her children.
When commenting on the decision to stop visitors handling eggs and feeding
goats earlier this week, a trust spokesman made no mention of the outbreak
of _E. coli_.
On Friday night Julian Lloyd, head of media at the National Trust, said it
was thought the 4 children came from the same school.
"Obviously we regret it has happened," he said. "It is a residual risk. We
are keen to work with the HPA to implement whatever they advise us. It is
important for the public to understand that it is a very low level of risk
and not attached just to Wimpole Hall Farm."
An HPA spokesman said the farm had been under investigation for a number of
weeks.
"4 children visited the farm in April and subsequently developed _E.
coli_," he said. "We have been investigating a number of possible sources
of the outbreak. We did not confirm that Wimpole Hall Farm was the source
until earlier this week."
He said 2 child relatives of the children had subsequently contracted the
bug. All 6 children were being treated, he added. "The children are all
responding to treatment," he said. "We have had no further reports of cases
of _E. coli_ linked to the farm."
He added although the outbreak had been definitely linked to the farm, it
may never be known exactly where they picked it up.
"It could be handling eggs, it could be feeding goats, it could be from
petting animals," he added.

[The _E. coli_ serotype is not identified, but it is presumably _E. coli_
O157. Although eggs are prominently mentioned in the article, it is likely
that the infection was acquired by petting or touching animals or from
contact with ground contamination from animal feces. If eggs were
involved, it likely would have been from touching an egg that had become
contaminated from contact with the ground. Nothing beats careful hand
washing after contact with potentially contaminated sources.
Treatment is mentioned in the article, but as mentioned in previous posts,
use of antibiotics in therapy for the diarrhea is controversial, as some
studies (but not others) have reported a marked increase in episodes of
hemolytic uremic syndrome following use of antibiotics for the _E. coli_
infection. I personally would avoid antibiotic therapy. - Mod.DK]
