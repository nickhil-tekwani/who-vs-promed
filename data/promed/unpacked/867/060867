Nine ill after drinking poisoned tea
----------------------------------
Nine people have fallen ill at a Japanese university after drinking tea
laced with cadmium.
Officials said yesterday that the nine at Kyoto University, in western
Japan, experienced stomach pains and nausea which lasted for about two
hours. None of them was seriously ill. Tests on the leftover tea showed
traces of cadmium, which is sometimes used in research at the
university.
There have been more than 15 poisonings [incidents over the past two
months, but only one person ahs been arrested. Police believe that many
may be copying the first incident in late July, in which a curry served
at a summer festival was laced with arsenic. Four people were killed and
60 made ill.
