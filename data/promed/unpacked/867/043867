1st report of _Hop latent viroid_ (HpLVd) in China
--------------------------------------------------
Xinjiang is the primary region of hop (_Humulus lupulus_) production in
China due to high quality and productivity promoted by the favorable
climate, geography, and soil type. _Hop latent viroid_ (HpLVd) does not
cause any obvious symptoms in hop but results in a serious decrease in the
content of alpha acid, an important characteristic for use in the beer
industry (Matousek, et al. 2001).
In September 2006, 96 samples were gathered from symptomless hop leaves in
commercial fields in the Wensu, Yanqi, Changji, Shawan, Emin, Tacheng, and
Yili districts of Xinjiang, China. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to
dot blot hybridization using a biotin-labeled HpLVd cDNA probe and also
RT-PCR [reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction] specific for HpLVd
(Matousek, et al. 2001).
Dot blot hybridization results demonstrated that HpLVd was present in all
surveyed regions with an infection rate in each sample between 56 and 88
per cent. Using RT-PCR, a 256-bp [base pair] DNA fragment was amplified
from 16 samples collected from 7 different regions. The amplified products
were cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparisons revealed 99.2 to 100 per
cent homology among the collected isolates and with the HpLVd sequences
previously reported.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of HpLVd from China. Considering
the poor quality of hops infected with HpLVd, our results show the need for
a domestic eradication program to control the spread of this viroid.

[_Hop latent viroid_ (HpLVd; genus _Cocadviroid_, family _Pospiviroidae_)
has been reported from most countries that grow hops. HpLVd is symptomless
on most commercial cultivars, and 'Omega' is the only known hop variety
which shows visible symptoms of this viroid. Therefore, molecular methods
must be used for diagnosis. The viroid is transmitted by mechanical means
in hop gardens. Disease management relies on eradication on infected plants
and the use of viroid-free planting material. To obtain clean hop lines,
cold treatment can be effective, for example storage at 4 deg C (39 deg F)
for 6 months or more, followed by meristem tip culture. Meristem tip tissue
culture is a method that may be used to obtain plant lines free of viruses
and viroids (for further information see ProMED-mail 20070423.1323). Heat
therapy methods, which are also used to produce clean plant lines appear to
be inefficient for HpLVd elimination.
Dot blot hybridisation is a diagnostic technique that uses small amounts of
plant extracts applied to a support membrane as small dots. Target
molecules contained in the extracts can then be detected using a labelled
complementary nucleic acid molecule ('probe') in a hybridisation assay.
Probe sticking to target molecules can be detected and produces a signal
indicating the specific extracts that contain the target.
