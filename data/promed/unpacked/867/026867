Queensland boy ill with rabid-like virus
----------------------------------------
A north Queensland boy was likely bitten or scratched by a bat or a flying fox carrying Australian bat lyssavirus, and he's now critically ill in hospital. An 8-year-old Queensland boy is critically ill with the bat-borne virus that causes fits [seizures], paralysis and death. It's only the 3rd confirmed case of the rabies-like Australian bat lyssavirus recorded in the country. The other 2 victims, both infected in Queensland, died.

It's assumed the north Queensland boy was bitten or scratched by a bat or a flying fox carrying the deadly virus. It's believed he was infected about 2 months ago and a few weeks ago developed a brain infection that led to fits [seizures]. He's now so unwell he cannot give doctors any clues about how he came to be infected. "We're not sure of the circumstances because the child is now too sick to tell us," Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young told reporters on Friday [15 Feb 2013].

"He's critically unwell. The previous 2 cases did not survive and the vast majority of people who contract rabies [rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus are distinct virus species - Mod.CP] overseas die, unfortunately. "The other 2 cases were recorded in 1996 and 1998.

Dr Young said the family was incredibly distressed given the prognosis for the boy. The time from exposure to the virus to the development of symptoms is variable. Of the 2 known human cases, one became ill several weeks after being bitten by a bat while the other became ill more than 2 years after a bat bite. The virus causes paralysis, delirium and convulsions. Death is usually caused by respiratory paralysis. It's theoretically possible that the virus could be passed from human to human but that is considered very unlikely. And so far the boy's family has not shown any signs of symptoms but they've been given post-exposure drugs [rabies virus vaccine?] as a safeguard.

Dr Young said it's assumed any bat in Australia could carry the disease, and bat behaviour is not an accurate guide to infection. She said the best protection against the virus was to avoid handling any bat or flying fox. "Only people who have been trained in the care of bats, and who have been vaccinated against rabies, should ever handle bats or flying foxes," she said. "It is important to also encourage young children to never handle bats, particularly if they should come across a sick or injured one."

Federal MP Bob Katter, who holds the north Queensland seat of Kennedy, says it's time to revisit the idea of culling bats. The independent MP has long supported culling because bats spread disease, ruin farmers' crops and are a pest. He says Premier Campbell Newman has broken a pre-election promise to do something about bat colonies that have invaded some Queensland towns. "Clearly the Liberal National Party puts the welfare of bats over the lives of human beings," Mr Katter told reporters on Friday. He said bat populations were out of control thanks to laws preventing farmers and others from killing them.

[Gert van der Hoek is thanked for drawing attention to this report.

Australian bat lyssavirus [ABLV} is classified as a district species in the genus _Lyssavirus_ of the family _Rhabdoviridae_. It is closely related to rabies virus, but restricted to bats. It is antigenically similar enough to be neutralised by standard anti-rabies virus vaccine which can be used for post-exposure prophylaxis if administered before the onset of symptoms of disease. However in the present case in view of the lapse of time between exposure and appearance of symptoms it is unlikely that post-exposure prophylaxis could be successful.

According to Queensland Health (http://access.health.qld.gov.au/hid/InfectionsandParasites/ViralInfections/australianBatLyssavirus_fs.asp):
Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) is a virus that can be transmitted from bats to humans, causing serious illness. The virus was 1st identified in 1996 and has been found in 4 kinds of flying foxes/fruit bats and one species of insect-eating microbat. Evidence of previous infection has been found in blood tests from a number of other bat species. It is therefore assumed that any bat in Australia could potentially carry the virus.

Since November 1996, 2 people have died as a result of ABLV infection after being bitten by bats. ABLV is one of 12 types of lyssavirus which are found around the world. ABLV is the only one of these known to occur in Australia. ABLV infection in humans causes a serious illness which results in paralysis, delirium, convulsions and death. Death is usually due to respiratory paralysis. Transmission of the virus from bats to humans is thought to usually be by a scratch or bite, but also potentially by being exposed to bat saliva through the eyes, nose or mouth (mucous membrane exposure). ABLV is unlikely to survive outside the bat for more than a few hours, especially in dry environments that are exposed to sunlight. The time from exposure to the virus to the development of symptoms is variable; of the 2 other known human cases of ABLV infection, one became ill several weeks after being bitten by a bat while the other became ill more than 2 years after a bat bite.

There is no available treatment for ABLV. In all potential exposures to ABLV (bites, scratches, mucous membrane exposures), seek medical advice immediately, even if you have been vaccinated. Proper cleansing of the wound is the single most effective measure for reducing transmission. If bitten or scratched, immediately wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water for at least 5 minutes. If available, an antiseptic with anti-virus action such as povidone-iodine, iodine tincture, aqueous iodine solution or alcohol (ethanol) should be applied after washing. If bat saliva contacts the eyes, nose or mouth, it is necessary to flush the area thoroughly with water. Seek medical attention as soon as possible. The best protection against being exposed to the virus is for members of the community to avoid handling any bat or flying fox.

Anyone who has been potentially exposed to ABLV, and has never received pre-exposure vaccination, will require an injection of rabies immunoglobulin and a series of 4 rabies vaccine injections over one month (on days zero, 3, 7, and 14). Queensland Health will fund these injections, which are called 'post-exposure prophylaxis,' and your local public health unit will arrange for these injections to be delivered to your GP or hospital. These injections are recommended for anyone who has been exposed to ABLV, regardless of how long ago the exposure occurred. People with a weakened immune system will require a further (5th) dose of vaccine given at day 28 and follow up blood tests to confirm their immunity. Post-exposure vaccination may be delayed for up to 48 hours if the bat is available for testing, without placing other people at risk of exposure.
