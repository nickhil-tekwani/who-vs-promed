California: West Nile Virus-infected Crows Found in Los Angeles County
--------------------------------------------------
5 dead crows found in the suburbs east of Los Angeles were infected with
West Nile virus, county health officials said on Tue 30 Sep 2003. The
discovery in the San Gabriel Valley marked the 2nd time the virus had been
found in an animal in Los Angeles County, said Dr. David Dassey, deputy
chief of acute communicable disease control. A crow that tested positive
for the virus was also found dead in the San Gabriel Valley earlier in
September 2003. Infected mosquitoes and chickens previously were
discovered in Imperial County and infected chickens were found in Riverside
County, officials have said.
"The evidence is that the wild bird population is infected, and it will
only be a matter of time until we see [human] cases," Dassey said. No
locally acquired human cases have been reported in California so far in
2003, although 2 women came down with the disease in Alameda County. Health
officials have said they contracted the virus while traveling out of state.

California: Predicted to be Epicenter of 2004 West Nile Virus Season
--------------------------------------------------
Westward expansion of West Nile virus has prompted the government to look
to California as the possible epicenter of 2004's virus season. Officials
with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believe the
mosquito-borne illness will hit the West Coast hard next year, particularly
California, said Dr. Lyle Petersen, acting director of the CDC's division
of vector-borne diseases. "If I had to make a guess, the biggest area of
concern would be the Imperial Valley in Southern California," said
Petersen, who spoke to reporters on Wed 1 Oct 2003 at the University of
California's Berkeley campus.
That's because the virus emerged in that area for the first time this
season. Health officials believe human cases erupt one season after it
first appears in the environment. West Nile virus has steadily moved
westward and down the Eastern Seaboard since 1999 when it was found in New
York City, the first time it was found in the Western Hemisphere.
Petersen said the CDC will be giving more money to California to improve
virus surveillance and public education to prevent people from being
infected. The virus is passed to people by bites of mosquitoes that have
fed on infected birds. Most often, it produces mild flu-like symptoms. In
the most serious cases, it can induce a deadly inflammation of the brain.
Petersen said this year's outbreak -- causing nearly 2000 cases in
Colorado, another 1000 in Nebraska, and more than 800 in South Dakota alone
-- likely will be of the same magnitude as 2002's outbreak, which was the
largest West Nile outbreak in the Western Hemisphere with 4156 cases and
284 deaths. Petersen characterized the 2003 outbreak as different from
previous U.S. onslaughts because the virus has sharply affected rural
areas. Previous outbreaks were spread by mosquitos that tended to live near
homes and buildings. The reason is the type of mosquito responsible for
passing the virus in Western states, _Culex tarsalis_, lives among
farmland, travels far and is "the most efficient vector of West Nile virus
ever discovered," Petersen said.
Although treatments and vaccines against the virus are being worked on,
they are still years away from public use, officials said. CDC officials
estimate the 2002 outbreak cost the country at least $200 million in
medical services. "There is no elimination" of West Nile virus, Petersen
said. "The only way to eliminate this is to get rid of every infected
mosquito -- and that's impossible. It's here to stay."

United States: West Nile Virus Activity; Thu 25 Sep to Wed 1 Oct 2003
--------------------------------------------------
This report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to
CDC through ArboNET as of 3 a.m., Mountain Daylight Time, Wed 1 Oct 2003.
Weekly Update
-------------
During the reporting week of Thu 25 Sep to Wed 1 Oct 2003, a total of 1034
human cases of WNV infection were reported from 27 states (Colorado,
Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming), including

[As of 1 Oct 2003, in the USA only 4 states -- Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada, and
Oregon -- remain entirely free of West Nile virus infection (apart from
travel-related human cases.
The weekly counts of new human cases during the past 4 weeks have been 414,
1046, 1214, 690, and now 1034, thereby negating last week's comment that
the epidemic might have reached its peak. So far the 3 western/midwestern
states of Colorado, Nebraska, and South Dakota have accounted for 65.4
percent (3830/5961) of the total number of confirmed human cases in 2003. -
