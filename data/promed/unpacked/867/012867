Rare diarrhoea virus attacks Calcutta
---------------------------------------------------
Calcutta, January 6 (HT Correspondent)
A rare type of diarrhoea virus has surfaced in Calcutta, after a gap of 16
years of its discovery in China for the first time.
Between August and October last year [1998] five adults were admitted into
the Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital at Beliaghata in Calcutta with acute
diarrhoea with vomitting and suffering from modest to severe dehydration.
They were treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS) and intravenous fluid
injection. They recovered and returned home.
Scientists at the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED)
found that the disease was due to adult diarrhoeal rotavirus (ADRV) group B,
which had raged in an almost epidemic form in Shexian country of ChinaÂ’s
Anhui province in 1983.
Speaking to the Hindustan Times, Dr Sujit Bhattacharyya, director, NICED,
said that the discovery of this new strain of diarrhoea certainly called for
a greater surveillance against the disease, although there was no cause for
panic. He said that the virus which had affected about 20 000 persons in
China claimed but a few lives.
The NICED director said that unlike ADRV group A, which was first found in
Australia in 1972 and then spread throughout the world, the ADRV group B was
not known to have been found anywhere else except in China. The Chinese
experts have recorded that no antibiotics were effective against the
disease, but it subsided by itself between three to seven days. The
existence of the virus was first recorded by scientists at the Institute of
Medical Sciences, Hefei (China).
