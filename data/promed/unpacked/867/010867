Sometimes, government inspectors responsible for examining
slaughterhouse cattle for mad cow disease and other ills are so
short-staffed that they find themselves peering down from catwalks at
hundreds of animals at once, looking for such telltale signs as
droopy ears, stumbling gait, and facial paralysis. The ranks of
inspectors are so thin that slaughterhouse workers often figure out
when "surprise" visits are about to take place, and make sure they
are on their best behavior.

These allegations were raised by former and current US Department of
Agriculture (USDA) inspectors in the wake of the biggest beef recall
in history -- 143 million pounds [about 65 000 tons) from a
California meatpacker accused of sending lame "downer" cows to slaughter.

The inspectors told The Associated Press that they fear chronic staff
shortages in their ranks are allowing sick cows to get into the
nation's food supply, endangering the public. According to USDA's own
figures, the inspector ranks nationwide had vacancy rates of 10
percent or more in 2006-07. "They're not covering all their bases.
There's a possibility that something could go through because you
don't have the manpower to check everything," said Lester
Friedlander, a former USDA veterinary inspector at a plant in
Wyalusing, Pennsylvania.

Amanda Eamich, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Food Safety and
Inspection Service (FSIS), acknowledged that the department has been
struggling to fill vacancies but denied the food supply is at risk.
"Every single animal must past antemortem inspection before it's
presented for slaughter, so only healthy animals are going to pass,"
she said. "We do have continuous inspection at slaughter facilities."
...
Wayne Pacelle, the Humane Society's president and chief executive,
said the video was filmed over a 6-week period last fall [2007] and
all the abuse happened when USDA inspectors were not present. "The
inspection system obviously has enormous gaps if these routine abuses
could happen," he said. "The inspector would show up and if there
were downed animals, the workers would try to get them up before the
inspectors got there."

Generally, downer cows -- those too sickly to stand, even with
coaxing -- are banned from the food supply under federal regulations.
Downer cows carry a higher risk of mad cow disease. And because
sickly animals typically wallow in feces and have weakened immune
systems, downer cows are more likely to carry _E. coli_ and
_Salmonella_, too. Veterinary inspector looks for such symptoms as an
unsteady gait, swollen lymph nodes, sores, and poor muscle tone.
...
Inspectors whose job is to make sure that the cattle are treated
humanely said staff shortages mean they are forced to adopt routine
hours for their checks, removing the element of surprise. USDA
numbers show anywhere between 10 and 12 percent of inspector and
veterinarian positions at poultry, beef, and pork slaughterhouses
nationwide were vacant between October 2006 and September 2007. In
some regions, including Colorado and Texas, a major beef-producing
state, the rate hovered around 15 percent. In New York, vacancy rates
hit nearly 22 percent last July [2007].
...
At 2 packing houses in Nebraska, veterinarians monitor up to 700 head
of cattle at a time for signs of illness -- just enough to make sure
all the cows are standing, said one veteran inspector who spoke on
condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job. The inspector has
worked for 15 years as an inspector at 2 plants in Lexington and
Grand Island, Nebraska One-quarter of the inspection positions at one
of his plants have been vacant now for 2 years, he said. "There are
so many vet shortages out in the field right now, they can't keep it
properly staffed," the inspector said. "When they come into these big
slaughter facilities, they'll put 200 head in a pen. All you can tell
is they're moving."

Friedlander, who left the USDA in 1995, said he recalled checking up
to 220 cows an hour by standing on a catwalk above a pen of hundreds
of animals. He would also check to see if cows could walk by having
workers drive them from one pen to another, 6 or 7 cows abreast. "If
you're a vet, you see the 1st cow, you might see the 2nd cow, but the
4th, 5th, 6th, 7th cow you might not see," he said. "How can we tell
if there's any facial paralysis or droopy ears? You can't tell."

The National Institute for Animal Agriculture (NIAA) condemns the
downed animal treatment shown on a video reportedly taken at a
packing company in California. Related to the same incident, NIAA
applauds action taken to make involved workers responsible for their
actions by charging them with felony and misdemeanor counts.

"The abuse recorded is an isolated incident and is not common
practice within animal agriculture. NIAA stands for responsible
treatment of livestock and therefore does not condone this incident,"
Scott Stuart, Chairman of NIAA, states. "We urge the USDA to fully
investigate the downed animal incident and the undercover
investigation. In addition, NIAA recommends that animal agriculture
immediately report violations of food safety regulations and inhumane
treatment of livestock to appropriate authorities." Stuart points out
that the importance of animal care and well-being in every step of
the production chain-is the focus of NIAA's upcoming annual meeting,
1-3 Apr 2008, in Indianapolis, Indiana.

[One can be sympathetic with the position taken by NIAA but it is now
up to the industry and the USDA (see next report) to transparently
determine how frequent this problem is and to clean it up if
necessary. The Chino downer handling was a nightmare for any viewer. - Mod.MHJ]

Days after the largest meat recall in US history, the head of the
Agriculture Department (USDA) said officials are reviewing why a
California plant processed unfit cattle, and that it was too early to
determine whether it was an incident specific to the facility. The
USDA announced on Sunday [17 Feb 2008] that the Hallmark/Westland
Meat Packing Co was recalling 143 million pounds (65 million kilos)
of meat, mostly beef, after plant workers were caught on videotape
forcing unfit cattle into the slaughterhouse.

"We are reviewing our procedures, how we work with the plant, how our
inspectors work, our staffing needs," Agriculture secretary, Ed
Schafer, told reporters at the USDA's annual Outlook Forum. "And
until we find out, we can't assess other plants, and we can't say ...
this is an isolated incident or an ongoing practice."
