PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2007 (02)
*****************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>
[Note: With continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease [abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.)
in ProMED-mail] in the human population, it has been decided to broaden the
scope of the occasional ProMED-mail reports to included other prion-related
diseases. These updates supercede the previous update thread.
In the case of human cases of vCJD, the definitions of the designations
deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD cases, and the case definitions can
be found by accessing the Department of Health website or by reference to a
previous ProMED-mail post in the vCJD thread.
Data on vCJD cases from any part of the world are now included in these
updates where appropriate, and other forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic,
familial, and GSS Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also
when they have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD.
In addition, prion-related diseases of domesticated and free-living animals
may also be included if relevant. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics - 4 Jun 2007
---------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 4 Jun 2007] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD). This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of the
disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK as of Mon 4 Jun 2007
--------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
-------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 114
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 47
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 161
Summary of vCJD cases -- alive
------------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 4
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 165
(The next table will be published on Mon 2 Jul 2007.)
Since the previous monthly statistics were released on 8 May 2007, the
total number of deaths from definite vCJD has increased by one and is now
161. The number of probable vCJD cases still alive has decreased by one,
and one probable case has become a definite case. The overall total number
of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains 165.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is
in decline. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by
20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, and so
far 3 in 2007.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK since 1995
------------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 4 Jun 2007, in the UK in the year 2007, so far there have been 47
referrals, 10 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 deaths from iatrogenic CJD, 3
deaths from vCJD, one from GSS and none from familial CJD.
During the period from 1995, when vCJD was 1st diagnosed, up to the
present, there have been 977 deaths from all forms of CJD, including the
161 deaths attributable to definite or probable vCJD. [These data are
accessible at

[2] UK: Sporadic CJD in 2 adolescents

ABSTRACT:
Background
----------
Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a condition predominantly
affecting older age groups, with cases aged less than 45 years rare and an
age at onset or death of less than 20 years exceptional.
Methods
-------
Data from the systematic study of sporadic CJD in the UK are available from
1970 onwards. Clinical and pathological data are reviewed in order to
identify atypical cases, including those at the extremes of the age range
of sporadic CJD. Detailed analysis of atypical cases is undertaken, and in
selected cases, laboratory transmission studies are carried out in order to
provide information on the characteristics of the infectious agent.
Results
-------
In the UK, 2 cases of sporadic CJD in adolescents have been identified,
dying aged 16 and 20 years. The 1st case predated the epidemic of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, and the characteristics of the 2nd case,
including laboratory transmission studies, are consistent with a diagnosis
of sporadic rather than variant CJD.
Conclusion
----------
The cases in this report indicate that sporadic CJD can develop at a very
young age, that variant CJD is not the only form of CJD occurring in this
age group and that neuropathological examination is essential to accurate
diagnosis of human prion disease.
