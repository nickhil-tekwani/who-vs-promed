Indonesia: 2 Suspected Human Cases of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------------
A father and his little daughter have died at a hospital in the
western Java town of Tangerang from suspected avian influenza, local
media reports said on Wednesday [13 Jul 2005].
A father, a staffer with the Supreme Audit Body (BPK), died at the
Siloam Gleneagles Hospital on Tuesday afternoon [12 Jul 2005] after
showing avian influenza symptoms, reported the Detikcom online news
service. His daughter died earlier Saturday [9 Jul 2005] with similar
symptoms, it said. Another daughter, who was 1st detected with the
symptoms, is still under intensive treatment at the same hospital,
around 20 km south of Jakarta. She suffers high fever and respiratory
problems.
The reports were 1st released by Metro TV, which reported that the
family suffered the disease after a trip to Hong Kong and India. The
Indonesian government has confirmed an avian influenza outbreak among
chickens, and only one person, a poultry worker in South Sulawesi

Indonesia: Government Denies Human Avian Influenza Report
---------------------------------------------------------
The Indonesian Minister of Health, Siti Fadillah Supari, denied today
[Wed 13 Jul 2005] that avian influenza has killed 2 persons in the
town of Tangerang during the last 5 days. She said that the 2, a
father and his one-year-old daughter, died from acute pneumonia.
"Based on a laboratory test conducted by the Ministry's Research and
Development Center on 13 Jul 2005, [it was established that] the
pneumonia was caused by pathogenic bacteria, and there was no
indication of pathogenic virus," Supari said in a statement published
by the Detikcom online news service. She said the health office in
Tangerang, some 20 km south of Jakarta, has been instructed to
further investigate the pneumonia case and the possibility of an
outbreak in the town.

[The only previous human case of avian influenza virus infection in
Indonesia concerned a poultry farm worker. The farm worker was
initially tested in late March 2005, after the avian influenza
outbreak in Indonesia spread to Sulawesi, killing at least 25 000
chickens. That outbreak prompted officials to limit the transfer of
poultry off the island and to take blood samples from laborers,
veterinarians and others exposed to sick chickens. In total, 81
people were tested, and all but one of the samples came back
negative, officials said. The single positive test was confirmed by
independent testing in Hong Kong. The poultry worker exhibited no
symptoms of illness prior or subsequent to laboratory testing. -
