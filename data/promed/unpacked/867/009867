The resurgence of dengue in Singapore, first noted in 1989, continued into
1998. A total of 5,183 cases of dengue fever and 75 cases of dengue
haemorrhagic fever were reported during the year. This included 153
imported cases. There was one fatal case of dengue shock syndrome involving
a two-month-old foreigner who was already seriously ill when he was brought
to Singapore for medical treatment.
The highest age-specific incidence rate was in young adults aged between 25
and 34 years and the median age was 30 years. There was a male predominance
with a male to female ratio of 1.8:1. Among the three major ethnic groups,
the incidence rate per 100,000 population was highest in Chinese (141.5)
followed by Indians (107.2) and Malays (65.6). The incidence rate was
highest among residents of landed properties (bungalows, semi-detached
bungalows, terrace houses). [Bungalows are usually 1- to 2-storeyed houses
with a garden, whereas terrace houses may or may not have a garden - Mod.
CYC (659.9 per 100,000). It was 6.1 times and 1.9 times higher than that
of residents of high-rise public housing estates (107.8 per 100,000) and
private apartments (342.6 per 100,000), respectively.
Disease transmission occurred throughout the year, with the majority of
cases (48.9%) reported during the months of June to September. A sharp
increase [in the number of cases was also seen in the first three months
of the year.
Thirty-four dengue viruses were isolated from patients' sera, 12 (35.3%)
dengue-1, 19 (55.9%) dengue-2 and 3 (8.8%) dengue-3.
The overall national _Aedes_ house index (percentage of premises positive
for _Aedes_ breeding) was 1.24%. Of 721,787 premises checked, 4,141 (0.57%)
were found to be breeding _Aedes aegypti_ while 4,824 (0.68%) were
positive for _Aedes albopictus_. The common [_Aedes_ breeding habitats
were discarded receptacles (36.0%) and domestic containers (12.7%).
