["On 28 Mar 2021, Avian influenza H5N3 was confirmed in turkey breeders at a commercial premise near Winsford, Cheshire West and Chester on [26 Mar 2021]. Further testing has confirmed this to be a low pathogenic strain and the 1km (approx. 0.6mi) temporary movement restriction zone has been replaced with a 1km (approx. 0.6mi) low pathogenic avian influenza restricted zone. For details of the movement restrictions and controls that apply in these zones", see https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#movement.

Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) is less infectious than highly pathogenic avian influenza. However, the serotypes H5 and H7 of low pathogenic avian influenza can mutate into a highly pathogenic virus. Therefore, strict measures must be taken.

Poultry infected with LPAI viruses may show mild signs of the disease or none at all and may go undetected due to the lack of symptoms in some species of birds. - Mod.CRD
