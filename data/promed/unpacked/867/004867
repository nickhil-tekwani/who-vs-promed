--------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
There are 4 medical conditions characterized by high levels of ferritin, the macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), adult onset Still's disease (AOSD), catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS), and septic shock, that share similar clinical and laboratory features, suggesting a common pathogenic mechanism. This common syndrome entity is termed "the hyperferritinemic syndrome". Here, we describe 2 different cases of hyperferritinemic syndrome triggered by chikungunya fever virus infection: a 21 year old female with SLE [systemic lupus erythematosus] and a 32 year old male patient who developed AOSD after the coinfection of dengue and chikungunya viruses.

[3] Virus phylogeographic relationships, Asia

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Outbreaks involving the Asian genotype chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused over one million infections in the Americas recently. The outbreak was preceded by a major nationwide outbreak in the Philippines. We examined the phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships of representative CHIKV isolates obtained from the 2012 Philippines outbreak with other CHIKV isolates collected globally. Asian CHIKV isolated from the Philippines, China, Micronesia, and Caribbean regions were found closely related, herein denoted as Cosmopolitan Asian CHIKV (CACV). 3 adaptive amino acid substitutions in nsP3 (D483N), E1 (P397L), and E3 (Q19R) were identified among CACV. Acquisition of the nsP3-483N mutation in Compostela Valley followed by E1-397L/E3-19R in Laguna preceded the nationwide spread in the Philippines. The China isolates possessed 2 of the amino acid substitutions, nsP3-D483N and E1-P397L whereas the Micronesian and Caribbean CHIKV inherited all the 3 amino acid substitutions. The unique amino acid substitutions observed among the isolates suggest multiple independent virus dissemination events. The possible biological importance of the specific genetic signatures associated with the rapid global of the virus is not known and warrant future in-depth study and epidemiological follow-up. Molecular evidence, however, supports the Philippines outbreak as the possible origin of the CACV.

ref: Mohite AA, Agius-Fernandez A. Chikungunya fever presenting with acute optic neuropathy. BMJ Case Rep. 2015; 2015. pii: bcr2015210081. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2015-210081
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Chikungunya fever is a vector borne virus that typically causes a self-limiting systemic illness with fever, skin rash, and joint aches 2 weeks after infection. We present the case of a 69 year old woman presenting with an acute unilateral optic neuropathy as a delayed complication of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection contracted during a recent trip to the West Indies. She presented to our ophthalmology department with acute painless visual field loss in the right eye and a recent flu-like illness. She was found to have a right relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) with unilateral optic disc swelling. Serology confirmed recent CHIKV infection. Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was delayed while awaiting MRI scans and serology results. At 5-month follow-up, there was a persistent right RAPD and marked optic atrophy with a corresponding inferior scotoma in the visual field.

[There is a review of ocular disease associated with chikungunya virus infections, indicating that ocular manifestations of infection have become more prevalent. The authors stated that ocular manifestations of chikungunya infection can be present at the time of fever or may manifest after many weeks. Anterior uveitis, optic neuritis, and retinitis are the commonest manifestations (Mahendradas P, Avadhani K, Shetty R. Chikungunya and the eye: a review. J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect. 2013; 3: 35; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3605073/).

If ProMED-mail subscribers know of any other cases of optic neuropathy or ocular disease following infections with chikungunya virus in outbreaks in the Americas, we would like to know about them. Mod.TY]
