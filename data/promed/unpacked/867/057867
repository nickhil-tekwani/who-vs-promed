China's southern city of Guangzhou [see commentary] has destroyed 153 320
domestic fowls in the wake of an outbreak of bird flu, local authorities
said on Tuesday [18 Sep 2007].
The extermination of 134 384 ducks, 18 786 chickens and 150 doves was
carried out in 9 villages within a radius of 3 km (2 miles) from the site
of the outbreak, an official with the Panyu district government said.
A total of 68 poultry farmers in Panyu district who have had close contact
with ducks killed by bird flu have taken blood tests and medical checkups,
and were found to be in good condition.
The Ministry of Agriculture and the National Avian Influenza Reference
Laboratory have confirmed a subtype H5N1 bird flu strain killed 9830 ducks
raised in Sixian Village of Panyu District in Guangzhou City since 5 Sep 2007.
The Panyu district government announced on Tuesday [18 Sep 2007] the
suspension of all poultry markets within a 13 km (8 mile) radius
surveillance zone. Tan Yinghua, Party chief of the district, told Xinhua
the district would put more pork, beef, and fish on the market to meet the
needs of local consumers.
As the world's largest producer of poultry, livestock, and aquatic
products, China has suffered huge economic losses from outbreaks of animal
diseases. It is estimated that animal diseases cost China 40 billion yuan
[USD 5.31824 billion] annually.
The previous reported case of H5N1 bird flu in China occurred in May [2007]
in central China's Hunan Province, which killed more than 11 000 poultry
with another 52 800 birds being culled. [Report submitted to the OIE (World
Organization for Animal Health) on 21 May 2007; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5462>.

China has reported 25 human cases of bird flu since 2003, which have
resulted in 16 deaths.

[According to China's report on the outbreak in Sixian (Panyu, Guangdong
province), submitted to the OIE on 17 Sep 2007, the outbreak started on 5
Sep 2007. The susceptible population is reported to have included 32 630
ducks, of which there were 9830 cases, 9830 deaths, with all the remaining
22 800 destroyed; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6213>.
The currently reported stamping-out operation in 9 villages around the
outbreak in Sixian falls in line with an earlier statement by the vice
mayor of the village, who said, "we would rather kill 100 000 ducks
wrongfully than miss even one (that has the virus)". This attitude may
reflect the worry of the authorities in view of the possibility that the
ducks were infected in spite of an earlier vaccination. This issue remains
to be clarified.

relevant 1st level administrative entity; in fact, Guangzhou is the capital
and the sub-provincial city of Guangdong Province. - Mod.AS
