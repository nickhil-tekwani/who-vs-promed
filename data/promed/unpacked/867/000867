Proximity between chimpanzees and people in a protected wildlife area
in Uganda may be leaving them with more in common than an ancestor in
the distant past. The animals also are apparently picking up human
bacteria -- some of them with antibiotic resistance, according to a
University of Illinois (UI) study.
The study in Uganda's Kibale National Park is the 1st to show such a
transmission in a protected wildlife area and without direct contact
between the animals and people, UI Professor Tony Goldberg said
recently. "I think the bottom line is maybe we should be more
concerned than we have been," said Goldberg, a veterinary
pathobiology professor in the UI College of Veterinary Medicine and
principal investigator of the study. "We should be aware of the risk
of infectious disease transmission, probably both ways."
Indeed, some of the most prominent infectious diseases to emerge
recently are believed to have jumped from animals to humans, HIV,
Ebola, and bird flu among them. Chimpanzees in some areas have
likewise exhibited signs of polio-like disease, and gorillas of
measles and mumps.
Diseases spread to humans can travel fast today as well, as fast as
an airliner can fly from Africa to Chicago, for instance.
"Diseases like SARS show how quickly a global epidemic can spread,"
said Goldberg, a leader in tracking the spread of pathogens by
studying their genetic makeup. Goldberg said the new study also
raises concern about the ease with which antibiotic resistance may be
transmitted, to wildlife in particular. The burgeoning of resistant
pathogens already is a human health threat, rendering commonly used
antibiotics ineffective in some cases.
But the spread of resistance has been thought to be largely a result
of such developed-nation problems as over-prescription of antibiotics
by doctors and widespread use of antibiotics in domestic animal feed.
To do the study, the UI researchers, working with colleagues from
Makerere University in Uganda and McGill University in Canada,
examined 2 of the communities of chimpanzees living in the Kibale
park. One of them has been under study by scientists for more than 2
decades. The other is visited regularly by ranger guides who shepherd
tourists in the park. The researchers collected samples of _E. coli_
bacteria from the chimpanzees and from the human scientists and
guides. They also collected samples of _E. coli_ from villagers who
live about 3 and 15 miles (5-24 km.) from the park and have little if
any contact with the chimps.
Goldberg said the researchers looked at _E. coli_ because the
bacterium is a good model system for such a study. It's common in
animals and humans and it can be a serious health threat in some
forms. Scientists also know much about _E. coli_ on a molecular,
genetic level -- more than any other bacterium -- and about
antibiotic resistance in _E. coli_. That's important because the UI
researchers and their colleagues basically compared the genetic
fingerprints of the various samples to see if there were
similarities. They found that _E. coli_ from people who worked in
proximity to the chimpanzees was more like the _E. coli_ from the
chimps than bacteria from the villagers who have little or no contact
with the animals.
Goldberg said you might expect some limited "background level" of
antibiotic resistance in the chimps from natural factors. But in this
case, specific strains of resistance proved to be significantly
similar among the animals and the people who work with them. While
antibiotics are used frequently among humans in the area, they've
never been used in the local wildlife, indicating that the resistance
found in the chimpanzees jumped from people, he said. And that's
without the 2 actually touching. Goldberg said the transmission
probably occurred environmentally, through contact by each with water
sources and the like. He said the findings have prompted the
researchers, who already took precautions to avoid contact, to be
even more careful. Another goal of the study is to provide the
Ugandans who manage Kibale with information they can use to minimize
the human impact on the wildlife there, through measures such as
limiting the number of people in the park and the time they spend in it.
The researchers are now looking for similarities in bacteria and
antibiotic resistance in people from farms around the park whose
crops are raided by Kibale chimpanzees and other monkeys.
The study was funded by the Morris Animal Foundation, which aims to
improve the health and well being of companion animals and wildlife
by funding humane health studies and disseminating information about
the results. Goldberg said it is the 1st in a series of studies
looking at health, disease transmission, and conservation involving
humans, primates, and domestic animals under the Kibale EcoHealth Project.
The project, headed by Goldberg and UI Professor Thomas Gillespie, is
associated with the UI Earth and Society Initiative, an
interdisciplinary program to address compelling environmental
questions, particularly as they relate to human health and societal well being.

The newspaper article does not make it clear if the direction of
transmission of the infectious organisms was conclusively proven in
this study, but we have long known about anthropozoonootic
infections. Human tuberculosis, measles, and polio being 3 notable
human diseases which have been found to kill apes and other pathogens
such as _Salmonella_ ssp, _Cryptosporidium parvum_, _Sarcoptes
scabiei_, and _Giardia duodenalis_ have been described as being found
in animals with humans implicated as the source species. Thaddeus
Graczyk has done some interesting work over the years in this subject
and also described the ability of a myriad of fly species able to
facilitate the long-distance spread of organisms shed in human feces.
As the authors note, one must be careful when interpreting antibiotic
resistance in bacteria. Antibiotics exist (and were originally
discovered) in nature, providing protection to the molds, fungi, and
plants that produce them. In turn, bacteria have developed antibiotic
resistance long before the advent of pharmaceuticals.

they need to defecate, so they do it in the bush. Flies can become
contaminated with fecal bacteria from there and spread them to
chimps. - Mod.MHJ, JW]
[Generally, a zoonosis is defined as a disease of animals that is
transmissible to humans. Some authors, however, have split the
concept into zooanthroponosis, infections humans can acquire from
animals, and anthropozoonosis, a disease of humans transmissible to
other animals -- also called a "reverse zoonosis".
The closeness of humans and animals in the wild, in a zoological
garden, or in a home can facilitate such reverse zoonoses. An example
of a classical infection of man that can be such a disease is
tuberculosis. _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ has been spread to
primates (1), elephants (2), and dogs (3).

This topic is an important discussion and I am glad we have assembled
several comments. I am very grateful for Billy Karesh's comments
above and his consistent contributions to ProMED-mail. I also want to
point out a very interesting paper by Mark Woolhouse and Sonya
Gowtage-Sequeria published in the EID (Emerging Infectious Diseases)
journal in December 2005 and referenced below.
The paper is titled "Host range and emerging and reemerging
pathogens". The authors surveyed the literature, including
ProMED-mail archives, and determined that there are 1407 species of
human pathogens, 58 percent of which are zoonotic. They also
identified 177 emerging and re-emerging diseases, of which 73 percent
are known to be zoonotic. The pattern differed somewhat across the
various pathogen groups of viruses and prions, bacteria and fungi,
protozoa and helminths. Bacteria and fungi are most likely to be
zoonotic, which is somewhat surprising given the attention viruses
receive in the world of emerging diseases.
Since 1959, WHO (World Health Organization) has defined zoonoses as
the "those diseases and infections which are naturally transmitted
between vertebrate animals and man". However, a major PAHO (Pan
American Health Organization) publication on zoonotic diseases by
Acha and Szyfres, "Zoonoses and communicable diseases common to man
and animals" differs slightly on the subject indicating that the book
"considers 2 groups of communicable diseases: those transmitted from
vertebrate animals to man, which are "strictly speaking" zoonoses;
and those common to man and animals". Jim Steele who has, for the
past 75 years, been steeped in the study and prevention of zoonotic
disease, both cites the WHO definition and utilizes the notion of
diseases that are common to man and animals in his CRC Handbook of
the Zoonoses series. Schwabe, in Veterinary Medicine and Human
Health, discuses the multiple definitions in detail and proposes the
notion that zoonoses are those infections that are shared in nature.
These multiple definitions of zoonoses, and their directional
subcategories, correctly given by Mod.LL above, result in a certain
amount of obfuscation concerning the essential nature of zoonotic
diseases. The emphasis should not be placed on directionality of
infection but on the natural pattern of occurrence and potential
manipulable risk factors, regardless of in which direction the
disease travels. Whether it goes from animals to humans or, as in
this case of antibiotic resistance in chimpanzees, the other way
around, key epidemiologic factors such as close proximity,
commonality of food and water, or other risk factors must be
uncovered. It is critical that appropriate behavior and/or management
of the transmitting and receiving species be ensured to prevent the
occurrence of disease transmission.
Certainly, work by people like Professor Goldberg, Billy Karesh, and
Gladys Kalema-Zikukosa, (whose non-profit Conservation through Public
Health works in Uganda on these issues) provides us with a view from
the other side of the zoonotic equation or more properly put, another
angle to look from when viewing the zoonotic disease web. This is
extremely valuable because the more we know about how chimpanzees get
sick, the more we know about transmission of disease between host
species in its entirety, the better we can both protect public health
and conserve animal health and well being. Obviously, it is important
to do both to the best of our abilities, yet the study of diseases
flowing from humans to animals is undertaken infrequently.
