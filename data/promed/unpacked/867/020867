A 27 year old male with chronic kidney disease, received an unrelated renal transplant from a living donor in Pakistan in 2002 that lasted until [chronic] rejection in 2014. He underwent a second unrelated (commercial) renal transplant from a living donor in Pakistan on [9 Nov 2018]. The patient arrived to Oman on [12 Nov 2018] and was brought immediately to our hospital. His renal function tests were grossly abnormal and he required urgent hemodialysis. DTPA renogram and Abdominal CT angiography confirmed acute rejection due to graft infarction. On the [15 Nov 2018] he underwent a transplantectomy of an infarcted kidney. Histopathology findings were consistent with renal infarction.

He was screened regularly -- every 3 months -- for HIV according to hemodialysis unit standards; the last HIV negative test was from [2 Oct 2018]. The patient received plasmapheresis on [5 Nov 2018].

The 1st reactive HIV test was done on [12 Nov 2018] by Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo chemiluminescent assay with index of 120. This reactivity was not confirmed by Bio-rad Geenius (TM) HIV 1/2 Confirmatory assay (with no single reactive band). Acute HIV infection was detected by testing a plasma sample, collected on [19 Nov 2018], with HIV viral load of 11 800 copies/ml (log10 5.07) using Roche cobas(R)4800 for HIV-1 system. A repeat HIV serology sample by ROCHE Elecsys(R) HIV combi PT (e411) ECL assay from [22 Nov 2018], was also reactive, with index of 86.5. This time the confirmatory Geenius (TM) assay detected a single gp41 band. A repeat HIV viral load from [27 Nov 2018] showed very HIV RNA of more than 10000000 copies/ml (log10 more than 7.0 ).
On [29 Nov 2018] the patient was started on ART that included: zidovudine 100mg tid , lamivudine 50mg od and raltegravir 400mg bid.

[The transplant cost the patient 41 500 USD. The cost cannot be retrieved after the failed transplant. It is usual that commercial kidney transplants performed in Pakistan receive heavy immunosuppression and are discharged very soon to their home country before complications appear. Usually no written report of the procedure or information about the donor is given to the recipient.

A study of "kidneys for sale" on social media [22 Jun 2015 to 19 Feb 2016] on Twitter, Google answers, and Facebook found a total of 557 advertisements on organ trade (Alrogy W, Jawdat D, Alsemari M, Alharbi A, Alasaad A, Hajeer AH. Organ trade using social networks. Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl. 2016;27:971-6; < http://www.sjkdt.org/article.asp?issn=1319-2442;year=2016;volume=27;issue=5;spage=971;epage=976;aulast=Alrogy>). Comparison across 12 medical outcomes indicates that transplant tourists are significantly more likely to contract cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B, HIV, post-transplantation diabetes mellitus, and wound infection than those receiving domestic kidney transplant (Anker AE and Feeley TH. Estimating the risks of acquiring a kidney abroad: a meta-analysis of complications following participation in transplant tourism. Clin Transplant. 2012;26:E232-41; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1399-0012.2012.01629.x).

A study following 36 commercial (illegal) kidney transplants performed in Pakistan found that the patients had not been cleared for transplantation with a standard pre-transplant work-up: 80% were hepatitis-C virus (HCV) or HBsAg positive. During follow-up, 7 patients died, 16 patients experienced wound infections with post-operative hernias, and 3 developed peri-renal hematomas. A total of 6 abscesses and 4 lymphoceles occurred, and 4 urinary fistulas were surgically treated. Transplantectomy [removal of the transplanted kidney] was performed in 3 patients because of renal artery thrombosis. As many as 9 patients developed active hepatitis C, and 4 patients manifested cytomegalovirus disease. Three patients developed steroid-induced diabetes, and 3 experienced acute myocardial infarction. Nine patients had one or more rejection episodes. Urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas or Escherichia occurred frequently. The one-yr patient and graft survival rates were 80% and 68%, respectively (Ivanovski N, Masin J, Rambabova-Busljetic I, et al. The outcome of commercial kidney transplant tourism in Pakistan. Clin Transplant. 2011;25:171-3; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1399-0012.2010.01299.x).

Thus it is clear that kidneys are offered for sale through social media. The study by Ivanovski N et al. clearly demonstrate that clinical outcomes are substandard. One wonders if there is any attempt to match tissue types between donor and recipient, or screen the donors for chronic infections. In addition, the immunosuppression after transplant is probably more severe than standard to avoid immediate rejection before the patient returns to his or her home country, leading to a high incidence of bacterial and fungal infections.

The authorities have a responsibility to try and control this criminal activity. Other countries have an obligation to increase the availability of organs, for instance introducing legislation allowing persons with irreversible brain damage to be donors unless they explicitly said no before the brain injury, and not as it is in many countries, that persons can only be used as donors if the explicitly chose to be donors in case they suffer irreversible brain damage. - Mod.EP
