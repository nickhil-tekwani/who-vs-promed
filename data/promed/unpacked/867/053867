Detection of bluetongue virus
-----------------------------
As of [8 Sep 2020], the detection of bluetongue virus (blue tongue disease) serotype 8 has been confirmed by the reference laboratory.

Following this analysis result, Luxembourg, which had been declared free from this disease since 2012, will be considered as a regulated area [restriction zone].

The following provisions concerning the export of susceptible animals (cattle, sheep, goats) to countries or zones free from this type of virus are applicable from [10 Sep 2020].

1. Adult animals must be vaccinated (the vaccination protocol must be finalized for at least 60 days).
2. Animals less than 90 days old must be treated with insecticides and have a negative result on a blood test (this blood test must be carried out within 7 days before export).
3. Animals exported for slaughter are not subject to these provisions.
4. Finally, it is important to emphasize that this type of virus has no repercussions on public health since it is not transmissible to humans.

[Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV‐8) caused an epizootic in Europe in 2006/09. Transplacental transmission of BTV‐8 was demonstrated leading to abortions, congenital malformations or nervous clinical signs in newborn calves.

BTV‐8 re‐emerged in France in 2015. Although the re‐emergent strain is nearly genetically identical to the one that had circulated in 2006/2009, it has caused very few clinical cases. However, from mid‐December 2018 to April 2019, cases of calves with congenital malformations or displaying nervous clinical signs occurred in some of France's departments in mainland France. Similar cases have been observed in Germany and in southern Belgium. It was suggested that the re‐emergent strain of BTV‐8 can cross the transplacental barrier and cause congenital malformations or nervous clinical signs in calves. The infection of bovine embryos may present an over-wintering mechanism of the virus.

Luxembourg has become a part of the large BTV 'restriction zone' covering the south-western parts of Germany; a map presenting an overview of bluetongue cases in Europe, per serotype, since 1 May 2020, as of 10 Sep 2020 with the restriction zone colored grey, is available at https://www.fli.de/de/aktuelles/tierseuchengeschehen/blauzungenkrankheit/ (click on the map on the right side of the page, zoom in). - Mod.AS
