Confirmation of a new outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in the province of East Flanders (30 Apr 2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A new outbreak of bovine tuberculosis [bTB] has been confirmed by bacterial culture. The infected farm is located in the province of East Flanders. This brings the total number of bTB outbreaks in Belgium during 2013 to 6.

Bovine tuberculosis can remain latent for years. A large number of officially tuberculosis-free countries may thus have to deal with recurring outbreaks in cattle. The new focus was discovered in the context of veterinary inspection in a slaughterhouse where highly suspicious gross lesions were observed during meat inspection of a slaughtered bovine animal. The animal came from a beef cattle herd which was not included among contact herds under follow-up observation. The epidemiological investigation following the discovery of the new bTB focus, will lead to surveillance activities, including periodically repeated tuberculin tests in a new chain of contact farms.

Prevailing precautionary bTB policy remains unchanged; it is described in detail in the Belgian veterinary websites http://www.favv-afsca.fgov.be/dierengezondheid/tuberculose/ (Flemish) and http://www.favv-afsca.fgov.be/santeanimale/tuberculose/ (French).

For the control and eradication of this disease, it is in everyone's interest that all precautions be closely adhered to by both veterinarians and farmers, in spite of the difficulties related to the required activities.

[According to the EU's Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) last available issue (24 Apr 2013), bTB has been reported from the following countries since 1 Jan 2013:
Country / Last outbreak date / Number of outbreaks
Austria / 21 Feb 2013 / 2
Belgium / 10 Apr 2013 / 5 (now 6)
France / 18 Apr 2013 / 46
Germany / 18 Apr 2013 / 24
Netherlands / 5 Mar 2013 / 1
Poland / 25 Mar 2013 / 4
Switzerland / 21 Mar 2013 / 2
Total: 84

The requirements from a country to qualify as free from bTB are stipulated in OIE's terrestrial Code, article 11.6.2., available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.6.htm. As long as the country maintains its bTB-freedom in at least 99.8 per cent of the herds and 99.9 per cent of the cattle, its national bTB-free status recognition is maintained. Such is the situation in relation to Belgium. - Mod.AS
