Rains Provide Conditions for Mosquito Population Increase
---------------------------------------------------------
For 2 years, parched South Georgia prayed for drought-busting rain from a
tropical storm. In June 2001, the deluge from Tropical Storm Allison
provided some critical relief. But with the storm came another hazard:
Allison's rains energized the region's mosquito population, which has
helped spread both West Nile virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis near the
Florida-Georgia border.
Now, rains from Tropical Storm Barry could create new mosquito breeding
grounds at Georgia's Ground Zero for the 2 mosquito-borne diseases. At 8
p.m., Fri 3 Aug 2001, Barry was about 270 miles southeast of New Orleans,
and was nearly stationary. Should the storm stay on a western track, South
Georgia would be spared the heaviest rains. But even a slight wobble to the
north could bring a "ton of moisture" into the area, says David Margolin, a
meteorologist with the Weather Channel.
In June, Allison's rains allowed mosquito eggs, dormant in the dry weather,
to hatch. Now, notes Paul Williams of the Georgia Emergency Management
Agency, mosquito-borne diseases are being found in some of the same
counties where floods were [severe. Eastern Equine encephalitis virus is a
recurring problem in counties south of Macon, but it's more common this
year, Williams says. So far 17 of the 22 dead birds known to be infected
with the virus have been found in the southern part of the state. Even if
Barry's rains are light, warns Mark Blackmore, a medical entomologist at
Valdosta State, the mosquito problem will continue for a while. "We're
several months away from relief."

West Nile Virus Surveillance in South Carolina
----------------------------------------------
With West Nile virus confirmed in most of the southeastern states, it seems
useful to share results of South Carolina's arbovirus surveillance in birds
and mosquitoes so far this year.
Since mid-May, 992 pools (5-50 female mosquitoes each) encompassing 20
species have been tested by culture and by PCR for West Nile virus, Eastern
equine encephalitis virus, St Louis encephalitis virus, California
encephalitis virus, and with a specific primer for La Crosse virus. Areas
nearest counties in North Carolina and Georgia having confirmed detection
have received special emphasis.
No West Nile virus has been found. So far 46 birds have been tested and
none has been positive.

Baltimore Stakes Claim to Epicenter of the 2001 Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------
BALTIMORE: Baltimore declared itself the epicenter of the West Nile virus
[outbreak this year and announced it would spray a city park with
pesticides for mosquitoes. "The first year or two, it was mostly in New
York and New Jersey, but now it's working its way south," Health
Commissioner Peter Beilenson said. "The city plans to spray the chemical
permethrin, a commonly used crop pesticide, in Clifton Park in the
northeastern section of the city on Tuesday night."
So far 77 dead birds infected with the virus have been found since 15 May
2001 in that section of the city. Maryland leads the nation in the number
of birds testing positive for the virus this year, state officials have
said. The virus appeared in the Western Hemisphere in 1999, when 59 people
were hospitalized with encephalitis or meningitis and 7 died. Last year, 21
human West Nile cases were reported, 2 of them fatal, according to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been no human cases
reported in Maryland.

West Nile Virus-positive Bird Total Now 10
-------------------------------------------
As of 9 Aug 2001, the State Mosquito Management Program today announced
that a third pool of mosquitoes has tested positive for West Nile virus
(WNV) and a second pool of mosquitoes has tested positive for Eastern
Equine Encephalitis virus (EEEV). The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment
Station (CAES) has isolated WNV from a pool of potentially human-feeding
mosquitoes (_Culex salinarius_) collected on 1 Aug 2001 from Beaver Pond
Park near Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven.
CAES has isolated EEEV from bird-feeding mosquitoes (_Culiseta melanura_)
collected on 25 Jul 2001 at Stonington High School. The state will work
with local officials to inspect the areas where the mosquitoes were
collected to determine adult mosquito levels and whether additional
trapping or larviciding is necessary in these areas.
The state also reported today 2 crows found in Fairfield and 1 crow found
in Stamford have tested positive for WNV. This brings the total number of
birds that have tested positive for WNV in Connecticut to 10. The crows in
Fairfield were found on 24 and 30 Jul 2001. The crow in Stamford was found
on 31 Jul 2001.

Second West Nile Virus Crow Found in Virginia
---------------------------------------------
RICHMOND: Virginia's Commissioner of Health, E. Anne Peterson, M.D.,
M.P.H., announced today that a dead crow found in the City of Suffolk has
been confirmed to have West Nile virus. The crow is the second bird to test
positive for West Nile virus in the state this year. The crow testing
positive for West Nile virus was collected on Collins Road in Suffolk,
Virginia on 28 Jul 2001. The crow tested positive and was confirmed by the
state's Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services in Richmond on 7 Aug 2001.
To date, 468 birds in Virginia have tested negative for West Nile virus; 7
crows tested positive for West Nile virus in Virginia last year. No human
cases have ever been reported in Virginia. Citizens should continue to
report all dead birds to their local health departments. Only certain
crows, blue jays, and raptors will be tested for West Nile virus, because
those bird species are the best early indicators of virus activity in an area.

northern Florida: Duval (Jacksonville, 1), Jefferson (Greenville, 2;
Monticello, 8), Leon (Tallahassee, 1), Madison (Greenville, 1), and Taylor
(Perry, 2; Shady Grove, 2). The earliest reported onset of illness was
approximately 25 Jun 2001 near Monticello in Jefferson County. Six (35
percent) of the 17 horses died or were euthanatized. All 17 horses were
positive on IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) and a
plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) performed on serum samples at
the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. All 3
horses from which brain tissues were available also tested positive at the
NVSL on reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR)
performed on those tissues.
Human Results:
--------------
There have been 2 confirmed human cases of WNV illness, both in residents
of Madison County, Florida. A 73-year-old man is reportedly improving. His
onset of illness was about 15 Jul 2001. A 64-year-old woman was also
confirmed to have WNV encephalitis. The onset date of her illness has not
been reported.
Other Mammals:
---------------
No other mammals have been reported as WNV-positive in 2001.
Wild Birds:
-----------
There have been 392 wild birds reported as positive for WNV in 11 States
plus the District of Columbia. New Jersey has reported the most positive
birds (121). Florida, Georgia, and Ohio have reported WNV-positive birds
for the first time ever.
Sentinel Chicken Results:
--------------------------
One sentinel chicken has been reported as WNV-positive in Duval County,
Florida.

Sentinel Chickens Test West Nile Virus-positive in Monmouth County, NJ
---------------------------------------------------------------------
TINTO FALLS: The Monmouth County Mosquito Extermination Commission (MCMEC)
received confirmation today that blood samples from 3 sentinel chickens
tested positive for West Nile virus. Samples collected on 19 Jul 2001 were
tested by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture using HI and IgM Elisa.
These samples were confirmed using PRN (Plaque Reduction Neutralization)
assay by the University of Rhode Island's Center for Vector-Borne Disease.
These are the first sentinel chickens in the entire northeast to
sero-convert this summer. Monmouth County is one of 2 counties in New
Jersey that are participating in a sentinel chicken program this year in a
cooperative agreement with the NJ Department of Agriculture. The Florida
Department of Health reported the only other sentinel chicken known to have
sero-converted so far this year, on 23 Jun 2001.
These positive chicken results are consistent with other indicators of West
Nile virus, including a few crows and mosquito pools that have tested
positive in the Keansburg/East Keansburg and Leonardo areas. For the 2001
season, the MCMEC maintains 5 flocks of from 3-9 chickens each located in
strategic areas throughout the county.
