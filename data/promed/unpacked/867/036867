The discussion about simian trypanosomes in Sri Lanka and Malaysia and their
possible infectivity to humans reminds me of our old friends, the flying
foxes (_Pteropus_ species et al.). Over the years, several graduate
students here have chanced upon a _T. cruzi_-like organism in the blood of
some of our megabats ("flying primates"?), which has been labelled
_Trypanosoma pteropi_. I am not aware that its life-cycle has ever been
elucidated, but likely vectors must include the spider-like, wingless,
blood-sucking nycteribiid flies (prolific on bats, but unlikely to transfer
to humans), or midges (_Ceratopogonidae_), very likely to feed on humans as
well. In view of the ability of various viruses to infect both us and
megachiroptera, it should not be such a challenge for a haemoflagellate to
do the same.
