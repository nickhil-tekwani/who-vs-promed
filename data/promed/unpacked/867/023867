The 1st phase of a vaccination campaign targeting 1 million people
has been completed in 6 districts and is ongoing in a further 2
districts. The bivalent vaccine has been secured from The
International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for
Epidemic Meningitis Control as well as from the security stockpiles
held by the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso.
The ICG has now also approved the release of 3 350 000 additional
doses of bivalent vaccine for use in further vaccination campaigns in
13 epidemic districts, including the entire city of Ouagadougou. A
1st shipment of 1 165 000 doses of this vaccine is scheduled to

the ongoing vaccination in the district, there are still sporadic
cases of the disease.
District Chairman Rashid Govule Iyiga, has appealed to residents to
report any suspected cases of the disease to the nearest health
center instead of taking patients to witch doctors.
