Grapes in the state of Maharashtra are being hit hard by downy mildew. The disease is spreading well as a result of recent humidity and rainfall.

Farmers have responded to previous occurrences by pruning vines earlier. However, this year [2012], the pruning had just ended when the majority of cases occurred.

According to a farmer: "Once we advance pruning, the flowering and fruit bearing schedule also gets advanced. We were expecting clear weather during the flowering period, but the recent rain spoiled our plans."

[Downy mildew on grapevine is caused by the fungus _Plasmopara viticola_. It causes lesions on leaves which later become necrotic, and it can also affect flowers and fruits. In years with warm, extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or totally destroyed. The disease can cause severe crop losses.

Spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain, wind, or mechanical means. The fungus survives between crops on infected plant debris as oospores, which are formed inside the host tissues. It is an obligate parasite and cannot be cultured _in vitro_. Disease management relies mainly on preventative fungicide applications according to forecasting services. Systemic fungicides are also available.

Maharashtra produces most of the country's wine for export to Europe and the US.
