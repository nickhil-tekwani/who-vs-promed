Anthrax Breaks Out in Kruger National Park
----------------------------------------
Anthrax has broken out amongst wild animals in the central district of
Kruger National Park [KNP. Officals of the South African National Parks
Service are warning people not to handle carcasses or eat the meat of
animals that have died suddenly. Ranchers & owners of private game farms in
the area are being urgently advised to vaccinate their animals at once.
Thirty cases have been confirmed in the area between Orpen Gate, Talamati
Rest Camp and Satara Rest Camp. To date, mortalities have been confirmed in
9 species. [The major species traditionally involved in the KNP are kudu,
which are browsers, reflecting the common method of spread via blowflies -
MHJ
William Mabasa, spokesman for South African National Parks, said in a
statement today that although the disease is invariably fatal, "History has
shown that anthrax functions as a natural population control mechanism in
wildlife, with minimal risk of species extinction." The disease is more
difficult to control in free ranging wildlife than in cattle because to
vaccinate these animals efficiently requires the use of helicopters and
remote injection darting techniques, which are immensely expensive, Mabasa
said. But some rare species are being vaccinated, he said.
Park residents and tourists visiting the Kruger National Park and adjoining
Lowveld Reserves are not at risk unless they handle or eat meat from an
infected carcass.
Mabasa said "The outbreak is currently limited to a relatively small area,
and much larger outbreaks have been experienced and weathered in the past,"
he said. The Kruger National Park has experienced major epidemics of this
disease in the early
sixties, early seventies and again in the early nineties.
Officials are asking that people report any sudden deaths in domestic or
wild animals to their nearest state veterinarian, private veterinarian or
animal health technician.

[Research by Kimothy Smith and the KNP staff shows that the risk of dying
from anthrax in the KNP is closely tied to the strain of _B. anthracis_
involved - MHJ
