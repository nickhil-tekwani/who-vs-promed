Virus That Affected Canyon Rafters Linked to Sewage Plant
-----------------------------------------------
A virus blamed for making more than 130 Grand Canyon rafters and hikers
sick this summer has been found in water flowing into the Colorado River
from the sewage treatment plant inside Glen Canyon Dam. Reports of the
[outbreak among] canyon rafters began in June 2002. The victims reported
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A virus was identified as the cause, and
health officials began testing for the virus at several points along the
river. Preliminary findings from an outbreak investigation report released
on Wed 30 Oct 2002 attributed the illness to Norwalk virus infection.
"We looked at genetic material in a river water sample from Lee's Ferry and
a sample of water emitted from the sewage treatment plant that serves the
visitor center at the dam, and both tested positive for Norwalk virus,"
Chuck Higgins, regional public health consultant for the National Park
Service in Denver, told The Salt Lake Tribune. "Recent work indicates
Norwalk virus may be somewhat resistant to chlorine, and if we find Norwalk
virus is surviving standard sewage treatment, that could have national
implications," he said.
Researchers from the Park Service, Centers for Disease Control, and the
State of Arizona are breaking down the genetic code of the virus strains
found in the river and in the treated wastewater to see if they match. The
outbreak affected river runners on at least 17 river trips. All infected
runners used river water as their primary drinking water source, treating
it with on-board filtration devices. Most cleaned their water filters on a
daily basis, indicating filters may be contaminated by the virus when
handled by infected staff or passengers.
Grand Canyon National Park officials will meet with commercial river guides
on Sat 2 Nov 2002 to discuss the report and emphasize the need for enhanced
water purification and hygiene practices. Park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge
said an educational program also is planned for non-commercial float trips.
"Because this virus has no other animal hosts than people, we probably have
a good chance of finding the source and eliminating it," said Higgins. "But
this is a big, long, open body of water and we are now developing a
research agenda. There's probably 12 dissertations here."

Chlorine-resistant Virus Affects More Than 130 Grand Canyon Visitors
-------------------------------------------------
A virus blamed for making more than 130 Grand Canyon rafters and hikers
sick this summer has been found in water flowing into the Colorado River
from the sewage treatment plant inside Glen Canyon Dam. Reports of the
canyon illness began in June 2002. The victims reported nausea, vomiting
and diarrhea. A virus was identified as the cause, and health officials
began testing at several points along the river. Preliminary findings from
an outbreak investigation report released Wednesday attributed the illness
to Norwalk virus. "We looked at genetic material in a river water sample
from Lee's Ferry and a sample of water emitted from the sewage treatment

the National Park Service in Denver, told The Salt Lake Tribune. "Recent
work indicates Norwalk virus may be somewhat resistant to chlorine, and if
we find Norwalk virus is surviving standard sewage treatment, that could
have national implications," he said.
The Colorado River supplies Lake Mead, which is Southern Nevada's primary
drinking water source. But officials for the Southern Nevada Water
Authority said on Thu 31 Oct 2002 that no microbes like the Norwalk virus
have been found in the drinking water during the authority's ongoing viral
monitoring program. "That is what we'd expect, because the combination of
filtration and disinfection we use to treat drinking water provides a very
strong barrier against viruses," said J.C. Davis, a spokesman for the
Southern Nevada Water Authority. "When our ozone facilities come on line
next year, that barrier will be even stronger," he said, referring to a
state-of-the-art treatment system the agency is installing for Lake Mead
water. Researchers from the Park Service, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, and the state of Arizona are breaking down the genetic code
of the viral strains found in the river and in the treated wastewater to
see if they match.
Grand Canyon National Park officials will meet with commercial river guides
on Saturday to discuss the report and emphasize the need for enhanced water
