Since 1 Jul 2012, 10 infections with bacteria of the _Vibrio_ genus (also called vibriosis) have been reported to Maine CDC; 4 in Maine residents and 6 in out of state residents. In 2011, only 4 cases were reported, all in Maine residents. The majority of vibriosis infections reported in Maine occur in the summer months. 7 of the 10 vibriosis infections reported in Maine in 2012 were laboratory-confirmed _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, one was _Vibrio fluvialis_, one was _Grimontia hollisae_ (formerly _Vibrio hollisae_), and one is pending speciation. The median age of ill individuals is 70 years. All patients reported consuming some type of seafood during their exposure period. All cases are considered sporadic and not linked at this time. Multiple state agencies are involved in the investigation.

Individuals with immune-compromising conditions, liver disease, decreased gastric acidity, peptic ulcers, and diabetes are more likely to become ill with vibriosis. Symptoms of vibriosis include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever, and headache. High fever, bloody stools, and high white blood cell count may occur in _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infections. Persons become symptomatic approximately 4-96 hours after exposure. Common exposures include consumption of raw oysters, clams or other seafood, and exposure of open cuts or wounds to salt water.

Many laboratories in the state do not routinely test for _Vibrio_ species on stool cultures. Testing can be performed on stool, blood, or wound cultures. All isolates of _Vibrio_ species from clinical specimens must be sent to the state Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory (HETL) for confirmation.

Clinicians are encouraged to order testing for _Vibrio_ species for patients with compatible illness and history of the following during the 4-96 hours prior to the onset of illness:
- consumption of seafood,
- exposure of open cuts or wounds to salt water.

Prevention:
- thoroughly cook all meat, fish, and shellfish;
- avoid exposing open wounds to warm seawater;
- avoid consuming raw seafood, especially if you have an immune-compromising condition;
- use separate cutting boards for raw meats, fish, shellfish, and other food products
- refrigerate meats, fish, shellfish, and produce at appropriate temperatures (40 deg F [4 deg C] for refrigerators and 0 deg F [-18 deg C] for freezers);
- keep foods that will be eaten raw, such as fruits and vegetables, away from food products from animals.

[The trend of increasing number of _Vibrio_ infections acquired from seafood obtained from the usually cooler ocean waters of the northern USA and Canada is a reflection of the phenomenon of global warming. Since 6 of the 10 infections occurred in non-Mainers visiting the state, it is important to note travel to the state as a pertinent piece of history for suspecting vibriosis. - Mod.LL
