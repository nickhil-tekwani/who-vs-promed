A total of 16 students who ate the cake cut for their friends who were transferred to another secondary school in the Ereğli district of Zonguldak, were treated at the hospital on suspicion of food poisoning.

In Kepez İzmirlioğulları Secondary School in Ereğli district, a cake was cut for the student who was allegedly transferred to another school. Some students who ate the cake became ill. Upon the notification of the school management and teachers, 16 students were taken to hospitals in the district by ambulances. It was stated that the health status of the students who were treated with the suspicion of food poisoning was good.

[Knowing the incubation period between ingestion of the cake, which is thought to be the vehicle for transmission of the illnesses here, and the onset of illness can be useful in establishing a diagnosis, as is whether fever was present and what gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and/or diarrhea) were prominent. Most infectious etiologies would be minimized by the baking of the cake but icing of the cake afterward is a risk factor. - Mod.LL
