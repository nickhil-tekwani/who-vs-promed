Swine flu deaths increase after onset of monsoon
------------------------------------------------
Swine flu [influenza pandemic (H1N1) virus infection] deaths continued
their upwards surge since the onset of monsoon with 17 fatalities reported
due to the disease in the country since 21 Jun 2010, the largest numbers of
which occurred in Kerala and Maharashtra. Both the states reported 7 deaths
each while Andhra Pradesh reported 2 and Uttar Pradesh one, health ministry
officials said today.

All 345 cases reported during the week are indigenous cases. Up to the
present, samples from 143 285 people have been tested for influenza H1N1
[virus infection] and 33 083 (23 per cent) of them have been found positive.

With the new cases, the swine flu toll in Kerala since the monsoon hit the
state has risen to 32. Kerala reported 16 deaths from 15 May to 15 Jun
2010, prompting the Central government to send a 3-member team to the state
to assess the situation.

[The monsoon period in India extends from June to September. It is likely
that the severe climatic conditions of the monsoon may exacerbate many
infectious and non-infectious diseases. For instance it was reported in
ProMED-mail recently that an upsurge in the incidence of rabies virus
infections was to be expected during the monsoon period (see: Rabies,
animal, human - India: (HR) 20100629.2164).
