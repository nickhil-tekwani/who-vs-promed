With reports of rabies deaths occurring weekly in north Andhra
Pradesh, a closer look at the data has revealed the cause of the
transmission of the killer virus: chronic dumping, or "translocation",
of dogs outside their city limits by municipalities throughout the
region.

The regional districts and municipalities of north Andhra, who refuse
to implement dog sterilization and canine anti-rabies vaccination
programs, are instead engaging in dog displacement in an ill-fated
attempt to respond to complaints by the public. Dog displacement
involves the catching, transport, and dumping of dogs either elsewhere
in the city, or outside the city in rural areas or forests. Such dogs
migrate to the nearest populated areas in search of food.
Municipalities themselves admit to dog dumping, as in a report in The
Hindu dated 28 May 2011 ("Complaints of dog menace worry officials")
in which Vijayawada Municipal Corporation officials confess to dumping
dogs as far as 40 km [25 mi] away from the city.

An examination of the geography of the human rabies deaths and
suspected rabid animal bites reported in the crisis thus far
(Hyderabad, Kamareddi - north of Hyderabad, Khammam - halfway between
Hyderabad and Rajahmundry, Vijayawada, Guntur, Eluru, Rajahmundry,
Kakinada, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, and up into the hills to Araku)
reveals these locations to be further away from each other than is
conceivable for dogs to travel in their normal daily migrations. An
average street dog may travel approximately 8 km [5 mi] in a day, but
that is back and forth in the same area in search of food. The rabies
virus does not materialize out of thin air; it is spread through the
saliva of infected animals, principally through bites. Transmission
requires the presence of infected animals. Infected animals are
getting to these new places because municipalities are taking them
there.

Rabies symptoms in dogs may not appear for a period of up to 2 months
[following their contact/infection], so dogs caught by municipal
catchers in response to public complaints may appear to be perfectly
healthy. The problem arises when these dogs, who may in fact be
carriers of rabies, are dumped elsewhere. It occurs regularly in the
cities and towns of Andhra Pradesh, and it amounts to the active
export and transmission of rabies to new locations by the
municipalities and districts themselves.

Expert studies on rabies have established that "Any actions that
cause instability in the dog population encourage an increase in the
transmission of rabies" (Reece & Chawla 2006, Blancou 1988, Beran
1991). Chronic [?] dog displacement is an example of one such action.
It destabilizes the dog population because when dogs are removed from
an area, more dogs will always migrate into the vacated space, and
very quickly. Because they are new to the area and unsettled, they
often fight among themselves for dominance of the turf. These fearful,
unsettled dogs are much more likely to bite local residents than dogs
who have lived in the area for some time, and people are much more
likely to get bitten in the crossfire as these dogs battle between
themselves for dominance. The practice of removing and displacing dogs
not only increases the risk of dog bite to residents, but the spread
of rabies as well.

Dr Lisa Warden, managing director of ABC India, states:
"Municipalities have got to realize that by displacing dogs to other
areas, they are actually facilitating the spread of the rabies virus
and making the problem worse. It is absolutely crucial to refrain from
such practices, and to implement immediate, mass scale anti-rabies
vaccination of all dogs in the rabies-affected areas, and then leave
the vaccinated dogs in place. A stable population of vaccinated dogs
is one of the best defenses against rabies in rabies-endemic locations
as they keep new, possibly unvaccinated, potentially rabid dogs out of
their areas." ABC India last week [week of 23 May 2011] began an
emergency response anti-rabies drive in Rajahmundry, the scene of the
highest number of human rabies deaths in the crisis thus far. ABC
India is expanding the drive to other cities of north Andhra Pradesh
this week.
