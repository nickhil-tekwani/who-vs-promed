The Ministry of Education was present this morning [26 Sep 2014] in Charata to personally supervise interventions carried out by the public hospital and the Regional Educational Directorate 4, given the unconfirmed probability of cases suspected of [a] hantavirus infection in the Tres Estacas locality.

The head of the Chaco educational department, together with Maria del Rosario Oliva, Director of the Enrique V de Llamas Charata Hospital, stated this Thu 24 Sep 2014 that as a preventive measure the intervention in schools [nos.] 177 and 399 of the Tres Estacas locality, Charata jurisdiction, [was being carried out] in order to guarantee the correct application of the protocol of the Ministry of Public Health through their Office of Epidemiology headed by Betina Irigoyen, given the probability of any cases of said serious acute viral disease [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome].

In this context, Soto indicated that even if the situation did not occur in any of the educational institutions, immediate preventive actions were taken to resolve the situation.

For her part, the Director of the Hospital provided the preventive measures which must be taken to reduce the risk of infectious foci. They are: avoid contact with rodents and their excreta, take preventive measures in carrying out risky activities within and outside of houses. The greatest danger is produced with removal of garbage, trash, raising dust and others that might be contaminated with feces, urine, or saliva of infected mice.

Thus, the provincial authorities have brought calm to the educational community of the locality. Also, Soto stated that the Minister of Public Health, Jaime Parra Moreno, and the Director of Epidemiology will also visit Charata today to carry out follow up of the operation to control the foci. Also, the President of the Charata Municipal Council, Rolando Obligado, and Councilwoman Maria Luisa Chomiak were fully informed of the situation.

[There is little specific information about these suspected cases, making an assessment of the occurrence and risk of hantavirus infections difficult. In any event, apparently there are suspected cases so the activities to assess risk of infection and implementation of preventive actions is wise.

Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 2 years (2012, 2013). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but Oran virus seems like a good possibility.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Oran hantavirus, can be seen at http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1260.jpeg.
