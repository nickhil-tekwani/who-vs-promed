I was most interested in the comments that were attributed to me by the New
Scientist, as reported in the ProMED-mail post of Sat 6 May 2006 -- "Tahyna
virus, surveillance - EU 20060506.1312." Please, may I correct some of the
misinformation presumably contained in the article by New Scientist.
Firstly, I am not a Professor of Oxford University [Professor Gould is
attached to the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), Centre for
Ecology and Hydrology, Oxford, UK].
Secondly, I am not aware of anyone from New Scientist approaching me for a
quotation of any sort at all.
Thirdly, I am not: "Engaged in a study commissioned by the British
government on the risk of insect-borne and other arthropod-borne viruses
emerging in Britain" (quoting from the ProMED-mail report of what appeared
in New Scientist).
Fourthly, I can only assume that someone at New Scientist has read the
review published in Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) (April 2006 - Gould,
et al) and selected the words that suit their desire to mis-inform the
general public and other scientists.
I re-emphasise, I do not recall anyone from New Scientist asking me about
the review in EID or discussing anything with me before they published
their article. Any figures concerning encephalitis in the UK that appeared
in my review were of course taken from peer-reviewed publications --
already available and well-known amongst virologists.

[ProMED-mail regrets contributing to spread of misinformation. The review
referred to by Dr Gould is published in the April issue of the journal
Emerging Infectious Diseases and is entitled: "Potential Arbovirus
Emergence and Implications for the United Kingdom"
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no04/05-1010.htm>). The authors of the
review are: Ernest Andrew Gould,* Stephen Higgs,� Alan Buckley,* and Tamara
Sergeevna Gritsun* at the *Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Oxford, Oxford,
United Kingdom; and �University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA.
The abstract of the paper reads as follows: "Arboviruses have evolved a
number of strategies to survive environmental challenges. This review
examines the factors that may determine arbovirus emergence, provides
examples of arboviruses that have emerged into new habitats, reviews the
arbovirus situation in western Europe in detail, discusses potential
arthropod vectors, and attempts to predict the risk for arbovirus emergence
in the United Kingdom. We conclude that climate change is probably the most
important requirement for the emergence of arthropod-borne diseases such as
dengue fever, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis,
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, bluetongue, and African horse sickness in
the United Kingdom. While other arboviruses, such as West Nile virus,
Sindbis virus, Tahyna virus, and Louping ill virus, apparently circulate in
the United Kingdom, they do not appear to present an imminent threat to
humans or animals." - Mod.CP]

Tahyna virus was first isolated in the Slovakian village of Tahyna in 1958.
The principal vector is _Aedes vexans_; with additional transmission by
_Ae. cantans_, _Ae. caspius_, _Ae. cinereus_, _Anopheles hyrcanus_, _An.
maculipennis_, _Culex modestus_, _Cx. pipiens_ and _Culiseta annulata_.
Austria:
--------
Tahyna virus has been isolated from mosquitoes (_Aedes caspius_) on the
eastern shore of Lake Neusied. Antibodies against Tahyna virus have been
documented among wild and domestic mammals in the eastern Neusiedlersee area.
Croatia:
--------
Seropositivity toward Tahyna virus is found among wild bears (_Ursus arctos_).
Czech Republic:
---------------
Evidence for Tahyna virus infection has been demonstrated in the Czech
Republic including midges and humans in West Bohemia; and in humans and
cormorants in Moravia. Following floods in 2000, 16 per cent of persons in
the Melnik region were found to be seropositive toward Tahyna virus. Tahnya
virus was isolated from mosquitoes (_Ae. vexans_ and _Ae. cinereus_) in
Moravia in 1997; and again (_Ae. vexans_) in 1999. Seroprevalence toward
Tahyna (Batai) virus has been demonstrated in wild animals.
France:
-------
Tahyna virus has been identified in mosquitoes (_Culex modestus_) in
France. During 1975 to 1979, antibody toward Tahyna virus was found in 31
per cent of humans and 9 percent of horses in the region of Camargue.
Germany:
--------
Tahyna virus has been isolated from domestic animals in the former East
Germany; and from _Aedes vexans_ in Upper Rhine area near Germersheim (Isle
Grun).
Italy:
------
Seropositivity toward Tahyna virus has been demonstrated in small mammals.
Tahyna virus has been isolated from _Aedes_ mosquitoes in Northern Italy
(Gorizia Province).
Macedonia:
----------
Seropositivity toward Tahyna virus is found among wild bears (_Ursus arctos_).
Morocco [of interest by contiguity to Spain]:
---------------------------------------------
21 per cent of small mammals surveyed in 1979 were found to be seropositive
toward Tahyna virus.
Norway:
-------
Viruses related or identical to Tahnya virus have been isolated from
mosquito species (_Aedes sticticus_, _Ae. diantaeus_ and _Ae. hexodontus_)
collected from Oyern, Trandum and Masi.
Poland:
-------
Antibodies to Tahnya virus have been detected in house sparrows (_Passer
domesticus_) and tree sparrows (_P. montanus_) in central Poland.
Romania:
--------
Seropositivity toward Tahyna virus has been demonstrated in humans.
Russian Federation:
-------------------
Tahyna, Inkoo, and other variants are present. Rates are highest in summer
and in persons below age 30. Over 100 human infections were documented
during 1985 to 1990. Highest risk exists in western Siberia (Ryazan region,
Sverdlovsk). Seropositivity is documented among humans in Irkutsk. 40 per
cent of healthy blood donors, and 4 to 14 per cent of febrile patients with
neurological signs in the Ryazan region were seropositive to Tahyna or
Inkoo viruses in 1991. Mosquito infection rates (1983 to 1991) vary: 0.009
per cent (tundra), 0.012 per cent (forest-tundra), 0.01 per cent (northern
taiga), 0.02 per cent (central taiga), 0.017 per cent (southern taiga),
0.026 per cent (forest steppe), 0.097 per cent (steppe). Vectors include
_Aedes communis_, _A. excurians_, _A. cantans_, _A. flavescens_, _A.
ciprius_, _A. punctor,_ _A. vexans_, _A. (Ochlerotatus) cataphylla_, _A.
nigripes_, _A. hexodontus_, _Oclerotatus impiger _(Sakhalin Island) and _O.
communis (Kalinin region).
Serbia and Montenegro:
----------------------
Human infection by Tahyna virus has been reported. Seropositivity toward
this agent is found among wild animals.
Slovakia:
---------
Seropositive birds and sheep are reported. Natural infection of mosquitoes
(_Aedes vexans_) and midges (_Ceratopogonidae_) has been identified.
Spain:
------
Seropositivity toward Tahyna virus has been demonstrated in small mammals.
Tajikistan:
-----------
Tahyna virus has been identified in the blood of febrile patients, and in
mosquitoes collected in Dushanbe.
