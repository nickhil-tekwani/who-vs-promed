Outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 Infection in Spain
----------------------------------------------
So far, a total of 181 cases have been reported in the largest outbreak of
_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infection yet identified in Spain. The cases are
150 schoolchildren at 4 schools in Barcelona and 31 household contacts.
Cases became ill between 19 Sept and 5 Nov 2000.
Though 6 children developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), all recovered.
The attack rates in the 4 affected schools ranged from 4 to 56 percent.
Preliminary enquiries suggested that the vehicle of infection was sausage
served by a catering company on 18 Sep 2000. The catering company supplied
10 schools, one factory, and a home for elderly people.
Cases arose at schools where the sausages were not heated; at the remaining
schools the sausages had been heated. Inspection of the catering company
identified irregularities and the company was closed down. No food samples
were investigated. _E. coli_ O157:H7 was isolated from 27 cases, and 8
isolates were shown to be phage type 2.
This is the seventh outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 infection to have been
reported to the National Centre of Epidemiology in Spain since 1989. The
next largest affected tourists from several countries who had visited the
Canary Islands in 1997 (1). 14 cases were confirmed in tourists, and 3
developed HUS.
In Spain, surveillance of _E. coli_ O157 infection is undertaken by the
Microbiological Information System (SIM), a voluntary laboratory-based
system, and by the National Reference Laboratory, which contributes to
Enter-net. _E. coli_ O157 infection is not a statutorily notifiable disease
in Spain, but it is obligatory to notify all outbreaks. In the past 10
years, only 41 and 12 cases have been reported to these surveillance
systems, respectively (2).
