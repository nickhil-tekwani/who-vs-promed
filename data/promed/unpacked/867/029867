Background data on botulism in Denmark and Germany
-------------------------------------------
Denmark: 4 outbreaks (7 cases, one fatal) of botulism occurred on the Faroe
Islands during 1987 to 1989 and were traced to dried mutton. Only 3 cases of
botulism were reported during 1990 to 2001: 2 in 1995 and one in 1998.
Germany: The annual incidence of botulism varied from 15 to 29 cases during
the 1980's, and 4 to 23 cases during the 1990's [rates 0.01/100 000 to
0.03/100 000].

It is worth noting that garlic has been implicated in at least 2 prior
outbreaks of botulism. These were an outbreak in which there were 3 cases as
a result of the ingestion of garlic bread that was made with garlic-in-oil
(1) and a large outbreak of 36 cases due to chopped garlic-in-oil (2).

[It is interesting that the garlic has been implicated in the Danish cases,
because it was preserved in chili-oil, & chili was the culprit in Texas in
2001 -- see ref. below. So how can they be sure the toxin wasn't in the
chili-oil? - Mod.JW]
