Foot-and-mouth disease reappears
--------------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been found in 4 cows after close
examinations geared toward wrapping up various measures against the
highly-contagious disease, which has plagued the country since early
April [2010].

The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MIFAFF)
said Tuesday [1 Jun 2010] that it found 4 infected cows in a farm in
Cheongyang, South Chungcheong Province. The ministry decided to cull
all 54 cows at the farm, which is 6.5 kilometers [approx. 4 miles]
away from the Livestock and Veterinary Research Institute where
infected cases were discovered last month.

The MIFAFF checked 5763 cows in 1538 farms across the country to see
if it could wind up anti-FMD measures because no outbreak had been
detected for over 3 weeks since 8 May 2010. The ministry said if
additional cases are not found, it will lift the ban on the transfer
of animals soon.

The fatal disease affects cloven-hoofed animals, mostly domesticated
ones such as cattle, goats, pigs, deer or sheep. The hitch is that
vaccination is difficult because the virus continually evolves and
mutates. [An arguable issue. - Mod.AS]

Due to the disease, the Seoul administration has destroyed about 50
000 animals this year.

[South Korea has recorded 11 outbreaks of FMD, serotype O, between
mid-April and the 1st semester of May 2010: 8 in the north-western
province Inchon-Jikhalsi (summary with map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9126>),
and 3 outbreaks in the centre-west, of which one in the province
Chungcheong-Bukdo and 2 on the west in Chungcheong-Namdo (summary with
map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9166>).

The current outbreak, not yet reported to the OIE, is the 3rd one in
Chungcheong-Namdo. The previous outbreak in this province started on 6
May 2010.

The 3 affected provinces can be seen in the political map

Early identification of the disease, followed by meticulous
application of stamping-out policy and strict quarantine measures,
contributed to the successful control of the outbreak. The virus is
genetically similar to recent isolates from China (Hong Kong) and
Japan. Japan has been less fortunate, mainly due to the several weeks
delay in the initial detection of the disease.
