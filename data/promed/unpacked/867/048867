["Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a poxvirus disease of cattle characterised by fever; nodules on the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs; emaciation; enlarged lymph nodes; oedema of the skin; and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides, and, occasionally, death. Various strains of capripoxvirus are responsible for the disease.

"These are antigenically indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox yet distinct at the genetic level. LSD has a partially different geographical distribution from sheep and goat pox, suggesting that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between sheep and goats.

"Transmission of LSD virus (LSDV) is thought to be predominantly by arthropods, natural contact transmission in the absence of vectors being inefficient. Lumpy skin disease is endemic in most African and Middle Eastern countries. Between 2012 and 2018, LSD spread into southeast Europe, the Balkans, and the Caucasus as part of the Eurasian LSD epidemic."

"LSDV is not transmissible to humans. However, all laboratory manipulations must be performed at an appropriate containment level determined using biorisk analysis."

Abstract:
---------
"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a viral transboundary disease endemic throughout Africa and of high economic importance that affects cattle and domestic water buffaloes. Since 2012, the disease has spread rapidly and widely throughout the Middle Eastern and Balkan regions, southern Caucasus, and parts of the Russian Federation. Before vaccination campaigns took their full effect, the disease continued spreading from region to region, mainly showing seasonal patterns despite implementing control and eradication measures. The disease is capable of appearing several hundred kilometers away from initial (focal) outbreak sites within a short time period. These incursions have triggered a long-awaited renewed scientific interest in LSD resulting in the initiation of novel research into broad aspects of the disease, including epidemiology, modes of transmission, and associated risk factors. Long-distance dispersal of LSDV seems to occur via the movement of infected animals, but distinct seasonal patterns indicate that arthropod-borne transmission is most likely responsible for the swift and aggressive short-distance spread of the disease. Elucidating the mechanisms of transmission of LSDV will enable the development of more targeted and effective actions for containment and eradication of the virus. The mode of vector-borne transmission of the disease is most likely mechanical, but there is no clear-cut evidence to confirm or disprove this assumption. To date, the most likely vectors for LSDV transmission are blood-sucking arthropods such as stable flies (_Stomoxys calcitrans_), mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_), and hard ticks (_Rhipicephalus_ and _Amblyomma_ species). New evidence suggests that the ubiquitous, synanthropic house fly, _Musca domestica_, may also play a role in LSDV transmission, but this has not yet been tested in a clinical setting. The aim of this review is to compile and discuss the earlier as well as the most recent research data on the transmission of LSDV". - Mod.CRD]
