SUMMARY -- as of 9 Aug 2015

There were 3 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 9 August: 2 in Guinea and 1 in Sierra Leone. The total number of confirmed cases for the previous week (week to 2 Aug 2015) has been revised up from 2 to 3, after 1 confirmed case from Tonkolili in Sierra Leone was added retrospectively. Case incidence has been below 10 confirmed cases per week for 3 consecutive weeks, but there remains a significant risk of further transmission and an increase in case incidence in the near and medium term. Only 1 of the 3 cases reported in the week to 9 Aug 2015 was a registered contact, but was lost to follow-up and has generated multiple high-risk contacts in several health facilities in Conakry. The detection by post-mortem testing of a confirmed case with a possible link to an unsafe burial in the Moussayah sub-prefecture of Forecariah, Guinea, suggests that transmission may have gone undetected in the community. In addition, a new confirmed case in the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown has generated a number of high-risk contacts. Over 1600 contacts remain under observation across 4 prefectures in Guinea and 2 districts in Sierra Leone; compared with over 1800 contacts across 5 prefectures and 4 districts in the previous week.

Of the 2 confirmed cases reported from Guinea in the week to 9 Aug 2015, 1 arose from an unknown source of infection and 1 was a registered contact who was lost to follow-up. The case reported from Forecariah was identified after post-mortem testing of a community death in the sub-prefecture of Moussayah. Preliminary investigations suggest that the case is linked to attendance of the unsafe burial of a family member who is thought to have died with symptoms compatible with EVD. The other case was reported from the Ratoma area of the capital, Conakry. The case is a registered contact of a known chain of transmission, but was lost to follow-up, and visited several health facilities throughout Conakry whilst symptomatic before being identified as EVD-positive. Many of the high-risk contacts identified in association with the case are health workers. 927 contacts remain under follow-up in 4 western prefectures in Guinea, compared with 1080 in 5 prefectures the previous week. Over half (55 percent) of all contacts are located in Forecariah, with 40 percent located in Conakry.

No new cases were reported from Liberia in the week to 9 Aug 2015. All contacts in Liberia have now completed their 21-day follow-up period. The last 2 patients with EVD in Liberia were discharged after completing treatment and testing negative for EVD for a 2nd time on 23 Jul 2015. The single confirmed case in Sierra Leone was reported from Freetown (Western Area Urban) and is linked to a branch of the Western Area Urban chain of transmission. The case is an 8-month-old female who had onset of symptoms on 4 Aug 2015, and who was admitted to Ola During Children's Hospital in Freetown on 6 Aug 2015 with fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea. A total of 29 high-risk contacts have been identified so far, 24 of whom are currently in voluntary quarantine. A total of 694 contacts remain under follow-up in Sierra Leone, compared with 811 the previous week. The vast majority of contacts, 638, are located in Tonkolili (associated with the case reported in the week ending 26 Jul 2015), with the remaining 56 located in Freetown.

For the 2nd consecutive week no health worker infections were reported from any of the affected countries. There have been a total of 880 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 512 reported deaths.

COUNTRIES WITH WIDESPREAD AND INTENSE TRANSMISSION

There have been a total of 27 929 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 9 Aug 2015, with 11 283 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). 2 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea and 1 in Sierra Leone in the week to 9 Aug 2015.
The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 9 Aug 2015. Since the start of the outbreak a total of 880 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 512 reported deaths (table 5).

[2] WHO: training health staff for Ebola
Date: 11 Aug 2015
Source: WHO [edited]
http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/training/en


Since August 2014, WHO has trained 7000 national & international health workers before they have been deployed.

Responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is a challenging task for the hundreds of thousands of national and international response personnel. Effective and timely training helps ensure that personnel on the ground have the ability to treat EVD patients and prevent further transmission. All personnel need to be able to work safely and effectively in dangerous conditions.

This website provides information, resource and updates on the training work carried out by WHO and its many national and international partners on the ground who are battling Ebola.

"GO" training
------------
"GO" training is a comprehensive package of modular pre-deployment training materials for WHO staff, consultants and partners deployed for the Ebola outbreak response in West Africa.

http://qz.com/476246/even-after-surviving-ebola-people-still-remain-very-sick-for-months-afterwards/
[According to the National Institute of Health, The long-term effects of Ebola include vision problems, immune system changes, mental disorders, joint pain; diabetes; hypertension, and pregnancy complications. Studies are under way to observe the progress of such symptoms.
The health consequences can lead to economic distress; Ebola-stricken communities often have disabled people who cannot return to work. Information is also limited about how long Ebola lingers as a sexually transmitted disease, and whether women who survive Ebola suffer complications during pregnancy. Representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), also noted the high risk of mental health consequences, both for those who contracted the disease and those who saw it affect others]

Therefore, in a collaboration with the Social Enterprise for Development Foundation (SEND), they have identified challenges which could undermine their capacity to prevent a recurrence. Therefore, with funds provided by the Department for International Development's Emergency Ebola Response Fund, through Welt Hunger Hilfe, SEND facilitated drafting of the Kailahun Remote Villages Ebola Prevention Project plan, targeting 32 border crossing points.]

In December 2015, it shipped 7000 from Sierra Leone to the United States (see Nature http://doi.org/6jm; 2014). However, the agency has come under fire recently for major lapses in biosecurity (see Nature http://doi.org/6jn; 2015), and raised this among a number of potential hurdles to creating a biobank]

12 Aug 2015 Liberia: In US Ebola response empty ETUs to expend over USD 5 million
http://allafrica.com/stories/201508120989.html
[Behind the Ganta Methodist Hospital sits an Ebola Treatment Unit which is considered state of the art by experts -- but since its opening in January 2015, the center has not had any confirmed Ebola patients. With no Ebola patients, the center operated by Project Concern International (PCI) has exhausted almost 60 per cent of the USD 5.6 million provided by the US government for its operation. Critics charge that millions of dollars spent by an Ebola treatment center that never had an Ebola patient is unjustifiable, but PCI argues, in an interview with FrontPageAfrica, that though it wasn't receiving Ebola patients, it used the money to strengthen surveillance in Nimba County, and the organization suggests that this intervention could explain why the county remains stable in the Ebola fight thus far reporting zero new cases.]
