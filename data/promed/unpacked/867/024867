SEROLOGIC DIAGNOSIS, STANDARDS: COMMENT
***************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Ross River virus - Australia (NSW) (02) 980112172830]

From: Edwin Lennette <LENNETTE@publichealth.org>

I concur with [this Moderator's] comments on the ProMED-mail posting about
Ross River virus infections in New South Wales. For more than fifty years I
have been preaching, and in my writings and books emphasizing, the bases on
which a laboratory diagnosis is serologically established, i.e., the need
to demonstrate a rise (or fall) in antibody titer. Diagnosis based on a
single specimen of serum is perilous and, as you point out, at best is
"presumptive".
It is disheartening (and frustrating) to see that this is still
unappreciated or misunderstood.
