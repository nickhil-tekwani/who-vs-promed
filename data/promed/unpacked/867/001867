First Report of Powdery Mildew of Greenhouse Pepper Caused by _Leveillula
taurica_ in British Columbia, Canada.
R. F. Cerkauskas, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Greenhouse and
Processing Crops Research Centre, Harrow, Ontario, N0R 1G0, Canada; and A.
Buonassisi, British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries,
Abbotsford Agriculture Centre, 1767 Angus Campbell Road, Abbotsford BC V3G
2M3, Canada. Plant Dis. 87:1151, 2003; published on-line as
D-2003-0722-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 30 Jun 2003.
In 2003, powdery mildew of greenhouse pepper (_Capsicum annuum_L.) was
reported simultaneously in 2 commercial greenhouses at 2 separate locations
near Langley in southern British Columbia. Trace amounts of mildew on the
foliage of cv. Zamboni in one operation, and 10-80 percent of the foliage
of cv. Triple Four was affected in an organic operation, with losses in
fruit yield of 2-4 kg per square meter, were noted. The greenhouse pepper
industry in British Columbia in 2001 comprised 76 ha with sales of $41.3
million (Canadian).
Affected areas appeared as a white, powdery coating on the abaxial leaf
surface of older foliage, while diffuse chlorotic spots were present at
corresponding locations on the adaxial surface. In some cases, pale yellow
spots appeared on the adaxial portion of the affected foliage during later
stages of disease development (2).
Hyaline, single-celled pyriform and cylindrical conidia were present in
40:60 proportion, respectively. Both conidia had a network of crests and
granules sometimes with tiny thorn-like projections on the surface. These
projections were evident also on the lower half of conidiophores.
Pyriform conidia ranged in length from 53.8 to 79.5 micrometers (mean =
68.0, SE = 0.8), and in width from 12.9 to 28.0 micrometers (mean = 20.1,
SE = 0.6, n = 50) with a mean length to width ratio of 3.5. Cylindrical
conidia had a length from 48.2 to 84.0 micrometers (mean = 66.0, SE = 0.9),
and in width from 13.4 to 25.2 micrometers (mean = 18.6, SE = 0.4, n = 50)
with a mean length to width ratio of 3.6.
Short conidial chains borne on conidiophores consisted of a basal pyriform
conidium followed by cylindrical conidium. No cleistothecia were observed.
Stomatal penetration and extensive endophytic mycelial growth in the
mesophyll layer were evident in foliar tissue cleared with glacial acetic
acid/EtOH (1:2) and stained with lactophenol cotton blue.
To confirm pathogenicity, a suspension of [20 000] conidia/ml from infected
pepper leaves was applied onto the abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces of
60-, 42-, and 28-day-old greenhouse pepper cv. Cubico, tomato cv. Trust,
and cucumber cv. Corona, respectively. Plants were maintained in a growth
chamber at 25/21 deg C day/night temperature and 80 percent relative
humidity. Control plants in the same chamber were treated identically but
not inoculated.
After 21 days, inoculated pepper plants developed foliar powdery mildew
symptoms on the abaxial surface, including sporulation similar to that of
naturally infected plants. Occurrence of the fungus on the abaxial surface
of pepper foliage, presence of endophytic mycelium, and the morphological
characteristics of the imperfect state confirm the identity of the fungus (2).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of _Leveillula taurica_ (Lev.)
G. Arnaud on pepper in British Columbia. The disease was first reported in
Ontario, Canada in 1999 (1).

[_Leveillula taurica_ causes severe disease on pepper, aubergine, artichoke,
and other vegetables in glasshouse and field production. Disease management
involves use of fungicides. Bicarbonate solutions are also effective in
reducing damage to leaves. Unfortunately, cultivars vary in their disease
susceptibility. - Mod.DH]
