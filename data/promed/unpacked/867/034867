Community Transmission of Oseltamivir-Resistant A(H1N1)pdm09
Influenza
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[A preliminary account of the characterisaton of 25 of the 29
oseltamivir-resistant viruses described in this NEJM letter was posted
on ProMED-mail in August 2011, see: Influenza (50): Australia (NS)
H275Y mutation cluster 20110825.2594. - Mod.CP]

Oseltamivir-resistant pre-pandemic seasonal influenza A (H1N1) viruses
with a H275Y neuraminidase substitution spread globally in 2008,
reducing the effectiveness of oseltamivir. Although
oseltamivir-resistant pandemic 2009 A (H1N1) viruses, now known as
A(H1N1)pdm09, have been detected in persons receiving oseltamivir
treatment, they have been detected in less than one percent of
untreated patients in the community, and transmission has been
documented only in closed settings or settings involving close contact
with infected persons.

We identified sustained community transmission of
oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Australia.
Reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction-positive A(H1N1)pdm09
viruses were obtained from 182 patients in emergency departments,
intensive care units, and general practitioners' offices in the Hunter
New England region of New South Wales, Australia, between May and
August 2011.

Viruses were analyzed for oseltamivir resistance. A total of 29
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (16 percent) contained the H275Y neuraminidase
substitution responsible for oseltamivir resistance and all were
resistant to the adamantine class of antiviral agents. Culture was
attempted for all specimens and yielded 90 isolates, of which 15
contained the H275Y substitution. A fluorescence-based neuraminidase
inhibition assay of the H275Y isolates showed that the IC50 value (the
concentration of drug required to inhibit neuraminidase activity by 50
percent) was 513 times higher for oseltamivir and 80 times higher for
peramivir than the IC50 values associated with wild-type strains.
However, these isolates remained fully sensitive to zanamivir. The
frequency of H275Y variants was 4 in 50 viruses in June (8 percent),
20 in 85 viruses in July (24 percent), and 4 in 45 viruses in August
(9 percent). Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequence analysis (Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data accession numbers,
EPI334765-33 4790 and 335634-335637) showed that the resistant strains
were closely related (99.9 to 100 percent hemagglutinin nucleotide
similarity and 99.6 to 100 percent neuraminidase nucleotide
similarity), suggesting the spread of a single variant.

Most patients lived within a 50-km (31-mile) radius of Newcastle, the
7th largest city in Australia, and 3 patients lived 90, 150, and 490
km (56, 93, and 304 mi) away. Two genetically related strains were
detected elsewhere in the state, including in Sydney.

An ethics waiver was granted and authorized under the New South Wales
Public Health Act of 2010 for an urgent public health investigation.
Hospital records and interviews with patients and general
practitioners revealed that only one of the 29 patients with resistant
influenza had received oseltamivir before the influenza specimen
collection. The ages were similar among the 29 patients with
oseltamivir-resistant influenza (median, 31 years; range, 4 months to
62 years) and the 153 patients with sensitivity to oseltamivir
(median, 29 years; range, one month to 74 years). Five patients with
oseltamivir-resistant influenza were children younger than 5 years of
age. The resistant viruses remained antigenically similar to the
vaccine strain, including those from 3 patients who received the 2011
influenza vaccine. Four households had 2 affected patients each, and 2
other patients shared a short car journey. The remaining patients had
no known epidemiologic link with the other patients with
oseltamivir-resistant influenza described here.

As winter approaches in the Northern Hemisphere, it remains important
to ensure that A(H1N1)pdm09 strains from early in the season are
analyzed rapidly for any indication that this transmissible
oseltamivir-resistant variant has spread.
