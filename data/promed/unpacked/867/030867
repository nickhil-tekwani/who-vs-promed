[The report confirms that the A influenza outbreak on the "lone turkey farm" in Kerala, reported by the media on 22 Jan 2015 and published in ProMED-mail posting 20150126.3121257 (item 3), has since been serotyped H5N1. The said media report stated that "another type of bird flu has hit the lone turkey farm" and that "humans would not be infected by the strain"; both statements are now negated. HPAI H5N1 should be viewed as potentially zoonotic, with the required precautionary measures undertaken to prevent human infection.

The current outbreak has become the 5th HPAI H5N1 outbreak in poultry in the south Indian state Kerala, since the start of this epizootic on 20 Nov 2014. For the location of Kureepuzha see map at http://tinyurl.com/pg9eql7. - Mod.AS
