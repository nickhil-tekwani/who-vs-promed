From: Guido Sabatinelli (CDI-CD) <GUS@who.dk>

The available confirmed information concerning occurrence of indigenous
cases of malaria in Kyrgyzstan, are the following:
Dr Adambekova, Deputy Head of the State Dept. of San-Epid. Surveillance,
confirmed 4 cases of Malaria in Panphilov Rayon, Chuy Oblast, caused by
_Plasmodium vivax_.
It should be noted that one indigenus vivax malaria case was already
registered in 1996 in Kyrgyzstan and that sporadic malaria cases are
observed in other Central Asian Republics due to migration of Tajik
population and return home of "peace keeping forces" deployed in Tajikistan.
WHO EURO is assisting MoH of Kyrgyzstan (and of the other Newly Independent
States from Central Asia and Caucasus) to reinforce the surveillance system
and to undertake control measures where necessary.
I am available to provide further information and updating for interested
people. An extensive paper on the malaria situation in 51 countries of WHO
European Region has been prepared and will be available soon.
