9 new cases of infectious blood disease noted with 2 deaths
-----------------------------------------------------------
Barely a month after lowering the meningococcemia alert in Baguio, health
officials disclosed that the bacterial disease continues to hound the city.
In the Tue 22 Feb 2005 press briefing at the City Mayor's Office, officials
from the Baguio Health Department and the Department of Health reported 9
confirmed meningococcemia patients in Baguio from 24 Jan to 21 Feb 2005. Of
these, 2 patients, a 6 year old and a 67 year old male, already died.
Dr Ramoncito Navarro, medical specialist III of the National Epidemiology
Center, explained the lowering of the meningococcemia alert in Jan 2005 did
not mean the disease has been totally contained. "We have to understand
that the alert was lowered because the level of the occurrences during that
time declined. But it does not mean that we should be relaxed. It was
lowered because the 'worst' stage is over," Navarro stressed. "We should
understand that the disease is here to stay, and we expect sporadic cases
to occur," he added. Navarro also advised the public to remain vigilant and
practice good personal hygiene.
Meanwhile, Mayor Braulio Yaranon is confident that this development will
not threaten the influx of visitors expected to arrive this weekend for the
Panagbenga festival. "We don't see it as a threat. As we said, this disease
also occurs in other places."

More Maori succumb to meningococcal epidemic
--------------------------------------------
Maori children are more than 4 times likely to contract meningococcal B
than their pakeha [a Maori word used to refer to New Zealanders of
non-Maori and non-Polynesian heritage - Mod.LL] counterparts. Western Bay
of Plenty iwi Ngaiterangi and Ngati Ranginui have joined forces to raise
awareness about the killer disease meningococcal B and its new vaccine, MeNZB.
Project manager Kim Skinner of Ngati Ranginui says it's important for Maori
families to immunize their children because the risk against them is so
much higher. "Statistics show us one in 100 Maori children under the age of
5 will contract meningococcal B as opposed to one in 438 paheka children.
Because our tamariki [a Maori word for children - Mod.LL] are so much at
risk it's crucial for them to get their first MeNZB immunization immediately."
Skinner says some families in the Western Bay who are "sitting on the
fence" need to stop procrastinating and immunize their children. "It
confuses me when parents say they aren't going to vaccinate their child
because they've heard it hurts their arm. It's true most children will have
a bit of an achy arm for a couple of days after being vaccinated, but
surely that's preferable to getting meningococcal and possibly facing
losing the arm altogether, not to mention the threat of death or any other
permanent effects of the disease."
More than half a million vaccinations have now been administered throughout
the top half of the North Island. Not a single incident or serious side
effect has been reported from any of those immunized with MeNZB.
Skinner says while some families are holding off immunizing their children,
many Maori families in the Western Bay have already acknowledged the threat
of meningococcal [disease] and have made immunizing their children a priority.
"We are encouraged to hear from some local practices that Maori families
are enthusiastic and pro-active about getting the free MeNZB immunization.
They've taken the 1st step towards protecting their kids, now we can only
hope all parents and caregivers will be as responsible."

[The New Zealand type B meningococcal vaccine is a strain-specific outer
membrane vesicle product not available in the USA as yet. Such a biologic,
when combined with the newly licensed (in the USA) protein-conjugated
quadrivalent capsular meningococcal vaccine (for types A, C, Y, and W-135),
would be a large nail in the coffin for invasive meningococcal disease.
This conjugated vaccine will replace its non-conjugated older sibling.
Conjugation of polysaccharides, previously used in the _Haemophilus
influenzae_ type b and pediatric heptavalent pneumococcal vaccines,
produces a T-lymphocyte-dependent antigen, allowing effective use in
infants less than 24 months of age and also facilitating booster effects by
producing immunologic memory. The type B polysaccharide capsule is not
useful as an immunogen, conjugated or not. - Mod.LL]
