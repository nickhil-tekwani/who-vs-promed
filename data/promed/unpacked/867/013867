Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis Outbreaks Caused by Coxsackievirus
A24v --- Uganda and Southern Sudan, 2010
---------------------------------------------
CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] was contacted on 22
Jun 2010 by the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH)/Uganda Virus
Research Institute and on 11 Jul 2010 by the Government of Southern
Sudan (GOSS) via the CDC Global Disease Detection Regional Center in
Kenya to perform diagnostic laboratory testing on conjunctival swabs
from persons with "red eye syndrome." Widespread, ongoing outbreaks
of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) have been observed in
Uganda and Southern Sudan since spring 2010.

AHC becomes a reportable condition in outbreak settings. Case numbers
were estimated in Uganda after MoH confirmation of reported cases
from district health facilities and, in Southern Sudan, after a
medical record review in 6 health facilities. To date, 6818 cases
from 26 districts in Uganda, and 428 cases in Juba, Southern Sudan
have been counted; however, because most cases are not reported,
these totals are considered underestimates.

Conjunctival swabs were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) for enterovirus RNA. Enterovirus-positive
swabs were further characterized, and enterovirus-negative swabs were
tested by PCR for adenovirus. Of 29 conjunctival swabs tested from
Uganda, 13 (45 percent) were identified as coxsackievirus A24 variant
(CA24v), one (3 percent) as enterovirus 99, and 15 (52 percent) were
negative; of 6 conjunctival swabs tested from Southern Sudan, 3 (50
percent) were identified as CA24v, and 3 (50 percent) were negative.
All 18 enterovirus- negative swabs tested negative for adenovirus.

AHC epidemics, caused predominantly by enterovirus 70, CA24v, or
adenovirus, have occurred worldwide in predominantly tropical and
subtropical regions, typically last several months and affect large
populations (e.g., over 10 000-200 000) (1,2). Negative laboratory
results are common and can be attributed to multiple factors,
including timing of specimen collection. Symptoms (e.g.,
subconjunctival hemorrhage, foreign-body sensation, photophobia, and
discharge) usually resolve within 1-2 weeks. Treatment for AHC is
symptomatic; however, if secondary bacterial infection is suspected,
patients should seek medical care. AHC is highly contagious and could
spread to neighboring areas and countries; prevention (e.g., hand
washing and proper hygiene) is essential for control.* Control
measures instituted by the Ugandan and GOSS MoHs have included
developing investigation and response guidelines and issuing health
alerts via media channels to increase awareness concerning symptoms, tra!
nsmission, treatment, and prevention.

The number of people who have turned up at doctors with complaints of
eye discharge caused by viral conjunctivitis has increased in
Istanbul compared to just a week ago. Many people have gone to
hospitals with complaints of viral conjunctivitis, officials said.
The rising number of infections has been seen in the Fatih, Samatya,
Bakirkoy, Zeytinburnu and Bahcelievler districts.

The virus that causes the infection can spread through the
respiratory tract and is deemed more dangerous in times of high
temperatures and humidity. "An outbreak of viral conjunctivitis is
observed once every 4-5 years," Dr. Cihan Unlucerci told daily
Hurriyet [News agency]. "The spread of the virus can be prohibited
almost 90 percent by sneezing in the right way, covering the mouth
with hands while sneezing." Unlucerci said such measures would
protect those who come in contact with infected people [but see comment below].

"Symptoms like bleariness of the eyes, watering of the eyes, pain in
the eyes, elevated sensitivity to light, bloated eyelids and waking
up with sealed-over eyelids will decrease after the 1st week," he
said. "The patient will be fully recovered in 3 weeks." The number of
infected people usually rises in autumn. Experts are surprised by the
high number of patients this summer [2010].

To prevent the spread of infection:
- Wash hands often with water and soap
- Don't touch or rub eyes
- Don't use common towels; clean them with water and detergent
- Use paper towels just once, then throw them away
- Limit pillowcases, glasses, makeup materials, eye drops and eye
ointment to personal use.

[Conjunctivitis is an inflammation or infection of the thin layer
(conjunctiva) that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the
white part of the eye. Inflammation can cause blood vessels in the
eye to become larger, and that can make the white of the eye look
pink or red. Thus, conjunctivitis is often called "pink eye" or "red
eye." Viral infection is the most common cause of conjunctivitis.

The infectious agent involved in the Turkish outbreak does not appear
to have been identified, but it is likely to one or more of the
adenoviruses and picornaviruses associated with mild respiratory
virus infections during the summer months. Information on the
identity of the infectious agent would be welcomed in due course.

The acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis observed in Uganda and Southern
Sudan -- a type of conjunctivitis that is sometimes accompanied by
nervous system involvement -- has previously been associated with
enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24, and a variant of
coxsackievirus A24 appears to have been responsible for the current
outbreak in Uganda and Southern Sudan.

[Regarding the containment of viral conjunctivitis, "Sneezing into
the hands" is not the way to go. We preach sneezing or coughing into
the inside of the elbow is better if there is no tissue to sneeze
into. Every thing/one the hands touch will become contaminated. - Mod.DK]
