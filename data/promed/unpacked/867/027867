On Long Island [New York state], a 13-year-old girl from Babylon
[became ill with] measles, setting off a health alert in Suffolk
County. The girl apparently visited the Bay Shore shopping mall on 29
Jul 2008. Non-immune people could develop the disease for up to 18
days after contact with the teen [i.e. through 16 Aug 2008].

Health officials say she likely caught measles while traveling through
Europe. Symptoms include ear aches, runny nose, fever, and a tell-tale
rash. [There is also a 1:1000 risk of encephalitis, which can be
fatal or leave severe sequelae on recovery. - Mod.JW]

[The 13-year-old patient was presumably unvaccinated and at risk of
infection during travel outside the United States. Currently, measles
outbreaks are occurring sporadically throughout Europe, and measles
has recently become endemic again in the United Kingdom 14 years after
local transmission had been halted by vaccination (see ProMED-mail
report:
Measles - UK (02): now endemic 20080705.2044).
