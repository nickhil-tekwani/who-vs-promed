Nairobi Embassy bombing killed valued ProMED-mail contributor
-------------------------------------------------------------
In 1998 we recognised -- http://www.promedmail.org/aboutus/awards/ -- the contributions of 2 special women: Dr Tan Poh Tin and Dr Louise Martin. Louise Martin, known to her friends and family as 'Weezie', had been killed in the Fri 7 Aug 1998 bombing of the US Embassy in Nairobi and it is the 15th anniversary of that tragic event in which some 200 people died.

Our 1998 recognition was necessarily brief: "Veterinarian, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, [Dr Louise Martin] participated in investigating the 1997-98 outbreak of Rift Valley fever in a remote area of Kenya. She spent Christmas 1997 in the field, and her reports of the initial and later stages of the epidemic investigations were posted on ProMED-mail. Locally she was not free of criticism for doing this, even though it engendered great support globally. She was another who put public health before personal considerations."

This barely scratches the surface of who she was. Weezie was in one of the earliest classes I taught, statistics and epidemiology. She and her friend Martha sat in the middle of the back row and were not silent. It was a class with character and she contributed positively and frequently; not only did she name me "H bar J", a students' nickname for many years, but I well remember her properly correcting one of my chi-square calculations -- in those days I was just one chapter ahead of my students, learning as I went. I knew her parents and attended her mother's funeral at the cathedral downtown. She had a deep interest in congenital diseases and went on to study for her doctorate up in Pennsylvania. For some reason it was not proceeding smoothly and one day she and her dad, who had at one time been the state epidemiologist, came to see me to see what I might suggest. Knowing the CDC was looking for veterinarians I advised that she look into joining the EIS [Epidemic Intelligence Service], and from there her career took off where she eventually headed up the congenital disease section. And at CDC she met Doug Klaucke and they were married. Unable to have children they adopted a trio of siblings, 2 boys and a girl -- the eldest was 11 and the youngest 4 -- who were much loved.

Then Doug was posted out to WHO Nairobi in 1997. It was that late December that I had a telephone call from Weezie describing what they had found when they went up to the NE border to investigate an extensive series of human deaths. She wondered whether it could be anthrax. Some 10 years before I had done a sabbatical at Ft Detrick and one of my colleagues there had investigated an extensive epidemic of Rift Valley fever in that part of Africa and I recognised the parallel circumstances, and told her to check out the possibility of Rift first. She and Doug had the outbreak all to themselves at first as it was the Christmas holidays and everyone else was on leave; thus it was not confirmed until after the New Year. [See ProMED-mail postings 19980101.0001, 19980107.0048, and 19980116.0120] Then it was chaos as everyone and their aunt descended on Garissa [County in the former North Eastern Province of Kenya], which had but one hotel and one gas station, and the herding of these foreign "experts" added to the problems of the Kenyan health services. Weezie kept us at ProMED abreast of these and other aspects of this epidemic as it progressed. Come July she and Doug were tired out and it was decided that he would take the boys to visit his in-laws in Lake Charles [Louisiana], and Weezie and the girl would go to Greece or Spain (I cannot remember which it was but the object was for the girls to enjoy themselves). They were all back in Nairobi by midweek in the 1st week of August [1998]. Once the dirty clothes had been washed and everyone rested it was Friday morning, and Weezie said she would go into the Embassy to pick up their mail. Doug heard the distant explosion but they did not hear what had happened until he got a phone call around 1:30 pm. She is still missed.
