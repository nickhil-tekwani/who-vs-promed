The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) announced the 1st human case [in 2013] of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a Massachusetts resident. The woman, a resident of Norfolk County in her 80s, was hospitalized in mid-August and died several days later.

DPH is conducting an epidemiological investigation to determine where the woman was most likely exposed to infected mosquitoes. Assessment of EEE risk areas will depend on the findings of this investigation.

There were 7 cases of EEE in Massachusetts in 2012. EEE is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. EEE is a serious disease in all ages and can cause death.

The 1st symptoms of EEE are fever (often 103-106 deg F [39-41 deg C]), stiff neck, headache, and lack of energy. These symptoms show up 3-10 days after a bite from an infected mosquito. Inflammation and swelling of the brain, called encephalitis, is the most dangerous and common serious complication. The disease generally worsens quickly, and some patients may go into a coma within a week.

People have an important role to play in protecting themselves and their loved ones from illnesses caused by mosquitoes.

[There have been sporadic equine cases of EEE virus infection in Massachusetts recently -- one this year (2013) and 5 in 2012. In endemic areas such as this one, it is important for people to avoid mosquito bites and for horse owners to have their animals vaccinated.
