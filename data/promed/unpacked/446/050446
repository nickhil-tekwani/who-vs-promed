Since 1 Aug 2017, the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) has identified 2000 cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since 1 Aug 2017, primarily among homeless people and drug users, prompted declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

The DPH is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Counts as of 13 Oct 2018:
- Total Outbreak: 2159
- Hospitalizations: 1166
- Deaths: 14

Since March 2018, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health has reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A virus. This increase in cases has primarily been among injecting and non-injecting drug users, homeless or mobile individuals, and those who have been recently incarcerated. Viral sequencing has linked cases from Kentucky and California.

Those affected the most are the marginalized cohorts of humanity, including homeless people and substance abusers. Their needs for adequate sanitation and living conditions were supplied in the San Diego (California) area, and such an approach to these outbreaks is required elsewhere in the USA. Spill-over into other portions of the population, such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers, will continue. It is not clear how many of these rapidly increasing cases are in individuals outside the described cohorts.

Kentucky remains in 1st place in cases. West Virginia has roared past California and Michigan for 2nd on the HAV case number list. With the 1603 number in West Virginia and Kentucky's 2159, these 2 states have reported 3762 cases.

In the entire year of 2016 (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2016surveillance/index.htm), CDC reported only 2007 cases from all 50 states. Based on weekly numbers, 185 new cases were reported from these 2 states in the past week. There is no clear sign of decreasing numbers. It is not entirely clear what public health responses are occurring. - Mod.LL

The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County (DOH-Pinellas) is recommending prevention and vaccination to combat a rise in hepatitis A cases in the county as well as in nearby areas of the state. As of 22 Oct 2018, 58 cases have been reported in Pinellas County and more than 180 in Florida. Similar increases have been reported in other states.

"We are on track to report the highest number of hepatitis A cases since 2005," said DOH-Pinellas Director Dr. Ulyee Choe. "We have enhanced our public health efforts in encouraging prevention to reduce new cases, but those at risk need to know that there's an effective vaccine that protects them from this disease."

As part of its public health mission, DOH-Pinellas is offering the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine at no cost to adults and children. The usual USD 70.66 cost for adults is waived to remove the barrier of cost; vaccines are always provided at no cost to children and teens through the age of 18.

Hepatitis A is spread person-to-person via feces contaminated with its virus. For example, food prepared by an infected person who doesn't practice proper hygiene in handwashing could sicken others. Symptoms include fever, dark urine, yellow-tinged skin or eyes, fatigue, and gastric issues. It causes damage to the liver, especially among those who already have liver disease.

[Florida is now another state with an outbreak of HAV. The epidemiology of the outbreak is likely to be similar to other states with cases primarily in homeless and illicit drug using cohorts. - Mod.LL
