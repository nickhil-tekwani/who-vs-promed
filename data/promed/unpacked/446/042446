Avian influenza: WHO updated factsheet
--------------------------------------
The H5N1 avian influenza virus can survive for more than a month in bird
droppings in cold weather and for nearly a week even in hot summer
temperatures, the World Health Organization said on Fri 20 Jan 2006.
When people become infected with avian influenza virus, they get a high
fever and pneumonia very quickly, according to an updated factsheet from
the WHO, posted on the internet [The full text is appended below - Mod.CP].
The factsheet incorporates the most recent findings on the H5N1 avian
influenza virus, which WHO says is causing by far the worst outbreak among
both birds and people ever recorded. It has been found from South Korea,
across South East Asia, into Turkey, Ukraine and Romania. It has infected
149 people and killed 80, according to the WHO figures, which do not
include the most recent deaths and infections in Turkey.
Bird droppings may be a significant source of its spread to both people and
birds, the WHO said. For example, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus can
survive in bird feces for at least 35 days at low temperature (4 degrees C
or 39 degrees F). At a much higher temperature (37 degrees C or 98.6
degrees F), H5N1 viruses have been shown to survive, in fecal samples, for
6 days.
Poultry, especially those kept in small backyard flocks, are the main
source of the virus. "These birds usually roam freely as they scavenge for
food and often mingle with wild birds or share water sources with them.
Such situations create abundant opportunities for human exposure to the
virus, especially when birds enter households or are brought into
households during adverse weather, or when they share areas where children
play or sleep, WHO states.
According to WHO, H5N1 has different qualities from seasonal flu. The
incubation period for H5N1 avian influenza may be longer than that for
normal seasonal influenza, which is around 2 to 3 days. Current data for
H5N1 infection indicate an incubation period ranging from 2 to 8 days and
possibly as long as 17 days. Initial symptoms include a high fever, usually
with a temperature higher than 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F), and
influenza-like symptoms. Diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain,
and bleeding from the nose and gums have also been reported as early
symptoms in some patients. And with H5N1 infection, all patients have
developed pneumonia, and usually very early on the illness, WHO states. On
present evidence, difficulty in breathing develops around 5 days following
the 1st symptoms. Respiratory distress, a hoarse voice, and a crackling
sound when inhaling are commonly seen. There is bloody sputum. Another
common feature is multiorgan dysfunction, notably involving the kidney and
heart. The WHO recommends using Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir,
as soon as possible to treat bird flu.
WHO stresses that H5N1 remains mostly a disease of birds, with tens of
millions infected in 2 years. For unknown reasons, most cases have occurred
in rural and periurban households where small flocks of poultry are kept.
Again for unknown reasons, very few cases have been detected in presumed
high-risk groups, such as commercial poultry workers, workers at live
poultry markets, cullers, veterinarians, and health staff caring for
patients without adequate protective equipment. Also lacking is an
explanation for the puzzling concentration of cases in previously healthy
children and young adults.

Avian influenza ("bird flu") and the significance of its transmission to
humans
---------------------------------------------------
The disease in birds: impact and control measures
-------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains
of the influenza virus. The disease, which was first identified in Italy
more than 100 years ago, occurs worldwide.
All birds are thought to be susceptible to infection with avian influenza,
though some species are more resistant to infection than others. Infection
causes a wide spectrum of symptoms in birds, ranging from mild illness to a
highly contagious and rapidly fatal disease resulting in severe epidemics.
The latter is known as "highly pathogenic avian influenza." This form is
characterized by sudden onset, severe illness, and rapid death, with a
mortality that can approach 100 per cent.
15 subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds, thus providing an
extensive reservoir of influenza viruses potentially circulating in bird
populations. To date, all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been
caused by influenza A viruses of subtypes H5 and H7.
Migratory waterfowl -- most notably wild ducks -- are the natural reservoir
of avian influenza viruses, and these birds are also the most resistant to
infection. Domestic poultry, including chickens and turkeys, are
particularly susceptible to epidemics of rapidly fatal influenza.
Direct or indirect contact of domestic flocks with wild migratory waterfowl
has been implicated as a frequent cause of epidemics. Live bird markets
have also played an important role in the spread of epidemics.
Recent research has shown that viruses of low pathogenicity can, after
circulation for sometimes short periods in a poultry population, mutate
into highly pathogenic viruses. During a 1983-1984 epidemic in the United
States of America, the H5N2 virus initially caused low mortality, but
within 6 months became highly pathogenic, with a mortality approaching 90
per cent. Control of the outbreak required destruction of more than 17
million birds at a cost of nearly USD65 million. During a 1999-2001
epidemic in Italy, the H7N1 virus, initially of low pathogenicity, mutated
within 9 months to a highly pathogenic form. More than 13 million birds
died or were destroyed.
The quarantining of infected farms and destruction of infected or
potentially exposed flocks are standard control measures aimed at
preventing spread to other farms and eventual establishment of the virus in
a country's poultry population. Apart from being highly contagious, avian
influenza viruses are readily transmitted from farm to farm by mechanical
means, such as by contaminated equipment, vehicles, feed, cages, or
clothing. Highly pathogenic viruses can survive for long periods in the
environment, especially when temperatures are low. Stringent sanitary
measures on farms can, however, confer some degree of protection.
In the absence of prompt control measures backed by good surveillance,
epidemics can last for years. For example, an epidemic of H5N2 avian
influenza, which began in Mexico in 1992, started with low pathogenicity,
evolved to the highly fatal form, and was not controlled until 1995.
A constantly mutating virus: 2 consequences
-------------------------------------------
All type A influenza viruses, including those that regularly cause seasonal
epidemics of influenza in humans, are genetically labile and well adapted
to elude host defenses. Influenza viruses lack mechanisms for the
"proofreading" and repair of errors that occur during replication. As a
result of these uncorrected errors, the genetic composition of the viruses
changes as they replicate in humans and animals, and the existing strain is
replaced with a new antigenic variant. These constant, permanent and
usually small changes in the antigenic composition of influenza A viruses
are known as antigenic drift.
The tendency of influenza viruses to undergo frequent and permanent
antigenic changes necessitates constant monitoring of the global influenza
situation and annual adjustments in the composition of influenza vaccines.
Both activities have been a cornerstone of the WHO Global Influenza
Programme since its inception in 1947.
Influenza viruses have a 2nd characteristic of great public health concern:
influenza A viruses, including subtypes from different species, can swap or
"reassort" genetic materials and merge. This reassortment process, known as
antigenic shift, results in a novel subtype different from both parent
viruses. As populations will have no immunity to the new subtype, and as no
existing vaccines can confer protection, antigenic shift has historically
resulted in highly lethal pandemics. For this to happen, the novel subtype
needs to have genes from human influenza viruses that make it readily
transmissible from person to person for a sustainable period.
Conditions favourable for the emergence of antigenic shift have long been
thought to involve humans living in close proximity to domestic poultry and
pigs. Because pigs are susceptible to infection with both avian and
mammalian viruses, including human strains, they can serve as a "mixing
vessel" for the scrambling of genetic material from human and avian
viruses, resulting in the emergence of a novel subtype.
Recent events, however, have identified a 2nd possible mechanism. Evidence
is mounting that, for at least some of the 15 avian influenza virus
subtypes circulating in bird populations, humans themselves can serve as
the "mixing vessel."
Human infection with avian influenza viruses: a timeline
--------------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and
pigs. The 1st documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus
occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, when the H5N1 strain caused severe
respiratory disease in 18 humans, of whom 6 died. The infection of humans
coincided with an epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza, caused by
the same strain, in Hong Kong's poultry population.
Extensive investigation of that outbreak determined that close contact with
live infected poultry was the source of human infection. Studies at the
genetic level further determined that the virus had jumped directly from
birds to humans. Limited transmission to health care workers occurred, but
did not cause severe disease.
Rapid destruction -- within 3 days -- of Hong Kong's entire poultry
population, estimated at around 1.5 million birds, reduced opportunities
for further direct transmission to humans, and may have averted a pandemic.
That event alarmed public health authorities, as it marked the 1st time
that an avian influenza virus was transmitted directly to humans and caused
severe illness with high mortality. Alarm mounted again in February 2003,
when an outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in Hong Kong caused 2 cases and 1
death in members of a family who had recently travelled to southern China.
Another child in the family died during that visit, but the cause of death
is not known.
2 other avian influenza viruses have recently caused illness in humans. An
outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza, which began in the
Netherlands in February 2003, caused the death of one veterinarian 2 months
later, and mild illness in 83 other humans. Mild cases of avian influenza
H9N2 in children occurred in Hong Kong in 1999 (2 cases) and in
mid-December 2003 (one case). H9N2 is not highly pathogenic in birds.
The most recent cause for alarm occurred in January 2004, when laboratory
tests confirmed the presence of H5N1 avian influenza virus in human cases
of severe respiratory disease in the northern part of Viet Nam.
Why H5N1 is of particular concern
---------------------------------
Of the 15 avian influenza virus subtypes, H5N1 is of particular concern for
several reasons. H5N1 mutates rapidly and has a documented propensity to
acquire genes from viruses infecting other animal species. Its ability to
cause severe disease in humans has now been documented on 2 occasions. In
addition, laboratory studies have demonstrated that isolates from this
virus have a high pathogenicity and can cause severe disease in humans.
Birds that survive infection excrete virus for at least 10 days, orally and
in faeces, thus facilitating further spread at live poultry markets and by
migratory birds.
The epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by H5N1, which
began in mid-December 2003 in the Republic of Korea and is now being seen
in other Asian countries, is therefore of particular public health concern.
H5N1 variants demonstrated a capacity to directly infect humans in 1997,
and have done so again in Viet Nam in January 2004. The spread of infection
in birds increases the opportunities for direct infection of humans. If
more humans become infected over time, the likelihood also increases that
humans, if concurrently infected with human and avian influenza strains,
could serve as the "mixing vessel" for the emergence of a novel subtype
with sufficient human genes to be easily transmitted from person to person.
Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic.
Influenza pandemics: can they be averted?
-----------------------------------------
Based on historical patterns, influenza pandemics can be expected to occur,
on average, 3-4 times each century when new virus subtypes emerge and are
readily transmitted from person to person. However, the occurrence of
influenza pandemics is unpredictable. In the 20th century, the great
influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, which caused an estimated 40 to 50 million
deaths worldwide, was followed by pandemics in 1957-1958 and 1968-1969.
Experts agree that another influenza pandemic is inevitable and possibly
imminent.
Most influenza experts also agree that the prompt culling of Hong Kong's
entire poultry population in 1997 probably averted a pandemic.
Several measures can help minimize the global public health risks that
could arise from large outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza
in birds. An immediate priority is to halt further spread of epidemics in
poultry populations. This strategy works to reduce opportunities for human
exposure to the virus. Vaccination of persons at high risk of exposure to
infected poultry, using existing vaccines effective against currently
circulating human influenza strains, can reduce the likelihood of
co-infection of humans with avian and influenza strains, and thus reduce
the risk that genes will be exchanged. Workers involved in the culling of
poultry flocks must be protected, by proper clothing and equipment, against
infection. These workers should also receive antiviral drugs as a
prophylactic measure.
When cases of avian influenza in humans occur, information on the extent of
influenza infection in animals as well as humans and on circulating
influenza viruses is urgently needed to aid the assessment of risks to
public health and to guide the best protective measures.
Thorough investigation of each case is also essential. While WHO and the
members of its global influenza network, together with other international
agencies, can assist with many of these activities, the successful
containment of public health risks also depends on the epidemiological and
laboratory capacity of affected countries and the adequacy of surveillance
systems already in place.
While all these activities can reduce the likelihood that a pandemic strain
will emerge, the question of whether another influenza pandemic can be
averted cannot be answered with certainty.
Clinical course and treatment of human cases of H5N1 avian influenza
----------------------------------------------------
Published information about the clinical course of human infection with
H5N1 avian influenza is limited to studies of cases in the 1997 Hong Kong
outbreak. In that outbreak, patients developed symptoms of fever, sore
throat, cough and, in several of the fatal cases, severe respiratory
distress secondary to viral pneumonia. Previously healthy adults and
children, and some with chronic medical conditions, were affected.
Tests for diagnosing all influenza strains of animals and humans are rapid
and reliable. Many laboratories in the WHO global influenza network have
the necessary high-security facilities and reagents for performing these
tests as well as considerable experience. Rapid bedside tests for the
diagnosis of human influenza are also available, but do not have the
precision of the more extensive laboratory testing that is currently needed
to fully understand the most recent cases and determine whether human
infection is spreading, either directly from birds or from person to person.
Antiviral drugs, some of which can be used for both treatment and
prevention, are clinically effective against influenza A virus strains in
otherwise healthy adults and children, but have some limitations. Some of
these drugs are also expensive and supplies are limited.
Experience in the production of influenza vaccines is also considerable,
particularly as vaccine composition changes each year to match changes in
circulating virus due to antigenic drift. However, at least 4 months would
be needed to produce a new vaccine, in significant quantities, capable of
conferring protection against a new virus subtype.]
