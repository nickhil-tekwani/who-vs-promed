Concerning this outbreak, the analysis' results are still waiting. We think that this outbreak can be due to migration observed in the Far North of Cameroon. In central Africa (Central African Republic), we have also observed these same cases due to Monkey pox. Only the analysis' results of "Centre Pasteur du Cameroun" will help us know more about this outbreak.

[Douala, Cameroon ProMED thanks this EpiCore Surveillace Project member for his contribution. Indeed monkey pox has been described in chimpanzees in Cameroon but it is unclear if human have or are occurring. We await further information. - Mod.LL
