The Ministry of Health has confirmed an outbreak of yellow fever in some parts of the country [Ghana]. A statement issued by the Ministry of Health indicated that this disease is predominantly prevalent in the Tain and West Gonja districts in the Brong-Ahafo Region and Northern Region respectively.

The Ministry [of Health] in a statement pointed out that a "total of 12 cases of yellow fever have been reported and 3 have died as a result since the end of 2015."

Preventive measures include avoiding mosquito bite, sleeping in insecticide treated bed nets, environmental cleanliness and preventing stagnation of water in tins and tyres.

[This report provides little epidemiological detail about the 12 yellow fever (YF) cases in eastern Ghana. If these cases have all occurred "since the end of 2015" as the report states, then they have occurred within the past 7 days. ProMED would be interested to know the specific location and dates where and when the YF virus infections occurred, as well as information about the sex and ages of the victims. Is a YF vaccination campaign planned in the areas where the cases occurred, as has been the case with YF outbreaks in Ghana in the past?

There have been sporadic cases of yellow fever (YF) in Ghana in recent years, including this one (2016). Recently, the 1st phase of a mass vaccination campaign was conducted in November 2011 and targeted a population of 5.8 million people covering 40 districts (8 regions). A YF reactive campaign was carried out in 3 more districts. The 2nd phase, planned for 2012, targeted 1.7 million people spanning 17 districts.

[Preventive measures should always include vaccination around the foci. ProMED would be interested to hear whether the 2011 and 2012 YF vaccination campaigns covered the areas of the present cases, and whether Ghana includes YF vaccine in its current EPI (Expanded Program on Immunization) childhood vaccination program. - Mod.JW]
