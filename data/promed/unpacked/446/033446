Finland and Sweden warn swimmers of toxic algae bloom in Baltic
-------------------------
Environmental watchdogs in Finland and Sweden have warned swimmers to be
cautious when going for dips at the countries' beaches because of a toxic
algae bloom in the Baltic Sea brought on by sweltering summer temperatures.
"There are some algae in the water, so we have warned people to be careful
when swimming, not to swallow water, and to shower afterwards," said Antti
Poenkae, chief of environmental health at the Helsinki Environment Institute.
Young children and dogs are particularly sensitive to the algae
called _Nodularia spumigena_ but more commonly referred to as blue-green
algae. It can cause flu-like symptoms, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, nausea,
headaches, as well as itchy and burning skin, but it is not life
threatening. It has erupted in the Baltic Sea off Sweden's southeastern
coast and in the Gulf of Finland on Finland's southern coast.
So far this month, it has poisoned some 30 people in Finland, mostly
children who have swallowed algae-infected water while swimming, according
to local health authorities.
The algae typically blooms during warm weather, and has recently become a
seasonal phenomenon during hot summers, as it thrives in the brackish and
increasingly polluted waters of the Baltic Sea.
"It seems that it's becoming more common because of the higher amounts of
phosphor[ous], nitrogen, and organic material from sewage discharged into
the Baltic Sea from the surrounding countries," Poenkae noted.
The algae appear in the sea as strings of blue, green, or yellow scum or
occasionally just murky, cloudy waters.
Earlier this week the Finnish coast guard reported a 300-kilometer
(185-mile) long belt of algae some 20 to 50 kilometers (12 to 30 miles)
wide, stretching from the southwestern tip of Finland across the Baltic to
the Aaland islands. And in Sweden, the algae have been observed around the
Baltic holiday islands of Oeland and Gotland and in the Stockholm archipelago.
If the warm weather continues, officials said the outbreak was likely to
worsen.

[Many species of cyanobacteria produce populations that are toxic to humans
and animals. Blue-green pond scums have been linked to the poisoning of
cattle and dogs, and occasionally people. Some species of cyanobacteria
appear to be nontoxic and are harvested as a food source. It is therefore
not recommended that wild algae populations be gathered and eaten without
some knowledge of the organisms involved. Cyanobacteria may cause other
problems as well; a species of _Lyngbya_ is responsible for one of the skin
irritations commonly known as "swimmer's itch." _Anabaena_ is a blue-green
algae.
Nodularia spp. can form macroscopic filaments These filaments, when
solitary, can be almost straight, irregularly curved, or may form somewhat
regular spirals with varying width and pitch, or when abundant, entangled
into macroscopic agglomerations.
_Nodularia spumigena_ does produce the heptoxin nodularin. It is most
frequently seen blooming in the Baltic Sea July through September. - Mod.TG]
