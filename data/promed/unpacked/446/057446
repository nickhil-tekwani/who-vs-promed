One more case of foot-and-mouth in Andong
-----------------------------------------
Another case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] was confirmed at a
cattle farm in Seohu, a township in Andong, North Gyeongsang, just 8
km (5 miles) from a case reported on Monday [29 Nov 2010], according
to the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The
cattle farm reported that 5 cows were drooling and had fever and loss
of appetite, which led the farm to suspect FMD.

After the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service
conducted an epidemiology study at the farm, it confirmed the
presence of the virus. An official from the quarantine service said,
"We cannot rule out the possibility that the FMD virus originated on
the cattle farm because the virus appeared in the cows after an
incubation period of one or 2 weeks."

Two cases of the disease were found at hog farms in the area on
Monday. To prevent the disease from spreading further, 41 cows raised
within 500 meters (about 1600 feet) of the Seohu farm were
slaughtered. In addition, the entrance to Seohu is being monitored.

Residents reacted to the news of the outbreak with dismay.

"I was startled by the news and my heart sank," Lee, a 56-year-old
resident said. "Livestock farm owners are restless."

Other residents in the area worried about the threat to their livelihood.

"Livestock farms in Andong are already knee-deep in trouble," one
Andong resident said. "I am really anxious about whether the
livestock industry here is going to collapse."

On Monday, the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service
declared the area within a 3-km [1.86-mile] radius of the infection
site as "dangerous." It also put the area within 10 km [6.2 miles] of
the site on alert and established a control zone within 20 km [12.4
miles] of the site. People and animals are prohibited from traveling
to 85 places within the 20-km radius.

About 3100 pigs and cows were buried in Andong yesterday and around
20 000 animals from 132 farmhouses within a 3-km radius of the
epicenter are still on call.

Quarantine officials at the Food Ministry are currently in the
process of conducting epidemiology studies to discover the source of
the infection, tracing the migration patterns of livestock farm
owners, migrant workers and veterinarians. The officials have
confirmed that one hog farm owner traveled to Viet Nam for 5 days
early last month [October 2010] but said that none of the migrant
workers from the infected farms had traveled abroad recently.

Another obstacle to containment may be the appearance of a new type
of virus. The O virus is more contagious than the A virus that swept
through Gimpo and Gangwha in April [2010]. The rate of infection is
higher in the former.

[The South Korean authorities have issued on 30 Nov 2010 follow-up
report Number 1 to the OIE, notifying the above outbreak in cattle
which follows the outbreak in swine a day earlier. The report
includes the following epidemiological comments:
"The National Veterinary Research & Quarantine Service (NVRQS)
confirmed by sequencing analysis that the 1st reported cases were
infected with FMD virus serotype O. On 29 Nov 2010, a private
veterinarian reported to the local veterinary service an FMD
suspicious case in a Korean native beef cattle farm located 8 km [5
miles] southwest of the 1st outbreak farm. The NVRQS confirmed FMD
positive on 30 Nov 2010 by RT-PCR. All cloven-hoofed animals raised
in the area within 500m [0.31-mile] radius of the affected farm will
be culled and buried as a preemptive measure." See, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10002>.

The involvement of swine in the epizootic is bad news, since these
animals are known to be prolific producers of the virus, enhancing
the prospects of its airborne spread. Windbourne dissemination of FMD
virus, particularly in certain weather conditions, can take place
over considerable distances. This may underline their decision to
cull all susceptible animals within a radius of 500m of the focus;
hopefully, the spread, when the infected swine were still alive, did
not exceed that distance. - Mod.AS].
