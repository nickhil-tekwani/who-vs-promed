[1] Clarification
Date: 29 Apr 2010
From: Sona Bari <baris@who.int> [edited]


I wish to refer to [the report from ProMED-RUS
in] your posting [Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (04):
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan susp 20100424.1319] in
which it is stated, in the context of the polio
outbreak in Tajikistan, that "Cases have also
been detected in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan."

Please allow me to clarify that no cases of polio
have been confirmed in Uzbekistan to date and
that polio cases reported this year [2010] in
Afghanistan (10 to date) are not related to the
outbreak in Tajikistan. No cases have been
detected in the areas of Afghanistan bordering Tajikistan.

[2] Eurosurveillance report - virus origin Uttar Pradesh, India
Date: 29 Apr 2010

On 23 Apr 2010, the World Health Organisation
announced the confirmation of wild poliovirus
serotype 1 (WPV1) in 7 samples from children with
Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) in Tajikistan, in
the context of a multi-district cluster starting in December 2009.

Poliomyelitis (polio) was eliminated in the WHO
European Region and the Region was certified
polio-free in 2002. Since then, considerable
efforts of national authorities and of the
international public health community have
sustained the polio-free status for the 880
million population of the Region. The last
indigenous case of wild poliovirus infection in
the WHO European Region was reported in Turkey in
1998 [1]. However, poliovirus imported from polio
endemic countries remains a threat. In 1996,
following migration resulting from the opening of
borders in 1992, Albania reported 138 laboratory
confirmed cases of WPV1 infection, including 16
deaths, with 24 confirmed polio cases detected in
the bordering United Nations administered
Province of Kosovo [2]. The main age group
affected was the group of 10 to 34 years-old
which accounted for 79 percent of cases and the
lowest incidence was reported among children aged
one to 9 years. Among those with known
vaccination status, 93 percent had received at
least 3 doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV). The
last outbreak in the EU, due to imported WPV3,
occurred in the Netherlands in 1992 and 1993 in a
community objecting to vaccination [3]. A total
of 71 individuals were paralysed and 2 deaths
were reported. The last cases of imported wild
poliovirus in the WHO European Region were
reported in 2001. These occurrences were
associated with WPV1 originating from India, with
3 Roma children in Bulgaria and one non-paralytic
case in Georgia [4]. These cases related to
importation did not result in indigenous
transmission, defined by the WHO as uninterrupted
transmission occurring for more than 12 months.

Tajikistan, with a 6.6 million population, is one
of the 5 Central Asian Republics and borders
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, China and Afghanistan.
Two outbreaks of polio were registered in
Tajikistan in the 1990s, with 111 and 26 cases of
poliomyelitis reported to the WHO in 1991 and
1994, respectively [5]. The last clinically
confirmed case of poliomyelitis observed in Tajikistan was in 1997 [1,6].

The reported vaccine coverage with 3 doses of OPV
in Tajikistan in 2008 was 87 percent [7], which
is below the WHO target of over 90 percent [8].
In 2007, the national health authorities in
Tajikistan conducted an immunisation campaign
against polio, targeting children less than 3
years old in the areas bordering Afghanistan.

At the beginning of April 2010, the WHO Country
Office in Tajikistan was informed of an increase
in AFP cases in multiple contiguous districts. On
average, Tajikistan reports 35-40 AFP cases
annually with peaks in July and October. As of
[28 Apr 2010], the Ministry of Health of
Tajikistan reported 171 AFP cases to WHO, with a
sharp increase in the past 2 weeks, including 12
deaths and 32 cases of laboratory confirmed WPV1
infection; the tests were conducted at the WHO
regional reference laboratory for polio, based at
the Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral
Encephalitis, Moscow, Russian Federation [9].
Genetic sequencing has determined that the
poliovirus is most closely related to virus from
Uttar Pradesh, India. One-hundred and thirty-six
(80 percent) of the AFP cases were in children
aged under 5 years (age range 0-17 years). Cases
were mainly reported from districts bordering
Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. The Uzbek national
authorities are investigating 3 cases of AFP.

Following the confirmation of WPV1 in Tajikistan,
3 rounds of nationwide immunisation with
monovalent OPV type 1 are planned for all
children aged 5 years or younger (1.1 million
children) with a 2 week interval between each
round, starting the 1st round on [4 May 2010]. In
addition, there are ongoing efforts to strengthen
AFP surveillance. Upon the request of the
Ministry of Health of Tajikistan, WHO deployed a
multi-disciplinary team of clinical,
epidemiological, and virological experts, to
investigate the event and assist national
authorities in planning and implementing the
necessary public health measures. WPV1 and WPV3
activity is currently recorded in Afghanistan. As
of [20 Apr 2010], Afghanistan reported 8 cases of
poliomyelitis (one WPV1 and seven WPV3) for the
year 2010. The onset of disease in the most
recent case was on [8 Apr 2010]. Since 2002, no
cases of wild poliovirus infection have been
detected in northern Afghanistan, areas with
recognised high quality AFP surveillance.
Pakistan reported 13 cases of polio due to WPV1
and WPV3 so far in 2010 [8]. Polio is still
endemic in 4 countries worldwide; besides
Afghanistan and Pakistan these are India and Nigeria [8].

The movement of Tajik nationals in the European
Union (EU) is limited as less than 2200 Schengen
visas were issued in 2009. Considering these
small numbers of Tajik nationals coming to the
Schengen area, the risk of spread of WPV1
associated with the ongoing outbreak in
Tajikistan within the EU is considered to be
limited. However, importation of cases cannot be
excluded, and high levels of vaccine coverage
with 3 doses of polio vaccine are needed to
ensure that importation into the EU will not
occur. Pockets of susceptible populations do
exist in the EU and the risk of disease in these
groups is high if the virus is introduced in
these communities. Avoiding complacency and
maintaining good AFP and/or enterovirus
surveillance in the EU to comply with WHO targets
is of utmost importance to prevent WPV
importation and further spread, particularly
considering that 90% of cases associated with WPV
infection do not have clinical symptoms. The need
to maintain vigilance, implement adequate
measures to detect and prevent re-importation of
polio into polio-free regions is also stressed in
a paper by H Nokleby et al. in this issue of Eurosurveillance [10].

While AFP surveillance is considered the gold
standard for certification purposes, other
surveillance strategies and sources of data have
been accepted by the WHO European Regional
Certification Commission of the Eradication of
Poliomyelitis that enable the detection, rapid
reporting, and investigation of any paralytic
polio cases. This applies to countries that have
been non-endemic for a long time, with high
levels of sanitation and strong health systems.
Accepted alternative surveillance strategies
include enterovirus surveillance and/or
environmental surveillance for polioviruses.
Member states of the WHO European Region conduct
a combination of AFP, enterovirus, and/or
environmental surveillance. Forty-three of the 53
member states in the WHO European Region conduct
AFP surveillance, including 23 of the 29 EU/EEA
countries (Liechtenstein is not reporting to
WHO), 41 have implemented enhanced enterovirus
surveillance while 7 are doing environmental
surveillance through sewage systems.

A region is certified as polio-free if no
indigenous poliomyelitis cases are identified for
a period of more than 3 years in the presence of
high quality, certification-standard
surveillance. The current outbreak in Tajikistan
represents the 1st introduction of wild
poliovirus in the WHO European Region since it
has been certified polio-free in 2002. Therefore,
strong measures are needed to protect the status.
The present situation calls for strong political
and financial commitment from all member states
to ensure the WHO European Region sustains its
polio-free status and that global eradication of polio will be reached by 2012.

Although the region is considered at high-risk
for importation of wild poliovirus due to ongoing
global travel, trade, and migration, especially
with the 4 polio endemic countries, the current
poliomyelitis outbreak in Tajikistan does not
substantially affect the risk for further spread
to the EU Member States at this time. It is
important to note that WHO does not recommend
restrictions on international travel and trade in
case of the detection of wild poliovirus but
emphasizes that standard recommendations
regarding vaccination of travellers to and from a
polio-affected country apply until a polio outbreak is interrupted.

[3] Outbreak response
Date: 29 Apr 2010
Source: Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/LatestNews201004.asp#04>


Tajikistan is launching an outbreak response
vaccination activity on [1 May 2010] in the
capital Dushanbe and 6 surrounding districts, as
lab testing confirms that 32 children in the
country have been paralysed by polio. This
response is to be followed by 3 nation-wide
vaccination campaigns, the 1st of which is due to
start on [4 May]. Four million doses of vaccine have arrived in the country.

Genetic sequencing has now determined that the
poliovirus is most closely related to virus from
Uttar Pradesh, India. Countries neighbouring
Tajikistan have lined up protective measures:
Uzbekistan is planning to vaccinate its children
under 5 years of age starting in the last week of
May [2010]; Kyrgyzstan is conducting polio
vaccinations as part of European Immunization
Week; Afghanistan has stepped up surveillance
along its border with Tajikistan and is focusing
staff resources on border provinces during its [2
May 2010] nationwide immunization activity.

WHO and UNICEF are urgently seeking emergency
funding to support the costs of the field
operations and vaccination campaigns. Rotary
International, the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and the UK Department for
International Development have already pledged emergency funding.

The Ministries of Health in Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan are supported in their planning and
implementation by WHO, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the United Nations
Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies and other partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

WHO recommendations for travel to Tajikistan are
the same as for any other polio-infected country
­ immunization or boosting of past immunization.
No further actions or travel restrictions are recommended.

[In the above report (see [2] Eurosurveillance
report], as of 27 Apr 2010, there have been 171
cases of AFP with 12 deaths reported of which 32
had WPV1 isolated. This represents an increase of
51 AFP cases and 2 deaths, with 25 addition
isolates of WPV1 since the 1st report of this
outbreak (see prior ProMED-mail posting
Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (04): Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan susp 20100424.1319). Additional
information since the 1st report on this outbreak
includes genetic sequencing of the WPV1 isolated
from cases as most closely resembling viruses
from Uttar Pradesh India. It has been pointed out
that while Afghanistan is still a polio endemic
country not having interrupted transmission and
sustained the interruption for 3 years, the
northern part of Afghanistan has not had recent
poliovirus transmission, with 7 out of the 8
confirmed cases with onset in 2010 having WPV3
isolated, whereas the virus identified in the
current outbreak in Tajiskistan is WPV1. The
identification of the probable origin of the
virus in Uttar Pradesh, a key endemic area in
India further highlights the ease of travel of
microorganisms (and their hosts), crossing borders silently.

We still await word on the findings of the
investigations on the 3 identified AFP cases in
Uzbekistan, as well as more information on
results of the investigation of the outbreak in
Tajikistan, with possible information on the
silent or not so silent spread of the WPV since December 2009.

For the interactive HealthMap/ProMED map of
Tajikistan, showing borders with neighboring
countries (including Uzbekistan and Afghanistan)
see <http://healthmap.org/r/01f4>. For the
interactive HealthMap/ProMED map of Uttar
Pradesh, India, see
<http://healthmap.org/r/00Hk>. Moving the map
around, one can see that Uttar Pradesh is a
significant distance to the southeast from Tajikistan. - Mod.MPP]
