The following information is a week old, however, it may be useful.
According to e-mail from Dr.Jorge Foianini of AMDA-Bolivia(a UN- registered
international health NGO) in Santa Cruz, the local health authority received
21 fatal YF reports by 3 Feb 1999. Ages of the patients are between 14-63
years, average 33 years. Reported cases are from Tejeria, Santa Ana de
Velasco, Murillo, Las Lomitas, Florida & Postrervalle. Local newspaper 'El
Nuevo Dia' learned of 3 new cases from Cabezas (Cordillera country)
recently.
The case fatality rate remains uncertain. The 'END' reported on January 29
that the number of confirmed cases reached 33, including 13 fatal cases
(approx.30%). The Bolivia-Japan Friendship Hospital in Santa Cruz accepted 4
YF patients in January. They are diagnosed YF serologically (I guess it's an
ELISA IgM test). The Japanese physicians working at the friendship hospital
suspect there are many milder cases, which are not reported.
The local health authority received donations of YF vaccine from Brazil
(210 000 doses), Peru (35 000 doses), Paraguay (1000 doses) by 3 Feb. Those
are being [administered at 5 health centers(Centros de Salud) in Santa Cruz
and vicinity. Approximately 20 000 doses were already [administered by the
end of January. The vaccination campaign is being expanded to the rural
areas in February.
The local health authority estimates that 1 000 000 doses are needed to stop
the YF epidemic, and plan to immunize 3 000 000 more people.
Currently the Bolivian government is requesting [emergency medical aid for
mass vaccination from the Japanese government.

The Robert Koch Institut, the German Yellow Fever vaccine producer, had
several requests this week from German doctors living in Santa Cruz, Bolivia
for supplies of vaccine for their own use in an outbreak of Yellow Fever.
Apparently the Bolivian newspaper "La Razon" had an article on 29 Jan
[1999 reporting an outbreak with 13 deaths and 20 "infected". The Bolivian
Embassy in Berlin has provided us with a copy of that article and an E-mail
address of "La Razon":
http://208.143.241.66/cuerpoe/edicion.htm
I have just requested more information [from them.

"La Razon" reports & send us anything new on this outbreak - Mod.JW
