[Since the start of this epizootic, on 5 Dec 2013, China has reported 8 outbreaks of PPR, initially in the northwestern province Xinjiang, spreading eastwards into 3 other provinces. See interactive map (click to centre, zoom-in) at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14492.

China's 2 current follow-up reports, submitted on 2 consecutive days and reporting PPR outbreaks in 2 separate provinces (locations on maps in the 2 source URL's), illustrate the rapid and wide spread of the virus. According to the current and previous reports, China's PPR control policy is based upon stamping out without vaccination combined with quarantine measures.

This moderator is not aware of a country which has managed to definitely eradicate or even control PPR without vaccination, but stands to be corrected. China may be compelled to apply, as soon as possible, PPR vaccine to protect its susceptible sheep (143 680 000) and goat (141 361 000) populations (2012 OIE data) against this devastating viral disease. - Mod.AS
