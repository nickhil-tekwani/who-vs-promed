The following is updated information on the above Porcine Myocarditis.
The syndrome, called Porcine Myocarditis (PMC) only affects newborn piglets
and those up to 5 weeks of age. The disease appears to be previously unknown.
PMC has been limited to 2 piggeries in NSW, both of which are owned and
operated by the same company. The properties are under movement controls
with strict protocols in place. The disease has been listed as a notifiable
disease under the NSW Stock Diseases Act.
Clinically PMC presents as an increase in stillbirths and pre-weaning
mortalities. There is also a variable but significant increase in the
incidence of mummified foetuses. The gross pathological changes consist of
small pale areas in the myocardium. There is often evidence of cardiac
enlargement and an increase in the volume of body fluids, consistent with
congestive heart failure. Histologically there is a non-suppurative
myocarditis. It is believed that the syndrome is due to a viral infection
predominantly, if not exclusively, occurring in utero.
Animal health scientists and epidemiologists from Australian Animal Health
Laboratory (AAHL), NSW Agriculture, and Australia's Department of
Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries have determined that PMC is not a
recognized exotic or endemic disease.
Extensive laboratory investigations utilising virus isolation, antigen
detection, PCR, and serology have excluded PCV2 infection and a wide range
of endemic and exotic viral infections of pigs. Endemic agents also
excluded that have been previously identified in pigs in some locations in
Australia include EMC, porcine parvovirus, PCV1, PCV2, and BVDV.
Exotic agents excluded include FMD, PRRS, Aujesky's disease, classical
swine fever, and Menangle virus.
Electron microscopy on affected myocardium has detected small virus-like
particles ranging from 19-27 nm. Virologists at EMAI have cultured an
unidentified cytopathic agent from several affected pigs' hearts and
lungs. It is fastidious in its growth requirements. Further work is
underway to (a) establish that the isolate is, in fact, associated with the
disease and (b) to characterise it. The epidemiology and clinical
expression of this disease is consistent with the introduction or emergence
of a new infectious agent into a fully susceptible population.
PMC is already resolving itself, with piglet losses due to the disease
approaching zero.
Despite rigorous scientific investigation, there has been no evidence of
PMC in piglets over 5 weeks of age. No impact on human health or food
safety has been identified. Pigs grown to market weight have shown no sign
of the disease at slaughter.
Research continues in order to identify the exact cause of PMC
