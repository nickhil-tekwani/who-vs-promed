Epidemiological Models: Comments on the Nature of a Viral Host
--------------------------------------------------
[Different interpretations have been placed on the demonstration by Martina
et al. of experimental SARS virus infection of cats and ferrets (see: SARS
- worldwide (181): host range 20031030.2701). My presumption has been that
Martina et al. did not suggest that either ferrets or domestic cats are
alternate reservoirs of the SARS coronavirus. Rather, their intention was
to demonstrate experimentally that many animal species (not just captive
raccoon dogs and civet cats) might transmit SARS coronavirus and that it is
premature to jump to conclusions about the source of SARS coronavirus
infection on the basis of rather arbitrary studies of captive animals in
Chinese markets.
My assumption has been that ferrets and cats were used in these experiments
because these animals were available and convenient laboratory subjects.
Dr. Ruedas presents a critique of these experiments from the standpoint of
the discipline of Medical Ecology, which although mathematical in content,
deserves consideration. - Mod.CP]
In their brief communication on SARS virus infection in wild animals (ref.
1) indicated that -- based on their findings -- distantly related
carnivores (in their instance, ferrets and cats) could act as reservoirs
for the SARS coronavirus (SCV). There are some potential pitfalls in their
reasoning. Susceptibility is defined in medical terms as diminished
immunity to a disease, especially an infection, or not having immunity to
an infectious disease and thus [being] at risk of infection (ref 2). Can a
reservoir, or host species, be susceptible to the virus it hosts? In
certain instances of host-parasite co-evolutionary frameworks, the answer
is yes: a malarial protozoan, _Plasmodium_, is conferred evolutionary
advantage if its human host is incapacitated, because a healthy human
easily could evade a mosquito, the flight speed of which is estimated at 5
to 7 Km/h. Incapacitation of the host therefore increases the feeding
opportunities for the mosquitoes and perpetuates the epidemic and enzootic
cycles of malaria. In such a system, the vectorial capacity equation of
Macdonald (ref. 3) may be arranged (ref. 4) to, VC = ma (P/F)(e^(-n/E))E
where: ma = number of bites per human per day (estimated from human bait
catches); P = proportion of blood meals taken on human hosts; F = days
between blood meals (from lab studies); n = extrinsic incubation period
(lab studies); and E = vector's life expectancy.
It may be readily appreciated that incapacitation will significantly
increase ma and P, hence the vectorial capacity will be significantly
enhanced, to the benefit of _Plasmodium_. Anderson and May (ref. 5) listed
a number of complicating factors in this system including the effects of
longevity (on both human host and vector): decreased life-span in the human
significantly impacts the dynamics of the disease (e.g., their mu [defined
in next paragraph] less than 1 percent in equation 14.7 et seq.).
A directly transmitted zoonosis such as SARS is at once a simpler and more
complicated framework to model. A basic SIR
(susceptible-infected-recovered) model of disease dynamics (ref. 6)
consists of the 3 host cell categories (complicating for age, a, at time,
t), thus: N(a, t) = X(a, t) + Y(a, t) + Z(a, t), where X, Y, and Z
correspond to populations of each of the modeled categories (SIR); an
additional category for a latent category (infected but not infectious), H,
may be added. A basic set of differential equations describing this
framework (ref. 5) is beyond the scope of this correspondence, but includes
age-specific host death rate mu, recovery rate upsilon, disease induced
mortality rate alpha, and a "force of infection" component, lambda. An
ideal host species for a directly transmitted viral disease would have a
negligible age-specific or otherwise alpha(a), hence upsilon(a) would be an
irrelevant component of the epidemiological dynamics.
In such a situation, the total number of hosts, N, is not equivalent to the
traditional equation shown above, rather Z ~= 0, and Y would be a
proportion of X, but because alpha(a) ~= 0, (i.e., mu + alpha ~= mu) the
entire host population N can be uniformly modeled.
An additional biological factor critical to adequate representation of the
system is the basic reproductive rate, Rsub0, of the virus. Although
technically this should represent the intrinsic reproductive rate of an
organism, in terms of its representation in disease dynamics, Rsub0
generally is symbolic of infections produced by an infected, infectious
host or victim -- given that evolutionarily a virus is dead if it does not
colonize a new host. In order to establish itself in a host (or victim)
population -- or establish an equilibrium -- a virus would within this
framework have Rsub0 > 1. Departures from equilibrium lead to R,
the effective reproductive rate, discounted by the fraction of the host
population being susceptible, x*, where R = Rsub0x* =1. Anderson and May
(ref. 5) lucidly pointed out that Rsub0 must be proportional to the number
(or density) of hosts candidate for infection such that Rsub0 = N/NsubT,
where N is the population size and NsubT the threshold magnitude. For
condition Rsub0 > 1, the corollary condition N > NsubT must hold.
Synthesizing, it can readily be appreciated that a certain minimal number
of intrinsic biological factors determine the suitability of an organism to
be a potential host for a given virus. In the situation described by
Martina et al. (ref. 1) it is clear that the ferret cannot in any way be
considered a host. This is because the disease-induced mortality rate
alpha, as Martina et al (ref. 1) suggest, would be so high that the total
population mortality rate alpha+mu would not support the disease dynamics
in a sustainable manner. Furthermore, ferrets exist in the wild in
extremely low numbers (ref. 7). Hence the directly transmitted SCV would
have an even lesser probability of transmission given the density-dependent
dynamics of the epidemiological framework.
There is, of course, a more essential flaw: the name _Mustela furo_ applies
to domestic ferrets only. These animals are reproductively -- hence
genetically -- identical to _M. putorius_, the polecat. That is to say, _M.
furo_ as a species does not really exist, being no more than a series of
individuals drawn from _M. putorius_. The natural range of _M. putorius_ is
most of Europe east to the Ural Mountains. (ref. 8). Therefore, even were
it not for the epidemiological dynamic considerations alluded to above, _M.
"furo"_ perforce cannot be considered a potential host for SCV. If _M.
"furo"_ are available in markets in Guangdong these are, by definition,
imported, and beg the question: why is there no SARS in Europe? An allied
species occupying a range including the epicenter of the SARS epidemic
(ref. 8, 9), _M. sibirica_, could be considered as a potential host.
However, the low densities prevalent in _M. putorius_ likewise exist in _M.
sibirica_ and indeed in all species of the genus _Mustela_. As a
consequence of the foregoing, mustelids it would seem should be discounted
as hosts of SCV.
In contrast, the situation reported by Martina et al. (ref. 1) regarding
cats is far more worthy of note. The correct name (by first designation)
applicable to these organisms is _Felis catus_ (ref. 8) (by Linnaeus in
1758), rather than _F. silvestris_ (by Schreber in 1775) or _F. domesticus_
(by Erxleben in 1777), all of which, despite their distinct names, cona = 0
makes for highly effective transmission dynamics, as has been shown in
hantaviruses and their rodent hosts (ref. 10).
The typically exponential rise in proportion of infected hosts P(t), has
been shown (ref. 5) to depend on the rate at which new infectives are being
produced, lambda, such that P(t) = P(0)exp(lambda t). Furthermore, the
biological quality lambda, depends on Rsub0 and on the parasite lifespan,
D, such that lambda = (Rsub0 - 1)/D. Finally, in a host-virus framework
such as SARS, D represents the duration of infectiousness; however, for
chronically infected hosts (e.g., rodent hosts of Hantaviruses) D is
effectively equivalent to the life-span of the host since the host is
infected for life and sheds virus for life. Recall that in ferrets, D is
severely curtailed by SCV infection due to the high mortality rate, alpha.
In contrast, if cats are asymptomatically infected, alpha = 0, and if they
are shown to be capable of chronic infection with a magnitude of D
equivalent to their life-span (2-5 years in the wild and 12-14 years as
pets), then the epidemiological potential of cats-SCV vis-a-vis humans-SARS
would be of enormous extent. For these reasons, _Felis catus_ also must be
discounted from consideration as the natural host of SCV. If it were the
natural host, SCV and the consequent SARS infection of humans would be a
quotidian affair on a global scale. Instead, it is arguably the first
emergent infection of the 21st century with a focus in Guangzhou, Guangdong
province, China. The fact that _F. catus_ is capable of asymptomatic
transmission is, however, highly suggestive that perhaps another felid
could be the host. In the focal area, the wild species _Prionailurus
bengalensis_ (leopard cat) and _Catopuma temmincki_ (Golden cat) both
occur, although the range of the former, including most of India,
Indochina, and the Greater Sunda islands, makes it an unlikely candidate
species for the natural host of SARS.
Mathematical models representing epidemiological frameworks are of
tremendous heuristic utility, as was recently shown in the pages of the
journal Nature with respect to smallpox (ref. 6). These frameworks can and
should also be used to determine probabilities of particular species being
hosts, given certain minimal biological properties inherent to the species
(e.g., geographic range). Medical ecology, integrating as it does disparate
fields from mathematics, across epidemiology and medicine, to basic and
applied ecology, has much to offer in the search for viral hosts: because
of the medical impact of SARS on humans, discounting from consideration
species that cannot be potential hosts is of particular importance in
elucidating the epidemiology of this fascinating disease. Furthermore,
given that cats are able to be infected but -- unlike humans -- do not
manifest any clinical sign of disease, they are not an adequate animal
model for testing therapies against the human virus.

[While on the whole, Martina et al. concentrated on the potential use of
cats and ferrets as animal models to test antiviral drugs or vaccines
against the SARS coronavirus (SCV), they made certain bold comments that
deserved questioning. In their first paragraph, they indicated that --
based on the data they presented -- the reservoir for SCV could potentially
involve a large number of animal species.
Secondly -- and most importantly -- they indicated that their data
supported the use of cats and ferrets as model animals. Dr. Ruedas seized
on these items and argued from the perspective of mathematical epidemiology
that neither species should be considered either as the natural host or as
an animal model. Ruedas argued that the data provided by Martina et al.
strongly argue in favor of considering a wild felid as a potential natural
host, but the domestic cat would have caused human cases of SARS over a
broad geographic area long before had it been the host.
Ferrets, Ruedas argues, also are unlikely hosts due to their population
biology: their densities are likely too low to support an enzootic cycle of
SCV transmission. In addition, the ferret species examined in the Martina
et al. paper does not naturally occur in China. The jury is still out on
whether ferrets should be considered animal models. By Martina et al.'s
own admission, although a large number of their 6 experimental ferrets died
post-inoculation, none died of SARS or SARS-associated symptoms. Since
none of the animals displayed chronic infection, the dynamics of the
disease to some extent mirror those of humans. As such, ferrets should
remain under consideration. However, the small sample size and high
mortality from other causes (hepatic lipidosis and emaciation) for now
preclude definitive conclusions. - Mod.CP]
