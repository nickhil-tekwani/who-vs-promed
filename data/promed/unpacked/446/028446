SARCOCYSTIC NEURONA IN OPOSSUMS
===============================
Subject: Sacrocystic Neurona in Didelphis virginiana
Recently a friend of mine with horses (and opossums in her barn)
asked me about an article published in Equus, 1/96 issue. The
article was entitled "Beating EPM" and was submitted by researchers
at UCD School of Vet Med, U. of KY and U of Fla. The only name
attached to the paper was the researcher at Fla (McKay).
The article reports the finding of a protozoan called Sacrocystic
neurona [sic, Sarcocyctic?], that is transmitted by grackles and
brownheaded cowbirds to the opossum, where it can last in sporocyst
form in the fecals for up to a year (lab conditions I assume).
Horses pick it up from ingesting eggs from tainted hay, and the only
treatment is bactrim and deraprim for a lengthy regimen (4 months
or so, as relapse is common after typical 3 week regimen). Equines
which do not develop immunity cannot live with the disease, as once
it enters circulatory system it quickly breaks through the blood-
brain barrier to do CNS damage. Treatment at this stage is still
possible, but costs around $800./mo, so the total outlay to save an
infected animal is more than considerable.
Stephen Potkay reported in The Biology of Marsupials, Hunsaker, 1977
a protozoan Sarcocystis garnhami (or other varieties) found in Didelphis
virginiana. I have seen no other references to these, and the above
article suggested that they may be related.
We have many (doesn't everyone) starlings and cowbirds in the area,
and the opossums living in said barn leave stools all over the stacked
hay. Unfortunately, the hay cannot be stacked vertically but is
horizontal, so affected layers cannott be removed. It is tarped.
For anyone with information, my questions are:
[1] Are there any figures available with which to extrapolate rate of
occurence/infection among pops of D. virginiana? In what geographic
regions has this been found?
[2] Potkay's meager findings reported that symptoms were inapparent in opossum
carriers, and that only with heavily infected animals, grey-white streaks
were visible in affected muscle tissue at pathology. Findings still hold?
True with this strain (if different) as well?
[3] Are there any prophylactic measures that can be taken with the resident
equines?
Thanks for any info.
