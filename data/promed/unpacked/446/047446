[The disease seems to continue its spread in the northwestern region
of Libya, where at least 8 foci have been recorded so far and
stamping-out policy is reportedly applied now in cattle. The crucial
question is, whether the virus -- which had penetrated into Libya
(from where?) at least 8 weeks before its first reporting to the OIE,
on 18 Jun 2003 -- is present also in the large populations of sheep
and goats.
It would be useful to be informed whether FMD serotype SAT 2
vaccination is considered in Libya, and what preventive steps
(vaccination included?) are being applied by its neighbouring
countries. - Mod.AS]
