U.N. bird flu expert to battle North Korea outbreaks
-----------------------------------------------
A top United Nations bird flu expert has flown to North Korea to help
assess and contain outbreaks of the disease among poultry in the state, the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Wednesday [30 Mar 2005].
Hans Wagner, a senior FAO official based in Bangkok, who has played a
prominent role in Asia's battle against the deadly H5N1 virus, flew to
Pyongyang on Tuesday [29 Mar 2005], a day after North Korea told the agency
of outbreaks without saying which strain caused them.
He will be joined soon by 2 FAO consultants from China and Australia who
are part of a regional network set up to fight the H5N1 strain, which has
killed 49 people in Asia since late 2003, 16 since the virus erupted anew
in December 2004.
"They will look at the strategies being set up by the government and also
bring some supplies," FAO spokesman Diderik de Vleeschauwer told Reuters.
North Korea said on Sunday [27 Mar 2005] that it had culled hundreds of
thousands of birds, after avian influenza hit 2 farms in Pyongyang, but,
did not say whether the bird flu virus was the H5N1 strain which can jump
from birds to humans.
The FAO has sent avian flu diagnostic kits to North Korea, where the agency
already has a project to upgrade veterinary laboratories, provide
equipment, and create a network for sharing information on the disease.
Poultry production was one of a few growing sectors in North Korea, where
many people are short of food and the supply of animal protein is very
limited, the FAO said. North Korean farms produced 25.5 million birds in
2004, about 2 times more than in 1997.
South Korea, which has stepped up quarantine measures at border points and
at poultry farms near the border, believes the outbreaks in North Korea are
extensive.
De Vleeschauwer said it was too early for the FAO team to give its
assessment, but he said the North Koreans were being "open and transparent.
They are willing to work with FAO and they realize this is a serious
situation," he said.
It is the 1st time North Korea has confirmed an outbreak of bird flu, and
the fear is that it will prove to be the H5N1 virus, which has proven
extremely difficult to stamp out in China, Thailand, Viet Nam and Indonesia.
The FAO says bird flu is now endemic in the region, and experts no longer
talk about eradicating it. Now, they just hope to contain it before it
mutates into a form that can pass between humans easily and set off a
global pandemic, which could kill millions of people with no immunity to
the new strain.
The FAO team is expected to stay in North Korea until next week [1st week
April 2005]. The agency is also working with the government to hold a
national bird flu workshop soon to improve awareness and control methods
and to promote good farming practices.

North Korea may have culled 10 million chickens over bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
North Korea may have culled as many as 10 million chickens in the Pyongyang
area alone, following the recent outbreak of bird flu in the country, the
South Korean daily Donga Ilbo reported on Wednesday [30 Mar 2005].
Citing informed sources who met with recent visitors to North Korea, the
report said North Korea is said to have culled all chickens bred in the
Pyongyang area to prevent the spread of the disease.

North Korea Fights against the Bird Flu
-------------------
On Tuesday [29 Mar 2005], the North Korean Central News Agency disclosed
images of epidemic control officials sterilizing the chicken factory where
the bird flu outbreak was reported. On the same day, the South Korean
government handed over a notification over to the North through Panmunjeom,
asking for information concerning the bird flu outbreak and also expressing
its intention to help in any way possible.

[The discrepancy between data cited in different newswires dealing with the
North Korea AI situation illuminates the need for an official report.
Published data, such as culling figures, remain ambiguous. For comparison:
during the H5N1 epizootic in South Korea, December 2003 - March 2004, 19
outbreaks were recorded; the total number of affected and culled birds
(chickens and ducks) officially (and timely) reported was 399 898. - Mod.AS]
