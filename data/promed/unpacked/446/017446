The piece on target leaf spot of cucumber (see below) that was posted on 21
Jan 2003 indicated that the disease occurred in Korea. There are 2 Korean
geopolitical entities, North Korea and South Korea. The disease occurred in
the South Korean provinces of Chonnam and Gyeongnam.

Do any of our readers have information on whether target leaf spot occurs
in North Korea? Please let me know if you have information on this disease.
