At least 48 people have died in a fresh outbreak of cholera that has
infected about 3000 people in Mozambique's northern Cabo Delgado province,
an official said on Friday. New cholera outbreaks have hit the coastal
districts of Macomia and Mocimboa da Praia, and the provincial capital
Pemba, deputy national health director Avertino Barreto told AFP. Macomia
has seen the highest death toll (29), with another 16 deaths in Mocimboa da
Praia and 3 in Pemba, he said. But Barreto said Mocimboa da Praia town and
the surrounding area required more attention because of its poor water supply.
No new cases of the waterborne disease have been reported elsewhere in this
south eastern African state, where cholera is endemic with more outbreaks
usually during the rainy season. In the past 2 years, hundreds of people
have died of cholera in southern and central Mozambique following
catastrophic floods. This year, Mozambique faces drought instead, along
with neighboring Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Cholera claims 62 lives in northern Mozambique
----------------------------------------------
62 people have died of cholera in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo
Delgado, neighboring on Tanzania, since an outbreak of the disease began on
5 Jan 2002, the Maputo daily "Noticias" reported on Monday. Of that figure,
28 deaths were reported in Macomia district, where 503 cases were
diagnosed, while 25 others died in Mocimboa da Praia district, out of 1460
cases reported.
Two more victims were from the district of Namuno, where 329 cases have
been reported. This was also the place where the first case was diagnosed
on 5 Jan 2002. Other affected districts include Quissanga, and the
provincial capital Pemba, with 1072 and 379 cases, which resulted in 3 and
4 deaths, respectively. Local health authorities are worried that the
epidemic may spread to Mueda district, and have thus launched awareness
campaigns there.
Henrique Pinto, chief of the community health department at the provincial
health directorate, said that the situation is stabilizing in most
districts, particularly in those where the first cases were reported. The
outbreak of the disease is blamed on inadequate access to supplies of clean
drinking water.
