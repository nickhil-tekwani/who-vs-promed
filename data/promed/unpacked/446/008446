A magisterial inquiry has been ordered after over 170 persons were hospitalized with suspected food poisoning after they consumed food at a government function in Karbi Anglong attended by a chief minister and health minister. A 35 year old man who reportedly attended the program in Diphu on Tuesday [2 Feb 2021] died at his residence.

"Frankly, it looks like a case of food poisoning," Ng Chandra Dhwaj Singha, deputy commissioner, Karbi Anglong, told EastMojo. "We have sent the food samples to Guwahati Medical College and Hospital." According to Singha, 198 people reported sick on Tuesday [2 Feb 2021]. They were all part of the program to launch the 1st academic session of the MBBS at the new Diphu Medical College and Hospital and were handed 2 food packets, including one with sweet and other snacks and another one, which had egg biryani.

Sumitra Hagjer, principal, DMCH, said over 130 persons who reported sick with stomach cramps, vomiting, or diarrhea were admitted initially. "Right now, we have 35 patients who are admitted. They will be discharged tomorrow," she said.

Singha said a 35 year old from the Bokolia Police Station area who was reportedly part of the meeting died at his residence. "We are inquiring into the exact cause of his death. The post-mortem report will be out tomorrow [Thu 4 Feb 2021]." Singha said he has ordered a magisterial inquiry to investigate the incident.

"It is still not clear where the food came from," an official said. "Some say biryani was brought in from Guwahati. Some say it was locally prepared."

[The cause of this outbreak of foodborne illness in Assam is not stated. However, it seems that because the illnesses began with gastrointestinal symptoms on the same day as the meeting, the cause is likely either a preformed bacterial toxin disease, such as staphylococcal food poisoning, or chemical poisoning. - Mod.LL

ProMED would appreciate further information about this outbreak as details emerge. - Mod.SH
