On 25 Aug 2008, the National Institute of Research Development for
Microbiology and Immunology (the "Cantacuzino" Institute) in
Bucharest, Romania reported the detection of IgM antibodies against
West Nile virus in the serum of a male patient in his mid 40s, from
Braila town (Braila County, south eastern Romania).

Case report
-----------
Clinical data
-------------
On 3 Aug 2008 the patient fell ill with fever between 38 and 39 deg C
[100.4-102.2 deg F], severe headache, macula-papular exanthema,
vomiting, diarrhea, and ocular aches. His symptoms worsened and 5
days later he was admitted to the infectious disease section of the
local hospital with moderate clinical symptoms of meningitis. A
possible rickettsiosis was diagnosed and he received doxycycline and
symptomatic treatment. The patient fully recovered and was discharged
on 15 Aug [2008]. Patient history revealed that he had gone fishing 2
weeks before the onset of disease, in Gropeni village in Braila
County, on the shores of the Danube River where IgG against West Nile
virus had been detected in horses in 2007.

Laboratory findings
-------------------
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampled at time of admission was clear, the
cell count was 20 per mm3 with 100 percent lymphocytes. Leptospirosis
was considered as differential diagnosis but the slide agglutination
test was negative. Samples were sent to "Cantacuzino" Institute on 18
Aug [2008] for further testing for _Rickettsia conorii_, however, the
immunofluorescence test was negative. Although the samples had been
sent only for the diagnosis of a rickettsial disease, they were also
tested for antibodies against West Nile virus, according to the
requirements of the surveillance system for West Nile fever [1]. IgM
antibodies against West Nile virus in the patient's serum were
detected on 25 Aug [2008], the positive result of the CSF sampled at
the time of hospital admission was obtained on 3 Sep [2008]. The case
was thus confirmed according to the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (ECDC) case definition.

Epidemiological investigations
------------------------------
The local public health authority (PHA) of Braila sampled mosquitoes
in the village where the patient had been fishing. The samples sent
on 4 Sep [2008] to the "Cantacuzino" Institute tested negative.

Epidemiologists checked the consultation registry at the infectious
disease hospital in Braila and at the general practitioner (GP)
clinic in the village where the patient had been fishing, searching
for patients presenting with the symptoms of "fever and exanthema"
between 15 Jul-26 Aug [2008]. This led to the detection of a female
patient who had been hospitalised at the infectious disease centre on
20 Aug [2008] and reported to the Centre for Prevention and Control
of Communicable Diseases, Public Health Institute of Bucharest on 2
Sep [2008]. Her blood was tested for antibodies against West Nile
virus and _R. conorii_. The test results were negative for IgM antibodies.

Information about the mortality in birds and horses in the area as
well as results from surveillance for the presence of West Nile virus
in birds and animals, performed in 2008, was requested from the local
(Braila Sanitary-Veterinary Direction - SVD), the national veterinary
authorities (National Sanitary-Veterinary Authority and Food Safety),
and the Diagnostic Institute for Animal Health. All veterinary
institutions were also notified about the human case.

Immediate control measures on local level
-----------------------------------------
Doctors at the infectious disease hospital in Braila and the village
GP were informed about the case and asked to perform serum
investigation for West Nile virus in patients presenting with fever
associated with exanthema, without a known cause. The administrative
authorities of the 2 localities were also notified about the case, as
they are responsible for specific control measures against
mosquitoes. Health education campaigns for the general population
included messages about informing a physician in case of sickness
(fever and rash) and taking protective measures (clothing,
repellents) for mosquito bites and sanitary measures in and around
their living space.

Risk assessment and implications for the future
-----------------------------------------------
A risk analysis of the current situation performed by the specialists
of the Centre for Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases
(CPCCD) on 1 Sep [2008] concluded that Braila County is one of the
counties in Romania with a risk for the occurrence of West Nile
virus. Climatic conditions, temperature, humidity (rain, soil
humidity, natural water reservoirs such as the Danube delta), and the
presence of migratory and indigenous wild birds and horses favour the
existence and multiplication of the _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes.
Considering this and the recent detection of a human case of West
Nile virus infection several measures were proposed by the CPCCD specialists:
- In the area of Gropeni [village], which is currently the only
remaining area at risk, regular surveillance of the mosquito
population will continue and samples will be sent for analysis to
"Cantacuzino" Institute.
- A serum survey in the human population is needed in order to
identify the infection among the population of the Gropeni area.
- The County Haematological Centres are not equipped to detect the
West Nile virus in donated blood, therefore a temporary suspension
for blood donation from people of the village of Gropeni was
recommended until the end of October 2008.
- A decision to prolong this period to extend temporary suspension of
blood donation might be taken on the basis of monitoring climatic
conditions and mosquito population from Gropeni area.
- Serum testing of random samples from the serum deposits of the
Braila Haematological Centre from blood donated in August [2008]
should be undertaken to collect additional information regarding the
current situation.

West Nile virus surveillance in Romania
---------------------------------------
The vector for West Nile virus present in Romania is _Culex_ spp.
(_Cx. molestus / pipiens_), which is active from May to October each
year. Since 1997, active surveillance for West Nile virus in humans,
has been performed between the months of May and October in all
counties along the river Danube, including Bucharest. Furthermore,
surveillance is ongoing in wild birds and horses. Humans with
clinical symptoms of meningitis and clear CSF are tested for the
presence of IgM antibodies against West Nile virus. Suspected and
positive cases are mandatorily notifiable (1). From the start of
active surveillance in the current season [2008] only 6 probable
meningitis cases with clear CSF have been reported, however, all were
negative for West Nile virus antibodies. No systematic serosurveys
have been undertaken neither from patients presenting with what might
have been atypical symptoms of West Nile fever, nor from the general
population in Braila County. No systematic surveillance exists
regarding the presence of West Nile virus in mosquitoes.

Results from Braila County
--------------------------
In the last 10 years there were 2 confirmed human cases with West
Nile fever symptoms in the county of Braila, one in 1997 and the
other in 2001. In both cases the examination of the CSF showed clear
[liquid] and signs of meningitis.

Serology studies undertaken in 2007 in horses demonstrated the
presence of West Nile virus infection (unpublished data,
communication by SVD Braila). Braila County was among the counties
included in the studies. Serum samples were taken from horses in 5
towns, 2 of them neighboring Gropeni village where the patient had
gone fishing. Out of 23 serum samples taken, 13 were positive showing
IgG antibodies against the West Nile virus (unpublished data).
According to experts of the Braila SVD bird mortality in 2007 was not
higher compared to past years.

Conclusion
----------
3 cases of West Nile virus infection detected in Braila County in the
past decade together with animal data demonstrate that there is a
risk of infection in humans resulting from mosquito bites in this
area. In the current case the probability that the patient had
acquired the infection in the town where he resided was considered
low because there mosquito control measures had been carried out
twice in 2008. Therefore he was thought to have been infected while
fishing in an area where there is a high density of mosquitoes and
measures for mosquito extermination are not practised. This
highlights the need for systematic vector control measures in the
affected area and for education of the population regarding the
necessary mechanical (such as long sleeved shirts and pants) and/or
chemical protection (repellents) while fishing or pursuing other
recreational or occupational activities.

[Romania has had sporadic cases and outbreaks of West Nile virus
infections in the past. As Mod.CP commented in ProMED-mail post
20010731.1499, "A major epidemic of West Nile virus neurologic
manifestations occurred in Bucharest and southeastern Romania in
1996. In total, 393 patients with serologically confirmed or probable
West Nile virus infection were identified, of whom 352 had acute
central nervous system infections, and 17 patients older than 50
years died. Fatality/case ratio and disease incidence increased with age.

"The outbreak was confined to 14 districts in the lower Danube valley
and Bucharest (attack rate 12.4/100 000 people) with a seroprevalence
of 4.1 percent. West Nile virus was recovered from _Culex pipiens_
mosquitoes, the most likely vector, and antibodies to West Nile virus
were found in 41 percent of domestic fowl. In subsequent years,
neurologic infections were diagnosed serologically as West Nile virus
encephalitis in a small number of patients in 19 southeastern
districts and in Bucharest.

"Sentinel chickens placed in Bucharest seroconverted to West Nile
virus during the summer months. The continued occurrence of sporadic
West Nile virus infections in southeastern Romania in consecutive
years after the 1996 epidemic is consistent with local enzootic
transmission of the virus."
