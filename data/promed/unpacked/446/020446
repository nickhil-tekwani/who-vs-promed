An anthrax outbreak has been reported on farms in the Harare metropolitan
area, the Veterinary Services Department said on Thursday.
Principal veterinary officer, Anne Mujeyi, said that the cases were
detected when 3 cattle died of the disease early this week. "We picked up
cases of anthrax in the Harare metropolitan area this week," she said. "The
1st case was recorded at an agricultural engineering farm next to Hatcliffe
on Monday, while 2 others were recorded on Tuesday at the Harare City
Council farm in Crowborough and Winsbury plot in Mt Hampden."
Mujeyi said veterinary officers were immediately dispatched to the affected
areas and had since vaccinated all the cattle. She said the affected areas
recorded anthrax outbreaks in 2004 and had carried out vaccinations in
February 2005.
Mujeyi said the affected farms had since been quarantined to avoid
spreading the contagious disease [see Mod. comment below]. She added that
anthrax in human beings had also been detected in Masvingo and Chihota
communal area where one animal died this month.
"We have discovered that there is no active infection within the livestock
in these areas but that the affected people consumed the preserved meat
from cattle that died of anthrax during 2004," she said. She advised the
public not to eat meat from animals that would have died on their own or
buy meat from dubious sources.
Mujeyi also expressed hope that no further infections would be recorded in
Harare within the next 3 weeks, the time it took for animals to build up
antibodies to fight off the disease after vaccination.
Zimbabwe has lost a number of cattle over the years to anthrax, which is
fatal but curable. [And controllable. - Mod.MHJ]

[There are a number of odd aspects to this report. Normally anthrax is
rarely seen in commercial herds in Africa because of the higher level of
management practiced and regular vaccinations. With normal vaccination in
February 2005 using a valid Sterne vaccine, these animals should have been
fully protected. However, if the animals were not in good condition when
vaccinated, any immunity developed would have been minimal.
Anthrax is not a contagious disease. Post-outbreak herd quarantine is to
stop animals leaving the farm that are incubating the disease and before
the vaccine protection has kicked in. With Sterne it is frankly rare to see
deaths from anthrax more than 8 days after vaccination; normal development
of immunity is faster than Dr Mujeyi states.
The most efficient way to control anthrax in cattle herds is (1) to
properly and quickly deal with the affected carcasses; (2) to treat the
survivors with a long-acting antibiotic (such as LA200, but use normal
penicillin with horses, as LA200 is painful); and (3) to wait 7-10 days
before vaccinating with Sterne or another recognised live vaccine.
Simultaneous treatment with antibiotics and Sterne only results in killing
the live vaccine and any incubating infections without any medium-term
benefits.
The report of human cases from consuming "preserved meat" follows from the
need of farm managers -- usually poor relatives of the farm owner -- having
to prove that any missing animals had died and had not been sold or given
away. Thus animals dying are skinned; the meat is stripped from the carcass
and sun-dried; and the head, hide and dried meat are available to the owner
when he or she later visits the farm. This handling maximises the number of
spores in these products. - Mod.MHJ]
