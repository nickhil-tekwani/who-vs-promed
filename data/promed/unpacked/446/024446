The _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ which caused the recent outbreak associated
with oysters has been identified as "a virulent strain called 03:K6" This
strain was the only one found in individuals who became ill from eating raw
oysters from Galveston Bay. This strain has not previously been identified
in U.S. waters but is common in South East Asia. A connection with ballast
water discharged from ships is considered a strong possibility according to
Dr. George Hofkin of the US Food and Drug Administration, who is involved
in the investigation of this outbreak.
Comparative situations mentioned were:
- the detection of the bacterium which causes cholera in oysters from
Alabama's Mobile Bay a few years ago, traced to ballast water (taken on to
stabilize ships during ocean passages) which was dumped from ships which
had been to Peru where a major outbreak had occurred,
- Zebra mussels carried to the Great Lakes from foreign ports via ballast
water dumped in US waters.
Footnote: The Houston ship channel, which is 40 ft deep, passes through
Galveston Bay, which ranges in depth from a few feet to around 15 feet. A
number of rivers empty into Galveston Bay, so that rain anywhere in the
watershed flows to Galveston Bay and then on to the Gulf of Mexico. Lack
of rain prior to this outbreak had created conditions in which there was
very little movement of water in the bay.
