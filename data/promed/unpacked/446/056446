The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Ho Chi Minh City said that the city has recorded a total of 6358 hand-foot-mouth infection cases from the beginning of the year [2020], said Dr. Le Hong Nga from the center yesterday [2 Oct 2020].

Hand, foot, and mouth disease has raised alarm in Ho Chi Minh City, with up to 640 new cases reported in the last week of September 2020, highest compared to previous months.

Districts that documented a sharp increase in infections during the week include District 9, District 12, Tan Phu District, and Binh Chanh District.

According to Dr. Hong Nga, the risks of transmission are high at places with many children such as kindergartens or nurseries. As the new academic year has just started, possible outbreaks may occur everywhere in the city; therefore, parents should take their children to nearby medical clinics when their children have symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease. Moreover, the child should be kept at home to prevent the spread.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is usually caused by enterovirus. At present, there are no vaccines to protect against the illness.

In related news on the same day, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the Central Highlands Province of Lam Dong said that 774 cases of dengue have been reported across the province, mostly in districts Duc Trong with 287 cases, Da Teh, Bao Lam and Bao Loc Town.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a highly contagious, worldwide viral illness that affects predominantly children. It is caused by several enteroviruses, such as coxsackieviruses A6, A10, A16 and enterovirus 71. In most cases, HFMD follows a benign and self-limiting course.

In Viet Nam, the epidemiology of HFMD is complex, but EV71 is responsible for nearly half of the infections in those who have tested positive for HFMD. Typically, HFMD sporadically occurs across Viet Nam but remains most concentrated in the Southern and Central provinces.

In Viet Nam, HFMD occurs throughout the year, but the peak season is from March until May and September to December. Children can get HFMD at all ages, but children below 3 years are more susceptible, as they have not developed immunity against the virus.

HFMD caused by coxsackievirus (A16) is usually mild, and children will recover spontaneously after 7-10 days. Sometimes the disease can last a bit longer, but severe complications are rare. Mouth sores may cause children to refuse to eat and drink, resulting in dehydration, fatigue, and low blood sugar. If that is the case, the child needs to be admitted to the hospital to receive fluids and food intravenously.

HFMD caused by EV71 can be more serious, with sometimes severe complications. The most common ones are neurological (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis), but, fortunately, these are rare.

The viruses can be found in the nasal secretions, saliva, fluid in the sores, and stools. HFMD spreads through close contact, coughing and sneezing, or touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. A person is most contagious during the 1st week after the onset of symptoms. After recovery, the virus can persist in the body for weeks, meaning that a child can still spread the disease.

Other children may not show any symptoms, but they may still transmit the virus to others.
