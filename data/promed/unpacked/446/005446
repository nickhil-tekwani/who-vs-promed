Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease confirmed in Elderly Man
----------------------------------------------------------
Estimates of the scale of a possible [new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (vCJD) epidemic in the UK are being reassessed, following the death
of a 74-year-old man from the disease. Until now, all the known victims of
[new vCJD - the human form of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or
"mad cow" disease) - have been aged between 12 and 55 years of age.
Scientists at the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh have now
confirmed that the man, who died last year and is believed to have been
from North Yorkshire, was suffering from the brain disease. His death has
triggered questions about whether a larger section of society than
initially thought could be vulnerable to the disease. The disease was not
diagnosed before the man's death, and there is growing concern that other
cases of vCJD among the elderly may be going undetected.
The symptoms of vCJD are similar to those of dementia, and the post-mortem
tissue analysis required to diagnose vCJD has not been carried out with
elderly people. Professor Roy Anderson, Director of the Wellcome Trust
Centre for the Epidemiology of Infectious Disease, indicated that a rethink
about the predicted size of a possible epidemic was necessary. He told "The
Independent" that he and his group were reexamining their previous
analysis, because they been misguided to some extent by the clustering of
cases in the younger age groups. This one case somewhat changes that view.
Since the first cases were confirmed in 1995, the number of victims had
been rising steadily. This latest case brings the total number to 85.
Previous studies had suggested that younger people were either more
vulnerable to vCJD infection, or had suffered greater exposure to meat
infected with BSE during the 1980's, or had shorter incubation periods. It
is still not known how long the disease can incubate in humans and
diagnosis can only be confirmed after death. Predictions by Professor
Anderson's group had suggested around 6 000 people had been infected
between 1980 and 1996. but if the incubation period was as long as 60
years, that figure could increase to around 130 000.

[One of the recommendations of the recently published BSE Enquiry is that
epidemiologists, particularly those in the public sector, should make
available the data on which their conclusions are based. Professor
Anderson's group was responsible for developing the mathematical template
that related the past pattern of the BSE epidemic in cattle to the future
course of any vCJD epidemic in humans, and explored the wide range of
possible outcomes given the uncertainty in epidemiological determinants.
They demonstrated that the average number of humans infected by one
infectious bovine and the incubation period distribution are the 2
epidemiological factors that have the greatest impact on epidemic size and
duration. Using the time-series of the BSE epidemic and the cases seen to
date, they showed that the minimum length of the incubation period is
approximately 9 years [compared with 5 years in cattle, and that at least
20% of the cases diagnosed to date were exposed prior to 1986. They also
demonstrated that the current age distribution of vCJD cases can only arise
if younger people were either exposed to a greater extent, or were more
susceptible to infection, or have shorter incubation periods. Thus the
projected course of the vCJD epidemic in the UK is greatly dependent on
accurate determination of the incubation period of the disease. The
estimation of incubation period is not simple because there is no immune
response to the vCJD prion and no practical in vivo diagnostic test. The
current mathematical modelling is based on a tight range of affected age
groups, and the confirmation of vCJD in a person outside this range
necessitates revision of the modelling and the prediction of the projected
size of the epidemic.
It is also possible that the increasing frequency of dementias with age has
masked the real extent of vCJD infection in the population.
It is customary now to refer to new variant CJD (nvCJD) simply as variant
CJD (vCJD). For the sake of consistency and ease of archiving, ProMED-mail
continues to list these posts under the heading CJD (new var.). - Mod.CP
