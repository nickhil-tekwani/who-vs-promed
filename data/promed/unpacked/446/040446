There is a boom of infected patients with hepatitis A in Rakovski. There are sick children in several schools and kindergartens. The 1st diseases have been since the beginning of September 2017. Everyone has gone through the infectious clinic in Plovdiv, say the city's health inspection.

"This is an infection that is transmitted by fecal-oral route and the problem is that the incubation period of the disease is quite long -- up to 45 days, a person is infectious before he becomes yellow," health inspectors warn.

In the Roma neighborhood of Rakovski, almost every house has a hepatitis A sufferer. Residents of the neighborhood admit they do not know how to protect themselves. There are a total of 35 reported cases of infected children at Hristo Smirnenski School in Rakovski. Parents of students are worried and threaten to stop their children from school if no action is taken.

[The source in this outbreaks is unclear but appears related to general defects in poor sanitary conditions. Hepatitis A infection in children is primarily asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice). With a spate of children recognized with the acute infection, it is certainly likely that many more cases will have occurred. - Mod.LL
