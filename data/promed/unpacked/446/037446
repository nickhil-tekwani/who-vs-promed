Pet vaccinations provide peace of mind when a potential distemper outbreak occurs in the area.

The New Bern [North Carolina] Police Department reported multiple incidents involving foxes and raccoons within the past 2 months, leading to a suspicion of a distemper outbreak.

Distemper is a fatal viral illness with no known cure that can affect domestic pets as well as some wild animals.

Officers and animal control have been called to check on animals acting suspiciously and appearing to be physically sick and exhibiting odd neurological behavior, according to a police release. During the last several weeks [November 2016], officers with the New Bern Police Department, NBPD Animal Control and, on one occasion, Craven County Animal Control, have been called to take care of foxes exhibiting clinical signs of the disease.

The animals were collected, but due to state guidelines, were not tested for the disease.

While distemper cannot be transmitted to humans, it is extremely contagious to domestic pets. Pets can be protected from the disease with vaccinations.

Early signs of the disease include respiratory problems like coughing and nasal discharge. These clinical signs can be accompanied by diarrhea or vomiting, according to the release.

As the disease progresses, more noticeable, neurological signs like walking in circles, head tilts, partial or complete paralysis, convulsions, dementia-like symptoms, involuntary jerky or twitching convulsions, seizures, and mouth chomping will be observed, according to the release.

Authorities are advising residents with pets to contact their veterinarians to make sure their pets are vaccinated against distemper. They also advise residents not to approach any wild animal and not to leave any pet food outside, as this may draw wild animals close to homes and could bring them in contact with pets.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Animals showing the same signs might be rabid. In North Carolina, terrestrial rabies is mainly maintained by raccoons. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats, and ferrets in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB]
