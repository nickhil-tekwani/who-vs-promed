First Report of _Colletotrichum dematium_ on Tomato in Argentina [edited]
G. M. Dal Bello, Comisión de Investigaciones Científicas de la Provincia de
Buenos Aires (CIC), Laboratorio de Fitopatología, Facultad de Ciencias
Agrarias y Forestales, UNLP, calles 60 y 119, c.c. 31, 1900 La Plata,
Argentina.
Plant Dis. 84:198, 2000; published on-line as D-1999-1206-01N, 1999.
Accepted for publication 27 November 1999.
Anthracnose of tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ Mill. var. _pyriforme_
(Dunal) L.H. Bailey) was observed on ripe fruits of pear-shaped tomato in
the post harvest phase during September 1998 to February 1999. Anthracnose
causes a rot of ripe fruit that can cause significant losses in the field
and during storage.
Symptoms occurred on fruits of several cultivars grown in commercial fields
at La Plata, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Fruit rot began as small,
round (1 to 2 mm diameter), grayish, sunken, water-soaked lesions. The
center of the spots became tan and flecked with small black specks.
Individual spots enlarged concentrically to approximately 2 cm in diameter
and became covered with numerous, submerged, black acervuli that formed in
concentric rings and, under wet conditions, produced a mass of slimy
salmon-colored spores. In time, total fruit rot often occurred due to
coalescence of multiple lesions. Symptoms also developed during storage,
resulting in diminished fruit quality and marketable value.
_Colletotrichum dematium_ (Pers.) Grove was isolated consistently by
plating surface-disinfected lesion margins on acidified potato dextrose
agar (PDA). Colony and conidial characteristics on PDA were consistent with
the description of _C. dematium_ (1).
Pathogenicity tests on ripe fruits (moist chamber incubation) and on leaves
of tomato in a greenhouse with a selected fungal isolate confirmed that _C.
dematium_ was the causal organism.
This is the first report of _C. dematium_ on tomato in Argentina.
