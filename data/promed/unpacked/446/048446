Rawalpindi and Mansehra areas.
According to the Internet edition of the Pakistani daily DAWN, dated

of an army general in the city had died in scores 2 weeks ago." See at

Russia confirms bird flu in 3 farms near Moscow
-----------------------------------------------
Russia has confirmed outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain
of bird flu, potentially dangerous to humans, in 3 farms near the
capital, where it had been suspected, a veterinary official said on
Thursday [22 Feb 2007].
"These are not new cases, but part of the same pattern where the
source can be traced to one and the same place," Nikolai Vlasov, head
of veterinary surveillance at animal and plant health watchdog
Rosselkhoznadzor, told a news briefing.
This month [February 2007], bird deaths were registered at small
private farms in 8 districts in the region of Moscow, in the
neighboring Kaluga region and in the republic of Adygeya, a region in
the North Caucasus.
As of Thursday [22 Feb 2007], the H5N1 virus had been officially
confirmed in Moscow's pet market, 7 districts in the Moscow region
and in Adygeya. It has yet to be confirmed in the Dmitrov district
and in the region of Kaluga.
Health officials have traced all outbreaks in the Moscow region to
birds bought in the last 2 weeks at the Sadovod market, commonly
known as "Ptichka," or "Birdie."
The Moscow region outbreaks are Russia's 2nd instance of bird flu
this year [2007] and the 1st ever so close to the capital.
The 3rd area affected, Adygeya [see comment], is surrounded entirely
by the southern region of Krasnodar, where H5N1 killed poultry in 3
settlements last month [January 2007] in the country's 1st outbreak in 2007.
Vlasov said the outbreak of the virus in Adygeya could have been
caused by migrant fowl, which nest in winter in this region. No human
cases of bird flu have been recorded in Russia.
"All people who have been in contact with the dead birds, especially
those who were found to have respiratory diseases have been checked
thoroughly, but none have shown any sign of falling ill," Vlasov said.
The emergencies ministry said on Thursday [22 Feb 2007] that since 9
Feb 2007, 1500 birds have been culled to prevent the spread of the
virus, and 355 have died.
The virus has killed 167 people worldwide since 2003, mostly in Asia
and in cases where the victims had been in direct contact with
infected birds. A total of 274 cases have been recorded in humans.
Five people have died from 8 cases in Azerbaijan, which borders
Russia in the south.
