The Ministry of Agriculture on Thursday [26 Dec 2013] confirmed that goats in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have died of a plague called "peste des petits ruminants."

On 21 Dec 2013, a farm reported that 176 goats [according to the official report, sheep; see commentary] had showed symptoms of the disease in Hami Prefecture and 34 of them had died. The country's exotic animal disease research center on Thursday [26 Dec 2013] confirmed the epidemic was peste des petits ruminants.

Local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where 271 goats have been culled and safely disposed of to prevent the disease from spreading.

Peste des petits ruminants, also known as PPR, goat plague or ovine rinderpest, is a contagious disease mainly affecting goats and sheep. The virus causes fever, lesions, labored breathing and diarrhoea in infected animals.

[This PPR outbreak, which is the 2nd in Xinjiang, has been duly notified to the OIE on Thu 26 Dec 2013 as a follow-up report (see with map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14577). According to the report, the outbreak started on 21 Dec 2013 in the village Wupu, Hami district, affecting 305 susceptible sheep of which 176 were clinical cases with 34 deaths; all remaining 271 sheep were destroyed.

The above press report mentions goats as the affected species; reconfirmation on the identity of the species involved will be helpful.

The 1st outbreak in Xinjiang, which reportedly had started 5 Dec 2013, involved, according to the OIE immediate notification, 6874 susceptible goats with 1236 clinical cases and 203 deaths. Stamping out was similarly applied.

China has been applying stamping out policy addressing PPR, refraining from vaccination. It would be interesting to follow the rate of success of such policy. Most countries affected by PPR had, eventually, to apply vaccination; the currently available PPR vaccines are generally known to be safe and effective (OIE's Manual at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.11_PPR.pdf).

For background and further details, please refer to Mod.CRD's comprehensive commentary in archived ProMED-mail post 20131206.2096193. China's population of small ruminants comprises of 143 680 000 sheep and 141 361 000 goats (OIE data, 2012).

PPR has already been reported from one of Xinjiang's neighboring countries, namely Tajikistan; alertness and enhanced surveillance may be in place in the other neighbors, namely Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. - Mod.AS
