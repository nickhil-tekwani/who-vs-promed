Manufacturer's Recall of Nasal Spray Contaminated with _Burkholderia
cepacia_ Complex
------------------------
CDC has been notified of a voluntary recall of over-the-counter
oxymetazoline HCl 0.05 percent nasal spray because of intrinsic
contamination with _Burkholderia cepacia_ complex. The nasal spray is
distributed as "Major Twice-A-Day 12 Hour Nasal Spray." The manufacturer
(Propharma Inc., Miami, Florida) has recalled lot no. K4496, released in
Nov 2003, with an expiration date of Oct 2006.
Preliminary molecular epidemiology indicates that isolates related to the
strain found in the nasal spray have been recovered from patients in
multiple states. Clinicians should be aware that patients using product
from this lot number might have been exposed to _B. cepacia_ complex.
Patients with underlying lung disease (especially cystic fibrosis) might be
at increased risk for severe infections with _B. cepacia_ complex. Cases of
_B. cepacia_ complex infection or colonization associated with use of this
product should be reported to the local or state health department and CDC,
telephone 800-893-0485.
