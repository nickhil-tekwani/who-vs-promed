Oklahoma City Zoo leaders say routine testing showed that 21-month-old Achara, the youngest Asian elephant at the facility, tested positive for endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV), 1A strain.

Officials say all elephants are believed to carry strains of the virus, adding that this isn't the 1st time Achara has tested positive for EEHV. However, this is the 1st time this particular strain has been detected. Zoo officials say that although low levels of the virus were detected, the animal care team is starting anti-viral treatment and will be monitoring her.

"We are grateful for the advances in veterinary medicine and research related to EEHV that have enabled us to detect this disease early on in Achara," said Barry Downer, OKC Zoo deputy director. "We are following a daily treatment protocol that has been successful in other elephants. Because there is no cure for EEHV, it just goes dormant; we will be vigilantly monitoring her health, as we will the rest of the herd." The animal care team conducts weekly tests on the elephant herd to monitor for signs of the disease, which can be fatal.

Achara's half-sister, Malee, died at the age of 4 due to infection of EEHV1A, the most common strain in elephants across North America, Europe and in Asia including wild populations. This strain was similar to the one that caused illness in Chandra, Malee's and Achara's aunt, when she was a calf. Chandra survived the illness, however, and has remained healthy since that time.

[Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus 1A is a member of the _Proboscivirus_ genus and is a major cause of fatal hemorrhagic disease in endangered juvenile Asian elephants worldwide.

This virus causes fatal hemorrhagic disease commonly identified at North American zoos. The virus only causes benign external herpetic lesions in African elephants, but in Asian elephant's infection results in endothelial disease, which in many cases can be fatal. Asian elephant deaths are the consequence of cross-species infection with a herpesvirus that is naturally latent in, but normally not lethal to, African elephants. - Mod.PMB
