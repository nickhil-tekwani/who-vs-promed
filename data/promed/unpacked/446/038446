[We thank Robert Herriman for his correction.

His comment refers to the post published earlier today (Measles update (30): USA (WA) fatal case, New Zealand (Manawatu-Wanganui) susp. 20160709.4335103). ProMED-mail apologizes for the error. Indeed, the death reported from measles in Washington was from a year ago. - Mod.DK
