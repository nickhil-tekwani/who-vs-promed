The USDA has confirmed vesicular stomatitis cases on additional affected premises in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

The USDA/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Situation Report of 21 May 2020 confirms newly positive premises with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as follows:

Arizona has 3 newly confirmed positive equine premises: 2 in Cochise County and 1 in (newly infected) Santa Cruz County.

New Mexico has 1 newly confirmed positive equine premises, in Dona Ana County.

Texas has 3 newly confirmed positive premises, 2 of which involve equines: 1 each in Hudspeth and Kerr counties, both of which are newly infected. In addition, McMullen County is newly infected, with 1 confirmed positive cattle premises.

Since its last situation report on 14 May 2020, 12 premises have been released from quarantine: 3 in Arizona (1 each in Cochise, Gila, and Pima counties); 2 in New Mexico (Dona Ana County); and 7 in Texas (1 in El Paso County, 4 in Starr County, and 2 in Zapata County).

Premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases are quarantined and monitored by veterinarians for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected on the premises.

Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks, (and) the most recent and largest VS outbreak occurred in 2015. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways."

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

[This outbreak of VSV began as 2 separate strains. However, the USDA has stopped reporting the different strains of this virus.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses, cattle, and swine. The agent causing VSV has a wide host range and can occasionally infect sheep and goats. In affected livestock, VSV causes blister-like lesions to form in the mouth and on the dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves, and teats. These blisters swell and break, leaving raw tissue that is so painful that infected animals generally refuse to eat and drink and show signs of lameness. Severe weight loss usually follows, and in dairy cows, a severe drop in milk production commonly occurs. Affected dairy cattle can appear to be normal and will continue to eat about half of their feed intake.

Known competent vectors for transmission of VSV include black flies, sand flies, and biting midges (_Culicoides_ spp.). The use of equine fly/mosquito approved spray is helpful in controlling the insect vectors transmitting this virus. - Mod.TG
