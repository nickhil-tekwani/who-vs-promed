Health officials said Friday [8 Jan 2010] there is a confirmed case of
wound botulism in a heroin user in Yakima County. A 2nd case is
suspected. Both individuals, a man and a woman, are hospitalized and
on ventilators.

The individuals became ill in December 2009, said Marianne Patnode,
communicable disease services coordinator for the Yakima Health
District. An educational outreach campaign has been underway to warn
intravenous drug users that they are at risk from a contaminated
supply of heroin.

Patnode said Yakima sees sporadic cases of botulism among intravenous
drug users who cut their heroin with a substance, often dirt or honey,
that contains the spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

While the 1st case was confirmed the 3rd week of December 2009, the
2nd person's illness was too far along to be diagnosed. That is, the
patient didn't have enough free toxin to be tested, but Patnode said
clinically, physicians know the individual was poisoned with botulism.
Symptoms include blurred vision and difficulty breathing. The illness
can progress to paralysis. Individuals have to be ventilated for
several weeks and then weaned from the ventilators.

Yakima County's last significant outbreak of wound botulism was in
2003, when there were 5 cases.

[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a
wound, germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the
wound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs).
Those IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or
intramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.

Black tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound
botulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a
gummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly
in Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally
injected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The
local area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess-forming.

The tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents
("cutting" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the
_Clostridium botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the
development of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin,
cleaning the injection paraphernalia or sharing needles.

Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending,
flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the
severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early
in the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results
of microbiological testing.

In cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical
debridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse
after antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl
penicillin and metronidazole.

Toxin type A (one of 7 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of
both foodborne and wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by
toxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis
and a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.
All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the
presynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine
transmission across the neuromuscular junction.

Yakima County, Washington, as noted, has been the location for
previous clusters of cases (2; see ProMED postings "Botulism, wound,
drug-related - USA (WA)" 20060329.0953 and "Botulism, wound,
drug-related - USA (WA)" 20070603.1795).
