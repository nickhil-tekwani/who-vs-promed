There is absolutely no reason to destroy LPAI infected flocks. What is wrong with these people and what is wrong with ProMED-mail editors who allow these decisions to go by without critical comment?

[According to prevailing internationally agreed criteria, the 2 main alternative strategies to control LPNAI (low pathogenic notifiable avian influenza H5 and H7 viruses), in addition to the basic biosecurity/quarantine measures, are:
1. Depopulation of the affected flocks (by stamping out or slaughter), 2. Preventive vaccination.

Low-pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza (LPNAI) became reportable to the OIE in 2006 because some H5 and H7 low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses have the potential to mutate to HPAI viruses.

According to the reference below, based upon questionnaires answered by OIE member countries, since 2006 and as of 2012, fewer outbreaks of LPNAI have been reported than of HPAI and only 6 countries used vaccine in control programmes, accounting for 8.1 percent of the total H5/H7 AI vaccine usage, as compared to 91.9 percent usage of the vaccine against HPAI.

The Danes do not seem to deserve a critical comment. They have acted similarly to other NAI-free countries (such as Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, and South Korea) when responding to a sporadic LPNAI outbreak: immediate eradication, in line with OIE requirements, saving time and losses to local and external markets and potential public health hazards. This, also according to EU's long-established policy; see chapter V "Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI)" in Council directive 2005/94/E, available at http://tinyurl.com/lq4w9kg. According to OIE code chapter 10.4.3., instead of stamping out, "poultry may be kept for slaughter for human consumption subject to specified conditions" ("subjected to ante- and post-mortem inspections in accordance with Chapter 6.2. and found free of any signs suggestive of NAI specifically.") According to the reference below, this alternative has been applied in some vaccinating countries and is possibly applicable in countries experiencing enzootic LPNAI situation or multiple repeated introductions. Its application in NAI-free countries may affect exports and encounter consumer reservations.
