Brazil Spots More Foot-And-Mouth After Slaughter
------------------------------------------------
Santana do Livramento, Brazil - Saturday, Brazil confirmed a fresh outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in its southernmost state and began
slaughtering infected cattle immediately.
It is Brazil's fifth case of FMD in the past 2 weeks and comes 2 days after
the state euthanized hundreds of livestock. At least 2 more outbreaks are
suspected in the region. The agricultural secretariat of Rio Grande do Sul
state said it began slaughtering a herd of 67 animals on Brazil's border
with Uruguay after 20 cattle were confirmed with the disease.
A spokesman for the secretariat added that blood and tissue samples from
herds in the nearby town of Alegrete had been taken to laboratories to
confirm 2 more suspected outbreaks. The latest outbreaks came as state
authorities used police roadblocks and vaccinations to fight the scourge,
which causes fever and blisters on cattle and other cloven-hoofed animals.
FMD has ravaged farms in Britain and other parts of Europe and there have
been widespread outbreaks in Argentina and Uruguay. Brazil's cases
prompted the rest of the country, Europe and some Asian countries to ban
imports of beef from Rio Grande do Sul. The government said the bans could
slice $300 million off Brazil's meat exports this year, estimated at $2.5
billion. Brazil is home to the world's largest commercial cattle herd,
with 167 million head.
Four police roadblocks were set up at the entrance to the infected farm, in
Quarai, close to Alegrete and Santana do Livramento, where the other 4
cases were spotted.
Brazil on Thursday completed the mass slaughter of 323 animals in the
region, bulldozing their carcasses into huge pits and banning the
transportation of livestock and animal products among the farms in the
region, prime cattle ranching territory. The secretariat said the
slaughter of the latest infected cattle should be completed by the end of
Saturday. Vaccinations of the state's herd are expected to continue for
about the next 45 days.

Argentina vaccinates 28 million cattle for FMD
----------------------------------------------
Argentina has vaccinated close to 28 million of the country's roughly 49
million cattle against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and expects signs of
the disease to disappear by 2003, a top health official said.
Health authorities aim to achieve the status of "free of FMD with
vaccination" in 4 years, said Bernardo Cane, president of the national food
and animal health agency Senasa. "Our experience in the 1990's was that
after 2 complete years of vaccinating...(or) by 2003, there should be no
presence of the disease (in our animals)," said Cane.
Argentina said in April it planned to vaccinate 98 percent of the country's
herd to bring the disease under control. Under the program, cattle are
vaccinated twice a year. Twenty million more cattle must be vaccinated in
the first round, said Cane. The second round will begin later in the year.
The latest outbreak of the highly contagious virus has closed Argentina's
main export markets -- including the United States, Canada, Chile and the
European Union (EU) -- and put in danger some $600 million worth of annual
meat exports.
Cane will travel to Chicago, Illinois, USA on Friday to explain Argentina's
disease-control program at a meeting of United States beef importers and
will meet with sanitary officials in the U.S. and Canada in June to discuss
the process for winning back some access to those lucrative markets.
"A meeting between Senasa and APHIS (the food and animal health arm of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal, Plant Health Inspection Service))
has been confirmed for 11 Jun 2001 and with Canadian authorities for 12 Jun
2001, to begin negotiations on access," Cane said.
Cane went to Brussels earlier in the week to meet with EU officials in the
hope that they would decide to reopen that market to Argentine beef. Cane
said he expects an EU commission, which visited Argentina in late April and
early May to evaluate the controls against the disease, to issue a report
within 20 days.
