State and federal officials say ice cream is behind a deadly outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections that has affected people in 10 states.

"As a result of this investigation, Big Olaf Creamery in Sarasota, FL, is voluntarily contacting retail locations to recommend against selling their ice cream products. Consumers who have Big Olaf Creamery brand ice cream at home should throw away any remaining product," according to a notice posted tonight [2 Jul 2022] by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

As of 30 Jun [2022] there were 23 confirmed patients, one of whom died. Another patient was a pregnant woman who lost her baby because of the infection, the CDC reported earlier this week. Twenty-two of the patients were so sick they had to be hospitalized.

Of the 17 people interviewed as of today [2 Jul 2022], 14 reported eating ice cream. Among 13 people who remembered details about the type of ice cream they ate, 6 reported eating Big Olaf Creamery brand ice cream or eating ice cream at locations that might have been supplied by Big Olaf Creamery.

The investigation is ongoing. The company has not initiated a recall.

"Of the 22 people with information, 20 sick people reported living in or traveling to Florida in the month before they got sick, although the significance of this is still under investigation. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 24 Jan 2021 through 12 Jun 2022," the CDC reported.

Whole-genome sequencing showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely got sick from the same food.

Sick people range in age from less than 1 to 92 years, with a median age of 72, and 52% are male. Five people got sick during their pregnancies, and one illness resulted in a fetal loss.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses, according to the CDC. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

The CDC did not specifically report where the Big Olaf ice cream implicated in the current outbreak was manufactured.

About Listeria infections
Food contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any of the implicated Big Olaf ice cream and developed symptoms of _Listeria_ infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible _Listeria_ exposure. Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks, because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.

A brand of Vidalia onions sold at Publix stores across Florida has been recalled due to potential _Listeria_ contamination. Anyone who purchased Little Bear brand Vidalia sweet onions between 22 and 24 Jun [2022] should throw them away and can bring their receipt to the place of purchase for a refund, according to a release from the US Food & Drug Administration.

The recalled onions were sold in bulk in the produce section of Publix and are marked with "PLU 4159" on the sticker. In addition to Florida, the recalled items were sold at Publix stores throughout Georgia and Wegman's stores in the Rochester, New York, area, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.

According to the FDA, the recall comes after internal company testing detected _Listeria_ on a single pack line. No other products grown, packed, or sold by the company, A&M Farms, are affected by this recall.

Anyone with questions about the recalled onions can contact the company's information desk at 1-912-585-2058 on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. "The health and safety of consumers are our top priorities here at A&M Farms. We are glad that most of the implicated product never reached stores, but we are focused intently on alerting consumers in those areas that did receive the onions," Aries Haygood, co-owner of A&M Farms, said in a statement.

As of 30 Jun [2022], no illnesses or adverse effects were reported in connection to this recall, though the CDC is investigating a _Listeria_ outbreak among people who live in or traveled to Florida recently.

The Sarasota ice cream brand Big Olaf Creamery also issued a recall on Saturday [2 Jul 2022] due to _Listeria_ concerns.

[The US CDC identified a cluster of related listeriosis cases, based on whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ that showed the isolates to be closely related genetically, suggesting a common source. A total of 23 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 10 states. Of the 22 people with residence/travel information, 20 sick people reported living in or traveling to Florida in the month before they got sick. Twelve of the infected lived in Florida. One death has been reported in Illinois from the outbreak strain. Five women were infected during pregnancy, and one fetal loss has been reported.

A food history of 17 people interviewed showed that 14 reported eating ice cream. Among 13 people who remembered details about the type of ice cream they ate, 6 reported eating Big Olaf Creamery brand ice cream or eating ice cream at locations that might have been supplied by Big Olaf Creamery. Big Olaf Creamery is a Sarasota, Florida-based company distributing locally to "ice cream parlors, senior homes, restaurants, fairs, and supermarkets with a full range of premium frozen products" (https://bigolaf.com). Big Olaf Creamery sells its ice cream in Florida and currently has 5 stores in the Sarasota area with 3 in Sarasota and one each in Venice and Lakewood Ranch (https://bigolaf.com/locations/). Although, we have not been told if _Listeria_ have been isolated from Big Olaf Creamery ice cream, Big Olaf is contacting retail locations to recommend against selling their ice cream products.

Coincidentally, a brand of Vidalia onions, marked with sticker code "PLU 4159," has been recalled due to _Listeria_ contamination. The recalled onions were sold at Publix supermarket stores in Florida and Georgia and at Wegman's stores in the Rochester, New York, area, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. We are told that no illnesses have been reported in connection with these onions. We have not been told if the _Listeria_ isolates from the contaminated Vidalia onions are genetically related to the _Listeria_ isolated from patients in this outbreak.

The food history from the affected patients apparently did not implicate onions, but we will have to await the results of whole-gene sequencing of onion and any ice cream _Listeria_ isolates to confirm what food item is actually involved.

The investigation is ongoing, and we await further information as the investigation progresses. - Mod.ML
