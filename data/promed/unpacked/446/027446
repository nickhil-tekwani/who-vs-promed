In cooperation with the Wyoming State Veterinarian's office, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department will conduct brucellosis surveillance in the Bighorn Mountains for a 3rd year by collecting blood samples from hunter harvested elk.

Game and Fish is asking successful elk hunters to assist by collecting blood samples from elk immediately after harvest.

"In 2012, 2 seropositive elk were discovered in hunt area 40 in the Bighorn Mountains and 2 additional seropositives were found in the same hunt area in 2013," said Tim Woolley, wildlife management coordinator with the Game and Fish in Cody, Wyoming. "In 2014, 2 seropositive bull elk were identified in hunt area 39 and hunt area 41, and an additional seropositive cow elk was identified in hunt area 40. Animals that test seropositive to brucellosis do not necessarily carry the disease; they could have just been exposed to the bacteria at some time in their life."

Brucellosis surveillance efforts across the state rely on hunters voluntarily collecting blood samples from harvested elk.

"Thanks to hunters, last year [2014] we received 646 blood usable samples from elk harvested across the entire Bighorn Mountains," Woolley said.

Game and Fish will mail blood sample kits to elk hunters holding limited quota licensees for hunt areas in the Bighorn Mountains. If you do not receive one or are hunting in a general area, blood kits are available at game warden stations and the Sheridan or Cody Game and Fish regional office.

[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century. In 2002, collaborative efforts of the US Department of Agriculture's Animal, the livestock industries and State animal health authorities achieved brucellosis-free status in 48 States with no known infection.

The only known focus of _B. abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle.

The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock, hence surveillance in elk taking advantage of samples collected by hunters is a wise initiative. - Mod.PMB
