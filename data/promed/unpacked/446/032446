Ecuador's shrimp exports will suffer big losses this year due to low world
prices and attacks of white spot virus, industry officials said Wednesday.
Shrimp are Ecuador's third largest source of export income, following oil
and bananas. The country is the world's second largest shrimp producer.
Producers and exporters say that their $900 million shrimp export target set
for 1999 will not be reached, and forecast only $580 million in sales.
Sandro Coglitore, head of the National Shrimp Chamber, said white spot virus
had frightened producers who prefer to stop breeding rather than risk major
losses.
White spot, which kills shrimp larvae, first appeared in Ecuadorean shrimp
farms at the beginning of the year, but the outbreak has worsened in the
last 2 months. The virus apparently comes from Asia, but the industry does
not know how it reached the South American country.
Ecuadorean shrimp exports rose 5.4 percent to 114,754 tons in 1998 compared
to 1997, thanks the warm waters of the El Nino weather phenomenon.
The United States, Spain, France and Italy are the main markets for
Ecuadorean shrimp.
Ricardo Estrada, head of the private Investment and Exports Corporation,
said the outlook for 2000 is dark due to the virus. "This year we'll see a
30 percent contraction in the sector. Next year will see more problems and
(shrimp) exports will be around $500 million,'' he said. Estrada sees
recovery for the sector beginning in the second half of 2000.

[The question of how the virus may have come to the Ecuadorian shores from
Asia is similar to the question of how cholera reached the Peruvian shores
back in 1991. Speculation in 1991 was that ships from Asia may have emptied
their bilges near the coast, causing contamination of fish, crustaceans and
bivalves harvested from the waters. A similar scenario may account for the
introduction of the white spot virus. - MPP
