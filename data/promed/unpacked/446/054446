2 Washington State men in their 50s were recently hospitalized in connection with recalled Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream, according to the Washington State Department of Health. The men, who both live in King County, are now out of the hospital and recovering, said department spokesman Donn Moyer, who added that both have underlying health conditions.

One became ill at the end of November [2014], and the other the 1st week of December 2014, he said. "They were ill; the disease investigation started; they started noticing some similarities, and traced it back to this product," Moyer said.

Results from lab tests done using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) confirmed one man's case as listeriosis, while the other is a probable case, but Moyer noted they are "epidemiologically linked."

There was also a positive result for the same strain of _Listeria_ in the now-recalled product, he said. Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream Inc. of Snohomish, WA has issued a voluntary recall of all ice cream, gelato, custard and sorbet for all flavors and container sizes produced on or after 1 Jan 2014 until 15 Dec 2014 because these products have the potential to be contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_.

The products are labeled Snoqualmie Ice Cream, Snoqualmie Gelato, Snoqualmie Custard, Snoqualmie Sorbet or Emerald & Spruce Ice Cream or Top Pot Hand Forged Ice Cream and have a production date code located on the bottom of the container. The date codes included either end in "4", e.g., XXX4 (pints and cups) or are listed by date: "Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 15, 2014," (trays & tubs).

The ice cream, gelato, custard and sorbet were distributed in Arizona, Idaho, California, Oregon and Washington, and may have been further distributed and sold in various retail outlets in Alaska, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.

The recall was initiated based on the confirmation of a positive result of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in the samples collected within the production facility and analyzed by the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA). The company is working with FDA and WSDA to investigate the root cause.

Customers who have purchased the affected product should dispose of it or return it to the place of purchase, where they will receive a refund.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, _Listeria_ infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

In a recent international outbreak of a bacterial infection [listeriosis], health officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have investigated recent deaths and sourced the outbreak back to potentially bad batches of pre-made caramel apples sold in retail stores such as Safeway over the past few months. But now, as the holiday season is in full bloom and more cases are popping up day after day, CDC officials are finding other sources, as well, and are now putting a warning on ice cream potentially infected in some areas of the nation.

Caused by the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_, listeriosis is a disease that can cause gastrointestinal distress and flu-like symptoms in individuals, with a particular ability for harming people whose immune systems are stressed or compromised, including the elderly and pregnant women. In a press release issued this morning [29 Dec 2014], the CDC warns all consumers to avoid prepackaged caramel apples while they investigate the outbreak and source the cause of the infection in a joint collaboration alongside the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and state health organizations.

The newest warnings have arisen out of 2 new cases from Washington state, where 2 gentlemen in their 50s, who also happen to be residents of King County, were recently hospitalized after consuming ice cream from the local Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream shop. Washington State Department of Health officials confirmed that the 2 men had in fact been infected with _Listeria_, but they are also facing complications of previously underlying medical issues as well.

"They were ill," Washington Department of Health spokesperson Donn Moyer says. "[As] the disease investigation started, they started noticing some similarities and traced it back to this product."

While the current epidemic could very possibly be attributed to other sources, including a significant contribution from caramel apples recently recalled, the CDC is convinced that Snoqualmie's gourmet ice cream may be a source of _Listeria_ to more than 5 states currently infected, including: Arizona, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and California.

Company officials with Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream have declined to comment, though they did issue a voluntary recall on Tue 23 Dec 2014 for all flavors and sizes of their ice creams, custards, gelatos and sorbet manufactured and distributed from 15 Dec 2014 to 1 Jan 2015 to be sure that consumers need not fear eating their products in the near future.

[This listeriosis outbreak that has affected 2 people in Washington State are linked by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotyping with contaminated ice cream products manufactured by Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream, but the Snoqualmie ice creams, custards, gelatos and sorbet have been distributed and sold in various retail outlets in multiple other states in addition to Washington State (Arizona, Idaho, California, Oregon, as well as Alaska, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming). Cases of listeriosis caused by this _Listeria_ strain may be anticipated.

The 2nd news report intimates that the Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream outbreak may be connected with the listeriosis/caramel apple outbreak occurring in multiple US states and Canada, but the caramel apple outbreak is associated with 2 genotypically distinct _Listeria_ strains. The news reports above give no indication that the _Listeria_ strain causing the Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream outbreak and those causing the caramel apple outbreak are genetically closely related.
