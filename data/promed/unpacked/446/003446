Puerto Rico: 18 Confirmed Cases of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever
--------------------------------------------------
A total of 18 cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever have been confirmed in
Puerto Rico during the first 9 months of this year, health officials said.
Patricia Cano, a Health Ministry expert on dengue fever, said on Tue 8 Oct
2002 that so far this year, 33 percent of the 2003 people believed infected
with dengue fever have tested positive for the disease. "A total of 18
cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever has been reported by 28 Sep 2002," Cano
said. Some 289 suspected cases of dengue fever were reported in September
of 2002, compared with 708 cases during the same month in 2001.
To date, a 15-year-old girl has been the only fatality from dengue
hemorrhagic fever in Puerto Rico. "The number of cases so far has been
within forecast, perhaps a little lower than last year," Cano said. Dengue
fever cases have been falling off in Puerto Rico as a result of a campaign
launched in May to fumigate high-risk communities.

Malaysia (Perak): Alarming Rise in Dengue Cases
-----------------------------------------------
The increased incidence of dengue fever in Perak in the first 9 months this
year is alarming, said state Health, Environment, Science and Technology
Committee chairman Datuk Ho Cheng Wang yesterday. He urged residents not to
be unduly worried although there was a 82 percent increase this year as
compared to the same period last year. He said during the first 9 months of
this year, 1659 cases, including 6 deaths, were recorded in Perak compared
to only 913 cases, including 2 deaths, during the same period last year.
"There is an increase of 746 cases or 82 percent this year," he said.
Ho said the Health Department and the respective local authorities were
monitoring the situation and taking immediate remedial actions, including
fogging activities. "Please co-operate with the authorities and residents
can play their part by ensuring that their compounds are kept clean," he
told a press conference here yesterday. Ho attributed the ongoing rainy
season as one of the main causes for the incidence of dengue fever.
He said this year's fatalities occurred in areas under the jurisdiction of
the Ipoh City Council (2 deaths) and a death each in the districts of Kuala
Kangsar, Kinta, Batang Padang, Larut, Matang and Selama. He also allayed
fears of residents in Kampar that there was a major outbreak of dengue
fever there. "Based on statistics recorded between 22 and 28 Sep 2002,
there were only 28 cases there and between 29 Sep and 6 Oct 2002 18 cases,
including one death," he said. Ho said there were enough hospital beds for
dengue fever victims at the Kampar hospital and that any shortfall could be
covered by Tapah hospital.

Malaysia: Selangor Placed on Dengue Alert
-----------------------------------------
Selangor has been placed on dengue alert following 3 deaths reported
between 29 Sep and 5 Oct 2002, raising the total fatalities so far to 10
this year. State Health Committee chairman Datuk Tang See Hang said
Selayang has the highest number of fatal cases with 4, followed by Subang
Jaya and Klang (2 each) and Kuala Langat and Shah Alam (one each). He said
there was a 30 percent rise in dengue cases in the state compared to last
year, with a total of 5986 cases already reported. Selayang Municipal
Council topped the list with 1367 cases followed by Subang Jaya Municipal
Council with 1165 cases.
Tang said the state government, health officials, and local authorities
would meet on Thu 24 Oct 2002 to find solutions to control the rise in
dengue cases and deaths related to it. "The state government views the
situation (3 deaths in a week) as critical considering that there had been
only 7 deaths up to 29 Sep this year. The present situation is also bad as
there were only 3 deaths for the whole of last year," he said. He added
that: "The statistics showed that the dengue outbreak is prone in urban
areas in the state. This could be attributed to the massive ongoing
development resulting in stagnant water being collected at construction
sites. The current rainy weather condition have also made it difficult for
the authorities to contain the outbreak." Tang urged the public to view the
outbreak seriously and take preventive measures by keeping their premises
and surroundings clear from potential water traps such as unwanted
containers, flower pots, and tires.
In Ipoh, Perak Health Department director Dr Abdul Razak Kechik urged those
suffering from dengue fever to be isolated and placed under a mosquito net
to avoid infecting others. He added that: "The _Aedes_ mosquito only
becomes a vector (carrier) of dengue virus once it bites and sucks blood of
a human being suffering from dengue fever. Dengue virus will then multiply
in the body of the _Aedes_ mosquito, which will spread the fever to other
people. Animals cannot carry [transmit] dengue virus. Other mosquitoes like
_Culex_ might bite someone with dengue fever, but the virus will die inside
the insect. Similarly, not all _Aedes_ mosquitoes might be carrying dengue
virus, especially when they have just emerged from the larval
stage. People with dengue fever must report to the authorities."

India (Maharashtra & Gujarat): 36 Dengue Cases Reported in Pune
------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 7 Oct 2002, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) has sent 2
teams of entomologists to scout areas in the city and surrounding villages
for infected mosquitoes. So far 20 samples from outside Pune and 2 cases at
Sassoon General Hospital have tested positive for dengue virus by the NIV.
As of Mon 7 Oct 2002, the KEM Hospital dengue [unit], which is testing
samples of suspected dengue virus free of cost, had detected 9 more cases
from Dhankawadi, Pimpri, Kolhapur, Bhor, Wadgaon, and Wagholi. "So far
there are a total of 36 patients in the city undergoing treatment for
dengue" said Dr Rajesh Gadia, Chief of the Dengue [Unit] at KEM hospital.
Senior scientists at the NIV did not rule out an outbreak of dengue fever
[also] at Surat in Gujarat and said that they had confirmed 11 dengue cases
at Shirur, 4 at Satara, 3 at Nanded , and 2 at Solapur. According to the
scientists, over 50 samples have tested positive for dengue virus at Surat.
NIV scientists said that they had not received many samples of suspected
dengue cases from the city barring 2 from Sassoon Hospital. They have
started collecting infected mosquitoes from various parts specially Shirur.
NIV scientists however admitted that there has been an increase in the
number of cases of dengue since 1998. From the outbreak in Hadapsar in
1998, there has been an increase this year in the number of cases that are
being sporadically reported from various parts. Urbanisation and increased
transport facilities is also one of the many factors for the rise in the
number of patients infected with dengue virus. When contacted, Dr Anil
Ravetkar, Chief Medical Officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said that
there had been no further increase in the number of dengue cases.
