A 45-year-old woman from Ashti town in Wardha district, died of scrub typhus on Tuesday [6 Nov 2012] at 7 pm at the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC) where she was undergoing treatment since [13 Oct 2012]. She is the 2nd positive scrub typhus case reported from the region so far.

Dr Sunil Agrawal, associate professor of medicine and the acting department head, told TOI [Times of India] that the patient came to the hospital at a very late stage with severe complications. Since she did not have [the skin] lesion [caused] by the bite of chiggers [that is, the larval stage of] trombiculid mites, which transmit the disease-causing bacterium _Rickettsia [now called _Orientia_] tsutsugamushi_, doctors did not suspect scrub typhus initially.

Dr Agrawal said, "the patient came to us 9 days after suffering from high fever. Her blood sample report became positive for scrub typhus. We had already begun treating her with doxycycline, which is used for scrub typhus." She was kept in medicine ICU after going into multiple organ dysfunction stage. Her condition improved and she was shifted back to the ward. "Her condition deteriorated again and she was kept on a ventilator. She died on Tuesday night [6 Nov 2012] after multiple organ failure and suffering acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)," he said.

[Another woman] of Kolhu in Katol tehsil [administrative division] was the 1st scrub typhus case, which was reported from IGGMC by medicine head Dr PP Joshi and Dr Abhijit Nugurwar, a registrar in medicine ICU. TOI had reported this on [23 Oct 2012]. "We got the [Ashti town] patient's report on [31 Oct 2012] from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), New Delhi. Had she come to us in the initial stages, maybe we could have saved her," said Dr Joshi.

Since this is an uncommon and notifiable disease, Dr Vijay Kargilwar, surveillance officer from Integrated Diseases Surveillance Project of central government for Nagpur district and epidemiologist, conducted a survey at Kolhu on 23 Oct 2012]. "When the Ashti woman tested positive, we went back to the village on [30 Oct 2012] and collected samples from 9 patients," he said.

Ashti district surveillance officer Dr Nilam Somalkar conducted a survey in his area after learning about the patient. "The patient, a farm labourer from ward 6 which is very close to the forest area, stayed alone. Her family lives in Nagpur," he said.

[For a discussion of scrub typhus, see prior ProMED-mail post: Scrub typhus - India (07): (RJ) fatal, susp. 20120917.1297397. Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganisms that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm).

The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination test based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test continues to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are not often available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic.

Nagpur is a city located precisely at the geographical center of India and is the winter capital of the state of Maharashtra, the largest city in central India. Nagpur, with a population of 2,405,421 (2011) is the third largest city in Maharashtra after Mumbai and Pune. For a map of India showing the location of Nagpur, see http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&sugexp=les;&cp=6&gs_id=6&xhr=t&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&bpcl=38093640&biw=1280&bih=529&q=nagpur&um. [Ashti is 622km (387 miles) from Nagpur].
