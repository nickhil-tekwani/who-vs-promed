The number of people killed by Q-fever, a flu-like illness which mainly infects sheep and goats, was at least 24, the head of the public health institute RIVM told television current affairs show Nieuwsuur on Tuesday [28 Feb 2012]. The previous official death toll stood at 19.

The outbreak of Q-fever began in 2007 and led to the slaughter of some 40 000 goats in an effort to get the spread under control. Some 4000 humans became ill with the disease, but that total could be far higher, Roel Coutinho, head of the RIVM's infectious diseases unit, told the show.

On Tuesday [28 Feb 2012], it emerged that dozens of people who still have health problems relating to Q-fever are planning to take legal action against the goat farms where they became infected.

[It may be assumed that the above human cases are related to the years 2008-2010; details will help.

Q fever became a reportable animal disease in the Netherlands in July 2008, following the appearance of steadily growing numbers of human cases. The outbreak continued throughout 2009 and the 1st semester of 2010. Stamping out of infected goat holdings was combined with the introduction of compulsory vaccinations.

The following numbers of new outbreaks (predominantly in dairy goats) are derived from the Dutch annual reports to the OIE:
2006 - disease present, no quantitative data
2007 - 1
2008 - 12
2009 - 65
2010 - 33
January-June 2011 - 7

The disease is currently included in WAHID's interface as "continuing." The Q fever report includes the following note by OIE's Animal Health Information Department: "After investigation, the reason for notification has been changed from "new strain of a listed disease" to "unexpected increase in incidence of a listed disease." This report replaces the immediate notification report published on 29 Dec 2009 and having for its reason: "New strain of a listed disease."
