EL NINO, DISEASE PREDICTIONS - USA (LOUISIANA)

The ANIMAL HEALTH NOTES for September 1997, issued by the Louisiana State
University Agricultural Center contains the following warning to farmers &
veterinarians:
Cattle
Next Spring: El Nino is predicted to bring a wet winter to this region [US
Gulf Coast of the Gulf of Mexico]. Calf morbidity and mortality may
increase. Next Spring, calves nursing cows that are grazing rye grass on
organic soils in coastal parishes [counties] may exhibit an increase in
chronic diarrhea, abomasal ulcers, and failure to thrive associated with
secondary copper deficiency. Rye grass pastures on upland soils that had a
history of producing copper deficiency in nursing calves this wet ['97]
spring will repeat unless cows receive additional copper in the diet.
[Although this report does not directly and exclusively concern infectious
diseases, it does indicate concern regarding expected complex ecological
effects of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation phenomenon. Clearly, acute
increases or decreases in precipitation and temperature will throw all
sorts of data off their means. In this EN/SO regard, I wonder if anyone is
preparing to study the possibility of infectious disease increases brought
about by increases or decreases in essential nutrients. -Mod. CHC]
