Two cases of epidemic hemorrhagic fever have been reported in Jiangsu
province; One in Guanyun, one in Nanjing. It emerged yesterday that
Nanjing No. 2 Hospital recently admitted 2 patients with epidemic
hemorrhagic fever for treatment. One is from Guanyun County in
Lianyungang, and the other a local Nanjing patient.
Experts say that each winter and spring this type of infectious
disease breaks out easily, spread by [rodents] carrying the
virus. Residents must be on guard against [rodents].
More than 10 days ago, a 42-year-old male patient from Guanyun
developed fever of unknown cause. He was diagnosed with upper
respiratory tract infection in a local hospital. Treatment was
ineffective and his condition became more critical, with reduced
urination, chest pain and lower back pain. The results of dialysis
were also poor. The other patient, a 43-year-old female farmer from
the Nanjing area, likewise inexplicably developed fever and was also
incorrectly diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection. Six
days ago her high fever and anuria became more serious, and she was
transferred to Nanjing No. 2 Hospital and diagnosed with epidemic
hemorrhagic fever.
Wenhu Yao, Director of Nanjing No. 2 Hospital's Infectious Disease
Department, explained that the source of epidemic hemorrhagic fever
infection is rodents carrying hantavirus. Bites from rodents
carrying hantavirus, contact with the excrement of rodents carrying
the virus, accidental consumption of food nibbled by rats rodents
carrying the virus, etc. can lead to infection by the
virus. However, this virus does not spread from person to person.
Director Yao says that epidemic hemorrhagic fever occurs easily in
winter and spring. Patients develop high fever and also manifest the
"3 reds and 3 pains." The "3 pains" are headache, orbital pain,
lower back pain or disabling pain throughout the body. The "3 reds"
are red face, red neck, and flushed skin on the chest or drunken appearance.
Director Wenhu Yao warns that epidemic hemorrhagic fever is an acute
infectious disease. If not treated with antibiotics in time, it can
have fatal consequences. But statistics show that over half of
epidemic hemorrhagic fever patients are incorrectly diagnosed with
upper respiratory tract infection. Some are also incorrectly
diagnosed with hepatitis, kidney disease, etc.
Lei Hong, Vice Director of Nanjing Centers for Disease Control Acute
Infectious Disease Department, says that epidemic hemorrhagic fever
occurs each year in winter and spring. In Nanjing, it mainly occurs
in the Lishui-Gaochun belt. He emphasized that eradication of rats
is the main protective measure. In areas where the incidence of
rodents carrying the virus is high, residents can be vaccinated.

[Most viruses associated with viral hemorrhagic fevers are zoonotic;
i.e. such viruses naturally reside in an animal reservoir host or
arthropod vector. The hemorrhagic fever viruses are usually dependent
entirely on their hosts for replication and overall survival. For
the most part, rodents and arthropods are the main reservoirs for
viruses causing viral hemorrhagic fevers. The viruses that cause
viral hemorrhagic fevers are distributed over much of the globe.
However, because each virus is associated with one or more particular
host species, the virus and the disease it causes are usually seen
only where the host species/reservoir live(s).
The viruses carried in rodent reservoirs are transmitted when humans
have contact with urine, fecal matter, saliva, or other body
excretions from infected rodents. Viruses causing epidemic
hemorrhagic fevers in the Far East are likely to be members of the
genus _Hantavirus_. These viruses are tripartite genome RNA viruses
distinguished from other members of the family _Bunyaviridae in that
they are not arthropod-borne. They are associated with severe disease
in humans (often presenting with renal involvement), whereas they
have little effect on their rodent hosts.
The identity of the virus present in Jiangsu province is not stated,
but it is likely to be closely related to Hantaan virus, the original
member of the genus first isolated in South Korea.
