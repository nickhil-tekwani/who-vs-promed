The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) has reported this year's [2014] 6th rubella (German measles) case in a 31-year-old male who resides in northern Taiwan. However, unlike the other 5 cases, this one was acquired in Taiwan.

The young boy displayed the characteristic maculopapular rash indicative of rubella, otherwise known as German measles. According to the case, on [7 Nov 2014], he developed fever, runny nose and rash. On the following day, he sought medical attention. On [11 Nov 2014], rubella infection was confirmed in the case. Currently, the case has been isolated for medical treatment. Since the case had not recently traveled overseas, Taiwan CDC determined the case to be an indigenous case. The possible source of infection is being investigated.

Preventive measures have been put in place to avoid further transmission. More than 200 contacts are being monitored.

Besides the current indigenous case, the Taiwan CDC reports 2 cases who acquired the infection in China, and one each were acquired in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Rubella, or German measles, is a disease spread by the coughs and sneezes of infected people. Symptoms include rash and fever for 2 to 3 days. Some people do not feel sick. If a pregnant woman gets rubella virus, her baby could have birth defects such as deafness, cataracts, heart defects, mental disabilities, and organ damage.

Prevention of rubella is through vaccination. In addition to vaccination, they recommend practicing good hygiene (handwashing) and keeping hands out of faces as other measures to protect yourself.

[From ProMED-mail moderator CP's comments in ProMED-mail post Rubella - UK: England (Hampshire), alert 20120912.1291874:

"Rubella is an acute, contagious viral infection. While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host. In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (under 39 C), nausea and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 percent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days. Once a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2-3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1-5 days after the appearance of the rash.

"When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye and heart defects and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries and other expensive care.

"The rubella vaccine is a live [naturally] attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years. A single dose gives more than 95 percent long-lasting immunity, which is similar to that induced by natural infection. [The] rubella vaccine is administered as part of the triple MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine. The occurrence of rubella disease is an indication of less than adequate uptake of MMR vaccine."

Rubella has been eliminated in the United States. Travelers going outside the United States are at risk for rubella. People who cannot show that they were vaccinated as children and who have never had rubella should be vaccinated. The only rubella vaccines available in the United States are the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines. Adolescents and adults who have not had rubella or have not been vaccinated with MMR should get 2 doses, separated by at least 28 days; and infants 6 months through 11 months of age should have 1 dose of MMR vaccine if traveling internationally (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/rubella).
