According to a report by Lao National Radio, lumpy skin disease [LSD] has spread to cattle throughout 128 villages across 7 districts in Vientiane Capital. Head of the Vientiane Capital Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Mr. Lasai Nuanthasing, says the spread of lumpy skin disease in livestock has been recorded in the districts of Hadsayfong, Sangthong, Naxaythong, Sikhottabong, Xaythany, Saysettha, and Pakngeum.

"Some 2330 animals have become infected with the disease, while 22 deaths have been recorded, and 2040 recoveries have been made," said Mr. Larsay Nouanthasing. "Lumpy skin disease is a virus that affects the health of cows and buffalo. However, it is not transmissible to humans, and consumption of cow or buffalo meat remains safe after the animals have recovered," Mr. Larsay added.

Experts from the Department of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries are now providing advice to cattle farmers, instructing them to isolate infected animals. While there is no known treatment for the virus that causes LSD itself, secondary infections among animals are usually treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and vitamin injections.

The virus was first reported in Laos in April 2021, with the government exploring options for the provision of vaccines. It has now infected thousands of animals and caused over 100 deaths.

The government of Laos placed a temporary ban on the import and export of livestock and beef products earlier this month [June 2021] to prevent the spread of lumpy skin disease.

[According to the Lao National Radio's report of 9 Jun 2021, "cattle and buffaloes in 126 villages in 30 districts of 7 provinces across the country are infected with almost 11 000 clinical cases, of which more than 100 have died and more than 8000 have been treated. The province with the highest number of infected animals was Khammouane with 5100, of which more than 3000 were treated and more than 60 died, followed by Savannakhet with almost 4000 cases, of which 3000 were treated and 60 died. In Vientiane alone, more than 2000 animals were infected, more than 1000 treated and 12 died" (available, in Lao, at <tinyurl.com/97fbzzx4>).

On 11 Jun 2021, Laos' presentation titled "Lumpy skin disease (LSD): Outbreak situation in Lao PDR 2021" was included among others at the LSD Coordination Meeting for South-East Asia, a Zoom meeting organized by the OIE Sub-Regional Representation for South-East Asia.

According to the report from Laos, the disease is already widely spread, affecting cattle; no cases in buffalo have been reported as observed, while a number of "susceptible" buffaloes are included. The disease had been confirmed by RT-PCR on 28 May 2021. Vaccine is not available, and the presentation included a request to the international organisations for help in its supply. The Laos presentation can be seen at https://rr-asia.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02_laos_souriya.pdf.

The Zoom meeting was recorded and is conveniently available at https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/events/lumpy-skin-disease-lsd-coordination-meeting-for-south-east-asia/. It includes, among other issues, the following presentations: Update review on global and regional LSD situation and country presentations from Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, Indonesia and the Philippines.

Following the 1st report of LSD in Asia in 2019 in Bangladesh, China and India, the disease continued its spread affecting Viet Nam in October 2020, Myanmar in November 2020, Sri Lanka in January 2021, and Thailand in April 2021, followed by recent official notifications of its confirmed circulation and concerning impact in Cambodia and Malaysia.

The event in Laos is yet to be officially reported to OIE-WAHIS.

With increasing risks of LSD spread in South-East Asia region, the need for rapid detection and implementation of appropriate response and control measures is critical to control the disease and to minimize impact. The disease is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
