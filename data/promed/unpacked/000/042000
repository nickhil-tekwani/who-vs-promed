An alarming rise in cases of Bosnians infected with the rare animal
disease brucellosis requires urgent action to prevent it from
spreading, an epidemiologist warned Thursday (22 May 2008).

"The number of people who were registered with the infection this
year [2008] is 395. The situation is very, very serious," Zlatko
Puvacic, the chief epidemiologist of the Muslim-Croat half of Bosnia, told AFP.

At least another 1000 people in the Muslim-Croat Federation had been
infected by brucellosis but were not registered since they were yet
to see a doctor, Puvacic estimated.

A precise figure on those currently infected with the animal disease
was unknown. Puvacic said health authorities "must urgently undertake
measures to prevent further spreading of the disease."

He called for the establishment of quarantine facilities for infected
cattle, mainly sheep, and for the proper disposal of the remains of
euthanised animals. "Otherwise the number of infected humans could be
2 to 3 times higher," said Puvacic. He said the situation is
identical in the Republika Srpska, the Serb entity that along with
the Muslim-Croat Federation makes up post-war Bosnia.

[Brucellosis, also called undulant fever or Malta fever in humans, is
an infection caused by a gram-negative bacillus in the genus
_Brucella_. The brucellosis outbreak in Bosnia and Herzegovina is
apparently worsening: According to the news release above, about 400
cases are now reported so far this year (2008) in the Muslim-Croat
half of the country (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and a
similar situation is occurring in the Serb portion (Republika
Srpska). ProMED-mail post no. 20050614.1658 reported that a total of
39 patients were treated in a similar 5-month period of 2005, whereas
in 2003 and 2004 there was a total of 47 cases of brucellosis.

The moderator (AS) of ProMED-mail post no. 20080122.0268 noted that:
"Efforts to eradicate _B. melitensis_ from the European countries
affected (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and Greece) have been under
way -- with EU support -- for years; though advances are significant
(Greece excluded), total eradication has not been achieved so far.

_B. melitensis_ is maintained mainly within small ruminants (sheep
and goats), though cases in cattle and buffaloes may occur
sporadically. _B. abortus_ is maintained mainly within large bovines
(cattle and buffaloes).

The same moderator noted in ProMED-mail post no. 20080119.0234 that
brucellosis "is also a serious zoonosis .... transmitted to humans
mainly in the following 2 routes: by direct contact with affected
animals or their post-partum/post-abortion secretions, or by the
ingestion of contaminated, unpasteurised food products, mainly dairy
products." Direct person-to-person transmission from an infected
mother to infant can occur by means of breast-feeding. _Brucella_ can
also be used as a bioweapon; the microorganism can be delivered as an
aerosol, making it relatively easy to disseminate. Therefore, an
outbreak of infections would be difficult to detect because the
earliest signs are flu-like symptoms. - Mod.ML
