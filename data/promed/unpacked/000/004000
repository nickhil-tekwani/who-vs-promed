News of the response
--------------------
Ebola Survivors Tracking Program

- At the 9th Ebola outbreak in Equateur Province, the Ministry of Health launched an Ebola-survivors follow-up program to provide clinical, biological and psychosocial follow-up for people who have recovered from Ebola. The minister of health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, also initiated the establishment of the National Association of Ebola Winners to bring together all survivors in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The national coordinator of the program and association is Dr Richard Kitenge. Survivors' monitoring centers will be set up in Beni, Butembo and Mangina. The Ministry of Health gives priority to local health personnel in all areas of the program to build local capacity. The survivor monitoring program teams are reviewing the database of all survivors since the start of this 10th outbreak. The Ministry of Health will resume sharing survivor data as soon as this cleanup of the database is complete.

Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 28 727 people have been vaccinated, including 14 966 in Beni, 4544 in Mabalako, 2152 in Katwa, 1663 in Mandima, 1435 in Butembo, 1237 in Kalunguta, 732 in Masereka, 434 in Bunia, 355 in Tchomia, 293 in Vuhovi, 258 in Mutwanga, 240 in Komanda, 178 in Oicha, 160 in Musienene, and 80 in Kyondo.

[In a tweet by Helen Branswell (as submitted by Rapporteur MJM):
"Two more healthcare workers have been infected with #Ebola in #DRC, @WHOAFRO reports. This brings the number of HCW infections in this outbreak to 30."

New cases are always disturbing but especially so when health care workers become infected. They are putting their lives on the line every day as they treat patients, since Ebola virus is transmitted through bodily fluids, and they are in such close contact with Ebola patients. It is also dangerous because they can spread the virus easily in the clinics where they are working, which generally have not been the Ebola treatment centers but rather community health clinics with less if any barrier protection.

Additional bad news is that on 10 Nov 2018, there were reports of 2 attacks by armed groups in Beni with deaths and kidnappings. This unrest has been exacerbating the outbreak by interfering with the ability of the response teams to control the outbreak. - Mod.LK]

[2] Ebola control
Date: 11 Nov 2018

Dr Ibrahima Soce-Fall, WHO regional director for emergencies and health security, says that in the fight against Ebola in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, the most important thing is to quickly detect new cases and arrange support. He said this on Sat 10 Nov 2018 during an interview with Radio Okapi.

"Every epidemic is special. If we look at the number of deaths for this epidemic, at 198 [now 205; see MoH report above], compared to Yambuku, where we were at 280, we can see that the lethality is lower. But Yambuku was also a rural area, but here we are in an urban area where the population is very mobile. So, the context is very specific. This phase of the epidemic is still a dynamic phase. It is certain that in the coming weeks, there will be new cases.

But the most important thing is to be able to detect new cases very quickly," said Dr Ibrahima Soce-Fall.

[The case fatality rate (CFR) currently is hovering around 60.8%, which is very high. As long as the unrest prevents health care workers from identifying contacts, cases and deaths will increase, and the CFR may change.

The overall CFR among the 8413 confirmed cases in the 3 West-African countries during the West African outbreak was 63%. Age had a big influence on mortality: Cases among teenagers and young adults had best chances of survival, while children under 5 and elderly over 75 were at greatest risk of dying. Hospitalization was another significant factor influencing mortality. As many as 93% of the patients who were not in a hospital died of the disease [excerpted from http://www.sciencejournalforkids.org/uploads/5/4/2/8/54289603/cfr_ebola_article.pdf.
