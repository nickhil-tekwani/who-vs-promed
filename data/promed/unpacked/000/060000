Fast facts
- The US Food and Drug Administration is cautioning horse owners not to feed Top of the Rockies alfalfa cubes with the date codes 111222, 111322, 111422, 111522, and 111622.
- These alfalfa cubes have been recalled by Manzanola Feeds of Manzanola, CO, which distributes products directly to feed stores and co-ops in 10 states. Further distribution is possible, so it's important to check the date codes if you have these products.
- Top of the Rockies alfalfa cubes are sold in white and tan plastic 50-pound bags with green labeling. The date codes are on the front of the package.
- If you have Top of the Rockies alfalfa cubes with these date codes, or you can't be sure of the date code of the products you have, throw them away in a secure container and follow the handling and cleaning instructions below.
- FDA is aware of at least 98 horses in Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, and Texas who showed neurologic signs. At least 45 of these horses have died or were euthanized due to declining health.
- The signs reported are consistent with botulism, and while further testing is underway to pinpoint the cause of the horse illnesses, horse owners and handlers should take precautions to protect human and animal health.
- Immediately consult a veterinarian if your horse ate this product and shows signs of neurologic illness, such as muscle tremors, difficulty eating or swallowing, difficulty standing, or collapse.

What is the problem?
The US FDA is cautioning horse owners not to feed recalled Top of the Rockies alfalfa cubes with the date codes 111222, 111322, 111422, 111522, and 111622. Some of the alfalfa cubes have been reported to contain what appears to be fur and animal tissues, indicating the material from an animal or animals may have been incorporated into the cubes during alfalfa harvesting. Some people have reported a foul odor in some of the bags. _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium causing botulism, is commonly present in decaying animal carcasses. Testing of the alfalfa cubes and other feed and tissue samples is in progress.

These alfalfa cubes were made by Manzanola Feeds of Manzanola, CO, and FDA has confirmed the firm distributes products to feed stores and co-ops in 10 states: AR, CO, IL, KS, LA, MO, NM, OK, TX, and WI. Further distribution may be possible, so it's important to check the date code if you have this product.

FDA is aware of several horses in Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, and Texas who showed neurologic symptoms, and is working with state authorities to learn more. At least 45 of these horses have died or were euthanized due to declining health. Necropsies of some of the horses are underway or pending. At this time, it appears that Top of the Rockies alfalfa cubes was the only common food source among all of the cases.

This is an ongoing investigation, and FDA will share additional information as it becomes available.

What do I need to do?
If you have Top of the Rockies alfalfa cubes with the date codes 111222, 111322, 111422, 111522, or 111622, or you can't be sure of the date code of the products you have, do not feed them to your horses or any other animals. Throw them away in a secure container and place them in a covered trash can or dumpster so no other animals can access them. Avoid handling the cubes directly and wear disposable gloves and a face mask while throwing the cubes away and cleaning any bins or containers where they were kept.

- Wearing gloves and a face mask (preferable an N95 respirator), clean out all the empty bins or containers where the alfalfa cubes were kept.
- Make a bleach solution by combining 1/4 cup household bleach to every 2 cups of water.
- Completely cover the container with the bleach solution, place a layer of paper towels on top of the bleach, and let sit for at least 15 minutes.
- Wipe up any remaining liquid with new paper towels and let the containers air dry.
- Clean the area with liquid soap and water to remove the bleach and discard any items that may have come into contact with the contaminated food or containers.
- Dispose of the face mask and gloves in a secure trash receptacle and wash your hands with soap and running water for at least 2 minutes.

What signs have been reported?
Attending veterinarians and state officials have reported horses have shown signs of neurologic illness, including muscle tremors rapidly progressing to the whole body, weakness, decreased tongue tone, agitation, and inability to stand. If you see these signs in your horse, seek immediate veterinary care.

These signs are consistent with botulism, and many horses have been treated for suspected botulism. No human illnesses have been reported to date.

How can I report a horse illness?
If you think your horse has become ill after eating contaminated food, call your veterinarian first. You can also report the illness to FDA through the Safety Reporting Portal or by calling your state's FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinators. If possible, share the brand name and lot numbers of what your horse ate.

[When an animal is caught in the harvesting equipment of grains or forage for hay, the operator of the equipment may or may not know it. This type of contamination is certainly unintentional.

This is a horribly heartbreaking situation. Our sympathies to those who have affected and/or deceased horses.

"Botulism is a rapidly fatal disease with motor paralysis. It is commonly caused by eating food contaminated with the toxin (a type of poison) produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. This organism grows rapidly in decomposing animal tissue and sometimes in plant material. It results in rapid death due to the paralysis of vital organs. Botulism is not usually an infection but a poisoning. The frequency of botulism in animals is not known with accuracy, but it is low in horses."
(https://www.merckvetmanual.com/horse-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-horses/botulism-in-horses)

"There are 7 types of _C. botulinum_, differentiated by the antigenic specificity of the toxins: A, B, C1, D, E, F, and G. Types A, B, and E are most important in humans; C1 in most animal species, notably wild ducks, pheasants, chickens, mink, cattle, and horses; and D in cattle. In horses, the most common type in North America and Europe is type B (>85% of US cases), and in the western US type A has been reported in only 2 outbreaks, both in humans, known to have been caused by type F. Type G, isolated from soil in Argentina, is not known to have been involved in any outbreak of botulism."
(https://www.merckvetmanual.com/veterinary/generalized-conditions/clostridial-diseases/botulism-in-animals)

Of the 7 types of _Clostridium botulinum_ toxins, "the C1 toxin is seen in most animal species, although type B is most common in North America and Europe. The usual source of the toxin is decaying carcasses or vegetable materials such as decaying grass, hay, grain, or spoiled silage. Toxins of all types have the same action.

"The signs of botulism are caused by muscle paralysis. They include paralysis becoming progressively more severe, disturbed vision, difficulty in chewing and swallowing, and overall weakness. Death is usually due to paralysis of the lungs or heart. Diagnosis of this condition is difficult, and it is often made by excluding any other possible causes of paralysis and by association with a likely source of the toxin.

"Botulism may also originate in 2 other ways. _Clostridium botulinum_ has occasionally been found to grow in the gastrointestinal tract and produce toxins there. When the toxins are released, they cause typical botulism. This occurs in foals usually less than 4 weeks old and results in the shaker foal syndrome. Foals may be found dead without previous signs, but most often, foals show signs of paralysis that slowly progresses. Stilted gait, muscle tremors, and the inability to stand for more than 4 to 5 minutes are key signs. Other signs include difficulty swallowing, constipation, dilated pupils, and frequent urination. As the disease progresses, labored breathing with extension of the head and neck, rapid heart rate, and respiratory arrest occur. Death occurs most often 1 to 3 days after signs are first noted. Botulinum antitoxin has been used for treatment, with varying success. Early administration to foals, before they can no longer stand, is reported to be successful. Full supportive care is also important. In endemic areas, such as Kentucky, vaccination with type B toxoid appears to be effective.

"A 3rd form of botulism occurs in humans -- and sometimes in adult horses -- when the bacterium grows and produces toxin in a wound. This is referred to as wound botulism."
(https://www.merckvetmanual.com/horse-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-horses/botulism-in-horses)

"Botulinum antitoxin has been used for treatment with varying degrees of success, depending on the type of toxin involved and the species of host. Treatment involves hydration, correcting electrolyte disturbances, and general supportive measures. Treatment of ducks and mink with type C antitoxin is often successful; however, such treatment is rarely used in cattle. Early administration of antitoxin (type B) specific or polyvalent to foals before recumbency (30 000 IU, IV) is reported to be successful. Supportive care in valuable animals is essential; prognosis is poor in recumbent animals. In endemic areas (e.g., Kentucky), vaccination with type B toxoid appears to be effective." - Mod.TG
