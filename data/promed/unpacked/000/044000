Hepatitis C epidemic in Ukraine
-------------------------------
Treatment of hepatitis C in Ukraine is very expensive; free treatment
is offered only if the person is co-infected with HIV [human
immunodeficiency virus]. It is known now that 1 in 30 Ukrainian
carries hepatitis C [virus], which equates to approximately 3 to 10
percent of the population.

According to public health specialists, the prevalence of hepatitis C
is 10 times higher than HIV and the prevalence of hepatitis C in
Ukraine is higher than elsewhere in Europe.

Treatment costs range from 10 to 19 000 [US] dollars plus about USD
200 every month for laboratory tests. Free antiviral treatment is
offered only to those Ukrainians who have HIV/hepatitis C
co-infection.

[The increase in hepatitis C is associated with the increase in HIV
in Ukraine. The routes of transmission of hepatitis C are similar to
those for HIV, that is, sexual, intravenous, and blood transfusion. No
vaccine against hepatitis C is available. - Mod.NR]

[According to Dumchev KV et al (HIV and hepatitis C virus infections
among hanka injection drug users in central Ukraine: a cross-sectional
survey. In Harm Reduct J 2009 Aug 23; 6(1): 23; available at
<http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/6/1/23>), Ukraine has
experienced an increase in injection drug use since the 1990s. An
increase in HIV and hepatitis C virus infections has followed as a
consequence.
