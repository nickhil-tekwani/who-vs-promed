Cases of rare, deadly flesh-eating disease spike in Nanaimo and Oceanside dogs
-----------------------------------------------------------
Necrotizing fasciitis is a flesh-eating disease in which bacteria rapidly eats away at healthy tissue in dogs when it enters their body through a cut or other breach of the skin. It causes incredibly painful swelling and usually results in amputation or euthanasia. It's a rare bacterial infection which is proving life-altering, if not fatal, for pets [on Vancouver Island].

Dr Catherine Daniel, a veterinarian at Nanaimo's Central Island Veterinary Emergency Hospital, told NanaimoNewsNOW she's either personally treated or is aware of at least 6 cases from Nanaimo and Oceanside in recent months, after not experiencing the disease in her career before. "It's rapid, one of our cases was literally getting worse in front of our eyes. One case came in and it only had a little swelling about the size of a golf ball, the next day it was back and the whole leg was swollen."

Two dogs in Nanaimo and 1 in Parksville were confirmed as necrotizing fasciitis cases with all 3 being put down. Another 2 in Qualicum Beach are suspected to have succumbed to the disease with lab results still pending. Details of the 6th case on the Island are unknown as the owners have not consented to their information being released.

Incidents began showing up to Dr Daniel in October [2021], with the most recent one coming in mid-April [2022] and it's not known if the 6 are linked in any way.

The bacteria, _Streptococcus canis_, will be living on a surface, including an animal's skin, but is largely harmless until it has the opportunity to enter under the skin. It is not considered contagious in the same manner as a virus, but a small sample size means little is known about how the bacteria is travelling and why it becomes so serious, so quickly in some animals. "We don't exactly know what exact conditions allow it to become so aggressive, because a lot of dogs will have _S. canis_ but not get necrotizing fasciitis," Daniel said. "There's still a lot of unanswered questions."

Once in the body, time is of the essence. Swelling of the affected area changes by the hour and antibiotics do little to stop the spread. Daniel said a majority of dogs will either have the limb amputated or be euthanized within 24 to 48 hours of showing signs. "If you catch it early enough and you treat it...with aggressive surgery, you can potentially save them. Cases I know that have been successful, generally if it happens on a limb, the limb is amputated."

The swelling is typically discoloured and squishy and leaves an imprint when pushed on. It is also incredibly painful for the animal. "They might be super, super sore and it's this tiny swelling and you can't make heads or tails why they're as sore as they are," Daniel said. "Sometimes they'll come in completely non-weight bearing, acting like their leg is broken and it's the swelling."

Daniel admitted it's a tough conversation for vets and dog owners to have, discussing amputation or euthanasia for what looks to be a minor injury. A delay in actually identifying the disease can often be fatal, so surgeons are having to remove limbs before necrotizing fasciitis is confirmed. But it's the spread of swelling which often forces their hand. "With the last couple of cases we drew a line where the swelling ended and within 2 hours you could see it had progressed past the line."

Daniel is helping lead an effort to not only study recent cases but track future ones. Future samples of suspected cases will be sent to doctors who specialize in the disease and a survey is being developed for past cases to try and determine any common links.

Daniel said they are also reaching out to Island vets to share their research in a bid to find more cases or help them detect future ones faster. The bacteria in dogs carries a very low risk to humans, with Daniel saying only someone severely immunocompromised would be even remotely vulnerable to this specific strain.

[Canine necrotising fasciitis (NF) is an uncommon, deep-seated destructive infection of the skin, subcutaneous, and superficial fascia. Rarely, the process also can occur in the muscle, when it is termed necrotising myositis (NM)1.

Both of these conditions can be associated with another syndrome called toxic shock syndrome (TSS1).

What causes it?
---------------
A number of different bacterial species have been isolated from dogs with NF, and include the following (1,2,3):
- _Streptococcus_ species
- Most streptococcal species isolated from canine NF belong to a group of commensal streptococci belonging to the group G streptococci, which includes the species _Streptococci canis_
- _Streptococcus canis_ has been isolated from dogs in the following infections - Urinary tract infection; mastitis; metritis; skin infections; septic bacteraemia
- _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_
- _Escherichia coli_
- _Clostridium_ species
- _Pasteurella_ species
- _Staphylococcus pseudointermedius_

What are the risk factors?
--------------------------
- Fluoroquinolone antibiotic administration (1)
(Fluoroquinolone antibiotics induce expression of a bacteriophage-encoded streptococcal super-antigen)
- Potential risk factors (1,2)
(Immune-suppression; corticosteroid administration; radiation therapy (4)
- Trauma (1)
(Note: pre-existing traumatic injury or trauma is not always evident or necessary for NF or NM to occur; pre-existing trauma can be major (for example, bite wounds; surgery) or very minor. Case reports in veterinary literature have cited injection sites for subcutaneous fluid administration, and small wounds as potential points of entry for causative organisms. Surgical sites may be recent, or may be many years old (for example, cruciate surgery etc.); where no wound is found, it is assumed bacteria gain entry to tissues from haematogenous routes)

Pathophysiology
---------------
The following is a brief description of the progression of infection to overt disease (1-3):
1. Bacteria gain entry from wound, or haematogenous spread and localise in fascia/muscle
2. Bacteria produce endotoxins and proteases causing local tissue damage, creating a nidus for bacterial proliferation
3. Infection spreads along fascial planes
4. Toxin-induced thrombosis and vasoconstriction in infected tissue, and surrounding skin and muscle results in decreased tissue viability and increased spread of infection.
5. Toxic shock syndrome may ensue as a result of tissue destruction and haematogenous spread of endotoxins and inflammatory mediators
6. Steatitis [fatty tissue inflammation] may occur without skin destruction in some cases.

Progression is extremely rapid, with clinical signs of swelling over an affected area to discoloration and progressing to septic shock taking minutes to hours without treatment.

Diagnosis
---------
Early diagnosis is crucial in reducing the severity of disease as failure to diagnose NF or NM early during illness is thought to play a major role in the high mortality rates -- which can approach 100%.

The following list outlines clinical features of the disease:
- No age or sex predilection
- The patient is usually normal up to a few hours prior to presentation
- Acute pain - with or without noticeable swelling or injury
- Intense pain - often disproportionate to an injury, wound, old surgery site or swelling. In some cases, no injury is found
- Swelling at the site of pain. Occasionally, spasm and rigidity is seen about affected tissue
- Visual characteristics:
(Usually, there is no discoloration or demarcation on the skin initially. However, it usually develops over several hours; infections by _Pseudomonas_ are characterised by early erythema and rapid discoloration
- Pyrexia [fever] may develop within 24 hrs. of presentation
- Clinical signs of septic shock
(Hypotension; tachycardia or bradycardia [very fast or very slow heart rate]; hyperaemic/red mucous membranes; collapse)

Diagnostic evaluation should include the following:
1. Careful evaluation for evidence of wounds (bite wounds, old scars, etc)
2. Diagnostic imaging (1,5)
(Radiography - may reveal gas pocketing within soft tissues; ultrasonography - may reveal fluid accumulations in tissues, which may be aspirated for cytology, gram stain and culture)
3. Fluid analysis
3a. Fluid characteristics
a. _Streptococcus canis_: cream/gray-coloured, purulent material with no odour (dish-water pus)
b. _Clostridium_ spp: cream-coloured malodourous pus
3b. Cytology
a. _Streptococcus canis_: chains of cocci
b. _E. coli_: gram-negative rods
c. _Clostridium_ spp: plump, gram-positive rods
d. _Pasteurella multocida_: bipolar gram-negative rods
3c. Gram stain
3d. Antimicrobial culture and sensitivity

Treatment
---------
Patients with NF or NM, with or without toxic shock, require urgent and intensive therapy. Treatment falls broadly into two categories: stabilisation and supportive care; and fasciitis/myositis management.

1. Stabilisation and supportive care involve support of respiratory and cardiovascular systems as dictated by patient clinical status (1,3).
1a. Stabilisation
a. Oxygen supplementation
b. Provision of ventilation support may be required in patients with acute respiratory distress due to septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
c. Intravenous fluid therapy should be applied to treat shock, provide for correction of hydration deficits, and electrolyte disorders.
d. Blood pressure should be monitored, and maintained within normal limits using intravenous fluid therapy, positive inotropes (dobutamine) and cautious use of vasopressors (noradrenaline) to achieve desired end-points (SAP >100 mm Hg; MAP > 70 mm Hg)
e. Urine output should be monitored and maintained at or above 1 ml/kg/hr
f. Coagulation abnormalities should be managed with fresh frozen plasma prior to surgical intervention and debridement of the areas of fasciitis (see below)
1b. Supportive care
a. Analgesia should be provided using a multi-modal approach. Typically, an opioid infusion, such as fentanyl, combined with ketamine continuous infusion is recommended. Addition of intravenous lidocaine +/- local nerve block with lidocaine/bupivacaine will improve the quality of analgesia. Epidural analgesia should generally be avoided in septic patients.
b. Antimicrobial therapy should commence immediately following sample collection for antimicrobial culture and sensitivity.

1c. Initial antibiotic choice is based on cytological appearance and gram stain
a. Gram positive cocci in chains (_Streptococci_): clindamycin 10 mg/kg q 12 hrs.; amoxycillin/clavulanate 10-20 mg/kg q 12 hrs.
b. Gram negative rods (_Pseudomonas_, _E. coli_) - enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin
c. Gram positive rods (_clostridia_): metronidazole 10 mg/kg q 12 hrs.
d. _Pasteurella_: cefazolin 20 mg/kg q 8-12 hrs.
e. NOTE: fluoroquinolones SHOULD NOT be administered to patients with Gram positive infections

2. Surgical management involves debridement of affected tissues, and should be performed as early as possible to reduce bacterial load and necrotic tissue (1,2).
2a. Remove all necrotic tissue until bleeding is observed from all remaining tissues (muscle, subcutaneous tissues). Fat resection in affected areas must be meticulous, as adipose tissue has a relatively poor blood supply.
2b. Copious wound lavage with lactated Ringers' solution or 0.9% NaCl is recommended
2c. Closure
a. Where debridement is required: manage as an open wound using debridement dressings, with manuka honey or sugar. Delayed primary closure may be attempted only when it is clear infection no longer remains (granulation tissue will begin to appear at this stage)
b. Where debridement is not required, primary closure may be applied
c. Vacuum-assisted wound closure has been applied and may reduce wound healing time and improve wound contracture (2,6).

Conclusion
----------
Patients exhibiting pain in a localised area, especially when accompanied by fever, must have necrotising fasciitis placed on their differential diagnosis list. In these cases, it is important to avoid specific therapies mentioned above, such as routine use of fluoroquinolones etc., and to intensively monitor the patients, intervening with appropriate surgical and medical therapy early in the disease.

Necrotising fasciitis is a serious and potentially fatal infectious condition that requires a high index of suspicion to be applied, along with early, aggressive intervention in order to achieve optimal outcome.
