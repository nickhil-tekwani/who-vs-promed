Flesh-Eating Infection Strikes Fishermen, Surfer in Volusia County
-----------------------------------------------------------
Several fishermen and at least one surfer in Volusia County, FL,
have reportedly contracted a mysterious infection that eats at their
flesh, according to a Local 6 News report.
Doctor Jeff Parks, an Ormond Beach dermatologist, said he has
treated 8 patients, including 2 who were hospitalized, in the last 2
months with the painful and contagious crater-like lesions. Parks
says the disease has been found in patients who had been in the
ocean.
Bacterial infections are common among commercial fishermen and
others who handle fish. [But] Parks says he is perplexed about why
so many people contracted this particular strain of bacteria.
A surfer was recently treated after an infection called
methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ or MRSA, entered
his body through an open wound as he swam in the Atlantic Ocean,
said his mother. The parent said the infection spread across her
son's body in less than a day. "There was a large space vacant of
skin, and it was oozing," she said.
MRSA bacteria create the same life-threatening lesions experts are
treating on turtles and fish in Central Florida, according to Local 6
News reporter Tarik Minor.
Fisherman Jim Freeman told Local 6 News that he knows of 8
fishing boat captains infected with MRSA. "It starts out as a white
pimple, but the minute you pop that pimple it starts boring,"
Freeman said. "It will go to the bone. Doctors say once it goes to
the bone, you either have to cut your arm off or cut your leg off."

[ProMED would like more information about this outbreak.
Community-acquired MRSA certainly has caused a number of
clusters including children, prisoners, and male homosexuals,
primarily related to skin infections.
These cases seem to vary in severity, since not all of those
afflicted were hospitalized, but some of the cases may have been
necrotizing fasciitis. An organism that can cause such a cluster
and is associated with sea water is _Vibrio vulnificus_ (1,2). It is
not clear if this halophilic vibrio or another bacterium is playing a
role here, nor whether there is any [etiological] relationship to the
reports of infections in turtles and fish.
