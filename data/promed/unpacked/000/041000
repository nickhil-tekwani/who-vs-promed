Bovine anthrax
--------------
Location: Mar Chiquita (near to the lake of the same name), Buenos Aires
Province.

The cattle started to die suddenly on 28 Jan 2008. Up to the present, there
are 13 dead cattle (11 cows, one calf, 2 bulls). This estancia [ranch] has
not suffered outbreaks before, but there have been outbreaks in the area in
recent years.

The cattle had not been vaccinated, although the estancia's veterinarian
had been recommending vaccination. There are no human cases.

[There is an excellent surveillance programme in place in this province,
with careful checking on every possible case. As a result, the annual
incidence is falling away. Unfortunately, not every herd is vaccinated,
with the result that we see here. The province is extremely flat with a
high water table. As a result, there are haemophagic flies in abundance to
take any infection from estancia to estancia. When I visited Azul and was
taken out to visit some of the estancias, not only was the grazing totally
outstanding, but within 360 feet, I could see some 2000 cattle grazing.

Buenos Aires province can be found at

Lagoon is north-northeast of Mar del Plata.

Our thanks to Ramon for this prompt report. - Mod.MHJ]
