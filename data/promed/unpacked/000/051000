In Saratsky district, Odesa region, a new case of anthrax was spotted as Saratsky Regional State Administration reported to Ukrinform. "The owner of the farm in Mykolaivka-Novorosiiska village spotted the signs of the disease of a cow that "fell on its feet" and appealed to the specialists. The workers of the animal health area urgently arrived at the site and confirmed the presence of the anthrax causative agent. No person was affected. The measures on the localization of the outbreak were put in place," the message said.

The specialists disinfected the [stable] and yard where the ill animal was contained, and quarantine was imposed in the village. This implies a ban for the removal of the meat and milk from this village. Moreover, other measures on the localization of anthrax outbreak were assumed.

Earlier we reported that a spell of anthrax was observed in a village in Saratsky district, Odesa region, southern Ukraine. According to preliminary data, the source of the disease is a domestic cow, [which] was slaughtered for meat. A total of 5 people who skinned the animal, suffered the symptoms and were taken to hospitals; they are under the medical supervision. Their lives are out of danger.

[The previous case was reported in the village of Minyalivka in Odessa region's Saratsky district, same district, different village. The potential connection of the 2 outbreaks has yet to be revealed by the Ukrainian veterinarians. If there have been other coincident bovine unreported cases I would be suspecting a contaminated dairy feed. The report indicates that the affected animal was housed at the time of death -- not unusual for dairy cows in winter -- which would rule out grazing. If there had been a frost, I would be not expecting to see any contaminated tabanid female flies visiting adjoining herds. I look forward to hearing what they find. - Mod.MHJ
