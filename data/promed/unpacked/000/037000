[A quick summary of Lumpy Skin Disease can be found in USDA's Foreign
Animal Disease "Gray Book" at
<http://www.vet.uga.edu/VPP/gray_book/FAD/LSD.htm>. The disease is
characterized by fever and the formation of 1-7 cm nodules in the
skin which eventually become necrotic. The skin of the muzzle,
nares, back, legs, scrotum, perineum, eyelids, lower ear, nasal and
oral mucosa, and tail are particularly likely to be affected. Biting
insects play a major role, and transmission increases in the rainy
season. Morbidity can range from 3 to 85 percent and mortality is
usually low, although some high-mortality outbreaks have been
documented. The disease occurs over much of sub-Saharan Africa with
previous outbreaks also in Kuwait, Egypt and Israel in the late
1980s. - Mod.PC]
[It is worthwhile mentioning that if cattle are vaccinated with the
heterologous sheep pox vaccine rather than the specific LSD
(Neetling) vaccine, the use of the Kenyan strain 0240 is strongly
contraindicated, since it is known to have caused serious reactions
in cattle, particularly dairy cattle. - Mod.AS]
