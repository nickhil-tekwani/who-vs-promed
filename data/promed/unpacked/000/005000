Outbreak of chikungunya [virus infection] in the Republic of the
Congo
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost 1000 suspected cases of chikungunya, a mosquito-borne viral
disease that causes fever and severe joint pain, have been recorded
in the Republic of Congo's capital [Brazzaville] over the past 2
weeks.

"More than 900 people are showing symptoms of chikungunya, which is
transmitted by mosquito," Director-General of Health Alexis Elira
Dokekias told a news conference on 14 Jun 2011.

The disease's symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea,
fatigue, and rash, and are similar to those of dengue fever. There is

no known cure; treatment consists of relieving the symptoms.

Dokekias said the 1st cases appeared in early June 2011 in the poor
neighbourhoods of Bacongo and Makelekele in the south of
Brazzaville.

Of 48 samples analysed in a laboratory in neighbouring Gabon, just
over half tested positive for the virus, he said.

Dokekias urged anyone showing symptoms of the disease to report to
the nearest medical centre, and called on all citizens to clean up
potential mosquito habitats.

Chikungunya takes its name from a word in the Kimakonde language
meaning "to become contorted" -- a reference to the stooped
appearance of those infected.

[[Cases of chikungunya were reported around the same time last year
[2010] from South Eastern Gabon as part of a mixed chikungunya/dengue
outbreak.

This new outbreak in Brazzaville is an indication that the risk of
transmission is still high in the region. Chikungunya is an arboviral
disease transmitted by mosquitoes, commonly _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes
albopictus_. The poor neighborhoods affected in Brazzaville are
therefore particularly at risk if there are environmental conditions
that favor breeding of mosquitoes.

During outbreaks, it is recommended that affected communities be
mobilised to initiate interventions to halt community transmission.
Such measures include reducing the number of natural and artificial
water-filled container habitats that support the breeding of the
mosquitoes. Complementary measures may include: use of insecticides;
clothing which minimizes skin exposure; repellents that contain DEET
(N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), IR3535
(3-[N-acetyl-N-butyl]-aminopropionic acid ethyl ester), or icaridin
(1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpropylester)
and can be applied to exposed skin; and insecticide treated mosquito
nets for those who sleep during the day time (see
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs327/en/).

[The number of cases has climbed dramatically from over 480 reported
on 11 Jun 2011 to over 900 just 3 days later on 14 Jun 2011,
indicating an accelerating outbreak. - Mod.TY]
