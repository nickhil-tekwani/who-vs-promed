Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Monglar, Kyaingtong, Shan State
Date of start of the outbreak: 15 Mar 2016
Outbreak status: resolved on 6 Apr 2016
Epidemiological unit: Livestock market
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 300 / 5 / - / 0 / 300
Affected population: layer chicken from collecting points

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed in percentages]

*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals
Epidemiological comments: risk-based surveillance of H7N9 in targeted border Townships and live bird market in Yangon and Mandalay has been conducted since 2013 by cooperation between the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department and FAO. Until now, the 5th round of the risk based surveillance of H7N9 has been conducted and 16545 chickens and ducks oropharyngeal swabs, 7765 environmental swabs and 705 duck sera were collected from poultry collecting points, poultry processing sites, formal city markets and live bird markets. Those samples were tested in Mandalay and Yangon Diagnostic Laboratory and then confirmed and sequenced by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong. From this 5th round of active surveillance, clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAI virus, which shares 99 percent similarity with A/chicken/Hubei/XG18/2015(H5N6) and 98 percent similarity with A/duck/Guangdong/GD01/2014(H5N6), was detected in the samples collected from chicken and environmental swabs in Monglar, which has a common border with China. H5N6 positive samples were taken from apparently healthy chickens imported from China, as well as from the environment. H5N6 positive samples were more concentrated geographically and temporally, and were found specifically in live bird markets, in ducks and chickens imported from China (unknown breeds).

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country disinfection/disinfestations; dipping/spraying for control of vectors or parasites; stamping out; official; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong (OIE Reference Laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 14 Dec 2016 / Positive

The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[According to the report, these samples were collected in March 2016, as part of an active surveillance program. Confirmation was made just this past December 2016, and the results officially communicated in February 2017. Almost a year following the collection of the samples was the information of this HPAI H5N6 finding made officially known. Even though good efforts are made to improve active surveillance, regrettably, in many cases, real time surveillance information of a disease detection is still quite limited.

The epidemiological comments in the report note that; "From this 5th round of active surveillance, clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAI virus, which shares 99 percent similarity with A/chicken/Hubei/XG18/2015(H5N6) and 98 percent similarity with A/duck/Guangdong/GD01/2014(H5N6), was detected in the samples collected from chicken and environmental swabs in Monglar, which has a common border with China. H5N6 positive samples were taken from apparently healthy chickens imported from China, as well as from the environment. H5N6 positive samples were more concentrated geographically and temporally, and were found specifically in live bird markets, in ducks and chickens imported from China (unknown breeds)."

China reported HPAI H5N6 on 23 Aug 2014. Since that time a total of 39 outbreaks have been reported. This event is still continuing. The latest follow-up report (no. 18) is dated 12 Jan 2017; see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=22251.

"Avian influenza A (H5N6) viruses have caused severe infection in humans, and thus far, human infections with the virus seem to be sporadic with no ongoing human-to-human transmission." (http://www.who.int/csr/don/07-december-2016-ah5n6-china/en/)
