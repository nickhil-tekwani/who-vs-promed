Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne disease, has killed at least 24 children in Odisha's Malkangiri district, an official said on Saturday [10 Nov 2012]. A team of experts visited the affected area a few days ago and collected nearly 70 samples after the children, aged between 2-5 years, died in 5 villages of the district in recent months. The team found that 10 samples were positive for Japanese encephalitis virus, according to the Joint Director of the state health department, M. M. Pradhan.

The dead children had symptoms including swelling of the eyes, nose, and ears, and they also had other symptoms characteristic of Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus that is responsible for the deaths of thousands of children in India every year. The investigation results of the rest of the samples will come soon, Pradhan said.

Pradhan said that villages had large number of pigs, the amplifying host of the virus.

No new cases of disease have been reported from the district after the affected areas were disinfected and an awareness campaign was launched.

[So far, 10 of some 70 samples from affected children have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis virus infection. It is not yet clear whether any other virus may be implicated in this outbreak as has been reported elsewhere in India, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a virus disease that infects animals and humans. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and in humans causes inflammation of the membranes around the brain. It is associated with irrigation and build-up of the mosquito-vector populations. This may cause the circulation of the virus to spill over into humans from its preferred hosts, birds and pigs. An effective inactivated vaccine is available, but it is expensive and requires more than a single injection. As is the case in Odisha, control of the pig population and mosquito eradication may be the best public health options.

Most JE virus infections are mild or without apparent symptoms, but approximately one in 200 infections result in severe disease characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and death. The case fatality rate can be as high as 60 percent among those with such disease symptoms. In areas where Japanese encephalitis virus is common, encephalitis is observed mainly in young children, because older children and adults have already been infected and are immune.

Orissa -- now officially rendered as Odisha -- is located on the east coast of India, adjacent to the Bay of Bengal. A map of Odisha/Orrisa showing Malkagigiri district in the far south of the state can be accessed at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orissa_State_map.svg. - Mod.CP
