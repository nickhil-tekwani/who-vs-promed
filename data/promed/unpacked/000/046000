The Chubut Interinstitutional Roundtable for the Massive Flowering of Colihue Cane (MIFMCC) confirmed yesterday [8 Nov 2013] that "the studies carried out in the Malbran Institute gave positive results for a presumptive hantavirus [infection] case," contracted by a 30 year old [female] patient from Aldea Escolar (Trevelin), who has been hospitalized for several days in the Esquel area hospital. In general, it was reported that the woman was progressing favorably, having been moved from the intensive care unit to a general ward.

Although a "yellow alert" was decreed due to the proliferation of rodents in the Los Alerces National Park, caused by the massive flowering of colihue cane from the winter to date, only 3 cases of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] have been registered in the Chubut mountainous region (2 cases in Trevelin and one in El Hoyo) -- which is within the annual average [of cases] for the region -- with the people affected having recuperated well.

The officials stated that "the park guards are doing impeccable work, passing out flyers containing all the preventive measures and making camping sites adequate so they will be safe."

The natural phenomenon of colihue cane flowering occurs once every 70 years, and in recent times it has happened in the Nahuel Huapi and Lago Puelo National Parks as well as in El Manso and other rural areas, without effects on the activities of the inhabitants or on tourism.

However, in the case of Los Alerces National Park, it was stated that "the increase in the rodent population is estimated at 1000 per ha [404 per acre], which makes it a season completely different and that will have a different impact on tourism," according to the head of the Esquel Department of Environmental Health, Rosendo Benedetti.

In detail, he stated that "the increase in the rat population was expected by, or following, last winter [2013]. The delay [in the rodent population increase] complicates some issues, especially by the arrival of the summer season," he said. Given the current situation, Mayor Arturo Costa Alvarez issued a resolution declaring a "yellow alert", based on "monitoring and studies carried out in relation to the rodent population, which in October 2013 increased 600 per cent in relation to sampling in the month of March 2013, in addition to the hantavirus antibody prevalence having reached 6 per cent in the rodents tested," according to the report from the Malbran Institute.

[Although the specific hantavirus involved in the 3 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this region is not specified, it most likely is Andes virus. Andes virus is the only hantavirus shown thus far to be transmitted directly from person to person, but only rarely, and among individuals in very close contact. Most infections are acquired from contact with excrement of infected rodents. Andes virus occurs in western Argentina, harbored by the long-tailed pygmy rice rat reservoir host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. The public health authorities and local park guards are doing an excellent, proactive job of informing the public in high risk areas to prevent additional cases.
