[It seems as though I "spoke" too soon re: possible interruption of transmission in the outbreak in Riyadh in yesterday's update (see MERS-CoV (71): Saudi Arabia (MK), pilgrimage caution, WHO 20160623.4305152), although we do not have the dates of hospitalization of this patient and dates of possible exposure to other MERS-CoV infected patients.

The unknowns still exist as to modes of transmission in the healthcare environment -- perhaps one of the positive outcomes of the identification of significant numbers of asymptomatic infections will permit a definitive study on transmission routes and the possible role of asymptomatic infections in the transmission cycle of the virus -- as well as a study of the viruses to see if there have been mutations with continued transmission to milder clinical expressions. So many questions await answering.
