The following is a summary of the responses received from 5 Epizootic/Core members within 24 hours of our request for case numbers and vaccination status of this outbreak:

- The exact number of deaths is not certain but surely more than 11.

- According to the weekly Epidemiological Report for week 37 there were 43 suspected cases of yellow fever in Ifelodun LGA of Kwara state. The laboratory tests were negative for 30; 1 was invalid; and 12 results are pending. [Interestingly, no mention is made of the 2 cases there were reported as confirmed. - Mod.TY]

- As at Epidemic week 37: 43 suspected cases have been identified, 1 confirmed case and vaccination is yet to commence. [This same Weekly Epidemiological Report on the cases was sent to ProMED-mail by Ebere Okereke <Ebere.Okereke@phe.gov.uk>, who is thanked. - Mod. TY]

- Suspected case: 17. Deaths: 11.

- A call to a member of the outbreak response team obtained the following information:
There is a discrepancy between the media reports and members of the outbreak response team. As of today [Thu 5 Oct 2017], 2 cases have been confirmed. Reactive vaccination is being planned though yet to commence.

[The count of the officially reported suspected cases totals 43. Of these, 30 have been discarded and 1 is invalid, leaving 12 results pending. Apparently the 2 confirmed cases are not included, but this is not clear. The results of the 12 pending cases are awaited with interest. If any of these 12 cases are confirmed as yellow fever, initiation of the vaccination campaign is urgent.
