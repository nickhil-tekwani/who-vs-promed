In the first eight months of this year more than [how many? - Mod - CHC]
15 people have died from complications of dengue. Its prevalence in Laos
is
reaching extreme levels and it continues to be a serious cause of
illness
throughout the country.
Since the beginning of 1998 the number of people with dengue has risen
to
surpass the figures of last year. In 1997, there were about 2615
patients
with dengue, of whom 14 died.
A total of about 10 000 people, or 0.25 per cent of the population, have
had dengue, and 295 of those died in 1987 alone. During that
time the disease spread very quickly and became an epidemic among the
capitals of the main provinces. After that, the number of patients
decreased until 1994-95, when figures began to soar and the
disease began to spread once again.
