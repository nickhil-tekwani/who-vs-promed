An unidentified epidemic is spreading among some North Korean towns
bordering China, placing North Korean health authorities on high
alert, a local aid group said on Tue 2 Jun 2008.

The disease, suspected to be avian influenza by some North Korean
doctors or hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) by others, has
already taken the lives of many North Korean children under 7 years
of age, the Buddhist group Good Friends said in its newsletter. Each
day since 27 Apr 2008, 5 to 6 children have died of the unidentified
epidemic in Hoeryong, North Hamgyong Province, the group said,
quoting a doctor of a hospital in the city. The disease is already
common among young children in the neighboring city of Musan,
according to the group.

"We diagnose the disease as avian influenza," the group quoted a
North Korean doctor in Hoeryong as saying. Patients show flu-like
symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and no appetite, the
doctor added. "Yes, right. Bird flu is spreading," another doctor in
Musan was quoted as saying. The disease is spreading mainly among
state-run daycare centers and kindergartens, although no cases of
adult infections have been reported, he added. "I understand the
authorities are trying to trace the root of the disease," he said.

But a 3rd North Korean doctor was quoted as saying that HFMD from
China may be spreading to North Korea's border areas, the aid group
said. HFMD has struck over 10 000 people resulting in 26 fatalities,
all of them children, in recent months, according to China's official
Xinhua News Agency.

A South Korean humanitarian agency says a mysterious epidemic has
been spreading along North Korean towns along the border with China,
killing dozens of children. The Seoul-based Good Friends agency says
5 or 6 children have died every day since the highly infectious
disease emerged on 27 Apr 2008.

The group says North Korean doctors have been unable to diagnose or
cure the disease and have said it could be avian flu or hand, foot
and mouth disease, which has killed dozens of children in China in
recent weeks.

Good Friends reports the outbreak has mainly affected state-run
daycare centres and kindergartens, with patients showing flu-like
symptoms before succumbing.

[The location of the North Korean outbreak, along the border with
China, and the age group of the patients are more consistent with a
diagnosis of HFMD rather than avian influenza, although the high
death toll is unexpected. Further information and clarification are
awaited.

[I would go further and say that if no adults are infected, and it is
affecting mainly state-run daycare centres and kindergartens, it can't
be either avian or human flu. - Mod.JW]
