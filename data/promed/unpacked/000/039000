Two samples of beef that were tested in Arkhangelsk were found
positive for anthrax. The box markings indicated Lvov (Ukraine) as
the source. In total 18 tons of beef were transported from
Lvov. Presently the meat storage facilities involved are closed
down. For final confirmation, meat samples have been sent for laboratory tests.
As a reminder, on 17 Feb 2006, 12 pieces of beef were confirmed
infected with _Bacillus anthracis_ in one of the markets in
Penza. Export of meat from Penza to Moscow was then prohibited. It
was also prohibited to sell meat in any public markets.

[Penza is 650 km southeast of Moscow. According to Google it has a
population of some 500 000 people and is bigger than Dublin or
Pittsburgh. "Street" or public markets have long been a place where
contaminated meat -- usually from a domestic slaughter and
frequently not inspected by the veterinary authorities -- has been
sold throughout Russia. - Mod.MHJ]

Since 20 Jan 2006 no meat was [exported] from Ukraine to Russia,
according to the Ukraine veterinary state department. The officials
at the state department state that the 18 tons of meat found in
Arkhangelsk and stamped as meat imported from Lvov should be
carefully tested with microscopic and bacteriological and biological
tests, and [a full] investigation should be conducted before making
such statements [concerning the origin of this meat].

Chief state veterinary inspector Ivan Bisyuk said that it was
incorrect that meat infected with anthrax found in Arkhangelsk was
imported from Ukraine. According to him, on 20 Jan 2006, Russia
declared a prohibition on importing meat from the Ukraine, and that
is why no meat was imported from Ukraine [by Russia]. According to
Bisyuk, meat could have reached Russia from Ukraine [only] through
illegal importing. At the same time, he said that the Ukraine
maintains border controls.
In October 2006, Russian experts on veterinary control inspected 19
Ukraine meat production companies. However, results have not yet been
announced.

[It is hard to make any valid conclusions based in the facts given in
the above articles before the results of tests are in. It is easy to
counterfeit a package for meat. It is known that meat was either
infected with anthrax or it was vaccinated with anthrax vaccine.
There is no danger for humans. The infected meat should be destroyed
and storage rooms should be disinfected. - Corresp.VM, translated by Mod.NR]
[My first question is, why was this meat shipment tested? If 18 tons
of beef were involved, how many boxes/carcasses/containers were
tested to find those 2 positives? Secondly, the apparent port of
entry was Archangel/Arkhangelsk, north of Moscow and a port on the
White Sea, which is a very long way from the Ukraine and the Black
Sea, and a major busy port, open year-round thanks to icebreakers.
There is patently more to this report than meets the eye. A good
working hypothesis would be that this was a shipment of meat with
forged papers and undertaken by a "Ukrainian" company not up-to-date
on Russian importation regulations. Also, the Russian authorities
have been a bit quick off the mark in their claims. We await a more
complete report on this event.
This is an occasion when restrictions on sharing cultures bites. We
and others have been trying to study the DNA of Russian _B.
anthracis_ cultures for some years but at all points have met with a
firm, immovable, Kremlin bureaucratic "Nyet!" As a result no one
knows anything of the geographic distribution of whatever genetic
strains exist in Russia, past or present. Papers are beginning to be
published of limited studies in a few adjoining countries. Thus,
unless this event involves a vaccine strain, as VM suggests, nailing
it down to its forensic origin(s) will be difficult if not impossible.
The only Russian importation restriction report that we have is from
Central Asia in 2003. - Mod.MHJ]
