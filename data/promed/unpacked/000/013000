The Public Health Agency [PHA] is leading a detailed investigation into the potential source of an outbreak of listeriosis among hospital patients. 4 cases including one death have been reported previously and 2 further cases have been confirmed. There have been no new cases identified since 18 Apr 2012.

As a precautionary measure, and while this investigation is ongoing, PHA has recommended that some pre-prepared foods should not be served to hospital in-patients. This is a precautionary measure while the PHA, along with the Food Standards Agency, Environmental Health officials and HSC Trusts, continue to investigate the potential source of this outbreak.

PHA has taken steps to reassure patients, their relatives and the public by producing a patient and visitor information leaflet "Preventing food poisoning at home and in health care settings" and also a short fact sheet on listeriosis. These have been distributed to all HSC Trusts and give details of foods that may be associated with _Listeria_ infection, practical food safety tips and advice on how to prevent food poisoning. PHA is also working with all Trusts to ensure that robust arrangements for food safety are maintained in the hospital setting.

Listeriosis is an uncommon infection in the hospital setting. It is usually food-borne, most often found in ready-to-eat refrigerated and processed foods such as chilled meats, soft cheeses, cold cuts of meat, pates and smoked fish. It may also be found in food items containing one or more of these products, e.g., sandwiches.

There would normally be between 3 to 5 cases of listeriosis each year in Northern Ireland. Listeriosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease. Most adults experience only mild infections of the eye and skin or gastroenteritis. It can, however, lead to severe illness including blood poisoning or meningitis.

Older people and individuals with weakened immune systems, including those who have cancer, AIDS or issues with alcohol misuse, are all susceptible. Listeriosis may be particularly dangerous in pregnancy as it can present as a mild and "flu-like" illness that is not serious to the mother but can cause miscarriage, premature delivery, stillbirth or severe illness in a newborn child.

The PHA is reminding patients in hospitals and those attending hospital day services that they should only eat foods provided on the wards by hospital staff and not eat foods from other sources such as hospital canteens, shops or restaurants. Visitors are urged not to bring food into hospitals for patients unless this has been discussed and agreed with ward managers. Patients should wash their hands before and after eating, eat food as soon as it is served, dispose of any leftovers immediately and not hold over food for later consumption.

[In an April 2012 ProMED-mail post (Listeriosis - UK: (Northern Ireland) nosocomial, fatal 20120415.1101822), a news report indicated that there were 3 cases of nosocomial listeriosis, one of which was fatal, at 2 hospitals in Northern Ireland (Antrim Area Hospital in Antrim and Causeway Hospital in Coleraine), possibly due to contaminated food prepared outside the hospital. The above news report indicates that the number of cases of nosocomial listeriosis is now 6, although no new cases have occurred since 18 Apr 2012. Comparison of the molecular characteristics, such as PFGE, of _L. monocytogenes_ strains isolated from the 6 cases with each other and with that of strains isolated from suspected foods would help to establish if a common source was involved and what would be the most likely source.

Antrim is a town in County Antrim with a population of 20 001 people in 2001 22 miles (35 km) northwest of Belfast, and Coleraine is a town in County Londonderry with a population of 24 042 people in 2001 55 miles (88.5 km) northwest of Belfast (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleraine).
