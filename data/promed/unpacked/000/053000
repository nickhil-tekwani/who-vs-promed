Swedish cases of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea saw a record-breaking rise in 2017, continuing the reverse of a trend, which saw the disease being almost totally eradicated just a decade ago. There were some 2550 new cases in 2015. Earlier reports stated the number of people who sought treatment for gonorrhea in the early part of 2017 was already 3 times higher than the same period in 2016.

While rates of infection with the disease were traditionally broadly similar between straight men, women, and gay men, what the Swedish Public Health Authority classifies as MSM -- men who have sex with men -- have seen a rapid rise in the past 5 years. In 2017, the number of cases among the gay community increased 59 per cent, well above the national average.

The spread of the disease has impacted disproportionately on certain areas. In the national capital of Stockholm, the prevalence of the disease is now 63 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, significantly ahead of the national rate of 25 cases per 100 000.

Speaking to SVT, Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist at the Public Health Authority, said of the rise: "Gonorrhea had almost disappeared completely in Sweden, but unfortunately we are seeing an increase again. The increase is mainly in the group of men who have sex with men, but we also see an increase in other groups.

"The reason for spreading is hard to know, but there are obvious connections to how individuals assess risks and how important it is with condom use."

[The rising number of cases of gonorrhea among men who have sex with men (MSM) is occurring worldwide and may be due to a variety of reasons that promote unprotected sex, such as engaging in unprotected sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own (serosorting), taking pre-exposure or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive "party drugs," use of smartphone apps that facilitate anonymous "hookups," etc.

Because of progressively decreasing susceptibility and resistance to currently recommended antimicrobial drugs, dual empiric therapy with the expanded-spectrum cephalosporin ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is currently recommended by the US CDC and the WHO; but many countries have seen _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ strains resistant to both these drugs. - Mod.ML
