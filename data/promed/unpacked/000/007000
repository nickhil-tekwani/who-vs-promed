In the aftermath of a human rabies death in Sto. Nino town in South Cotabato [Province], Mindanao, provincial health officials declared a rabies outbreak, according to a Philippines News Agency report today [14 Mar 2014].

Dr. Byron dela Cruz, officer-in-charge of the South Cotabato Provincial Veterinary Office, said Friday [14 Mar 2014] they have launched a massive anti-rabies vaccination among pet animals in Barangay Poblacion of Sto. Nino in a bid to prevent the possible spread of the disease to other areas. He said the vaccination drive mainly covers the 2-kilometer [about 1.2-mile] radius of the residence of the 44-year-old who died of rabies complications last March 4.

[The man], who is so far the 1st rabies fatality in the province this year [2014], succumbed exactly 2 months after being bitten by his own rabid dog, [the officer] said.

Though a relatively rare cause of death in the United States, 55 000 people die globally from this dreaded disease, mostly in Africa and Asia. That's a rate of one person every 10 minutes. And that shouldn't be the case because rabies in humans is 100 percent preventable through prompt and appropriate medical care.

The Department of Health (DOH) considers a single case of rabies infection as an outbreak due to its high fatality rate. In the entire Region 12, the DOH's regional epidemiology and surveillance unit (RESU) recorded a total of 19 cases and deaths due to rabies last year [2013].

[The human rabies death in Sto Nino town, South Cotabato Province, Mindanao has caused an official rabies outbreak to be declared, and the initiation of a regional canine vaccination programme. Such reactive vaccination programmes catch public attention. Unfortunately it is more cost effective to have proactive annual vaccination timed to catch the majority of young dogs and pups before they disperse.
