[Note: The appearance of the first CDC/ArboNET report of 2004, providing
national data for the United States, sets the clock for these updates. From
now on West Nile virus updates will be posted weekly in synchrony with
release of the cumulative figures for the United States. As previously,
reports of special significance (such as changes in geographic range,
virulence and pathogenicity, vector specificity and anything else of
special significance) will be posted separately as they come to hand. - Mod.CP]

West Nile Virus Activity - United States: Wed 9 to Tue 15 Jun 2004
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Human cases
-----------
As of Tue 15 Jun 2004, a total of 14 human cases of West Nile virus (WNV)
illness had been reported to CDC through ArboNET from 5 states. 10 cases
were reported from Arizona and one case each from California, New Mexico,
South Dakota, and Wyoming. 10 (71 percent) of the cases occurred in males;
the median age of patients was 53 years (range: 9 to 69 years), and dates
of illness onset ranged from 8 May 8 to 1 Jun 2004.

[In addition, reports of 2 cases in Colorado and one in Florida have
appeared in the press: see the following reports [3] & [4]. - Mod.CP]

Blood Donors
-------------
A total of 12 presumptive West Nile viremic blood donors have been reported
to ArboNET. Of these, 11 were reported from Arizona and one was reported
from New Mexico. Of the 12 donors reported to ArboNET, one person aged 69
years subsequently had neuroinvasive disease, and 2 persons aged 22 and 52
years had West Nile fever.

Birds and Equines
-----------------
During 2004, a total of 471 dead corvids and 55 other dead birds with WNV
infection have been reported from 18 states, and 16 WNV infections in
horses have been reported from 6 states (Alabama, Arizona, Missouri,
Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia).

Sentinel Chickens and Mosquitoes
--------------------------------
WNV seroconversions have been reported in 64 sentinel chicken flocks from 4
states (Arizona, California, Florida, and Louisiana), and 88 WNV-positive
mosquito pools have been reported from 8 states (Arizona, California,
Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas).

Additional information about national WNV activity is available from CDC at

Colorado: 1st Human Cases of West Nile Virus Infection Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------
Officials announced the 1st human cases of West Nile virus infection in
Colorado this season on Fri 11 Jun 2004. The case involved a 35-year-old
woman from Adams County, who became ill with a fever on 30 May 2004. She
was not hospitalized and is recovering, the health department said. A
30-year-old man from Pueblo County became ill with a fever on 2 Jun 2004.
He also was not hospitalized and is recovering.

The virus was first identified in Colorado in August 2002. During 2003,
the state led the nation with 2947 infections and 63 deaths.

Health officials said the recent warm weather was likely to blame for the
early human cases in 2004, the 1st of which was reported a month earlier
than in 2003. They said it doesn't necessarily mean it will be a bad year.

Florida: 1st Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection of the Year
--------------------------------------------------
The 1st human case of West Nile virus in Florida in 2004 has been confirmed
in Sarasota County. State health officials have not identified the victim
by age or gender. But they said the victim is expected to recover.

County health officials are reminding residents that mosquitoes are
prevalent during the summer rainy season and that everyone should cover
their skin when outdoors at during dusk and dawn. They said people age 50
and over are generally at a higher risk for severe symptoms.

There were 94 reported [human] cases of West Nile virus infection in
Florida in 2003. 6 people died.

Cumulative totals - Humans
--------------------------
As of Thu 27 May 2004, a total of 140 individuals resident in 22 of the 32
states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection: All 140
were seronegative and asymptomatic.

Cumulative totals - Equines
---------------------------
As of Thu 27 May 2004, a total of 1293 horses from 22 of the 32 states have
been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these animals
1006 were seronegative and 287 seropositive. All these animals were
asymptomatic.

Cumulative totals - Birds
-------------------------
As of Thu 27 May 2004, a total of 165 birds from 2 of the 32 states have
been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds 147

asymptomatic). All the seropositive birds were reported from the state of
Nuevo Leon.

the ProMED-mail post entitled "West Nile virus, birds - Puerto Rico (Ceiba)
20040614.1599. This post reported the detection of 2 West Nile
virus-positive birds in Puerto Rico. Mod.JW queried the species and
migratory status of the positive birds, eliciting the following responses.]

Date: Mon 14 Jun 2004
From: Peter Marra <marrap@si.edu>


Puerto Rico: Further information on West Nile virus-positive birds in Ceiba
---------------------------------------------------
One of the 2 West Nile virus-positive birds in Perto Rico was definitely a
resident bird species -- a bananaquit. The other individual was a green
heron that was probably resident, but there is no way to be sure. We have
recorded many [WNV] antibody-positive migrants in Puerto Rico.

Puerto Rico: Status of the West Nile Virus-positive Birds in Puerto Rico
---------------------------------------------------
The evidence for West Nile virus (WNV) transmission in Puerto Rico is only
serologic. We (Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and the Wadsworth
Center) have collected and tested 1205 bird sera collected in Puerto Rico:
712 residents, 493 migrants.

All samples were screened by an indirect IgG ELISA [Enzyme Linked
ImmunoSorbent Assay for Immunoglobulin G. - Mod.JW] to pick up flavivirus
antibodies. Reactive specimens were then confirmed by PRNT90s [Plaque
Reduction Neutralization Tests, 90 percent reduction. - Mod.JW]. 13
specimens were ELISA-positive (10 migrants, 2 year-round residents, and one
migratory status questionable). The migratory bird sera are to be
confirmed, but regardless of outcome, we are not certain where infection
occurred. The 2 year-round residents were a WNV-positive (PRNT-confirmed)
bananaquit collected at Roosevelt Roads NS and a common ground dove
positive for Saint Louis encephalitis virus (PRNT-confirmed) collected at
Laguna Cartegena NWR on the western coast of Puerto Rico. The green heron
with questionable migratory status was collected at Roosevelt Roads and was
WNV-positive (PRNT confirmed), but to be conservative we are calling this a
migrant.
