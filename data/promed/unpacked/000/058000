Approximately 50 patients acquired carbapenemase-producing _Klebsiella
pneumoniae_ (KPC), a multidrug resistant microorganism, and 30 per
cent of these patients died, according to Ms. Lizka Richard,
Vice-Director of Healthcare Facilities in Panama.

The specialist explained this occurrence was detected 2 months ago in
patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Metropolitan
Hospital Complex, managed by Social Security (CSS, according to its
Spanish initials), but the incidence of such cases is declining now.

She pointed out that the bacterium may have been brought by one or
more patients coming from outside the country, and then the infection
became disseminated, but we do not have hundreds of cases, and those
patients who died developed multimicrobial infections and multiorgan
failure.

She also explained that KPC attacks patients undergoing mechanical
ventilation; it enters their bodies through the respiratory route;
internal organs become affected, leading to death in some cases,
particularly in severely ill patients.

With respect to the possibility that a healthy person undergoing
surgery could acquire this infection, Ms. Richard said that a healthy
patient is able to successfully fight this infection, and also pointed
out that CSS is currently purchasing tigecycline, even though it has
not been included yet in the national drug formulary. She said that
the situation is under control.

Ms. Richard denied that there is any affected person in the
hemodialysis service, and she clarified that these patients may be
affected by any microorganism living on the skin, leading to the
development of several diseases, since their immune system is already
depressed.

She also said that the presence of the aforementioned microorganism is
a worldwide phenomenon, not exclusive to Panama. The occurrence of
this particular mutation is because of improper antimicrobial use,
which has led to the emergence of progressively drug resistant
bacteria.

The microorganism _Klebsiella_ Oxa-48, a multidrug-resistant
bacterium, may be the cause of death for 27 persons in the Netherlands
since 1 Jun 2011, according to a spokesperson from Maastad Hospital in
Rotterdam.

Even though the 27 deceased persons were infected by the
aforementioned bacterium, this does not mean these persons died as a
consequence of the infection, added a spokesman from Maastad Hospital
in Rotterdam. An investigation was started in order to determine
whether there is any relationship between deaths and this multidrug
resistant microorganism.

The hospital reported the 1st 2 fatal cases on 1 Jun 2011. The most
recent report indicates that there are 78 carriers of this
microorganism, and another 1967 persons are also suspected to be
carriers.

According to hospital sources, the situation now is under control.
This is the 1st time this type of microorganism has been detected in
the Netherlands, even though outbreaks had been previously reported in
France, Israel, and India, among other countries.

[Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes
imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. Carbapenems have the
broadest antibacterial spectrum compared to other beta-lactam classes,
such as penicillins and cephalosporins, and are resistant to most
beta-lactamases, especially the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases
(ESBLs) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC89009/) and
AmpC beta-lactamases
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2620637/).
Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that degrade
beta-lactam antibiotics and are one of the main mechanisms by which
bacteria are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics.

_Enterobacteriaceae_ producing ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases have
become increasingly common causes of severe infection, which has
prompted greater use of carbapenems. Until recently, beta-lactamases
that degrade carbapenems (carbapenemases) and thereby confer
resistance to carbapenems were limited to infrequent pathogens.
However, carbapenemases have now been acquired by common pathogens,
such as _Escherichia coli_ and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and have been
recognized around the world. There are several types of carbapenemases
that include KPC, VIM, NDM-1, and OXA-type
(http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/20/3/440). The genes encoding
carbapenemases are frequently located on mobile genetic elements,
which facilitates their spread between bacteria of the same or even
different species and which plays a major role in the spread of
antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli.

The emergence of carbapenemases has compromised the critical role that
carbapenems have played historically as antibiotics of last resort for
therapy of many infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative
bacilli.

The carbapenemases inactivate other beta-lactam antibiotics, such as
penicillins and cephalosporins, in addition to the carbapenems.
Unfortunately, bacteria producing carbapenemases are also typically
resistant to many other classes of antibiotics, thereby making these
pathogens multidrug-resistant.

Infection control interventions aimed at preventing transmission of
carbapenemase-producing isolates include recognition of
carbapenem-resistant _Enterobacteriaceae_ when cultured from clinical
specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these
isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting
point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance testing among
high-risk patients (CDC: Guidance for control of infections with
carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_
in acute care facilities. MMWR 2009; 58: 256-60. Available at:
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm). - Mod.ML]
