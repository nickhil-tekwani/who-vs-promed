Chronic Wasting Disease found in a farmed elk from Olmsted County
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Board of Animal Health today announced that a farmed
elk from an Olmsted County herd tested positive for Chronic Wasting
Disease (CWD). The brain stem and lymph nodes from a 7-year-old
female elk were submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, after
the animal was slaughtered. NVSL confirmed the animal had CWD.

The Board of Animal Health quarantined the herd on 23 Jan 2009. This
quarantine means no cervidae (members of the deer and elk family) can
move on or off the farm. Meanwhile, officials continue to investigate
the source of the infection and whether other cervidae may have been
exposed. In 2003, Minnesota implemented mandatory registration and
CWD surveillance programs for farmed cervidae herds. When farmed
cervidae over 16 months of age die or are slaughtered, herd owners
must submit brain samples for CWD testing.

CWD is a fatal brain and nervous system disease found in cervidae in
certain parts of North America. The disease is caused by an
abnormally shaped protein called a prion, which can damage brain and
nerve tissue.

Infected animals show progressive loss of body weight with
accompanying behavioral changes. In later stages of the disease,
infected animals become emaciated (thus "wasting" disease). Other
signs include staggering, consuming large amounts of water, excessive
urination, and drooling.

[This last sentence sounds more like Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease.
The most obvious and consistent clinical sign is weight loss over
time. CWD affected animals continue to eat but amounts of feed
consumed are reduced, leading to gradual loss of body condition.
Excessive drinking and urination are common in the terminal stages.
Behavioral changes also occur in the majority of cases, including
decreased interactions with other animals, listlessness, lowering of
the head, blank facial expression and repetitive walking in set
patterns. In elk, behavioral changes may also include
hyper-excitability and nervousness. Excessive salivation, drooling and
grinding of the teeth also are observed. - Mod.TG]

According to state health officials and the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, there is no evidence that CWD can be
transmitted to humans.
