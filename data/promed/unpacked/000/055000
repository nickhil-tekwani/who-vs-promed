The Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is reporting an outbreak of chickenpox, which infected some 2565 patients during the 1st 19 days of January 2014, according to a National News Bureau of Thailand report today [3 Feb 2014].

The Permanent Secretary for Public Health Dr Narong Sahamethapat stated that the cool weather during January-March of every year was conducive to the spread of varicella-zoster virus, the chickenpox virus. He thus encouraged all to be on guard against the highly communicable disease, as anyone with low immunity could be infected, especially children under the age of one. Thailand reported 48 000 chickenpox cases during 2013, with most cases seen in children aged between 5 and 9.

Chickenpox is a common, usually benign childhood disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the family _Herpesviridae_. This virus causes 2 distinct diseases; varicella (chickenpox) is the primary infection, and later when VZV reactivates, herpes zoster (or shingles).

Chickenpox is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing, by direct contact, and by aerosolization of the virus from skin lesions. You can also get it by contact with the vesicle secretions from shingles. The disease is characterized by fever and a red, itchy skin rash that usually starts on the abdomen, back, or face and then spreads to nearly all parts of the body. The rash begins as small red bumps that appear as pimples or insect bites. They then develop into thin-walled blisters that are filled with clear fluid which collapse on puncture. The blisters then break, crust over, and leave dry brown scabs.

The chickenpox lesions may be present in several stages of maturity and are more abundant on covered rather than exposed skin. Lesions may also be found in the mouth, upper respiratory tract, and on the genitals. Chickenpox is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash forms and continues until all the lesions are crusted over (usually about 5 days). This disease is more serious in adults than in children. Complications of chickenpox are rare but include pneumonia, encephalitis and secondary bacterial infections. Infection with this virus usually gives lifelong immunity, although 2nd attacks have been documented in immuno-compromised people. The viral infection remains latent, and disease may recur years later as shingles. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chickenpox vaccine is the best protection against chickenpox. The vaccine is made from weakened (attenuated) varicella virus that produces an immune response in your body that protects you against chickenpox. The chickenpox vaccine was licensed for use in the United States in 1995.

[The large number of cases of chickenpox is unusual and not explained.

Chickenpox is a very contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads easily from infected people to others who have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters. Before the availability of a vaccine, about 4 million people would get chickenpox each year in the United States. Also, about 10 600 people were hospitalized, and 100 to 150 died each year as a result of chickenpox.

Chickenpox vaccine is very safe and effective at preventing the disease. Most people who get the vaccine will not get chickenpox. If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, it is usually mild, with fewer blisters and mild or no fever. The chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe disease. Varicella virus is a DNA virus, and infection can be treated also with the antiviral drugs (acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir).

Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. Reactivation of latent infection causes herpes zoster (shingles). Shingles, also known as zoster or herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. Anyone who has recovered from chickenpox may develop shingles; even children can get shingles. However, the risk of getting the disease increases as a person gets older. About half of all cases occur among men and women who are 60 years old or older. People who have medical conditions that keep their immune systems from working properly, such as certain cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and people who receive immunosuppressive drugs, such as steroids and drugs given after organ transplantation, are also at greater risk of getting shingles. People who develop shingles typically have only one episode. In rare cases, however, a person can have a 2nd or even a 3rd episode. - Mod.CP
