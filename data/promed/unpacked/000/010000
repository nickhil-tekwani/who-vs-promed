Rift Valley fever in East Africa
--------------------------------
United Republic of Tanzania
---------------------------
From 13 Jan to 3 May 2007, a total of 264 cases including 109 deaths (case
fatality ratio (CFR) 41 per cent) of Rift Valley fever (RVF) were reported
in Tanzania. RFV was reported in 10 out of the 21 regions of Tanzania: 12
cases were reported in Arusha region, 1 in Dar es Salaam, 156 in Dodoma, 4
in Iringa, 6 in Manyara, 50 in Morogoro, 5 in Mwanza, 5 in the Pwani, 24 in
Singida, and 1 in Tanga regions. Only severe cases of RVF were detected
through surveillance and of the 264 cases, 154 (60 per cent) were
laboratory confirmed.
The surveillance of RVF organized through the Integrated Disease
Surveillance and Response (IDSR) program has been in place in Tanzania for
several years. To investigate this outbreak a WHO team from the Department
of Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response and the Regional Office for
Africa has been assisting the WHO Country Office in the assessment of the
outbreak and in refining the health component of the Tanzania Ministry of
Health and Social Welfare (TMOHSW) and the Tanzania Ministry of Livestock
Development (TMOLD) emergency response plan, including the early warning
system, active case detection, case management and social mobilization.
A national investigation team conducted several field visits in the
affected region to help with enhancement of surveillance, in-depth case
investigations, and active surveillance activities. The team also provided
training in patient care for clinical staff and in safe sample collection
and shipment for laboratory staff. The response to the outbreak was jointly
organized by the Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (TMOHSW)
and the Tanzania Ministry of Livestock Development (TMOLD) in collaboration
with the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, WHO, and FAO. The United Nations Emergency
Coordination Group of UNDP, WHO, FAO, UNICEF and WFP have also outlined
response plans in support of the Government strategy.
These programmes include animal and human health interventions as well as
sensitization and awareness campaigns at community level and among health
care professions.
