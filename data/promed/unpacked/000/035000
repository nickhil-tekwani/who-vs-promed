--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have caused multiple waves of infection globally. This phase 2/3 study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the bivalent vaccine candidate mRNA-1273.211 (equal mRNA amounts of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and beta variant spike proteins) as 50-µg (n = 300) and 100-µg (n = 595) 1st booster doses approximately 8.8-9.8 months after the mRNA-1273 primary series. The mRNA-1273.211 booster (50 µg and 100 µg) elicited higher neutralizing antibody responses against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and the beta variant than that after the 2nd mRNA-1273 dose. Antibody responses after the 50-µg mRNA-1273.211 booster dose were also higher than that after a 50-µg mRNA-1273 booster dose for the ancestral SARS-CoV-2, beta, omicron, and delta variants (28 days after the booster dose) and for the ancestral SARS-CoV-2, beta, and omicron (180 days after the booster dose), and the immunogenicity objectives were met. The safety and reactogenicity profile of the mRNA-1273.211 booster (50-µg) was comparable to mRNA-1273 (50-µg). These results indicate that bivalent booster vaccines can induce potent and durable antibody responses providing a new tool in response to emerging variants.

Discussion
----------
Overall, the bivalent mRNA-1273.211 booster vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety profile, comparable to the standard-of-care booster mRNA-1273 when administered at the 50-μg dose level. In addition, the mRNA-1273.211 vaccine (50 μg) elicited robust and persistent antibody responses against multiple variants of concern, even when some of these variants were not contained in the vaccine. Cross-neutralization of multiple variants and the potency and durability of the antibody response appear to be advantages of bivalent booster vaccines that contain both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and variant spike sequences, and such vaccines may represent an important strategy as we respond to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

[2] USA: cases
Date: Tue 19 Apr 2022
Source: New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/briefing/covid-cases-up-hospitalizations-omicron.html?searchResultPosition=1


Coronavirus cases have risen in major cities. Hospitalizations have not.

In several places where the number of cases has risen in recent weeks, hospitalizations have stayed flat. (In past COVID waves, by contrast, hospitalizations began rising about a week after cases did.)

How could this be? As is often the case with COVID, the answer is not completely clear. But at least some of it reflects the changing nature of the pandemic, many experts believe. The share of cases that turn into severe illnesses seems to be declining, for 3 main reasons:

- Vaccines and booster shots are effective and universally available to Americans who are at least 12. (COVID continues to be overwhelmingly mild among children).
- Treatments -- like Evusheld for the immunocompromised and Paxlovid for vulnerable people who get infected -- are increasingly available.
- Tens of millions of Americans have already been infected with the virus, providing them with at least some immunity.

To be clear, these trends will not eliminate severe COVID. The number of nationwide hospitalizations will probably rise in coming weeks, especially if cases continue to rise. The official number of cases has already increased 43% in the past 2 weeks, and hospitalizations have risen in a small number of states, like Vermont. Nationally, though, hospitalizations have not yet risen, probably for the same 3 reasons listed above.

Even if hospitalizations do rise in coming weeks, a declining share of coronavirus cases that result in serious illness would be very good news, Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at Columbia University, has pointed out.

"I haven't seen a COVID patient in the ER in weeks and go to work now expecting not to," Spencer told me, "despite a swirl of COVID in the community."

Among other things, a decoupling of cases and severe illness would mean that hospitals were less likely to become overwhelmed during future COVID surges. When hospitals avoid getting swamped, they can provide care to every patient who needs it, which becomes another factor that reduces bad health outcomes.

Going forward, this newsletter will begin to pay less attention to statistics on coronavirus cases and more attention to statistics on hospitalizations. "Looking at the data in the same way we've been accustomed over the past 2 years can be misleading," Spencer said.

We won't completely ignore the case numbers, because they still have some relevance. But the cases data has become both less reliable and less meaningful than earlier in the pandemic.

It is less reliable because of the recent closure of many testing clinics and the shift toward at-home testing. The data on COVID hospitalizations and deaths doesn't suffer from these problems and appears to be as accurate as it was earlier in the pandemic.

The cases data is less meaningful than it used to be because vaccines are universally available to US adults, and vaccines tend to turn COVID into an illness of similar severity to a flu, including for the elderly and the immunocompromised. More recent treatments like Paxlovid play a role, too.

One telling comparison: In the county that includes Seattle (which keeps detailed data), the daily COVID death rate for boosted elderly people has recently hovered around 2 per million. That's higher than the national flu death rate during a mild influenza season and somewhat lower than the rate during a heavy influenza season.

For boosted people (and children), the odds of severe COVID really do resemble the odds of severe influenza. And you don't tend to see news stories every time a member of Congress or a Broadway star contracts the flu.

I understand why the country is still treating COVID as a much bigger deal. For one thing, the large number of unvaccinated people means that COVID is still killing about 500 Americans a day. For another, COVID has dominated life for more than 2 years, and we can't simply flip a switch and return to our 2019 habits.

But nor would it be rational to treat the 2022 version of COVID as if it were identical to the 2020 version. It isn't. Vaccines, treatments, and even natural immunity have transformed the impact of the virus, especially for Americans who have chosen to protect themselves.

Another article in the New York Times addressing case counts, but global rather than US alone, also should be read (India Is Stalling the WHO's Efforts to Make Global COVID Death Toll Public, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/health/global-covid-deaths-who-india.html).

"The agency has calculated that 15 million people have died as a result of the pandemic, far more than earlier estimates, but has yet to release those numbers.

"An ambitious effort by the World Health Organization to calculate the global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic has found that vastly more people died than previously believed: a total of about 15 million by the end of 2021, more than double the official total of 6 million reported by countries individually.

"But the release of the staggering estimate -- the result of more than a year of research and analysis by experts around the world and the most comprehensive look at the lethality of the pandemic to date -- has been delayed for months because of objections from India, which disputes the calculation of how many of its citizens died and has tried to keep it from becoming public.

"More than 1/3 of the additional 9 million deaths are estimated to have occurred in India, where the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stood by its own count of about 520 000. The WHO will show the country's toll is at least 4 million, according to people familiar with the numbers who were not authorized to disclose them, which would give India the highest tally in the world, they said. The Times was unable to learn the estimates for other countries." - Mod.LK]

[3] COVID mysteries

https://www.statnews.com/2022/04/19/six-covid-mysteries-including-how-it-will-evolve/?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&utm_campaign=2678e7e077-MR_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-2678e7e077-150856821


For a formidable adversary with plenty of secrets up its sleeve, the coronavirus presented one bright bull's-eye for the world's response. Scientists, in record time, developed vaccines based on the virus's spike protein that in turn have saved millions of lives.

Yet more than 2 years after SARS-CoV-2 appeared, as documented deaths in the US near 1 million and estimated global deaths reach as high as 18 million, there are still many mysteries about the virus and the pandemic it caused. They range from the technical -- what role do autoantibodies play in long COVID? Can a pan-coronavirus vaccine actually be developed? -- to the philosophical, such as how can we rebuild trust in our institutions and each other? Debate still festers, too, over the virus's origins, despite recent studies adding evidence that it spilled over from wildlife.

Some of these questions defy answers entirely or can only be resolved over time. Here, STAT examines 6 mysteries that scientists are beginning to unravel. The eventual answers will determine our relationship with COVID and how we'll fight a future pandemic.

1. How will the virus evolve next?
2. What will future waves look like?
3. If you've never had COVID, how worried should you be right now?
4. How, exactly, does the virus transmit from person to person?
5. Will we get a new, better generation of vaccines, therapeutics, and tests?
6. How long before we understand long COVID?

[In the past 24 hours, 17 countries including Germany (130 759), the UK (116 306), South Korea (111 280), Spain (74 679), Japan (65 913), Australia (47 777), USA (39 531), Switzerland (28 077), Italy (27 326), France (25 465), Thailand (20 455), New Zealand (19 598), Brazil (18 182), Canada (17 093), Viet Nam (13 500), the Netherlands (10 913), and Greece (10 211) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3549 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 17 Apr 2022 to late 18 Apr 2022). A total of 39 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 23 of the 39 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, and none are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 24.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 28.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 13.4% increase in daily reported cases and 12.7% decrease in reported deaths. An overall global trend of decreasing cases (US has shown an increasing case trend over the last few days) and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.87 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 506.08 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.22 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
