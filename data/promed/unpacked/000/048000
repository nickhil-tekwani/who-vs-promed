Spatial, temporal, and species variation in prevalence of influenza A
viruses in wild migratory birds
------------------------------
Although extensive data exist on avian influenza in wild birds in North
America, limited information is available from elsewhere, including Europe.
Here, molecular diagnostic tools were employed for high-throughput
surveillance of migratory birds, as an alternative to classical
labor-intensive methods of virus isolation in eggs. This study included 36
809 samples from 323 bird species belonging to 18 orders, of which only 25
species of 3 orders were positive for influenza A virus. Information on
species, locations, and timing is provided for all samples tested. Seven
previously unknown host species for avian influenza virus were identified:
barnacle goose, bean goose, brent goose, pink-footed goose, bewick's swan,
common gull, and guillemot. Dabbling ducks were more frequently infected
than other ducks and Anseriformes; this distinction was probably related to
bird behavior rather than population sizes. Waders did not appear to play a
role in the epidemiology of avian influenza in Europe, in contrast to the
Americas. The high virus prevalence in ducks in Europe in spring, as
compared with North America, could explain the differences in virus-host
ecology between these continents. Most influenza A virus subtypes were
detected in ducks, but H13 and H16 subtypes were detected primarily in
gulls. Viruses of subtype H6 were more promiscuous in host range than other
subtypes. Temporal and spatial variation in influenza virus prevalence in
wild birds was observed, with influenza A virus prevalence varying by
sampling location; this is probably related to migration patterns from
north east to south west and a higher prevalence farther north along the
flyways.
[The authors] discuss the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza A
virus in wild birds in relation to host ecology and compare [their] results
with published studies. These data are useful for designing new
surveillance programs and are particularly relevant due to increased
interest in avian influenza in wild birds.

[We will increasingly see the products of various well-intentioned HPAI
(highly pathogenic avian influenza) wild bird surveillance programmes,
which like this one found everything but HPAI. However, such studies will
fill in many recognised gaps in our knowledge of the ecology of AI viruses
and what can normally be expected to be seen where in relation to what, in
this case in northern Europe. We may thus be aided, next time, in better
judging the true risks from the pathogenic viruses. Considering the
unbelievably high budgeting to combat the perceived risks of HPAI
regionally and globally, we had better harvest what we can of what might be
of future value. Readers should note that few of the species studied in
this paper would be expected to come in contact with backyard poultry, much
less commercial poultry. - Mod.MHJ]
