State public health officials issued a warning [Tue 24 Mar 2015] about the potential dangers of consuming raw milk after 6 Northern California residents fell seriously ill. The 6 residents were recently diagnosed with campylobacteriosis, a bacterial infection that can be caused by consuming contaminated raw milk, according to a news release from the department.

A recent investigation identified multiple bottles of Claravale Farm [in San Benito County] raw milk that tested positive for _Campylobacter_, department officials said. Symptoms of campylobacteriosis include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. Most people recover completely within about a week. In some people with compromised immune systems, it can cause a serious, life-threatening infection [and may be associated with a paralytic illness called Guillain-Barre syndrome. - Mod.LL]

Products with code dates of [28 Mar 2015] or earlier should be thrown away, public health officials said.

Raw milk is milk from cows, sheep, goats, or other animals that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful germs. Contaminated raw milk doesn't smell or look any different from uncontaminated raw milk.

Public health said they do not recommend drinking raw milk or raw milk products. The sale of raw milk from some dairies is legal statewide, but products must carry warning labels about possible disease-causing organisms.

[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article.htm), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 per cent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 per cent) involved cheese (42 per cent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 per cent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, campylobacter was responsible for 54 per cent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 per cent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 per cent), _Brucella_ spp (4 per cent), listeria (4 per cent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 per cent).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 per cent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.

It is a violation of federal law enforced by the FDA to sell raw milk packaged for consumer use across state lines (interstate commerce). But each state regulates the sale of raw milk within the state (intrastate), and some states, such as Pennsylvania, allow it to be sold. This means that in some states, dairy operations may sell it to local retail food stores or to consumers directly from the farm or at agricultural fairs or other community events, depending on the state law.

In states that prohibit intrastate sales of raw milk, some people have tried to circumvent the law by "cow sharing" or "cow leasing." They pay a fee to a farmer to lease or purchase part of a cow in exchange for raw milk, claiming that they are not actually buying the milk since they are part owners of the cow. Wisconsin banned cow-leasing programs after 75 people became infected with _Campylobacter jejuni_ bacteria in 2001 from drinking unpasteurized milk obtained through such a program.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk. - Mod.LL

On 22 Mar 2015, the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) announced a statewide recall and quarantine order of raw milk products at Claravale Farm. The news release can be accessed at http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/egov/Press_Releases/Press_Release.asp?PRnum=15-015.

Another statewide recall and quarantine order at this farm were issued on 23 Mar 2012, following the confirmed detection of _Campylobacter_ bacteria in raw cream (see Campylobacteriosis - USA (12): (CA) unpasteurized cream 20120324.1079609 and http://www.foodsafetynews.com/tag/claravale-farm/#.VRV1wFznesT).
