The Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) was notified that a 10-year-old quarter horse in the town of Four Lakes, Spokane County, is the 1st horse in the state to contract West Nile virus (WNV) this year [2017]. The horse, which was unvaccinated for the disease, is reported to have coordination problems with its rear legs and muscle tremors, but is improving.

Washington State University's Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Pullman reported the positive test results to WSDA's State Veterinarian's Office this week [week of Sun 6 Aug 2017].

WSDA confirmed 27 equine West Nile virus cases last year [2016]. Seven of those horses died or were euthanized. In all, 10 counties reported West Nile virus cases involving horses last year [2016], including Benton, Franklin, Grant, Kittitas, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Stevens and Yakima counties. Spokane County lead with 8 cases.

"Horses can still benefit from 1st-time vaccinations or an annual booster vaccination," State Veterinarian Dr Brian Joseph said. "It's never too late to vaccinate your horse, but it's more effective to do it earlier than now."

West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes that have fed on infected birds. The disease sickens people, horses, birds and other animals, but it does not spread directly from horses to people or other animals [but is spread by the mosquito. - Mod.TG].

The disease is fatal to horses in about one third of the cases in which clinical signs are apparent, although most horses do not become ill and show no signs. Horses that do become ill can appear to be displaying loss of coordination, loss of appetite, confusion, fever, stiffness, and muscle weakness, particularly in their hindquarters.

Spring is the best time to vaccinate horses against West Nile virus or obtain an annual booster shot. Besides vaccination, horse owners can reduce mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping horses inside during insects' feeding times, typically early in the morning and evening. Consider using equine-approved mosquito repellants, place fans inside barns or stalls to maintain air movement, and avoid using incandescent bulbs inside stables at night.

Veterinarians who learn of potential West Nile virus cases in horses or other animals should contact the State Veterinarian's Office at (360) 902-1878.

California animal health officials have confirmed 2 additional cases of West Nile virus (WNV) in horses in that state.

"On [Thu 10 Aug 2017], an unvaccinated 8-month-old Quarter Horse filly in Kern County and an unvaccinated 3-year-old Quarter Horse filly in Contra Costa County displaying neurologic signs were confirmed positive for WNV," read a statement from the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). "The Kern County filly was euthanized due to the severity of the disease and the Contra Costa County filly is recovering.

"For 2017, a total of 5 horses have been confirmed positive for WNV," the CDFA statement continued. "The positive horses were located in Contra Costa, Fresno, Kern (2), and Riverside counties. Four horses were unvaccinated and one horse had unknown vaccination status. A total of 4 horses died or were euthanized and one horse is recovering."

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

[The watch word of the season for horses is vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. West Nile virus is usually combined with Eastern and Western equine encephalitis, and often with tetanus as well. This is a single injection to protect your horse against 3 or 4 diseases. It is recommended the injection be repeated in 3-4 weeks for optimum immunity. - Mod.TG
