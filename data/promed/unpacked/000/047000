Spain: Fatal Adult Case of Measles Virus Pneumonitis
---------------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles in Almeria (southeastern Spain) has resulted in the
death of a 33-year-old woman as a consequence of complications of viral
pneumonitis. According to Health Delegate Manuel Lucas, 70 persons have
contracted the virus since the second week in February 2003. Lucas has
issued a call for all people between the ages of 20 and 35 years who have
not had the disease or been vaccinated to go to health centers to receive
the vaccine.
Lucas explained that this is a segment of the population that, in general,
was not vaccinated because in Spain, at that time, measles was no longer
included in the vaccination protocols [presumably this refers to a
population that was not vaccinated routinely in early childhood as the
vaccine was either not widely used and or was not included in routine
vaccination activities 25-30 years ago in Spain]. Approximately 1000
persons have already requested vaccination.

[It is difficult to assess the significance of this reported death due to
measles and the outbreak mentioned above in the absence of information on
age distribution of the cases, vaccination coverages, etc. The decision to
recommend vaccination of the 20 to 35 year old population suggests that
this outbreak may have an older age distribution. Provision of more
detailed information would be appreciated. - Mods.MPP/CP]
