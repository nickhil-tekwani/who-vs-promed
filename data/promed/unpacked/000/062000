One more suspected [hantavirus] death in Zonguldak
--------------------------------------------------
The authorities are speculating that the death of a 29 year old man in
Zonguldak is attributable to [a hantavirus infection]. Hantaviruses are
carried by rodents and cause epidemic hemorrhagic fever and severe
respiratory infections in humans, which can be fatal [the syndrome known as
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). - Mod.CP].

If a hantavirus is confirmed as the culprit, it will raise the number of
deaths from this virus infection to 2 in Bartin and Zonguldak. The victim
was among 16 people admitted to hospitals complaining of high fever,
chills, and nausea in Bartin and Zonguldak and among 5 of whom doctors
believe had contracted a hantavirus infection.

Dr Guven Celebi of the infectious diseases department at Zonguldak
Karaelmas University Hospital told the press that it was too early to say
for sure whether or not the man had contracted a hantavirus infection. "He
was one of 5 suspected cases the hospital was monitoring. But preliminary
testing had come back negative. Before he came to the hospital he had
suffered a number of problems and exhibited vascular problems connected
with epilepsy and his brain. Because he fit the bill [differential
diagnosis] for a hantavirus infection as well, we carried out a number of
tests. Some of these will produce results in 15-20 days. When those results
come back, we can say some concrete things," the doctor explained.

Celebi was the 1st doctor to identify a case of hantavirus infection in
Turkey when a man arrived at his hospital's emergency room on 20 Feb 2009
and was admitted with symptoms of fever, chills, and nausea. He died the
same day, and blood tests later confirmed he died of a hantavirus
infection, while his doctors' initial diagnosis of the cause of death was
'multi-organ' failure as a consequence of acute renal insufficiency.

[Confirmation of the diagnosis of hantavirus infection and identification
of the species of hantavirus involved remain unresolved pending the outcome
of the laboratory tests still in progress. Readers are referred to the 2
previous posts in this thread for discussion of the possible identity of
the etiologic agent.
