----------------------------------------------------------------------
Entirely speculative at this time, but one toxic plant worth of
consideration is Crofton weed, which causes severe acute pulmonary
oedema in horses usually after they have been consuming it for 1-3
weeks. Known to occur in the general area of eastern Australia,
particularly on fertile ex-rainforest soil types.

If pulmonary haemorrhage is present, then another possibility could be
paraquat ("Gramoxone") herbicide poisoning due to either horses
grazing pastures that have been recently sprayed with it, used
herbicide concentrate containers being misused for drinking water or
feed troughs, or contamination of other drinking water supplies.

If I were the veterinarian called to this case, I would also have been
taking all possible precautions after the recent Hendra virus
situation in the area.
