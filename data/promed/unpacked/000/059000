According to media reports, the smallpox vaccine may be reintroduced in some
villages in Africa if the outbreak of monkeypox worsens, U.S. health
officials said Thursday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
which is working with the World Health Organization to control the outbreak,
said at least 511 cases of monkeypox, most <16 years old, have been reported
in Congo since February 1996, the largest outbreak ever of the disease.
Similar to smallpox, monkeypox causes a fever, breathing trouble and
pus-filled blisters. The disease is not as contagious or as deadly as
smallpox. Most cases in Congo have been among youngsters under age 16. The
CDC has estimated the death toll at five.
Health officials have said that more people in Congo may be vulnerable to
monkeypox because use of the smallpox vaccine -- which also protects against
monkeypox -- was halted in the central African country, formerly known as
Zaire, in the late 1970s.
On Thursday, Dr. Brian Mahy, Director of the CDC's Division of Viral and
Rickettsial Diseases, said they would continue to monitor the situation and,
if a dramatic escalation in the number of cases were to be observed they
might consider a vaccine campaign in certain areas.

A halt in the use of the smallpox vaccine in Congo in the 1970s may have
left people more vulnerable to monkeypox, a similar but less deadly disease
that has cropped up in recent months, U.S. health officials said Thursday.
The epidemic appears to be slowing in the area where most of the illnesses
were concentrated but 500,000 doses of the vaccine are being kept in storage
so new stocks can be produced if necessary.

[The decision to re-introduce smallpox vaccination in Central Africa is a
tricky issue, due to the high prevalence of HIV infection in some areas. It
is possible that smallpox vaccination would inflict more damage than the
current monkeypox outbreak. I wouldn't like to be involved in this decision.

[On the other hand, one must try to prevent a real disease and not be swayed
by the possibility of another disease. - Mod.CHC.
