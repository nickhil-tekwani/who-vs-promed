There has been an approximately 50 percent increase in the number of cases of whooping cough (pertussis) in Chile between 1 Jan 2012 and 24 Mar 2012, totaling 643 cases, compared to only 338 cases for the same period during 2011.

According to data issued by the Chilean Ministry of Health, 43 percent of the cases correspond to children less than one year old (274 cases), and the incidence rate is 108.7 per 100 000 children less than 1 year old.

The [Santiago Metropolitan] and O' Higgins regions reported the most accentuated increase in the number of cases of whooping cough during the past few weeks. The most affected regions all over Chile are Antofagasta, Coquimbo, Valparaiso, Maule, Los Rios, and Los Lagos.

Between 1 Jan 2012 and 24 Mar 2012, 5 fatal cases in children have been reported, 1 in Antofagasta, 3 in Valparaiso, and 1 in Coquimbo. 4 of the deceased children were less than 2 months old and the other was a 4 month old baby. Whooping cough is a dangerous disease in children less than 6 months old. Nearly 7 newborns per year die because of this infection in Chile.

Last January 2012, the Chilean Ministry of Health launched a vaccination campaign called in Spanish "vacuna en capullo" (literally meaning "cocoon vaccination") which consists in immunizing persons who have direct contact with newborns. Consequently, pregnant mothers, fathers, siblings more than 15 years old and health care personnel taking care of babies during their 1st months of life must be immunized. The objective is to prevent transmission of the infection to babies.

Meanwhile, little children will still be immunized within the context of the Chilean National Vaccination Program.

[Typically, the incubation period of pertussis ranges from 3-12 days. Pertussis (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/967268-clinical) is a 6-week disease divided into catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent stages, each lasting from 1-2 weeks. The 3 stages of disease progression are as follows:

Stage 1: the initial (catarrhal) phase is indistinguishable from common upper respiratory infections with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing, variably accompanied by low-grade fever, tearing, and conjunctival suffusion. Pertussis is most infectious when patients are in the catarrhal phase, but pertussis may remain communicable for 3 or more weeks after the onset of cough.

Stage 2: patients in the 2nd (paroxysmal) phase present with paroxysms of intense coughing lasting up to several minutes. In older infants and toddlers, the paroxysms of coughing occasionally are followed by a loud whoop as inspired air goes through a still partially closed airway. Infants younger than 6 months do not have the characteristic whoop but may have apneic episodes and are at risk for exhaustion. Posttussive vomiting and turning red with coughing are common in affected children.

Stage 3: patients in the 3rd (convalescent) stage have a chronic cough, which may last for weeks.

Pertussis (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/clinical/complications.html) can cause serious and potentially life-threatening complications in infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated.

In infants younger than 12 months of age who get pertussis, more than half must be hospitalized. Hospitalization is most common in infants younger than 6 months of age. Of those infants who are hospitalized with pertussis approximately:
- 50 percent will have apnea
- 20 percent get pneumonia
- 1 percent will have seizures
- 1 percent will die
- 0.3 percent will have encephalopathy (as a result of hypoxia from coughing or possibly from toxin)

Of those infants younger than 12 months of age who die:
- Refractory pulmonary hypertension is a common, severe complication that contributes to death
- Encephalopathy occurs in approximately 20 percent of cases
- Other complications can include anorexia, dehydration, difficulty sleeping, epistaxis, hernias, otitis media, and urinary incontinence. More severe complications can include pneumothorax, rectal prolapse, and subdural hematomas. - Mod.LL]
