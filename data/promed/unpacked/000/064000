Reported cases of dengue fever are once again on the increase in Champassak
Province, reported the daily Pasason on August 28. In August the number of
dengue fever patients at Champassak hospital reached 312, with six
fatalities. The report said that this was the highest rate of contraction
of dengue fever in the last 11 years.
The director of Champassak hospital, said that the number of reported cases
has been on the rise since May, with this past month being the worst yet.
Because the number of patients exceeds the number of beds at the hospital,
many of those with the mosquito-borne infection have been placed in
temporary beds on the balcony of the hospital. Most of those infected are
young, ranging in age from one to fifteen. The public health service of
Champassak Province is very concerned about this situation and has
distributed medicine and medical instruments to the Champassak hospital.
The estimated value of this medical disbursement was 3.7 million kip.
