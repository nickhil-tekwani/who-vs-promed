Avian Influenza in Kuwait
-------------------------
Altogether a total of 17 outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) were reported to the OIE, 6 on 26 Feb 2007 and 11
just recently on 13 Mar 2007. [For additional cases, see commentary].
Based on the OIE report, about 3238 backyard chickens, turkeys,
geese, pigeons, falcons, guinea fowl, quails, and ducks have either
died of HPAI or have been destroyed as part of Kuwait's control
measures. About 4233 birds were termed susceptible. Outbreak
locations were Al Farwaniyah, Al Ahmadi, Al Jarah, Hawalli, Moubarak
Al Kabeer, and Al Kuwayt governates, which happen to be 5 of the 6
governorates in Kuwait.
No human cases have been reported. The 1st case of HPAI was confirmed in 2005.
Kuwait has also implemented measures to control movement inside the
country, vaccinate, disinfect infected premises, and [implement]
zoning for the whole country. A 3-month ban has also been imposed on
urban poultry slaughtering and sales of live poultry and live poultry
imports, as well as conducting health inspections of all poultry
shops, closure of the zoo, and the ban of poultry in cages at schools
and kindergartens.
Kuwaiti broiler meat production is expected to remain at 35 000 MT,
due to continued tepid demand stemming from AI. About 40-60 percent
of production is sold live with the remainder as frozen or chilled
whole birds, however demand for live chicken has declined, due to the
convenience of the frozen/chilled products and health concerns, which
could impact this trend. Local production does not compete with
imported products as local frozen whole chicken commands a 50-60
percent higher retail price over frozen imported whole chicken, while
local chilled whole chicken retails twice that of imported frozen
whole chicken. Per capita chicken meat consumption is forecast to be
43 kg in 2007.

UN calls for stricter controls in Myanmar after new bird flu outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The U.N. reported a new outbreak of bird flu in Myanmar on Wednesday
[21 Mar 2007] and called for more stringent measures to control the
spread of the deadly H5N1 virus.
About 1600 chickens contracted the virus and died during the weekend
at a farm in Nyaunghnapin, about 40 km (25 miles) north of Yangon,
Myanmar's largest city, said Tang Zang Ping, the Myanmar
representative for the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization.
Authorities slaughtered the farm's remaining 20 700 birds as a
precautionary measure, he said.
"We need to impose stricter control on the movement of poultry,
poultry products, chicken feed, eggs and even the trucks that carry
these materials," Tang told The Associated Press.
The Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department said in a statement
that the virus might have spread in the farm, located in Hmawyby
township, through contaminated trays used to carry eggs or small
birds, the New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
The statement said chickens, ducks and quails within a 1-km
(0.6-mile) radius of the farm were being monitored and that
authorities imposed a ban on the sale and transport of fowl within 6
km (4 miles) of the outbreak.
But authorities conceded that the measures might not be enough to
control the disease.
"Despite preparedness and designating restricted zones and controlled
zones, there can be more bird flu outbreaks in other regions," the
paper quoted the livestock department as saying.
Myanmar has reported 2 H5N1 outbreaks in recent weeks among poultry
at 2 farms on the outskirts of Yangon. Until the recent cases,
Myanmar last reported an H5N1 outbreak among poultry in March 2006.
It has reported no human H5N1 cases.
