A total of 35 sheep have been tested positive for brucellosis on a private
farm in the village Volchikha of Volchikhinskaya region. The farm is
located in the territory of former bigger farm called Voskhod. There are
701 sheep on this farm and specimens have been taken from all of them. One
sheep died before being tested. The regional office of ministry of
emergencies said that there are 9 people who came in contact with these
sheep. All these people have been tested for brucellosis as well, and 3 of
them had positive results.

Currently all sick and suspected animals have been isolated. The entire
herd is banned from entry into grazing areas. The entrances to the infected
farm are supplied with disinfecting barriers. The entire farm has been
disinfected. A ruling of local government has been issued about limitations
imposed on sheep in the territory because of brucellosis. The issue of
utilization of sick animals and contacted herd is now being discussed.

animals. - Mod.NR

It is not clear if the humans cases were ill or just had antibodies against
the disease in their blood. Altai is a federal province of Russia (a krai)
