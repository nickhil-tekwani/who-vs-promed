Deaths following yellow fever vaccination: WHO issues reassurance about the
continuing need for vaccination for travel to affected areas
-----------------------
The Lancet of 14 July [2001 collated reports of 7 deaths [actually 6,
with one severe illness -- see below. - Mod.JW following yellow fever
vaccination in Brazil, the USA, and Australia in the period 1996-2001
(1,2,3). The clinical pictures were not consistent and different vaccine
strains had been used on each continent.
The Brazilian cases (ages 5 and 22) were confirmed as vaccine-derived,
but represent 2 deaths in over 85 million vaccinations over a 10-year
period. The investigators were surprised by the clinical features of the
vaccine-related diseases, which included significant organ damage
normally only associated with wild-type yellow fever. Since neither the
vaccine nor its stabiliser had changed, it is possible that the 2 deaths
were due to unidentified host factors.
The 4 US cases were all more than 62 years of age and had co-
morbidity. Although the clinical features and their timing suggest
yellow fever vaccine as the cause of the 3 deaths and one severe illness,
only one of these cases had antigenic evidence of vaccine-derived
virus. Unlike the Brazilian cases, the US cases showed significant
central nervous system involvement and a lesser degree of organ
damage.
The one Australian case was aged 56 years and died of multi-system
disease. His death can be attributed by virus isolation to vaccine-
derived yellow fever. The same day, however, 20 other people were
immunised with yellow fever vaccine from the same batch and
remained well.
It is a feature of all 7 cases that death or severe illness occurred in a
small number of people among a much larger population who received
the same batch of vaccine. No obvious risk factors, apart from age in
the American cases, could be identified, and an accompanying Lancet
commentary concludes that "the use of 17D vaccination remains highly
advisable for people living in or travelling to endemic and epidemic
zones, but that these reports raise questions about the mechanisms of
attenuation of yellow fever virus that should be urgently investigated"
(4). This view is supported by WHO. However, WHO cautions that
"travellers should be carefully assessed regarding their need for the
vaccine and their personal level of risk" (5). [Ref. (5) includes the
statement: "An estimated 150 million doses of vaccine were
administered worldwide over the past 4 years, of which 54 million in
Brazil, where only 2 cases of serious adverse events were reported."
The current news comes at a time when there is a Europe-wide
shortage of single-dose yellow fever vaccine, partly caused by
production problems. The multi-dose vials that are used by many
yellow fever clinics in the United Kingdom are not licensed for use.
Although there is nothing illegal about the use of an unlicensed
vaccine, the practitioner rather than the manufacturer is responsible for
any adverse effects. This may make some practitioners wary about
giving the vaccine at all. It should be remembered, however, that in
Africa and South America, yellow fever is a re-emerging disease which
kills an estimated 30 000 people every year [see ref. (5) -- but this
seems rather high to me. Ref.(6) records a total of more than 4000
deaths in nearly 20 000 cases in urban outbreaks in Nigeria between
1988-1991, but no significant urban outbreaks have occurred since
then. - Mod.JW.
Yellow fever is caused by a flavivirus and produces an acute disease
with a mortality rate of up to 50-60 percent in non-immunes. An
anthropozoonosis, it is transmitted to man by mosquitoes within the
endemic zones of Africa and South America. The main reservoirs of
infection are mosquitoes and vertebrates (usually monkeys) in forest
areas (forest or sylvan yellow fever), except for when there is
transmission in towns from person to person by mosquitoes (urban
yellow fever) when humans become part of the reservoir (6).
A live attenuated vaccine based on a 17D version of the virus was
developed [by Nobel prize winner Max Theiler of The Rockefeller
Foundation in 1937, and all the currently produced vaccines are based
on this. The strains of vaccine used around the world are essentially
similar, but contain at least 2 different substrains, 17DD and 17D-204.
The vaccine is highly protective, and until recently has been regarded
as extremely safe [It should still be regarded as such; as few as 6
deaths, while regrettable, in 150 million doses is a safety record
unmatched by any other highly effective live attenuated vaccine except,
perhaps, the Sabin vaccine for polio. - Mod.JW.
