The detection of a new virus in the Chilean salmon industry set off
alarms at the Chilean Fishing Service (SERNAPESCA). Even though active
surveillance had been conducted since beginning of 2011, SERNAPESCA
intensified control actions after HSMI [heart and skeletal muscle
inflammation] virus was found in freshwater fish and sea hatcheries.
This virus [HSMI] has already been found in Norway.

Although the director of SERNAPESCA, Juan Luis Ansoleaga, clarified
that "this disease does not cause major economic losses, considering
that mortality rates range from 0-3 percent," in the webpage of
SERNAPESCA, it is stated that "[in Norway] outbreaks caused by HSMI
virus showed mortality rates close to 15 percent."

In any case, there is uncertainty about the disease. According to
Ansoleaga: "This one is considered an emerging infectious disease in
Norway, a country where control actions are not being implemented even
though the virus is widely distributed but in sea and fresh water
hatcheries." However, he adds that "there are aspects of [HSMI virus]
epidemiology that have not been clarified yet; therefore, there is
still uncertainty regarding the disease and the agent".

SERNAPESCA will extend the surveillance to freshwater fish in order to
assess the distribution of the virus in the country. "We have expanded
our surveillance efforts with the aim of obtaining more information
regarding the situation of the agent, and eventually the disease, in
the national salmon industry, which allow the health agencies to
evaluate the necessity of establishing specific measures," Ansoleaga
said.

Diagnostic tests are being run at the Pathology Institute of
Universidad Austral de Chile. A training program for SERNAPESCA
inspectors was carried out in August and September [2011].

By mid-2007, the salmon industry suffered the effects of infectious
salmon anemia virus. The impact of that disease lasted until the end
of 2009 and meant an important regression in the explosive development
the industry had been having. Because of this situation, a change in
regulations was implemented, with initiatives that aimed at exerting a
stronger health control in the industry. Salmon companies had to
re-negotiate their debts with the banks to assure the continuity of
their activities.

[The 1st cases of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) were registered in 1999 in the
Hitra/Froya area of Norway. Since then, there have been an increasing
number of outbreaks along the Norwegian coast. There is no mention of
any pathological finding in this report, just the diagnosis of the
virus. Usually, no external lesions are recognized. The most
consistent histopathological findings are severe and extensive
inflammation in heart and skeletal muscle. So far, the disease has
only been diagnosed in _S. salar_. It is unclear what species is being
referred to by "freshwater fish." - Mod.PMB]
