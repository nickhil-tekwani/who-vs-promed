The district of Antananarivo Atsimondrano has been struck by African
swine fever. While no official figure has yet been given by the
Regional Animal and Plant Health Service (SRAPS), those in charge
confirm that the district shows an increase in this disease attacking
pigs. "The breeders in the capital and its surroundings are more or
less on top of the situation, but in fact, especially swine in the
Bongolava area are transmitting this disease," said Dr. Ida Noro
Rasoldier, head of the service.
