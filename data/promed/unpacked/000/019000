This is indeed a very worrying development with now 4 large mink farms affected in the Netherlands. It would in my opinion be very surprising if other mink farms in large mink producing countries, such as northern Europe, North America and China, are not also affected. People should be informed that mink are kept at large farms and that transmission of such infections takes place very efficiently from cage to cage. Furthermore, the ProMEDmail post mentions that the infection mainly affects/cause disease in pregnant mink; however, it deserves explaining that minks breed only once a year, young mink kits being born in late April/early May, i.e. right around now. Consequently, commercial mink farms will have a very large number of mink on their farms as each female will now have around 5 mink kits.

Also, considering that the mink was likely initially infected by people, followed, likely, by significant mink to mink spread, one would believe that the risk of transmitting back to people would be high.

Finally, no details are given about the air sampling performed outside the farms; without details, it is not possible to assess the risk of airborne spread at any distance. Nevertheless, having worked with mink on other infections, I find this to be very troubling information and potentially serious risk.

[Thanks to Dr. Alxandersen for his insightful comment. As mentioned by Mod.AS in his comment in ProMED post 20200509.7316646, China leads the world production of mink. Interestingly, mink is one of the many mammal species sold in the wet market of Wuhan, where the pandemic is assumed to have begun.

Regarding the comment on the susceptibility of pregnant minks, the seasonality pointed out by Dr. Alexandersen is highly relevant. As the days get longer in the 1st half of March in the Northern Hemisphere, it is breeding season for the mink. High densities of a species that has proven to be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication are indeed a serious risk scenario. - Mod.PMB
