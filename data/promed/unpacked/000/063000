18 hospitalized after consuming chapattis
-----------------------------------------------
18 members of 3 families, including women and children, from the
nearby Chak Hakim village were hospitalized today [30 Dec 2005],
after they complained of vomiting and stomach pain after consuming
chapattis [a chapatti is a flat pancake-like bread cooked on a
griddle - Mod.LL]. The condition of 3 of the children was stated to
be serious.
A man, whose son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren were among the
victims admitted to the Civil Hospital, told news persons that the
members of the 3 families had purchased flour in the village.
The victims had used this flour in making chapattis for breakfast.
However, after consuming the chapattis, some of them started
vomiting, while others complained of stomach problems. Then, all fell
unconscious. They were rushed to the local hospital, where doctors
treated them in the emergency ward.
While some regained consciousness, others were still unconscious when
this correspondent visited the hospital around noon. The victims had
also consumed daal [lentils, also spelled dhall - Mod.LL] with the
chapattis. Meanwhile, samples of the flour were taken for examination
by the health authorities.
Dr. Yash Mitra, SMO, Civil Hospital, said that while other patients
were stable, the condition of 3 children was serious. "We are
monitoring their condition," said Dr. Mitra.

[The manifestations of nausea and vomiting with loss of
consciousness, which seem to have occurred rapidly after ingestion of
the chapattis, suggest a toxin ingestion. An organophosphate
pesticide contamination of the flour may be behind the episode. -
