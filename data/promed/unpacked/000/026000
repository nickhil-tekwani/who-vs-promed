ProMED-mail has provided excellent updates as this case (Undiagnosed
deaths, cervids - USA (WY)) unfolded, but the latest comment/possible
recommendation from the moderator requires a very strong caveat.
[From the previous posting :"If Game and Fish believes this to be the
cause, then perhaps they could supply supplement feeding to prevent such
heavy consumption of the lichens and thus prevent the deaths of these
animals. Â­ Mod.TG]
Recommendations for [responding to] a dramatic but rare event, such as
_Parmelia_ toxicosis, need to be evaluated carefully in terms of avoiding
unintended and sometimes insidious consequences. Supplemental feeding of
free-ranging wildlife in North America has been associated with the spread
of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis in deer and brucellosis in
elk. The economic costs of these diseases -- as borne by government
agencies, the livestock industry, and the sporting industry -- have been
huge, not to mention the impact on the species affected and other species
living around them.
Preventing and controlling infectious diseases at the landscape level,
involving thousands of species of animals, plants, and invertebrates across
a matrix of land-use patterns, ownership, and legal authorities, requires
thoroughly analyzed recommendations and well-planned implementation efforts.
As Dr. Bill Weber once said, "It's not rocket science, it's much more
challenging than that."

The information and comments on the nature of this toxicity are interesting
but supplemental feeding, except perhaps for a very, very short time to get
them past the immediate crisis, is a very bad idea. The local depletion of
preferred graze and browse species will not be alleviated, only
exacerbated, making the situation potentially worse and more likely to
reoccur in subsequent years. This is the epitome of exceeding carrying
capacity. Culling would make more sense unless alternative underutilized
range can be made available. Then keeping the elk in those areas and out
of the toxic lichen areas will be the problem.
Concentrating elk with supplemental feeds (on Winter feed grounds) is at
the core of the endemic brucellosis problem in Wyoming. Similarly
concentrating deer at Winter feed stations in Michigan is at the center of
the TB problem there. Such practices are likely to exacerbate transmission
of CWD.
Providing more open range for wildlife grazing and culling to keep
populations below carrying capacity, yes. Supplemental feeding, no. An
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

[Feeding of wildlife can present a number of problems, including the spread
of the disease. However, having spoken with several of the veterinarians
involved in the situation in Wyoming, this moderator considered it a
temporary solution to a tragic problem. The elk move on in a short period
of time, and their feeding grounds have suffered greatly because of the
drought. On a very limited short-term basis to prevent further deaths,
feeding was a workable solution.
This moderator was not proposing long-term feeding, or regular feeding, but
rather temporary feeding to solve an unusual problem. - Mod.TG]
