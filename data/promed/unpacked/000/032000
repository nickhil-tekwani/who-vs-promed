The Public Health Department from the Aragon Government has reported 2 new
legionellosis cases in Zaragoza. The number of people affected, in June
2004, therefore now stands at 28 patients. 16 of them are related to the
outbreak reported in the Lozano-Blesa University Clinic Hospital. The
authorities report that, out of the 16 patients associated with the
outbreak at this hospital, one died last Tue 22 Jun 2004, 14 have been
admitted to hospital in different facilities, and one has been discharged.
The 2 new cases are patients who were inpatients at the Lozano-Blesa
Hospital before the outbreak was initially reported. The first case is a 56
year old man who was admitted on 9 Jun 2004 because of an immunosuppressive
condition. He is currently at the medicine ward, and his clinical outlook
is good. The other case, a 62 year old woman, admitted on 13 Jun 2004 due
to circumstances similar to that of the other patient, but who,
subsequently, recovered well, has already been discharged.
The active surveillance for possible legionellosis cases, begun on 15 Jun
2004 when the associated bacterium was detected in 2 refrigeration towers
at the Lozano-Blesa Hospital, led to the confirmation of these 2 new cases
in patients who were admitted to this hospital before the outbreak was
declared. Public Health technicians from the Aragon Government had also
reported the confirmation of 3 other cases related to the outbreak. These
cases are currently under study and have been added to the 11 previously
confirmed cases. These cases are elderly people who were admitted with
legionellosis symptoms and who live near the hospital, or, frequent its
surroundings.
In 2003, 43 legionellosis cases were diagnosed in Aragon (27 in Zaragoza,
15 in Huesca, and one in Teruel). There have been 13 fatalities from this
disease since 1999 in the autonomous community (11 in Zaragoza and 2 in
Huesca).
