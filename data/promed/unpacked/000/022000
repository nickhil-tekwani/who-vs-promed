[Previous to the 6 outbreaks of BTV-16 in Greek sheep on Lesvos
described in the above follow-up report, clinical cases of BTV-16
have been reported by Greece, since the beginning of November 2010,
from several North and South Aegean islands as follows: Lesvos (12
outbreaks), Samos (1), Kos (1) and Rodos (2). Some of those islands
(e.g. Lesvos, Samos and Kos) are adjacent to the Turkish coast, where
similar cases are assumed to have taken place. In fact, Turkey
reported an outbreak of BTV-16 in sheep which had taken place in May
2010 in Karaoz, Aksu, Antalya (see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9834>).

Since BT is transmitted by culicoides, midges which are known to be
bourne by wind to significant distances, it is rather likely that the
virus may have been circulating during recent months also within
other territories in the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East
(e.g. Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan), and that clinical cases in
susceptible animals may have been seen. Information, including data
-- if available -- on the BT serotypes involved, is requested. - Mod.AS]
