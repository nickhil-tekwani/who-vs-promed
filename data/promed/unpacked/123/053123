Fraser Health is urging patients of an illegal dentist to get tested for infectious viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B and C after being exposed to unsterilized equipment. Tung Sheng Wu, also known as David Wu, 62, operated an underground dental practice out of a home on the 4300-block of Burnaby's Southwood Street for the past 10 years without a licence or any known training, according to the health authority. He also used equipment that was not cleaned or sterilized to meet Health Canada infection-control standards. Investigators believe he may have been practising dentistry illegally as far back as the 1990s.

At a news conference Wednesday [7 Aug 2013], Jerome Marburg, CEO of the College of Dental Surgeons of BC, said the college doesn't know if Wu ever trained as a dentist.

Marburg said the college shut down Wu's practice and seized dental equipment from the bedroom where he operated his practice -- which offered everything from fillings and extractions to orthodontics -- after an investigation that began in April [2013].

The college was alerted to Wu after a woman who said she was a patient complained about the treatment she received earlier this year [2013]. The college realized Wu is not a registered dentist, and hired a private investigator to carry out surveillance of his home. Through the investigation, the college was able to seek a court order to gather evidence. Along with the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police], college investigators entered the home on 29 May 2013, finding dental equipment and 1500 client files, which were written in Cantonese. Fraser Health is working to translate the documents and will be sending letters to the addresses on file to inform patients of their potential exposure and of the need to get tested.

Dr Michelle Murti, medical health officer for Fraser Health, said it's "very difficult for us to estimate exactly what the risk is, but we are recommending that each and every person who has been a client ... get tested immediately." The files indicate that at least one-third of Wu's clients were children.

Ninu Kang, acting executive director of the MOSAIC multicultural and immigrant service organization, said some of Wu's 1500 patients may have been new immigrants unable to pay for professional dental care and unaware of Canada's accreditation system. "(Affordable) dental care ... is an issue for new immigrants and their families and their children," Kang said. "Newcomers are also underemployed. During their settlement many new immigrants live below the poverty line and I think there is the potential for new immigrants to be exploited as they're learning about the system here in Canada." Marburg said the client files were more like financial transaction records than the files dentists are required to keep.

This is not the 1st time Wu has been investigated for working as a dentist without a licence. In 2003, the college obtained a court injunction ordering Wu to stop practising dentistry out of a home on Ravine Drive in Port Moody. The investigation was prompted after a lawyer reported to the college on behalf of an anonymous individual. After that investigation, Wu promised to leave the country within a few months, said Marburg.

Marburg said Wu's whereabouts are unknown, but investigators don't believe he has left Canada. Anyone who has ever received treatment from Wu is asked to contact a public health nurse at 1-855-895-7425. Testing is free for patients who don't have a BC Care Card.

[There is no confirmation of transmission of blood-borne infection (HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C in particular) by this unregistered dentist in Vancouver, but the possibility exits, particularly as the patients are presumed to be mostly immigrants, or otherwise deprived groups of the population, where there may be a greater incidence of blood-borne infections. Concerned patients should seek assistance without delay, as testing will be carried out free of charge.

According to a similar report by CTV News (http://bc.ctvnews.ca/illegal-dentist-exposed-1-500-patients-urged-to-get-hiv-tests-1.1401968): "A different, licensed dentist named Dr David Wu worked out of a legitimate office on 4330 Hastings St in Burnaby until retiring in 2010. Health officials confirm he is not the person at the centre of their investigation, and his former patients have no cause to be alarmed." - Mod.CP
