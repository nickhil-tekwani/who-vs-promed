CJD risk set to cost blood service 70 million pounds
The Committee on the Safety of Medicines of the Department of Health has
decided to ban the use of UK derived plasma for the manufacture of blood
products. This should take place in 'a few months time' after the cleaning
of the plasma fractionation equipment at BPL and the Scottish plasma
fractionation centre. The Department of Health admitted that up to 3000
people in 100 hospitals could have been treated with products made from
plasma donated by a person who died of nvCJD.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
98/182 Wednesday 13th May 1998
COMMITTEE ON SAFETY OF MEDICINES COMPLETES: REVIEW OF BLOOD PRODUCTS
The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has completed its review of the
sourcing of blood products, as announced on 26 February 1998.
A number of precautionary measures to protect patients against the
theoretical risk of contracting new variant CJD were announced at that time,
including permission if necessary for the importation of plasma for
manufacture, and a CSM review of the use of UK-sourced plasma, a component
of blood used in the manufacture of a variety of
blood products.
The CSM has reviewed all products individually and has advised that
manufactured blood products should not be sourced from UK plasma for the
present time (advice attached). The Secretary of State for Health has
accepted this advice.
The reasons for moving to non-UK sourced plasma for the time being are that,
although there is currently no evidence that nvCJD can be transmitted by
blood, there is nevertheless a theoretical risk. Currently there is no test
that can be applied to donors to detect the presence of the prion associated
with nvCJD.
It is possible that manufacturing processes used to produce blood products
may destroy the agent thought to cause nvCJD infections. However, no test is
available to confirm this.
As a precautionary measure, therefore, the Government is allowing the NHS's
Bio Products Laboratory and the Scottish National Blood Transfusion
Service's Protein Fractionation Centre to import plasma from outside the UK
until such time as a test is developed to screen for the possibility of
infection, or it is proven that nvCJD cannot be transmitted through blood
products, or that it can be proven that the manufacturing process destroys
any infective agent.
Only when quality inspectors are assured that the stringent safety standards
applied to the new sources of plasma are equivalent to those currently
available in the UK will plasma be imported.
Professor Michael Rawlins, Chairman of the CSM, said: "No new evidence has
been reported indicating that nvCJD can be transmitted via blood products.
However, while the risk remains only hypothetical, it cannot be fully
discounted.
"The NHS Bio Products Laboratory and the SNBTS' Protein Fractionation Centre
have been advised to take steps to source products from plasma derived from
outside the UK, while giving due regard to the supply of vital products to
patients. This will not happen overnight, as suitable collection centres
abroad will have to be identified and inspected by the UK authorities. After
this, the plants manufacturing the products will have to be cleaned before
overseas plasma can be used for manufacture. The CSM recognises that all
this will take some months.
"Some of the less common products such as antibodies used to treat and
prevent rare diseases may take longer to replace, but these are often
life-saving products and doctors should continue to use them in the short
term.
"It is important to note that the use of blood for transfusion, platelets
and fresh frozen plasma is not affected by this advice. These products are
produced from single donations and patients would not be exposed to the same
large number of donors as when the manufactured products are used."
"There is absolutely no question of any risk to blood donors of contracting
nvCJD. With the NHS treating more patients than ever before, blood stocks
need urgent replenishment. It is vital that blood donors support the NHS and
continue their life-saving work."

COMMITTEE ON SAFETY OF MEDICINES
TSE/nvCJD - RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON SAFETY OF MEDICINES AT A
MEETING HELD ON 30 APRIL 1998
1. The group considered that manufactured blood products should not be
sourced from UK plasma. Although it was accepted that some parts of the
manufacturing process for blood products may separate prion proteins, the
present state of the art means that these processes cannot be validated.
Therefore the theoretical risk that nvCJD could be transmitted by blood
products cannot be discounted.
2. BPL and PFC should move to sourcing products from plasma derived from
outside the UK in a time frame to be agreed with the CSM and giving regard
to the effects on the supply of all products, but especially of vital but
less readily obtainable products such as some rare and life saving specific
immunoglobulins. The latter may have to stay on the market for a longer
period of time if replacement products could not easily be found. BPL and
PFC should be asked to give a date by which non UK products could be made
available. In the future when a test is available to identify the agent of
ncCKD in blood donors or when a validated inactivation process is developed
it is hoped that there will be a return to the use of UK donor plasma.
3. In the interim period clinicians who do not wish to use products derived
from UK plasma have a choice of licensed products from other source plasma
to replace all the commonly used products.
4. A date after which no products from UK plasma could be released for use
should be agreed. It is not intended that products should be recalled. The
group recognised that a period of several months would be required to
establish satisfactory sources of plasma, to clean equipment and to produce
products from the new source plasma.
5. The group advised that all CTXs for blood products derived from UK donors
should be suspended.
6. The group also asked that the BPL and PFC should be encouraged to
undertake research into validating processes for the identification and
removal of nvCJD agents in source plasma, so that the use of UK plasma may
be re-established safely in the future.
7. The group suggested that there was a need for clinicians to be educated
in minimising the use of blood products where alternative treatments were
available, for example the use of steroids in children with ITP and the use
of Hepatitis A vaccine for travellers. The CSM was asked to consider how to
take this forward.

[One must wonder what the opportunity costs of this activity will be, and
the scale of future benefits to be gained in relation to the present risks.
