The Virginia Marine Resources Commission was cited as saying yesterday that
one of its workers who patrol the Pocomoke River has developed lesions and
other symptoms linked to _Pfiesteria piscicida_, but Virginia's health
commissioner says that won't change his position that more study is needed
to prove that the fish-killing microbe is a threat to people.
The story says that most of the Pocomoke is in Maryland, which closed the
river as a public health threat after thousands of fish were found dead in
August and pfiesteria were discovered in the water.
The Virginia employee who got sick was, the story says, treated last
Thursday by Ritchie C. Shoemaker, a physician in Pocomoke City, MD., who
has treated other patients with symptoms believed to have been caused by
pfiesteria.
Shoemaker was cited as saying the worker had been in and on the Pocomoke
River in both Maryland and Virginia and had about a dozen lesions, 1 inch
to 1 inches long, that were not healing. He added the lesions were on skin
that had come into contact with the water, saying, "They were typical
pfiesteria lesions ...exactly like the 15 other patients I've seen with them."
