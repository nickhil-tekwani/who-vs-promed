7 people have died and 50 are fighting for their lives in Latvian
hospitals after being poisoned by homemade alcohol, the Baltic
state's police said on Thursday [26 Oct 2006].
Police spokeswoman Sintija Kajina said police had seized around 100
litres of alcohol suspected of being the cause of the poisoning. She
did not say what the alcohol was. "The alcohol will be examined and
only then will we know what the active chemical is," Kajina said.
Hospitals in Preili, 200 km (125 miles) from Riga near the Russian
border, were flooded with more than 50 patients and helicopters have
been brought in to transport the sick to the capital.
Health Ministry spokeswoman Zaiga Barvida said the rural Latgale
region was known for having widespread social problems leading to
excessive drinking. "The region has a bad economic situation, high
unemployment and other social problems and this is why people drink
so much alcohol there. But people do drink a lot of alcohol all over
the country," Barvida said.
Latvia is one of Europe's poorest states and alcoholism remains an
entrenched problem. Almost every year deaths from poisoning following
binge drinking of homemade alcohol are reported in the Baltics. The
latest incident in Latvia echoes a similar one nearby in Russia. A
state of emergency was declared in the Russian region of Pskov, which
borders Latvia, after more than 400 people were taken to hospital and
15 died as a result of drinking tainted alcohol, Russian
television reported on Thursday [26 Oct 2006] [see refs. below].
"There may be a connection between what is going on in our country
and Russia," Kajina said. "We don't know if the alcohol in Latvia has
been produced locally or imported from Russia."
