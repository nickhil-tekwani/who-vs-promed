Doctors from the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are
on Majuro trying to identify the source of an outbreak of typhoid
fever. According to Dr. Alex Pinano, there are currently 24 cases of
this bacterial infection in the capital atoll in the Republic of the
Marshall Islands.
The disease, most often caused by fecal contamination of the water
supply, appears to be coming from the Rita area, Dr. Pinano told
Chamber of Commerce members at the regular monthly meeting. Chamber
member, Ben Chutaro, said that problems with ground water wells were
identified in the Jenrok area, which is on the same side of the
atoll, over 2 years ago. Most households are not connected to the
island's sanitary sewers due to failure to pay for Majuro Water and
Sewer services.
Dr. Pinano said that there are vaccines for typhoid available, but
supplies are not on-island. The country does not include the vaccines
in its regime of shots. Residents should be advised to boil any
ground water obtained from wells to kill this kind of bacteria.
With the current drought in effect, there is the possibility that
some businesses may be tempted to use well water [for] the
preparation of food or what will become food, such as ice for fresh fish.
In April and May 2006, there were 22 confirmed cases [of typhoid
fever]. Local health officials voiced their concern at that time
about the increase [in the number] of typhoid cases.

At least 70 residents of a village in the eastern Turkish province of
Mus have tested positive for typhus [sic], the outbreak being blamed
on polluted drinking water. [Abdominal typhus is another term for the
bacterial disease typhoid, commonly waterborne; the endemic
rickettsial disease typhus is flea-borne. - Mod.LL, JW]
Among the 70 people from the village of Bascatak, in the Malazgirt
district, who have contracted the infection are 4 teachers and 16 students.
Kenan Akpolat, head of the local health authority, said that 400
locals in the village, which has 147 houses, were tested. Akpolat
said that animal waste piled in front of barns has flowed into the
local water supply after heavy rains, causing the outbreak.
