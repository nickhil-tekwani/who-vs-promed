Re: Avian influenza, H7N3, poultry - Canada: (SK)
-------------------------------------------------
[There were 2 questions left unanswered for H7N3 in Saskatchewan:
[1] Where did this outbreak originate from?
[2] Did this outbreak involve an H7N3 virus that was genetically
allied to the strain involved in the 2004 British Columbia outbreak?

Jim Clark was asked if they had answers. - Mod MHJ]

The specific origin of the virus that caused the infection is
undetermined. There were sufficient opportunities for a virus to
enter this operation from a variety of sources due to insufficient
biosecurity measures being in place. The paper awaiting publication
concerning the homology of the H7N3 in Saskatchewan with other H7
subtypes that have been previously isolated will allow speculation
about the most probable source of the virus. We could find no
evidence of another H7 subtype in the domestic poultry population in
Saskatchewan in the surveillance that was conducted following the
discovery. There was no epidemiological linkage to another domestic
flock outside of Saskatchewan as this was a closed flock prior to the
discovery.

As indicated in my submission to ProMED-mail [see Avian influenza,
H7N3, poultry - Canada (06): (SK) 20071205.3924], "Although the virus
was an H7N3 subtype of influenza A, it did not have a close
phylogenetic relationship to the HPNAI [highly pathogenic notifiable
avian influenza] H7N3 subtype found in British Columbia in 2004." It
is my understanding the authors of the paper on the homology of the
virus will indicate there are other H7N3 viruses that have a higher
degree of homology than the H7N3 that was isolated from the HPAI H7N3
outbreak in BC in 2004.
