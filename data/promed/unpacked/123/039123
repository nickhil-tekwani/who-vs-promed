The increasing incidence of animal rabies cases has been really registered
in the south of Western Siberia during last 3 years (mostly in the lowland
steppe and forest-steppe zones at the border of Kazakhstan). The cases are
registered mainly out of towns, among foxes and cows. We have been in
contact with our colleagues from Novosibirsk Regional Veterinary
Laboratory. As we supposed, they are in charge of some diagnostics. Last
year they came here and brought some of their samples for joint
examination. We have not confirmed many of their positive records,
including 4 samples of hare brain, which they regarded as positive.
Meanwhile, they reported last year 166 animal rabies cases. At the same
time, in the neighbouring Omsk and Altay regions only 17 and 49 cases
respectively were registered. Also I would like to note that size of all
fox populations in Novosibirsk region is approximately 8,200 according to
official estimates. I would wonder if 50% of the foxes were rabid.
