In a press conference, the Minister of Public Health, Oscar Balverdi,
announced this morning [31 Mar 2011] that now "There are 5 laboratory
confirmed cases" of the new disease [St. Louis encephalitis virus
infection] transmitted by a mosquito. Moreover, he said, 6 or 7 more
cases are under study. The virus infects people when they are bitten
by _Culex pipiens_, a common mosquito, that transmits a disease
[virus] called St. Louis encephalitis (SLE).

According to the Minister, the 5 patients infected by this virus are
progressing well and all are from the [provincial] capital. Balverdi
explained that the disease [virus] is transmitted by a vector, a
common mosquito, that bites virus-infected birds and later transmits
it to people when it bites them. "This virus is not transmitted from
person to person," indicated the Minister.

The symptoms are the same as those presented when one contracts any
virus disease (persistent fever, headache, malaise). Balverdi
encouraged the community to seek medical attention if these symptoms
present themselves, and also, take the same measures to avoid breeding
[and bites] by any mosquito. That is to say, avoid water collection,
use repellants, etc.

With respect to the man from Santa Lucia who died yesterday [30 Mar
2011], Balverdi said that they still do not know if he was infected by
the virus and the case is under study.

[There were 4 laboratory confirmed human cases of St. Louis
encephalitis virus infection in Buenos Aires exactly a year ago (see
ProMED-mail archive number 20100402.1051). SLE virus had previously
caused outbreaks in the central part of Argentina (mainly in the
provinces of Cordoba and Entre Rios), and the 2010 cases were the 1st
time that it had been detected in Buenos Aires. The above report is
the 1st report for ProMED in San Juan province, although not
surprising given sporadic cases in the the central Argentina provinces
mentioned previously.
