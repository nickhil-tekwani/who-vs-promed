Chronic Wasting Disease Found in Cody Area
------------------------------------------
The latest round of tests from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's (WGFD) chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance program has found the disease in 3 new hunt areas, including a hunt area near Cody [Wyoming].

WGFD staff at the wildlife disease laboratory in Laramie confirmed the presence of CWD in a white-tailed buck from deer hunt area 112 southwest of Cody, in a bull elk from elk hunt area 12 northeast of Saratoga, and in a white-tailed doe in deer hunt area 171 north of Lander. Consistent with previous CWD findings for the season, these hunt areas are all near or overlap areas where CWD has been detected before.

"We continue to work hard to monitor CWD, research its impacts and potential vaccines," said Scott Edberg Deputy Chief of Game and Fish's Wildlife Division. "By the end of the year [2015], we will be releasing a draft updated CWD management plan for public review and comment. We look forward to hearing from the public about this proposed plan."

Hunters who wish to have their deer, elk or moose tested for CWD outside of the department's CWD surveillance program can do so by contacting the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab at (307) 766-9925. Hunters should be aware that it may take a few weeks after their animal is sampled to get their test results.

Area 112 is southwest of Cody, while 12 is northeast of Saratoga and 171 is north of Lander.

CWD has been found in Wyoming in both white-tailed deer and in elk. - Mod.TG]

Dr. Paul McGraw, State Veterinarian, from the [Wisconsin] Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) announced today [18 Nov 2015] that the agency has completed the depopulation of an Eau Claire County deer herd from which a 7-year-old doe tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in June [2015]. Subsequently, 2 additional deer from the farm tested positive in September and October [2015].

The herd of 228 whitetails owned by [RV] was put down beginning early Monday morning [16 Nov 2015], and concluded today [18 Nov 2015] at 1 p.m. A team comprised of veterinarians and animal health technicians from DATCP and U.S. Department of Agriculture-APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] carried out the depopulation of 163 adults and 65 fawns using a combination of injectable euthanasia or sharpshooting, as necessary.

Heads from all the adults were removed and sampled. Samples were sent to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for initial testing. Any preliminary positive tests for CWD are then sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa for confirmation. Confirmatory test results are not expected until the week of [23 Nov 2015].

Preliminary tests from the 1st 2 days of depopulation indicate that 23 additional animals are CWD positive. More tests are pending, so that number may rise. Carcasses testing positive for CWD were transported in a double-lined truck to an anaerobic digester, while carcasses from negative animals will be landfilled.

DATCP cooperated with USDA researchers to collect samples from the animals prior to euthanasia for use in the development of a validated live animal test for CWD. Such a test may have an impact on the way CWD is managed in the future.

[It is important to note that the 23 additional animals are positive ONLY on preliminary test. The number could rise, or it could drop. A decrease is possible but not very likely.

What is most interesting about this sad article is that there is no mention of compensation to the owner of these farmed cervids. These are not cheap animals, nor are the operations that house these animals. So this is a tremendous loss to the owner and yet there is no mention of compensation.

Sadly one way to encourage people to hide disease is to not compensate them for their loss. The CWD regulations have captive cervid owners as a captive audience where reporting is mandatory. Let's hope compensation is likewise.

Also, while CWD has not been shown to affect people, it has become some sort of political stigma and wildlife folks think it must be eradicated. However, in states that have tried it, it has not seemed to make much difference in the disease. Passive or hunter surveillance seems to at least let regulatory agencies know where the disease has appeared. So in this case, they know where it is, and is behind a fence.

I sincerely hope this owner was appropriately compensated. Compensation encourages reporting of disease, any disease. - Mod.TG
