Department of Health Advisory: Possible Measles Exposures in Perry
and Dauphin Counties
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While investigating a cluster of measles cases in Perry County, the
Pennsylvania state Department of Health has identified a suspected
case of measles that could have exposed other persons while
infectious, officials said today [7 Feb 2011].

The possible exposures could have occurred at the following times and
locations:
-- Wed 2 Feb 2011, between 5:50 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. at a book sale
that took place in the basement of the Newport Public Library, 316
North 4th Street, Newport.
-- Fri 4 Feb 2011, between 4 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. at the Lowe's Home
Improvement Store, 4000 Union Deposit Road, Harrisburg.

Most people in the United States are immune to measles, either
because they received the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine in
childhood, or because they were exposed to measles in the pre-vaccine era.

However, the following groups of individuals are at risk of becoming
infected with measles:
-- Infants less than one year of age who are too young to have
received the MMR vaccine;
-- Persons who were vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine, which was
used from 1963 through 1967, and have not been revaccinated;
-- Persons born after 1957 who have only received one dose of MMR vaccine;
-- Those who refused vaccination; and
-- Those from parts of the world where there is low vaccination
coverage or circulating measles.

If you or your children are at risk for measles and become ill with
the symptoms of this disease (see below) one to 2 weeks after
possible exposure, you should tell your health care provider that
you've been exposed to measles so that precautions can be taken to
avoid exposing anyone else.

Health care providers who suspect measles should call [their local]
Department of Health for consultation and to arrange testing.

Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus. Symptoms will begin
one to 2 weeks after exposure and include a runny nose, watery eyes,
cough and a high fever. After 4 days, a raised, red rash starts to
spread on the face, down the body and out to the arms and legs. The
rash usually lasts 4 to 7 days.

An individual with measles can spread the virus to others for 4 days
before and 4 days after the rash begins. It is spread by infected
droplets during sneezing or coughing, touching contaminated objects,
and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Infected
droplets and secretions can remain contagious on surfaces for up to 2 hours.

Complications from measles can include ear infection, diarrhea and
pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain), and even
death. Measles can also cause miscarriages or premature delivery in
pregnant women.

The MMR vaccine is given to toddlers when they are 12 to 15 months of
age, and a 2nd dose is required for all Pennsylvania schoolchildren.
However, individuals who have received only one dose of the vaccine,
instead of the recommended 2 doses, may still be at risk of infection
with this virus. The MMR vaccine can help prevent infection if it is
given within 3 days of exposure. There is no risk in getting an
additional dose of the MMR vaccine for individuals who may have
already received it.

For those in whom MMR cannot be given (pregnant women, infants under
6 months of age, persons with compromised immune systems), or if it
has been more than 3 days since your exposure, a dose of immune
globulin can provide protection up to 6 days after the day of exposure.

If you are not immune to measles and want to receive MMR or immune
globulin, ask your health care provider or contact [your local]
Department of Health.
