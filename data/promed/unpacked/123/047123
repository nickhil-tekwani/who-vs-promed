Re: Erysipelas, parrots - New Zealand (Fiordland) (02): vaccination
----------------------------------------------
Is there a veterinarian involved in the decision process for the use of the
vaccine? The only veterinarian mentioned, according to the article, has
reservations about its use. With so few birds left, it might be wise for an
experienced avian veterinarian, not linked to any vaccine company, to make
decisions that could be detrimental to the remaining birds.
