Important to note that the _Theileria_ in this case are from the _T.
orientalis_/_T. buffelei_ group with the former more prevalent in New
South Wales and now Victoria. _T. buffelei_ is more prevalent in far
northern Australia. Both are usually benign infections in Australia.

There has been a recent trend towards more frequent diagnosis of
clinical disease in particular geographic loci in NSW and now, it
seems, Victoria. That is currently the subject of more focused ongoing
investigation.

The main Australian tick vector is _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ (common
bush tick or bottle tick).
