Foot-and-mouth disease hits another Vietnamese province
-------------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam's central Nghe An province was stricken by foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD], raising the number of affected localities to 2, local
newspaper Youth reported Wednesday [23 Apr 2008].

The disease affected 28 buffaloes and bulls in Nghe An from [15-21
Apr 2008], the paper quoted the Department of Animal Health under the
Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development as saying.

Now, the central provinces of Nghe An and Ha Tinh are being hit by
the disease, said the department.

Under a national agriculture development plan approved by the
government in 2005, Viet Nam will, by 2010, have 35-40 million pigs,
some 6.7 million bulls and cows, and 2.8-3 million buffaloes.

[The newswire above reports new outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease

According to WAHID (OIE's animal disease interface), a previous epizootic,
caused by FMDV Asia 1, had started in June 2007 in the Quang Tri province,
affecting cattle and swine in 15 foci. Reportedly, 100 000 cattle were
subsequently vaccinated there with a trivalent vaccine (O, A, Asia 1).
According to a follow-up report, the outbreak was resolved as of 23 Feb
2008. A summary of the outbreak, including map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&this_country_code=VNM&reportid=5748>.

It will help to obtain official confirmation of the media-derived
information on 2008 FMD outbreaks in other provinces, Nghe An and Ha Tinh,
and - if confirmed - details on the serotype involved and the vaccination
history of the affected animals. - Mod. AS].
