The Belgian Government has said there is no general contamination of the
country's meat in an attempt to reassure the public about a food scare
surrounding meat and poultry products.
After a marathon 12-hour meeting involving senior ministers, a statement
issued by Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said tests on pork and beef had
found "no effective presence of dioxins." However, it said that pork and
beef products from suspect farms would be gradually withdrawn from sale.
The government said it was publishing a list of high-fat products which
would be withdrawn because if dioxins were present, they would probably be
concentrated in fat.
Four more countries have banned Belgian foods as the scare over toxic
animal feed deepens. Austria, Greece, the Netherlands and South Korea have
banned Belgian meat products following Thursday's move by the United States
to impose a temporary ban on chicken and pork from the European Union [EU.
It is now thought that up to 1,000 farms could be affected by the discovery
in Belgium of animal feed contaminated with dioxin.

Several hundred farms in the Netherlands, France and Germany are also now
under surveillance, as national governments and food industries across
Europe struggle to trace tainted products.
The EU is extending measures to protect consumers from possible poisoning
from contaminated pork, beef, chicken and daily products. It has ordered
the destruction of millions of pounds of chicken and egg products exported
from Belgium since 15 January. It said it would demand the removal from
sale and destruction of pork and cattle products from farms that used feed
tainted with the chemical.
But the European Commission described as "disproportionate" the US decision
to block all poultry and pork products from the whole of the EU.

Belgium, facing growing alarm at home and spreading trade curbs abroad over
a food contamination scare, announced more measures on Saturday to reassure
consumers that it had the crisis under control.
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's government said pork and beef products
that could have been tainted with cancer-causing dioxin found in animal
feed would be taken out of circulation, but for now there were no measures
for milk and dairy products.
After a nine-hour cabinet meeting that began on Friday afternoon, Dehaene
told a news conference early on Saturday: "There is no general
contamination."
The Belgian meat trade faced near-collapse as the number of countries
steering away from Belgian imports continued to rise. Countries as far
afield as the United States and the United Arab Emirates closed their
borders to Belgian meat. Saudi Arabia on Saturday banned imports of chicken
meat and eggs. Switzerland stopped imports of milk, milk products and cheese.
The European Union's (EU) executive body set a special meeting of
veterinary experts for Monday "to examine the matter further."
Belgian shoppers crossed into France, Germany and England in search of
untainted produce for their weekend dinners as selected Belgian towns
opened dump sites to residents so that they could drop off suspect goods
for destruction.
The Belgian army made a barracks complex near the coast available for
storing unwanted produce.
Prime Minister Dehaene said any dioxins in pork and beef would be
concentrated in fat. While no poison had been found, Belgian products with
high-fat content -- such as minced pork, sausages and bacon -- would be
removed from sale by Sunday.
No curbs were set on trade in milk and dairy products since any dioxins
would be greatly diluted in huge vats of milk.
Deputy Prime Minister Elio di Rupo acknowledged that restoring confidence
in Belgian meat abroad would be "a colossal job."
Dehaene halted his campaign activities on Saturday as he and top ministers
held more crisis talks to tackle issues such as farmers' compensation
claims and calls from employers to keep the European Commission from
imposing more trade restrictions.
Belgian media have estimated that the crisis could cost the nation some 30
billion Belgian francs ($767 million).
