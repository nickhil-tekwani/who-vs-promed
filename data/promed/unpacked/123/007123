The first report on legionellosis from India appeared over a decade ago.
The following 2 reports show that this condition exists in India.
Agrawal L, Dhunjibhoy KR, Nair KG. Isolation of _Legionella pneumophila_
from patients of respiratory tract disease and environmental samples.
Indian J Med Res 1991; 93: 364-5. In this preliminary study, 45 patients
suffering from pneumonia were screened for _L. pneumophila_. Also, 17
random environmental samples, water from a cooling system used for air
conditioning units, and samples from a respirator-humidifier were screened.
Four of the 45 clinical specimens (9 per cent) and 13 of the 17
environmental samples (76 per cent) showed the presence of _L.
pneumophila_. This is the 1st report from India of the isolation of _L.
pneumophila_.
Chaudhry R, Dhawan B, Dey AB. The incidence of _Legionella pneumophila_: a
prospective study in a tertiary care hospital in India. Trop Doct 2000; 30:
197-200. The prevalence of _Legionella pneumophila_, which resulted in
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients admitted to the hospital,
was investigated. Between April 1997 and December 1998, 60 patients with
CAP admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences were included
in the study. Etiological diagnosis was based on the results of routine
microbiological blood culture for bacteria and serological test by enzyme
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1-7.
Eight patients (13 per cent) had a conventional bacterial etiology and 9
patients (15 per cent) had serological evidence of recent infection with
_L. pneumophila_.
