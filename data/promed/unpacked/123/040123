[For the locations of all lumpy skin disease [LSD] outbreaks reported by Russia to the OIE in the past 12 months (1 Oct 2017 -- 30 Sep 2018), see OIE's interactive map at https://tinyurl.com/y7eq9cat (click on the Russian cluster, zoom in). The map clearly presents the dozens of LSD outbreaks in Russia's oblasts Saratov, Samara, Orensburg, Kurgan (suffering the largest cluster) and Omsk, being spread along Kazakhstan's northern border, facing Kazakhstan's provinces West Kazakhstan, Alt Yubinskaya, Kostanayskaya and North Kazakhstan. Notably, not a single outbreak is presented, for the said period, within Kazakhstan's territories which are adjacent to the infected Russian oblasts. The political border becoming such a demarcation line is rather puzzling, even more since Russia, according to OIE's data, maintains LSD vaccination policy while Kazakhstan does not.

TASS, Russia's news agency, reported on 26 Sep 2018 that Russia has decided to ban shipments of livestock products from Kazakhstan. (see http://tass.com/economy/1023159). This measure was initially planned to be implemented on 1 Oct 2018; following negotiations between the parties, its implementation has been postponed to start on 1 Nov 2018. The reasons, given by the spokesperson of the Russian agricultural watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor, were "the lack of transparency in Kazakhstan's supplies and production". In addition: "the accompanying documents do not accurately specify the origin of raw materials", "sometimes it is not clear from the documents where finished products were made", and "Kazakhstan was failing to meet the terms for integration of the Unified Automated Control System of its agricultural sector and Russia's Vetis system". Earlier, head of Rosselkhoznadzor Sergei Dankvert said that his agency has not decided yet on a total ban on livestock products from Kazakhstan.

According to Kazakhstan's annual report for 2017, its last LSD outbreak took place on 26 Nov 2016, the disease being absent since. Kazakhstan is one of the countries in which OIE performed PVS (Evaluation of Performance of Veterinary Services); the approved report was not permitted by the country to become public. From a reliable source we have learnt about the weakness of the mechanism required for maintaining coordination between the 3 levels (national, provincial and local) veterinary authorities in the country.

Updated information on the LSD surveillance in Kazakhstan, including sampling methods, number and locations of suspected/investigated cases, and other related activities and techniques applied, will be helpful. In the past, ProMED-mail published several media-derived cases (see See Also). - Mod.AS
