Thousands of fish killed by VHS in Michigan lake
------------------------------------------------
A substantial die-off of panfish, bass, and muskies on a 175 acre [71
hectare] lake in central Lower Michigan has been attributed to viral
hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS).
Gary Whelan, fish production manager for the Michigan Department of Natural
Resources, said the kill was "somewhere in the low thousands" on Budd Lake
in Clare County, about 40 miles [64km] west of Saginaw Bay. "The vast
majority were black crappie and bluegills," Whelan said. "There were some
largemouth bass and pumpkinseed, and a few muskies -- single-digit numbers
-- but the muskies were too far decomposed to test."
Budd Lake joins the Fox River Valley's Little Lake Butte des Morts and 3240
acre [1311 hectare] Conesus Lake in New York as the only known inland
waters to have VHS positive fish tested. But Wisconsin fishery biologists
believe it's likely the virus is present in other Lake Winnebago system
lakes because they are connected.
Whelan said spawning stress and temperature changes cause fish die-offs
every spring, but the large scale mortality on Budd Lake was unusual. Dead
fish were first reported 30 Apr [2007]. A total of 62 black crappies and a
smaller number of largemouth bass, bluegill and pumpkinseed were tested at
Michigan State University, and the test results came in this week [14-18
May 2007]. Because there was an unusual blue-green algae bloom on the lake
-- and such blooms are known to produce toxins -- Whelan said that may have
also played a role in the die-off.
"We don't know what the interactions are between that and VHS, but we do
know VHS was in the fish sampled," he said. Whelan has dealt with VHS in
Michigan's Great Lakes waters the past 2 years. He said no one knows how
big an impact it will have on inland or outlying waters. "It could kill off
susceptible fish and then fade away, only to reappear as an opportunistic
pathogen any time fish are stressed," Whelan said.
Another scenario, he said, is that the virus kills off young fish before
their immune systems are operational, ultimately depressing certain fish
populations. Whelan described Michigan's mortalities in recent years as
tens of thousands of freshwater drum, round gobies, gizzard shad and white
bass in lakes Erie and Ontario, thousands of yellow perch in central Lake
Erie and 2000 to 4000 muskies in Lake St Clair, where the muskie population
is estimated to be close to 100 000.
As a result of the new find, Michigan is modifying regulations recently
proposed in a Fish Disease Control Order that was presented to the Natural
Resources Commission last week [7-11 May 2007]. The order can be reviewed

State adopts emergency rules to halt spread of deadly fish virus
-----------------------------------------
The largely unregulated wild bait industry will undergo scrutiny and
fishermen soon will be banned from transporting live fish from the Lake
Winnebago System in Wisconsin. The measures, adopted by the state
Department of Natural Resources Board in an emergency rule Thursday [17 May
2007], are part of a fast-paced effort to contain the spread of a virus
deadly to many species of Wisconsin fish.
The virus made its first Wisconsin appearance in the Fox [River] Valley.
Officials last weekend confirmed that viral hemorrhagic septicemia, or VHS,
was present in 2 freshwater drum, commonly called sheepshead, that died 2
May [2007] in Little Lake Butte des Morts. Tests are pending on additional
fish taken from Lake Winnebago.
"We are seeing the beginnings of a fish kill possibly in the Lake Winnebago
System," said Mike Staggs, director of the DNR�s Bureau of Fisheries
Management and Habitat Protection.
Although the virus poses no health risk to humans, officials fear the virus
could lead to large fish kills in Wisconsin.
"The sun is going to come up on fishing tomorrow in Wisconsin and on into
the future," Staggs said. "We are not trying, by any way, stretch or means
sound any kind of death knell for any fisheries here in the state. On the
other hand there are reasons why we have to treat this as a very serious
fish health issue."
To avoid the spread of the virus into Lake Winnebago, officials closed the
Fox River lock in Menasha this past weekend [12-13 May 2007], although they
plan to reopen the locks if VHS is found to already be in the lake.
Thursday�s action extended emergency rules in place in lakes Michigan and
Superior and the Mississippi River. The rules require bait dealers to
document where and when they harvest wild bait. Currently people who
harvest bait must register with the state but aren�t required to document
their harvests.
The rules also require fishermen to drain live wells and bilges after each
fishing trip. Fishermen will not be allowed to transport live fish,
including bait, from the Winnebago system. The rules apply to the Winnebago
system, including the Wolf River upstream to Shawano; the Fox River south
to Montello and north to Green Bay; the Pine River to Poysippi; the Little
Wolf to Manawa; and the Embarrass River to Pella.
George Meyer, executive director of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation, a
group of 155 hunting fishing and trapping groups, called for a statewide
rule. "We believe that the proposed regulations are not strong enough," he
said.
The board adopted the rule following Meyer�s testimony. It will be extended
statewide if infected fish are found elsewhere. In the meantime, the DNR is
crafting a permanent rule that could carry the regulations statewide. The
virus has the potential to kill a wide range of fish.
