Week 11/2015 (9-15 Mar 2015)
----------------------------
Summary
-------
Influenza activity continues to circulate at medium levels in 28 out of 45 countries but has passed its peak in most European countries. While the proportion of influenza virus positive samples is similar to that of the previous week (41 percent), the overall number of influenza detections further decreased.

Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and type B viruses continued to circulate in the Region, with an increasing proportion of type B viruses. For the region as a whole influenza A(H3N2) viruses were most prominent, but several countries from the southern and far-eastern part of the Region (Georgia, Greece, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Turkey and Ukraine), reported predominantly sentinel influenza B virus detections over the season.

Notifications of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, mainly type B, and morbilliform rash were reported recently by United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are under investigation.

Hospitalized severe influenza cases were reported mainly in elderly people (53 percent). Influenza type A was more frequently observed (85 percent) than influenza B (15 percent) in fatal laboratory-confirmed hospitalized influenza cases. Excess all-cause mortality among people aged 65 years and older, concomitant with increased influenza activity and the predominance of A(H3N2) viruses, has been observed since the beginning of the year [2015] in 12 of 15 reporting countries.

About 2/3 of the A(H3N2) viruses characterized so far show antigenic differences compared to the virus included in the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. The observed reduction in effectiveness of the A(H3N2) component of the vaccine might have contributed to the excess mortality reported among elderly people. The A(H1N1)pdm09 and B components of the vaccine are likely to be effective.

This season, there are no indications of substantial reduced sensitivity of influenza A or B viruses to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamavir.

Virus characteristics (https://www.flunewseurope.org/VirusCharacteristics)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A(H1N1) viruses
---------------
155 of the 161 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses genetically characterized and the 294 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized to date are similar to the components included in the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere vaccines.

A(H3N2) viruses
---------------
Of the 725 A(H3N2) viruses characterized genetically, the majority fell into genetic subgroups that have been shown to be antigenically dissimilar to the current A(H3N2) vaccine virus, namely, 63 percent in genetic subgroup 3C.2a represented by A/Hong Kong/5738/2014 and 9 percent in genetic subgroup 3C.3a represented by A/Switzerland/9715293/2013; 27 percent fell into genetic subgroup 3C.3, represented by A/Samara/73/2013, which has shown to be antigenically similar to the current A(H3N2) vaccine virus. Antigenic analyses of 689 viruses showed similar findings: 67 percent were A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like and thus dissimilar to the A/Texas/50/2012 vaccine virus. Together, these observations indicate that the current A(H3N2) component of influenza vaccines will have a reduced effectiveness.

Influenza B viruses
-------------------
Of the 247 B/Yamagata lineage viruses characterized genetically to date, 99 percent belong to clade 3, represented by B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Table 2). The 5 influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like. Of the 331 influenza B viruses characterized antigenically, 98 percent were of the Yamagata lineage, which is included in the current 2014-2015 northern hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines; 6 viruses were of the Victoria lineage. Of the Yamagata lineage viruses, 25 percent were similar to B/Massachusetts/2/2012, a virus from genetic clade 2 and included in the current vaccine, while 74 percent were like B/Phuket/3073/2013, the virus from genetic clade 3, recommended for the southern hemisphere 2015 influenza season vaccines. In addition, 1 B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like and 2 B/Florida/4/2006-like Yamagata lineage viruses have been reported.
