In the recent post on Powassan virus (POWV) in New York state, it was suggested that POWV infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis for encephalitis cases, "especially when the patient has a history of tick bite or spends a lot of time outdoors" in tick habitats. I agree, but would also suggest that POWV infection should be considered in any such patient that has tested positive for exposure to West Nile virus (WNV), or St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), when the illness onset falls outside of the hottest summer months that favor transmission of these 2 viruses by mosquitoes.

POWV, SLEV and WNV are all members of the family _Flaviviridae_, so POWV is serologically cross-reactive with both SLEV and WNV, particularly on the less specific serological assays employed by most commercial testing laboratories. POWV is more closely related to SLEV than to WNV. And in Virginia, any patient that has symptoms of an arboviral illness and that tests IgM positive for SLE by a more specific test called the microsphere immunoassay (MIA) will also be tested for exposure to Powassan virus.

The Saratoga patient was confirmed by PRNT [plaque reduction neutralization test] on paired sera. Almost all the cases we have identified have been by serologic assays.

I agree with the comment. I think IgM and IgG flavivirus-positive assays, whether by ELISA or microsphere immunoassay, should be confirmed by cross-plaque reduction neutralization assays with paired sera from the patient because of the high level of cross-reactivity among flaviviruses. In a situation where there is a major WNV [West Nile virus] outbreak and an individual is IgM positive with clinically compatible symptoms, it may not be necessary to test further. But off season, certainly a cross-PRNT should be conducted with acute and convalescent sera. Because IgM of WNV may be long-lasting in the serum, diagnosis by IgM assay alone may not always be accurate.
