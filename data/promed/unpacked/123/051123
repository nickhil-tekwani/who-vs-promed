["Leishmaniosis is not a single entity but comprises a variety of syndromes caused primarily by at least 16 _Leishmania_ species affecting humans, transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies belonging to the genera _Phlebotomus_ and _Lutzomyia_. Leishmaniosis is associated with and limited by the geographic distribution of its sandfly vectors. Fifteen nosogeographical entities have been classified worldwide, of which 13 have an established or putative zoonotic nature. In recent years, the number of regions becoming leishmania-endemic has grown significantly, accompanied by an increased number of animal and human cases.

"In humans, the clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infections to those with high mortality, with 3 distinct forms being classically described: visceral (VL), cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous (MCL). Dogs are commonly affected by _L. infantum_ and _L. chagasi_ (now regarded as synonyms), which cause a chronic viscerocutaneous disease in this host (canine leishmaniosis, CanL). Asymptomatic infection in dogs is widespread and contributes to maintaining the long-term presence of the parasite in endemic regions. The clinical appearance and evolution of leishmaniosis is a consequence of complex interactions between the parasite and host immune response. The outcome of infection depends on the ability of host macrophages to effectively destroy the parasite." (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.11_LEISHMANIOSIS.pdf).

The following information was obtained from the abstract of a study titled "Re-emerging foci of visceral leishmaniasis in Armenia -- first molecular diagnosis of clinical samples":

"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was firstly reported in Armenia in 1913. Following a considerable increase of the number of cases until the mid 1950s, the disease disappeared after 1969 and re-emerged in 1999. Scientific literature about VL in Armenia is available only in Russian or Armenian. This paper presents a historical overview about leishmaniasis in Armenia based on this literature as well as an epidemiological update since the re-emergence of the disease. In 1999-2016, 116 indigenous VL cases were recorded mainly in children in 8 of the 11 districts; however, VL is underreported because of lack of trained medical [personnel] and diagnostic facilities. The aim of this work was to apply for the first time molecular diagnosis of VL in Armenia. Out of 25 VL suspected patients, 22 were positive by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genotyping using internal transcribed spacer 1-PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing identified the causative agent of VL in Armenia as _Leishmania infantum_. The present work is an important step towards the inclusion of molecular techniques in the current diagnosis of VL in Armenia and the establishment of local molecular diagnostic facilities."
