About 40 people, including several children, collapsed at a taxi rank
in Rustenburg, North West, on Saturday [10 Sep 2011] in a suspected
poisoning incident, paramedics said. Paramedics arrived at the taxi
rank at 11 AM and found many people lying on the ground, Netcare 911
spokesman Jeff Wicks said. Most of them showed symptoms of
organophosphate poisoning including vomiting, profuse sweating, nausea
and diarrhoea.

Organophosphate is a chemical used to kill insects and animals that
damage crops.

They told medics they had fallen ill after eating food at a nearby
restaurant, Wicks said.

Further details about the poisoning were not immediately available.
Those affected were taken to various hospitals in an ambulance and
minibus taxis.

[This article contains very little information. The clinical signs
mentioned, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, nausea and an apparently
rapid onset, sound like poisoning by organophosphates.

Organophosphate poisoning in South Africa is a reportable condition
that frequently goes under-diagnosed or under-recognized because of
lack of training for health care workers.

The article does not tell us what the emergency assistance people
treated the victims with. If it was organophosphates, then atropine
would have been an appropriate treatment and should have caused
abatement of some of the clinical signs.

Organophosphates are used in insect control on crops and for parasite
control on cattle and pets.

Exposure to organophosphates can occur by inhalation, ingestion, or by
contact. Since so many people were affected, it would seem that they
must have been exposed either by ingestion or by inhalation. It is not
reported whether any of the restaurant workers were suffering as well.
If they were, then it may be more of an inhalational exposure. If not,
then it may be ingestion.

While the article provides little information, dichlorvos is an
organophoshate that is often used in some countries in and around
storage areas that may house produce.

Dichlorvos is an organophosphate insecticide which is used to control
insects, primarily in storage areas and barns. It can affect the
nervous system, where it may cause nausea and vomiting, restlessness,
sweating, and muscle tremors at high levels. It is a dense colorless
liquid. It has a sweetish smell and readily mixes with water.
Dichlorvos used in pest control is diluted with other chemicals and
used as a spray. It can also be incorporated into plastic that slowly
releases the chemical.

Ingesting large doses may cause nausea and vomiting, restlessness,
sweating, and muscle tremors, while very large doses may cause coma,
inability to breathe, and death. Animal studies have also shown
effects on the nervous system when animals drank water or ate food
containing dichlorvos.

Any organophosphate is an anticholinesterase agent, blocking
acetylcholine and resulting in clinical signs such as excessive
salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal
effects.

Compared to poisoning by other organophosphates, dichlorvos causes a
more rapid onset of symptoms, which is often followed by a similarly
rapid recovery. The reason for this rapid disappearance of dichlorvos
is the presence of degrading enzymes in both tissues and blood plasma.
When dichlorvos is absorbed after ingestion, it is moved rapidly to
the liver where it is rapidly detoxified.

It is not known whether dichlorvos can affect reproduction or cause
birth defects in people. Animal studies have not reported effects on
reproduction or birth defects when animals were exposed to
dichlorvos.

It is not known whether dichlorvos causes cancer in people. A study in
rats and mice reported that rats had an increase in cancer of the
pancreas and in leukemia, and female mice had an increase in stomach
cancer after they were fed dichlorvos for 2 years.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined
that dichlorvos is possibly carcinogenic to humans.
