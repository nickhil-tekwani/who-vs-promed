A disease keeps spreading among the monkey population. A large number of female monkeys died at Vettikkattiri taking the death toll to 11. Veterinary surgeon Dr. David Abraham said that the cause of death was due to pus formation in the uterus. The doctor clarified that although humans would not be infected with this, it is better to avoid contact with these animals.

As monkeys do not have contacts with each other, it is unlikely that it could spread among their habitats. The results of the Pune Virology Institute tested negative that the monkey deaths were due to Kyasanur Forest disease.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), caused by a tick-borne flavivirus, is seen in a limited area of India. It was first reported in the spring of 1957, when an outbreak of severe disease was documented in people living near the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka State, India, which also affected wild nonhuman primates. The vector is _Haemaphysalis spinigera_, a tick whose immature stages are avid primate feeders, including humans. Ticks transmit the virus transovarially. Wild monkeys, _Presbytis entellus_ (black-faced langur) and _Macaca radiata_ (red-faced bonnet monkey), are very common in the forest localities where KFD virus circulates.

Pyometra or purulent endometritis may be a sporadic finding, not an event of epidemic presentation. Monkeys have been used as models for the study of venereal diseases such as endometritis caused by _Chlamydia trachomatis_, but no natural infection in wild monkey populations of this or other venereal pathogens has been reported so far. - Mod.PMB
