The death toll in the Greater Accra region from the cholera outbreak has risen to 21 out of 1570 reported cases.

Dr Ato Eshun, the Greater Accra disease control officer in an interview with XYZ News said all hospitals are well equipped to handle cholera cases for now. He also urged the public to quickly report such cases at the nearest hospital.

"So far a lot of cases are being reported because of the awareness situation. For now we have a little over 1570 cases and 21 deaths." He explained that "these deaths are due to the fact people come in the worst conditions. We want to entreat the general public to adhere strictly to personal and environmental hygiene."

[3] Cholera - Uganda (Nebbi District), Congo Democratic Republic

Persistent poor hygiene in Nebbi District has aided further spread of cholera, bringing the number of deaths to 11 and 550 infections in 2 weeks.

Despite increased sensitization about improving sanitation by health workers, communities have been slow in adapting to messages. The communities still take unboiled water, defecate in lakes because families are still reluctant to construct pit-latrines, and there is poor waste disposal in congested markets.

The district health officer, Mr Kits Obima, told the Monitor that the new infections pose a great challenge with the meager resources and manpower at established treatment centres.

"The village health teams moving door-door meet stiff resistance from some family heads who blatantly reject idea of constructing pit-latrines," Mr Obima said.

Already, there are plans to close Panyimur and Dei markets that attract huge numbers of traders from DR Congo. Some of the cases are from DR Congo.

Close on the heels of a H1N1 scare, cholera and gastroenteritis have sparked an epidemic scare in Bangalore. 5 cases of cholera have been reported from a private hospital in Chikkalalbagh area, near Majestic, said Dr Manoranjan Hegde, nodal officer, communicable disease, BBMP.

When contacted, Dr Chandrashekar Malagi, Joint Director, Communicable Diseases, State Health and Family Welfare Department, said there were 2 more cholera cases reported from Isolation Hospital. "However, in a city like Bangalore it is not a huge number. The climate is such that there could be more cases of cholera. Unless, there are too many cases reported, there is no need to panic," he said.
