Viet Nam: 2 More Suspected Human Cases of Avian Influenza (and one
suspected fatal case of SARS)
---------------------------------------------------
2 more Vietnamese, a 12-year-old girl and a woman, are in hospital with
suspected avian influenza, the official Vietnamese News Agency said on Tue
5 Apr 2005.
The girl, who lives near a poultry slaughterhouse, was in an isolation ward
on Monday in the northern city of Haiphong, the head of the city's Health
Department was quoted as saying. The woman was taken to hospital in Hue the
previous day and both were being tested to see if they had contracted the
H5N1 virus which has killed 49 people in Asia. The Haiphong hospital has
been treating a couple and their 3 daughters who caught avian influenza
last month [March 2005], the largest number of bird flu cases found
together [i.e. as a cluster] in Viet Nam.
The Tien Phong newspaper said researchers at the National Institute for
Hygiene and Epidemiology meanwhile were trying to find what had caused the
acute pneumonia which killed a 34-year-old doctor in the northern province
of Quang Ninh. He fell sick on Fri 1 Apr 2005, his breathing worsened
quickly despite emergency treatment for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS), and he died on Sunday, the newspaper said. Test results [are]
expected by the end of this week. A SARS outbreak in 2003 killed nearly 800
people worldwide, including 5 in Viet Nam.
On Monday, Vietnamese doctors said a 27-year-old woman had contracted avian
influenza after drinking duck blood, a local specialty, but was expected to
survive.
The avian influenza (H5N1) virus has swept across much of Asia in late 2003
and has since killed 35 people in Viet Nam, 14 since the disease broke out
anew in the southern Mekong Delta in December. The virus, which has also
killed 12 Thais and 2 Cambodians, does not pass easily from birds to
humans, and eating infected fowl cooked properly is not dangerous.

[It is not entirely clear why the 34-year-old doctor in Quang Ninh
province, who fell ill on Fri 1 Apr 2005 and died on Sunday, is being
considered a suspected case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) --
caused by a SARS coronavirus infection -- rather than as a suspected case
of avian influenza virus infection. Further clarification is requested
urgently. - Mod.CP]
