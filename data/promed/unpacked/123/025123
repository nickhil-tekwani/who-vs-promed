Thousands of citizens have been infected with malaria since the beginning of this year [2021] in areas controlled by the ousted Hadi government in Taiz province, southwest Yemen.

Health facilities in the province have recorded 4000 confirmed and suspected cases of malaria, a media source said, quoting an official in the malaria control program in the province.

The official noted that the areas where malaria had spread significantly were on the west coast, west, and western directorates.

People also had suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic, which claimed hundreds of lives.

[Malaria is endemic in Yemen especially in the western part along the Red Sea and in pockets on the south coast (See WHO World Malaria Report 2020, Annex 2 C WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region; https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/9789240015791).

The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has not contributed to malaria control since 2017, and the World Bank has decreased its funding from USD 47 million in 2017 to USD 17 million in 2019 and the UK has ceased to support malaria control in the country. In 2019, 612 000 long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) were distributed, and 1.9 million people were protected by indoor residual spraying (IRS) (WHO World Malaria Report 2020, Annex 3 D). Yemen has an estimated population of 29.2 million. In 2019 the WHO estimated that Yemen had 872 000 cases of malaria (range 610 000 to 1 259 000). - Mod.EP
