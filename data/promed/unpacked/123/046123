Enterovirus cases in Taiwan increase nearly 30 percent in one week
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Enterovirus infections in Taiwan have been increasing rapidly since the start of the epidemic season on 1 May [2016], with thousands of people falling ill in a single week, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Tue [17 May 2016].

According to the CDC, 17 000 patients sought outpatient or emergency treatment at hospitals for enterovirus infection between 8 May and 14 May, an increase of 27.8 percent from the previous week. Last week[9-15 May 2016], 312 classes were suspended at schools nationwide due to enterovirus infections among students, compared with 102 classes the previous week, the CDC said.

It said the coxsackie A virus remained the dominant virus strain circulating around the country. A total of 31 cases of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections have been confirmed so far this year, including 3 with severe complications, according to the CDC. EV71 is a common cause of hand, foot and mouth disease among infants and children and is associated with fatal neurological illness.

The CDC had warned earlier of a major EV71 epidemic in Taiwan this year.

[A strain (C4a) of enterovirus EV71 has infected hundreds of thousands of mostly pre-school-age children in China, Cambodia, and Taiwan in recent years. Most cases initially develop fever and a rash. More serious signs are sudden weakness in the limbs, excessive drowsiness or irritability, or evidence of heart and lung inflammation, such as being out of breath. [But note that the cases reported here are mostly mild. - Mod.LK]

Like many viruses, EV71 is transmitted by fecal contact and by coughs and sneezes (droplet infection). Spread from respiratory droplets can be limited by use of tissues and avoiding contact with others. Careful hand hygiene is important. Parents toileting children or changing nappies should be particularly careful to routinely wash their hands with soap and to use disinfectants where needed. Isolation of cases is very effective at limiting spread and children with hand, foot and mouth disease should be kept at home until the blisters have cleared up.

Treatment
---------
There is as yet no vaccine or curative treatment available on the market, but the Chinese company Sinovac has successfully tested a vaccine against EV71 in children. The trial, involving 10 000 children, showed a much lower incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease among the immunized children. Sinovac has applied for permission to market the vaccine.

Taiwan reports increases in enterovirus, hepatitis A infections
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is reporting increasing numbers of 2 viral diseases-enterovirus and hepatitis A, prompting calls for preventive measures. According to the surveillance data compiled by Taiwan CDC, coxsackie A virus is currently the dominant strains circulating in the community. Cases of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection have also continued to occur and most of them are mild cases.

During the past week, health officials report 17 000 ER and outpatient visits for enterovirus infections, which include 7 additional EV71 cases. Thus far this year, as of 17 May 2016, 31 cases of EV71 infection, including 25 mild cases, 3 suspected severe cases, and 3 severe cases, have been confirmed in Taiwan. Taiwan is not alone as several Asian countries are reporting increases in enterovirus to include China, Vietnam, South Korea, Macau and Singapore.

Taiwan CDC reminds that frequent hand washing is the primary way to prevent enterovirus infection. Adults who return home from work are advised to change clothes and wash hands with soap and water before coming into contact with children.

In addition, please make sure children wash their hands with soap and water thoroughly when returning home and before having their meals in order to prevent infection. When a child in a household is diagnosed with enterovirus infection, parents and child caregivers are urged to refrain the sick child from close contact with other children to prevent further spread of the disease.

Taiwan is also seeing a record number of hepatitis A infections year to date. According to the surveillance data collected by Taiwan CDC, thus far this year, as of 15 May 2016, a total of 275 cases of hepatitis A have been reported in Taiwan, reaching a record high in years. [See ProMED Hepatitis A - Taiwan: increased MSM incidence 20160518.4230111]. As many as 50 percent of the 275 cases are also infected with HIV.

The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control urges at-risk individuals, including restaurant workers, healthcare workers, caretakers of infants and children, people with chronic liver disease, hemophilia, or those who have had liver transplants, people who practice unsafe sex, people who inject drugs, and those planning to visit areas affected by hepatitis A, who do not have hepatitis A antibodies are urged to receive 2 doses of self-paid hepatitis A vaccine in order to lower the risk of infection.

In response to the increasing number of HIV and hepatitis A co-infection, Taiwan CDC plans to expand the target population for the free hepatitis A vaccination pilot program.

[Coxsackie virus is a member of the _Picornaviridae_ family of viruses in the genus termed _Enterovirus_.

Coxsackie virus infection usually is spread by fecal-oral contamination, although occasionally the virus is spread by droplets expelled by infected individuals. Items like utensils, diaper-changing tables, and toys that come in contact with body fluids that contain the virus may also transmit them to other individuals. Although people of any age, including adults, can get infected, the majority of patients with coxsackie infection are young children. Pregnant women can pass coxsackie virus to their newborns, which may cause serious problems for the newborn. So pregnant women need to notify their obstetrician if they exhibit symptoms of the infection, especially if they are close to their delivery date.

Prevention of coxsackie virus infections is difficult but possible. With children, keeping strict hygienic precautions is almost impossible, but good practices such as hand washing after diaper changing or touching infected skin may reduce viral transmission to other family members. Attempts to regularly clean items that children contact, especially toys, pacifiers, and any items they may place in their mouths, may also reduce viral transmission. Hand washing, in general, is the best prevention technique. Currently, there is no commercial vaccine available.

Pregnant women should avoid contact with children (or adults) with HFMD [Hand, foot, and mouth disease] because some studies suggest that coxsackie virus may cause developmental and other defects in the fetus.

Although infection and resolution of the disease usually renders the person immune to reinfection with the viral type that initiated the disease, the person is not immune to other coxsackie viral types. For example, a person may become immune to coxsackie viral type B4 but still would be susceptible to all of the other coxsackie viral types (for example, CVA16). In addition, other viruses such as enterovirus 71 and enteric cytopathic human orphan (ECHO) viruses can produce HFMD symptoms. Consequently, it is possible for some people to have multiple infections with HFMD symptoms even though repeated infections occur infrequently.
