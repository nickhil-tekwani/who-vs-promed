2000/159 Watermelon chlorotic stunt begomovirus: addition to the EPPO Alert
List [edited]
Watermelon chlorotic stunt begomovirus [WCSV] was first reported in 1986
from Yemen on watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_) crops. Infected plants
showed yellow veins, chlorotic mottling, severe stunting of young leaves,
and fruit yield was drastically reduced. The disease occurred wherever
watermelon was grown, with incidences of up to 90-100 %. _Bemisia tabaci_
(EPPO A2 quarantine pest) biotype B transmits the virus.
Between 1993 and 1996, severe outbreaks caused by WCSV were reported in the
cucurbit-growing regions of Central and Eastern Sudan on watermelons and
melons (_Cucumis melo_). Similar observations in Sudan from 1995 to 1997
confirmed that WCSV caused considerable losses in commercial melon crops.
Watermelons in southern provinces of Iran (Bushehr, Hormouzgan,
Sistan-Balouchistan) were similarly affected.
The genomes of two [WCSV] isolates from Sudan and Iran were cloned and
sequenced. These geographically distant isolates from Africa and the Near
East shared a very high overall sequence similarity and their capsid
proteins were identical. Considering the wide distribution of WCSV
throughout the Near East and the established populations of _B. tabaci_ in
the Mediterranean Basin, particular attention should be given to this virus.
This virus came to our attention because it causes a serious disease of
cucurbits in Iran, Sudan and Yemen.
Where? Africa: Sudan. Asia: Iran, Yemen.
On which plants: Watermelons (_Citrullus lanatus_), melons (_Cucumis
melo_). It can also be found on: snake cucumber (_Cucumis melo_ var.
flexuosus), _Cucurbita moschata_, wild cucurbits: _Citrullus colocynthis_
and _Cucumis melo_ var. agrestis.
Damage Symptoms: are characterized by yellow veins, chlorotic mottling,
severe stunting of young leaves, and drastically reduced fruit yield. High
disease incidence (up to 100%) and severe losses are reported in countries
where the disease is present.
Transmission: _Bemisia tabaci_ biotype B.
Pathway Infected: cucurbit plants for planting, fruits?, viruliferous _B.
tabaci_ from countries where watermelon chlorotic stunt begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Cucurbits are important crops in the EPPO region. Melons
and watermelons are particularly important for southern Europe. The insect
vector _B. tabaci_ is widespread.
