[According to the report above, a total of 82 933 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 4 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (13 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases are all indigenous cases, all 4 cases in Jilin. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there was 1 newly confirmed case reported in the past 24 hours. Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1692 imported cases reported (no newly confirmed imported cases in the past 24 hours.

There were 11 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 9 locally acquired cases and 2 imported cases. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 619, and 35 of these are importations from abroad. I realize it is repetitious mentioning this on a daily basis but..... It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic, in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported -- Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown. The worrisome observation vis a vis the cluster in Wuhan is that the virus had most likely been circulating there undetected until the cluster was identified.

- Of the 29 new cases [reported yesterday 13 May 2020], 3 were imported cases and 26 were locally transmitted cases.
-- 20 of the locally transmitted cases are related to the Itaewon club cluster; 5 are visitors to Itaewon clubs; 15 are contacts.
-- 4 local cases are related to a social gathering in Hongdae (in Mapo-gu, Seoul); further investigation on the chain of transmission is underway.
-- 1 local case is a contact of previous confirmed case.
-- 1 local case is from Gyeonggi Province; further investigation on the chain of transmission is underway.

- 2 additional confirmed cases have been reported between 0:00 and 12:00 today [14 May 2020], bringing the total related to the cluster to 133. Contact investigation and infection control measures are underway.
-- By region: Seoul City=73, Gyeonggi Province=25, Incheon City=18, Chungbuk Province=8, Busan City=4, Chungnam Province=1, Jeonbuk Province=1, Gyeongnam Province=1, Gangwon Province=1, Jeju Province=1
-- By chain of transmission: club visitors=82; contacts (family/acquaintance/coworkers/etc.)=51
-- By age group: [0-18]=13; [19-29]=83; [30-39]=23; [40-49]=7; [50-59]=4; [60+]=2
-- Male=112; female=21

- Although previous version of the guidelines have stipulated that personally identifiable information should not be disclosed, gender and age of individual confirmed cases are still being disclosed. The guidelines will be revised to clarify which information is nonessential and do not need to be included in the disclosure of travel routes of individual confirmed cases.

- KCDC requested that everyone actively cooperate with epidemiological investigation in order to help prevent further spread of COVID-19 in the community.
-- Providing false statement or testimony, submitting false information, or deliberately omitting or concealing facts during epidemiological investigation is punishable by imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to 20 million won according to the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act.

- Noting the recent rise in local transmission of COVID-19, KCDC stressed the importance of early detection through diagnostic testing.
-- In addition to Itaewon, several cases have also been found in Hongdae causing concern for a potential outbreak. Therefore, KCDC recommended that anyone who has come in close contact with a large number of unspecified persons in an enclosed/confined space such as clubs or bars need to be tested at a screening center through public health center or 1339 call center.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 27 cases and 0 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (13 to 14 May 2020) when there were 29 newly confirmed cases and 1 death. A total of 11 018 confirmed cases and 260 deaths were reported today (14 May 2020), up from 10 991 cases and 260 deaths yesterday (13 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 42 consecutive days and below 50 for 35 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 7 days. Of concern is that all but 5 of the newly confirmed cases were locally transmitted today (14 May 2020) and 3 yesterday (14 May 2020). 14 of the 27 newly confirmed cases were in Seoul (all locally acquired), 5 in Incheon (1 imported and 4 locally acquired ), 3 each in Daegu (all locally acquired) and Gyeonggi (2 imported and 1 locally acquired), and 1 each in Jeonnam (imported) and Quarantine (imported).

Figure 1: Daily confirmed cases by chain of transmission covers the period 1 Apr 2020 through 13 May 2020, on the English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) is striking in the 10 day period with minimal local transmission and predominant importation, and the recent shift (5-14 May 2020) when local transmission replaced the majority imported cases.

The outbreak associated with the Itaewon clubs is now up to 133 cases including 51 contacts (family/acquaintance/coworkers/etc.). And apparently there is now concern about another club district in Hongdae -- an area in Seoul around Hongik University, known for student nightlife with karaoke lounges and dance clubs. Many bars, cafes, and clubs are found in the area.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be a main problem, but the growing Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of next steps.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 223 096 cases, including 31 368 deaths, up from 222 104 cases and 31 106 deaths reported on 13 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 13 and 14 May 2020, was 992 newly confirmed cases, compared with 888 newly confirmed cases between 12 and 13 May 2020, a slight increase from yesterday's change. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 78.8% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 52.6% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Piedmont is the only other province reporting 100 or more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 12 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases (2 provinces, Basilicata and Sardinia, reported no new cases), and another 5 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Emilia-Romagna and Liguria are 2 provinces reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 63 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 62 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out. See section [7] from COVID-19-update (157): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local transm, Italy phase 2 20200505.7300349 for details on phase 2 opening.

[4] Iran: 114 533 total cases, 6854 deaths
Date: Thu 14 May 2020 22:55 Asia/Tehran

Iran warned of a possible coronavirus cluster hitting another province on Thursday [14 May 2020] as it announced 71 new deaths and more than 1800 infections nationwide.

"We are in situation similar to previous days (in most provinces) save for Khuzestan, which is still in a critical condition, and it seems that North Khorasan may be critical as well," said health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour. "If this trend continues, North Khorasan will require more serious measures, too," he added in televised remarks. North Khorasan province lies in northeastern Iran on the border with Turkmenistan. Khuzestan province in the southwest borders Iraq.

The ministry had on Monday [11 May 2020] signalled a setback in its efforts to contain the virus in Khuzestan where authorities shut state bodies, banks and non-essential businesses again in around 1/3 of its counties. Iran stopped publishing provincial figures for the coronavirus last month [April 2020].

Authorities in the southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, have also warned of a fresh spike in infections. "We had not seen such an increase in coronavirus infections since late February [2020]," said Ghasem Miri, deputy head of provincial capital Zahedan's medical university. The total number of people infected in the province had hit 909, of whom 821 had recovered and 59 died, Miri told ILNA news agency on Tuesday [12 May 2020].

Miri said the jump was due to the failure of people to observe "social distancing and health protocols". Iran has deemed more than 150 counties across the country as low-risk from the virus and has allowed them to reopen mosques. Since [11 Apr 2020], it has allowed a phased reopening of its economy and lifted restrictions on intercity travel.

Iran's deputy health minister also announced on Thursday [14 May 2020] that athletes in 29 sports -- including track and field, tennis, and weightlifting -- could resume training. Iraj Harirchi also told ISNA news agency that a decision about Iran's top flight football league would be made on Saturday [16 May 2020].

According to health ministry spokesman Jahanpour, the latest deaths brought the official toll to 6854. He said 1808 new cases of COVID-19 infection had been detected, raising the total to 114 533. Of those hospitalised, 90 539 had recovered and been discharged, while 2758 were in critical condition.

Iran has struggled to contain its outbreak of the novel coronavirus since announcing its 1st cases in the Shiite holy city of Qom on [19 Feb 2020]. Experts inside and outside the country have voiced scepticism about the official figures, saying the real toll could be much higher.

[In the 24 hours from 13 to 14 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 112 725 to 114 533, an increase of 1808 compared with 1958 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (13 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6783 to 6854, an increase of 71 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Russia, the UK, Italy, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 14 May 2020; 17:33 EDT). As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature as daily newly confirmed case counts and now daily deaths are increasing. The caution that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths may be starting slightly earlier than 2 weeks. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 457 593, including 86 912 deaths, an increase from 1 430 348 cases and 85 197 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 353 096 (24.2%) cumulative case reports and 2248 (8.3%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 186 293 as of 1:00 PM EDT on 14 May 2020, including 15 349 confirmed deaths and an additional 5057 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (3239 -- 11.9%), New York (2248 -- 8.3%), California (1880 -- 6.9%), Massachusetts (1685 -- 6.2%), Texas (1273 -- 4.7%), Michigan (1191 -- 4.4%), New Jersey (1163 -- 4.3%), Maryland (1091 -- 4.0%) , Virginia (1067 -- 3.9%), and Pennsylvania (1007 -- 3.7%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, Florida, and Georgia.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1, followed by Spain, Russia, UK, Italy, Brazil, France, Turkey, and New Jersey as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 Illinois, 13 China, 14 Massachusetts, 15 India, 16 Peru, 17 California, 18 Canada, 19 Pennsylvania, and 20 Belgium. Brazil is now 6th globally in terms of cumulative case counts. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City itself would be between Brazil and France (it would be number 7).

The US military has confirmed 8297 cumulative cases, with 87 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 11 767 cumulative cases and 117 new cases today (14 May 2020).

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The antibody-confirmed cases are now available in Table 4, which presents all cases including all tests performed. There were 506 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with in the preceding 24-hour period [from 11 to 12 May 2020], bringing the PCR [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 229 540 [272 646] cases as compared with 228 691 [271 095] confirmed cases on 12 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 24.52, a continual slow decrease over the past 25 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 24.52 today (13 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 229 540 [272 646] cases, an additional 330 cases have been hospitalized, and an additional 29 cases were admitted to ICU. 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.

Castile and Leon, Catalonia, and Navarre, all in the northern part of the country, are the most affected communities by population-based rates. - Mod.MPP]
