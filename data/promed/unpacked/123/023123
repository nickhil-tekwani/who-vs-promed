It is my sad obligation to inform the ProMED community of the death on 24 Oct 2015 of our semi-retired Viral Disease Moderator, Professor Craig Pringle at his home near Aberdeen, Scotland. Craig was a true friend and much-esteemed colleague of the ProMED staff. He devoted his time and effort to ProMED from early 2000 until nearly the time of his death and personally moderated and provided his outstanding commentary on more than 8400 ProMED reports during that time. My colleagues and I learned a great deal from Craig's knowledge, wisdom, and perspective. Some of the adjectives used to describe Craig in learning of his passing included: generous, meticulous, sensible, knowledgeable, urbane, scholarly, and warm. He had a way of incisively cutting to the heart of the matter and finding the essential truths, though always gently, with kindness and wit.

His friend and colleague, Professor Andrew Easton, has sent the obituary below with additional details of his highly accomplished life.

We are very grateful for his time with us and will truly miss him. We extend our sympathy to his family and friends.

Craig R. Pringle (1930-2015)

Professor Craig Pringle, Emeritus Professor of Virology at the University of Warwick, died suddenly at home on Sat 24 Oct 2015. Born in Glasgow in 1930, Craig's academic achievements led to his parents' expectations that their only son would follow a career in medicine, but his interests lay firmly in more basic aspects of science, and he undertook a degree in Zoology and Genetics at the University of Glasgow followed by a PhD in Microbial genetics at the University of Edinburgh, and this early passion for genetics remained with him throughout his scientific career, which subsequently focused on virology. After completing his PhD in 1957, Craig undertook a 2-year period of compulsory military service spent at the University of Cambridge, where he used his skill in the Russian language at the Joint Services School for Linguistics. This skill was also subsequently utilised in undertaking translation of 2 significant scientific texts and many scientific articles into English. It was typical of Craig's understated and quiet manner that many who knew him were unaware of his linguistic achievements.

Craig's initial steps in forging an extremely successful scientific career began by picking up his work in genetics at the University of Aberdeen, but the most significant step was his subsequent appointment to the Animal Virus Research Institute at Pirbright (now the Pirbright Laboratory) where he began to work on the genetics of foot and mouth disease virus, ultimately becoming the Head of the Department of Virus Genetics at the Institute. His time at Pirbright from 1961 to 1968, interrupted by a very brief return to Aberdeen as a lecturer in bacteriology, and particularly his collaborations with John Subak-Sharpe, set Craig on the path that he followed for the remainder of his scientific career, and beyond. In 1968 Craig moved to the UK Medical Research Council Virology Unit in Glasgow under the newly appointed Director Subak-Sharpe. It was here that Craig undertook most of the work that forged his international reputation for seminal observations on a number of virus systems but particularly vesicular stomatitis virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Craig's final position was as Professor of Virology in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Warwick from 1983 to his retirement in 1996 and at which he remained as an Emeritus Professor.

Craig made many pioneering contributions to the field of virology during his career. His careful and meticulous approach in the generation and analysis of virus mutants led to many fundamental observations in the systems he studied. At this time the use of virus mutants provided the major tool available to virologists for analysis of virus protein functions. Craig utilised his skills and enthusiasm for virology in the exploration of a wide range of different viruses bringing to each his attentive and critical approach. His work on vesicular stomatitis virus and other rhabdoviruses in particular laid a foundation for understanding the genetics of these viruses. Craig's work on these and other viruses such as the Bunyaviruses provided unique and invaluable reagents that he shared generously and without restriction with colleagues across the world. Subsequently Craig turned his attention to the genetics of pneumoviruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus; and this became the primary focus of his work in the later years of his career. As with all of his areas of interest Craig developed an international reputation for quality of this work. Throughout his career Craig retained his broad interest in virology and a particular pleasure for him was the award of a Visiting Professorship in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham from 1995 to 1996. During this time he worked in the laboratory of Gail Wertz, where he returned to his early passion of vesicular stomatitis virus to learn how to manipulate virus genomes in the recently described techniques of reverse genetics. This was a highly successful time and was a fitting conclusion to a career that had begun by making virus mutants using traditional approaches of chemical mutagenesis. Throughout his scientific career Craig was supervisor and mentor to a large number of postgraduate and postdoctoral colleagues. His positive influence is obvious through the successful scientific careers that many have had since working with him.

To all who knew him, Craig was a shy, quiet and thoughtful person who made light of the many accolades that he received for his work, if he mentioned them at all. Craig contributed at many levels to science, both directly through his research but also through his contributions to international organisations such as the World Health Organisation. The quality of his contributions to science are clear from the election to life membership of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (for which he acted as secretary for many years) and to life membership in the UK Society for General Microbiology (now the Microbiology Society) for his work as editor of the Journal of General Microbiology from 1982 to 1987.

When away from his research work, Craig's focus was his family: his wife Judy and 3 children Kirsty, Ian, and Heather. A source of immense pleasure to him was the birth of his 1st grandchild, Sophia, 4 months before his untimely death. Outside of the laboratory Craig maintained a keen enjoyment of the remoteness and ruggedness of the Scottish countryside and in particular the Hebridean islands of Colonsay and Jura where his family spent many holidays. This was a subject that Craig often mentioned and after his retirement from Warwick he returned to Scotland, to the village of Aboyne near Aberdeen where he was a keen walker, using his dogs as an excuse to explore the local area while also rekindling an interest in Scottish history and family genealogy.

Craig had a rich personal and professional life, with the latter dedicated to the exploration of virology. His passion for all things virological continued throughout his retirement from active research with contributions through work with the ICTV and on ProMED. His dedication to science was unquestionable, and it is fitting that he was working on ProMED up to the morning of his unexpected and sudden death. He will be missed as a good friend, colleague and mentor by all who knew him.
