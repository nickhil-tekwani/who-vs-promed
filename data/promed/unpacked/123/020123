Farmers in Kushtia [district] are worried about the new Gummy Stem Blight disease infecting scores of gourd plants and negatively affecting production. Upon inspection, many gourd plants were found rotting, several even dying, because of the disease known to be a cucurbit-rot disease caused by a fungal infection. A cure for the disease has still not been found, which has led many to fear significant losses in gourd farming.

[A] farmer said, "This year [2019], many of my gourd plants have perished due to some disease, when they matured to a few feet in height, their stems began to rot and slowly die. Gourd farmers nearby were also facing the same." Another farmer said his gourd plants simply died.

The district's Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) said the disease could attack a host plant at any stage of growth and it affects all parts of the host, including leaves, stems and fruits. Although [it] flourishes in moderate weather conditions, it can be prevented if farmers use disease free seeds and lime that can prevent the disease from spreading.

[Gummy stem blight (GSB) of cucurbits caused by the fungus _Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum_ (previously _Didymella bryoniae_) is a major disease of these crops. It can affect all above ground parts of plants at any stage of growth. Symptoms may include leaf lesions followed by blight and necrosis, as well as lesions and cankers with red exudate on stems that can eventually girdle the entire stem, leading to wilting and yellowing of its leaves and vines. Seedlings and transplants may be girdled by lesions and collapse, or be so weakened by the infection that they are never productive. The fungus also causes black rot if it infects the fruits. GSB requires prolonged moisture to become established and consequently is a serious problem in regions of high rainfall and in glasshouse crops.

Spores may be seed borne or spread by air currents, water from rain or irrigation systems, or by mechanical means (including insect and human activities). The fungus can survive between growing seasons in an over-wintering structure, and wild cucurbits or volunteer crop hosts may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management may include crop rotation, phytosanitation (removal of inoculum sources and reservoir hosts), fungicides and use of certified GSB-free seed or transplants.

Two related species, _S. citrulli_ and _S. caricae_, also affect cucurbits with similar GSB symptoms, but they vary somewhat in host preferences and epidemiology. _S. caricae_ is the only GSB fungus that also affects a non-cucurbit host, papaya (_Carica papaya_).
