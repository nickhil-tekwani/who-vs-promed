[2] Samoa: vaccination campaign
Date: Wed 4 Dec 2019

https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/photos/measles-vaccination-campaign-as-of-04122019-as-of-2-december-2019-the-government/2794936057204065/


Measles vaccination campaign
----------------------------
As of 2 Dec 2019, the Government of Samoa is providing free vaccination for all Samoan's aged 6 months to 60 years, in an effort to stop the current measles outbreak.

This booster dose will provide a person with 95% lifelong protection against measles.

Vaccination provides the safest and best protection against measles.

Key Information for the public:
1. Priority group for vaccination -- 6 months to 4 years: those who most need to be vaccinated are infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. Our youngest Samoan's are the most at risk of suffering serious complications from measles, including death, and remain the least vaccinated age group. Parents and families must vaccinate their young children to protect them against measles.

2. People outside of the priority group (5 years-60 years): individuals in the other age groups are at a reduced risk of suffering severe measles, however, they are recommended to be vaccinated if they haven't previously received a measles vaccine or had measles.

3. Individuals who should not be vaccinated are individuals who
- have received a measles vaccine (MR or MMR [measles, mumps, rubella]) in the past 28 days;
- are a pregnant woman;
- have had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of a measles vaccine;
- are severely immunocompromised (such as people with HIV or leukemia, and those receiving chemotherapy or large doses of corticosteroids);
- have been diagnosed as having measles during the current outbreak. A person who gets measles is given lifelong protection against the virus.

4. Individuals who have received a booster dose of measles vaccine since [1 Oct 2019] should not receive another dose of measles vaccine.

Individuals and parents should discuss with the vaccination team if they have any concerns or questions regarding vaccination.

[3] Samoa: traditional healers

As Samoa struggles to deal with the deadly measles epidemic, people are still flocking to a traditional healer in desperation.

The Prime Minister of Samoa has threatened police will jail people who discourage vaccinations and promise healing by alternative methods.

But there is a long history of natural healers in Samoa, and not all of them are making wild claims about cures.

Traditional healer Maria Amituanai told Checkpoint she was trained by her mother 40 years ago. "The treatment is passed down through her grandparents," a customer who translated for Ms Amituanai said. "A traditional healer doesn't really go to university ... it's usually passed down through generations.

At Ms Amituanai's property, there have been many people with sick children, showing symptoms of measles, including rashes and watery eyes.

The traditional healer spreads a grainy paste over the children's bodies, derived from crushed plant leaves. She also spoons a liquid into the children's mouths.

She would not reveal what was in the mixture, as she did not want to give away her family's secret recipes.

[AF] visited Ms Amituanai, hoping to get treatment for her 1-year-old daughter. She said her 3-year-old son got better after the traditional healing treatment.

While the government has established a nationwide ban on gatherings with children, dozens of people are in close proximity at Ms Amituanai's property, and none are wearing face masks.

Recently an alternative healer using Kangen Water [alkaline water] was shut down by police. But Ms Amituanai told Checkpoint she was doing something very different.

"She is encouraging people to see the doctors as well, take medication the doctors are giving out," a customer said. "She is not discouraging any health sector or doctors from what they're doing, she's just lending out her helping hand in a time of crisis." Ms Amituanai said she was not deceiving people.

Debate over vaccination has raged in Samoa, ever since 2 children died on Savai'i last year [2018] after botched vaccinations. 2 of the nurses responsible are in jail.

But Samoans have practised traditional healing methods for generations. It is a challenge for health authorities as they gear up for 2 days of an immunisation push.

The government is fighting against other competing messages online were influential people from overseas are claiming vaccinations are not safe.

One Australian-Samoan blogger has likened the compulsory vaccination programme to Nazi Germany, while influential former rugby player Eliota Fuimaono Sapolu has claimed the vaccines are dangerous.

The World Health Organisation has directly linked anti-vaccination messages to the spread of measles worldwide.

Canterbury doctor Scott Wilson works at a hospital near traditional healer Ms Amituanai. "Alternative therapies -- mainstream medicine doesn't have a particularly strong view on them as long as they're not to the detriment of patients' care. So as long as people aren't being taken advantage of financially or being given false beliefs," he said.

"I would stress to parents, if they're running high fevers, they have signs of pneumonia, if there are signs of severe infections, they need antibiotics."

Ms Amituanai said she did not charge money for her treatment but said some customers who had the means, were making donations.

[4] Samoa: government closes

The Samoan government will temporarily close later this week to allow officials to focus on the country's growing measles outbreak, which has resulted in more than 3700 cases and in 53 deaths since October [2019], the Washington Post reported today [2 Dec 2019; https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/12/02/samoa-measles-deaths/].

Civil offices will be closed on [Thu 5 Dec and Fri 6 Dec 2019], Prime Minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi announced today [2 Dec 2019], as all public officials will be assisting in vaccination campaigns across the country.

Schools have already been closed since mid-November [2019] in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, which is hitting children the hardest; so far, 48 of the 53 deaths have been in unvaccinated children under the age of 4 years.

According to the Post, Samoa's measles vaccination rate has declined since 2013 and was 31% before the epidemic began. The outbreak was likely tied to international travel between Samoa and New Zealand, and fears over the vaccine grew in 2018 after 2 babies in Samoa died when their vaccinations were incorrectly mixed.

A vaccination coverage rate of 95% or higher is needed to prevent outbreaks.

Kiribati's Ministry of Health is closely monitoring the health of a 5-month-old boy and his family after the child showed symptoms of measles.

Director of Public Health Eretii Timeon told Radio Kiribati they were now waiting for the child's blood test results from Fiji.

In the meantime, his family had been advised to stay home while the baby was receiving treatment.

Mr Timeon said rashes on the child's body, including other symptoms, were slowly disappearing.

A measles taskforce team is closely monitoring the situation.

The ministry said it could not confirm its 1st case of measles until blood test results return from Fiji.

[6] Taiwan ex Thailand

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday [3 Dec 2019] reported a new measles case in northern Taiwan.

The new confirmed measles case is a woman in her 30s living in New Taipei City who has taken public buses and visited clinics and hospitals during the communicability period, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center Director Liu Ting-ping said.

The agency's preliminary estimate is that about 480 people had direct contact with the woman and would be monitored for symptoms until [Fri [13 Dec 2019], she said.

The woman visited Thailand from [7 to 16 Nov 2019]; she began experiencing the symptoms of fever, throat pain, rashes, and shortness of breath on [21 Nov 2019] and first sought treatment at a clinic on [22 Nov 2019], CDC physician Huang Wan-ting said.

She was diagnosed with a cold on her 1st and 2nd visits to a clinic for treatment, Huang said, adding that she on Monday last week [25 Nov 2019] sought treatment at a hospital, where doctors initially suspected that she had a urinary tract infection.

However, test results on [30 Nov 2019] confirmed that the woman had contracted measles, Huang said, adding that she remained hospitalized.

[see source URL above for locations of possible exposure.]

As the woman has asthma, the shortness of breath she experienced along with the onset of other symptoms, which are common indicators of measles infection, might have led doctors to misdiagnose her because the disease has not been spreading in Taiwan, CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said.

Measles is at its peak in Viet Nam, Indonesia, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries, so people who plan to visit the region should consult a doctor about receiving a vaccination in advance and inform doctors about their travel if they develop a fever or rashes after returning to Taiwan, he said.

Separately, 861 hospital visits for chickenpox were reported last week [week of 25 Nov 2019], more than the previous 2 weeks, and 16 cluster cases have been reported in the past 4 weeks, mostly on school campuses, Liu said.

Three new cases linked to outbreak in Samoa that has killed 60 and infected 4000

Qld headed for worst measles year so far in the 21st Century as 3 new cases are diagnosed

Three new measles cases -- linked to the outbreak in Samoa that has killed 60 and infected 4000 -- have been diagnosed in Queensland, taking the state's 2019 tally to 67, meaning 2019 will be the worst for diagnoses of the disease since 1997.

The 3 new cases, all from the one family, have been diagnosed by the West Moreton Hospital and Health Service.

Those cases are believed to be linked to the highly contagious virus being brought into Queensland by a person travelling from Samoa.

The Pacific nation's measles epidemic has been exacerbated by low vaccination rates.

Queensland's worst year for measles since 1997, when 267 people were diagnosed, was in 2014, when 72 cases were recorded.

But with the New Year still more than 3 weeks away, 2019 appears headed towards eclipsing 2014 as the state's worst year for measles in the 21st Century to date.
