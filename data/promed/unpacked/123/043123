A woman has died and over 200 people, mostly children, have been treated in
the hospital as a typhoid fever outbreak hit the northern town of Borbon
town 2 weeks ago.
Some of the victims were brought to the nearby Juan Dosado Memorial
Hospital in Sogod town, but the attending physician allowed them to go home
after examination. However, some had to be brought to the Vicente Sotto
Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City for treatment.
Borbon Mayor Neil Vergara told The Freeman that the lone fatality was a
resident of barangay Sagay, which is 75 kilometers from Cebu City.
There are reports of another fatality in the same barangay, but Mayor
Vergara said he still has to verify this. The mayor said most of the cases
were monitored in barangays Poblacion, Cadaruhan, Tabunan, Sagay, and Laaw.
Vergara said, in barangay Cadaruhan alone more than 100 cases were reported
to the municipal health office since last week. "Barangay Candaruhan is
worst hit, since the people there do not have toilets and they drink water
from an open well," said the mayor.
Renan Cimafranca, head of the Regional Epidemiology Unit of the Department
of Health regional office confirmed the outbreak of typhoid fever in
different barangays of Borbon town 2 weeks ago. According to Cimafranca,
they confirmed that the people suffered from typhoid fever after they found
_Salmonella typhi_, the bacterium which causes the disease, in blood
cultures of the patients.
However, Cimafranca said they are still waiting for the results of the
tests from water samples taken from the different artesian wells in the
town to pinpoint the source of the disease.

[A barangay is the smallest political unit into which cities and
municipalities in the Philippines are divided. It is the basic unit of the
Philippine political system, consisting of less than 1000 inhabitants
residing within the territorial limit of a city or municipality and
administered by a set of elective officials, headed by a barangay chairman
(punong barangay). - Mod.LL] [For location of Borbon see

clear. Classically, typhoid is not associated with much diarrhea but
rather a febrile, systemic illness. - Mod.LL]

3 people have died from suspected typhoid fever in the Nongoma area in
northern KwaZulu-Natal, the provincial health department said on Wed, 26
Oct 2005.
The 1st person died in September 2005 and the last one died on Sun, 23 Oct
2005, said departmental spokesman Desmond Motha. He said 6 people in the
area had fallen ill from suspected typhoid since September 2005. 2 were
currently being treated in hospital.
Besides the Nongoma cases, 7 people had fallen ill in the province between
March and September 2005. Motha said it would "take some time" before the
results of tests on the water system in Nongoma were known, as the cases
were not related.
There are sporadic outbreaks of typhoid and cholera in the province due to
some areas not having proper sanitation. KwaZulu-Natal sees around 20
cases of typhoid every year.

Cape Town has confirmed its 1st case of typhoid, but provincial health
authorities have moved quickly to urge people not to panic.
The Fish Hoek man has been treated and discharged from False Bay Hospital,
where he was isolated from Wed, 19 Oct 2005, and there are no signs that
the disease has spread.
Typhoid has rocked the Mpumalanga town of Delmas. The affected local man
visited Delmas several weeks ago on church outreach business.
Western Cape Health Department spokesperson Faiza Steyn said yesterday, 26
Oct 2005, that tests on the man had been conducted in Delmas when he first
fell ill. However, these had turned up negative for typhoid. However, the
disease has an incubation period of 10 to 20 days and, when the man
continued feeling ill, he was admitted to False Bay Hospital on 19 Oct 2005.
"His blood was then cultured and reported positive with typhoid fever,"
said Steyn. She added that the patient's isolation and all universal
infection control measures had immediately swung into place at the hospital.
