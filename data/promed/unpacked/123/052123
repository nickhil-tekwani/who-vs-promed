The WHO Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) detected suspected
acute watery diarrhea (AWD) cases in Baidoa (Bay). On 4 Dec 2007,
about 268 cases were reported including 10 related deaths. 3 out of 4
samples tested positive for cholera. WHO conducted an investigation
and mobilized a rapid response team to ensure mass chlorination of
drinking water in wells in Baidoa and surrounding villages where the
cases originated. While 6 samples sent to Bossaso tested negative,
one belonging to an 80 year old male from Luug in Gedo tested positive.

As of 30 Nov 2007, 81 cases of suspected AWD, including 3 related
deaths were reported in Luuq by the Gedo Health Consortium (GHC). The
cholera control committee is coordinating the response through daily
meetings. Response consists of chlorination and health education for
the affected population.

Between 24 and 30 Nov 2007, Lower and Middle Juba reported 114 AWD
cases from 3 different districts, with no related deaths. WHO
supported the local NGO Juba Foundation with the renovation of the
main drinking water well and the chlorination of 2 wells in Nafta-Qur
village in Jamame in close collaboration with Muslim Aid.

Food hawking has been banned in parts of Siaya District following an
outbreak of cholera in the area. The outbreak reported early this
week [3-9 Dec 2007] has led to 3 deaths, while 6 people were treated
and discharged. More than 46 people are receiving in-patient
treatment in different health centres in the district.

The Provincial Administration has also ordered the residents to dig
pit latrines and adhere to high standards of hygiene. The Siaya
medical officer of health, Dr Elizabeth Okoth said the cholera
outbreak was due to lack of clean water, failure to observe hygiene
and feasting in gatherings.

The Department of Public Health and Social Services is reporting a
cholera infection in a 6-year-old male child. The cholera infection
has been confirmed by a reference laboratory although biotype and
toxin production studies are not complete, according to
epidemiologist Robert L. Haddock of the DPHSS (Department of Public
Health and Social Services) Office of Epidemiology and Research.

The infected child and his family had traveled to Saipan for a family
event the weekend before becoming ill, Haddock said in the latest
Guam epidemiology newsletter. He said, however, that neither Guam nor
the CNMI (Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) has observed
an increase in diarrheal illnesses or detected additional possible
cholera cases.
