A stem rot disease in cardamom plants is currently resulting in huge losses in Wayanad district. Nearly 76% extra rainfall occurred this October [2021]. Following this, the plant stems turned yellow, leaves started drying and the plants slowly perished. No fruits emerged on diseased plants, not even on the ones which bloomed. Farmers are worried about the loss. Those who follow organic farming methods are unable to resist this disease.

[Small cardamom (_Elettaria cardamomum_, family Zingiberaceae), also called lesser, true, Malabar or green cardamom, is an Indian native growing in tropical areas. This is likely the crop referred to above. Large (or black) cardamom (_Amomum subulatum_) is native to the Eastern Himalayas growing in cool, moist forest areas. Other related crops in the family are ginger (_Zingiber officinalis_) and turmeric (_Curcuma longa_). All these crops are highly-priced spices and have similar cultural requirements.

A number of fungal and bacterial pathogens known to occur in the region (see previous ProMED posts below) can cause rhizome rots, wilts and leaf blights in these crops similar to what is being described above. Fungal species of _Pythium_ and _Fusarium_ are commonly reported as the cause of rhizome and soft rots of crops in the Zingiberaceae in India and the region. In Kerala, root rot, foliar yellowing, rhizome rot, panicle wilt and stem rot diseases of small cardamom were previously found to be caused by _Fusarium_ species (see links below). This may be the problem referred to above, but reliable diagnosis is always needed for the effective management of crop diseases.
