During a Heilongjiang disease monitoring survey, anthracnose has been reported on maize crops in more than 20 counties of the province. On average, 5%-10% of fields are affected, with disease incidence of 30%-40%.

Recent higher than normal rainfall and temperatures were conducive to the occurrence and spread of the disease. These conditions also favour other late season diseases of maize which are expected to occur this year 2020 to a greater extent than usual. All localities should continue monitoring and apply timely control measures.

[The report above appears to refer to anthracnose of maize. However, other diseases may also thought to be present in the crops.

Anthracnose leaf blight and/or stalk rot of maize can be caused by the fungi _Colletotrichum graminicola_ or _Glomerella tucumanensis_. The latter has also been reported as the cause of red rot of sugar cane and can also affect sorghum.

Fungi in these genera have been reported to cause anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops. The fungi have a long saprophytic survival ability on plant debris which can serve as pathogen reservoir. Spread may occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect activities), with wind and water. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions during the onset of flowering and early stages of seed/fruit development. Control of anthracnose usually centers on crop cultivar resistance and/or diligent fungicide programmes, but may also include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum, as well as cultural measures to reduce environmental moisture.
