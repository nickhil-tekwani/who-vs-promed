Responding to the story about isolating _Clostridium perfringens_ from a
dead dog, an ill dog, and the stool from an owner who also became ill ...
It should be noted that _Clostridium perfringens_ is part of the normal
bowel flora of both dogs and human, and that methods beyond isolation by
culture would be needed to identify the isolate as toxin-producing and
implicate it as the cause of any illness.
Infection with a type A clostridial toxin (common food poisoning) would not
likely cause overtly *bloody* diarrhea, while type C toxin - the cause of
"Pigbel" or enteritis necroticans, is uncommonly found in this country.
