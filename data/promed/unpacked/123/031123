Forgive my insistence, but I would like to stress again that the majority
of the cases reported as Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), in Central
America and I suspect in South America also, are clinical diagnoses only,
or at best a single positive serological test. Under these circumstances,
it is difficult to say there
are VEE cases going on. Low virulent VEE strains and vaccination make it
difficult to interpret serologic results, paired samples are rarely taken
and virus isolation seldom attempted.

[We take the point, but assume that the almost weekly reports from Colombia
are of cases of clinical encephalitis in horses. If they are not being
caused by VEE, what are they? We would welcome a reply from the labs
there. - Mod.JW
