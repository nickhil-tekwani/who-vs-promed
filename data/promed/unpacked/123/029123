A total of 2 farm workers died and 17 were admitted to the government and private nursing homes in the town when they reportedly consumed water from a farm well at Kella village under the Gurla police station limits.

The hospital premises witnessed heart-rending scenes on [Sun 3 Dec 2017].

The farm workers, including 8 women, were engaged in the paddy field of farmer [K.V.S.R.] on [Sat 2 Dec 2017].

After consuming water from the well in the field, 6 of them complained of giddiness and vomiting. They were rushed to the Gurla Primary Health Centre and later to the district headquarters hospital here late in the evening. The condition of 4 receiving treatment in private nursing homes was stated to be stable.

The remaining 13 workers also complained symptoms of giddiness on [Sun 3 Dec 2017] and had been admitted to the government hospital where their condition was normal.

Gurla SI S. Ravi suspected contamination due to spraying of pesticides on the paddy crop. A post-mortem report would reveal the exact cause, he said.

[There are very few symptoms mentioned except vomiting and giddiness. Yet, giddiness has several definitions: 1 - a sensation of whirling and a tendency to fall or stagger; dizziness or 2 - a state of excitable frivolity. If we consider giddiness as frivolity, then there are very few pesticides producing frivolity and vomiting.

However, if we take giddiness to mean dizziness, then other pesticides come to mind. But, if these are the only 2 signs, the possibilities become rather scant. We are only told of those 2 signs. Likely there were others which may have been ascertained by hospital staff.

Those 2 symptoms could fit a number of pesticides. But there would be other symptoms as well. Without more information, speculation could be quite wide.

There have been some other cases of pesticide issues in India were farmers are dying from inhaled pesticides. Some of the pesticides mentioned in some of these other cases involve Police and Polo.

Polo is diafenthiuron and phenylthiourea (http://news.agropages.com/News/NewsDetail---16693.htm) which are inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase according to some testing. It is toxic through inhalation and some data indicates it is acutely toxic. It can cause organ failure with repeated exposures. https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Diafenthiuron#section=Agrochemical-Information

Phenylthiourea can affect you when breathed in and by passing through your skin. Contact with it can irritate the skin and eyes. Inhalation can irritate the nose and throat. Breathing fumes of phenylthiourea can irritate the lungs causing coughing and/or shortness of breath Higher exposures can cause a build- up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), shortness of breath and is a medical emergency.

Consequently the combination of these 2 chemicals could cause the very symptoms these individuals seem have.

Police contains fipronil and imidacloprid.

Direct but short-term contact with skin of fipronil can result in slight skin irritation. When individuals have eaten fipronil, reported health effects included sweating, nausea, vomiting, headache, stomach pain, dizziness, weakness, and seizures. Signs and symptoms from a brief exposure to fipronil generally improve and clear up without treatment. http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/fipronil.html.

Once in the body, fipronil is found mainly in the fatty tissue, and breaks down into smaller chemicals called metabolites. Fipronil and its metabolites are then removed from the body mostly through the feces and also in the urine. However one must realize that metabolites can be toxic, and continued exposure can result in a build up of these products that cannot be eliminated quickly enough to avoid producing damage.

Farm workers reported skin or eye irritation, dizziness, breathlessness, confusion, or vomiting after they were exposed to pesticides containing imidacloprid.http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/imidagen.html Imidacloprid maybe consumed when fruit or vegetables are not washed or it is consumed off the hands when the unwashed hands are used to handle food or are placed into the mouth. Imidacloprid does not go through skin easily but it can cross the lining of the stomach and especially the intestine when it is eaten. Once it gets into the body, imidacloprid moves through the bloodstream to the whole body. Imidacloprid is broken down in the liver and then removed from the body in feces and urine.

The combination of all of these chemical these individuals are using, and the frequency of use, may also contribute contamination of the wells
