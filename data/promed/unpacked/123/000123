The post stated inter alia: "Until now the only means of aid to humans
subjected to the risk of infection is a timely injection of
anti-rabies immunoglobulin and the prescription of a therapeutic
immunization course."

Would it be worth pointing out the importance of cleaning any
suspected wound thoroughly with soap and water as soon as possible
after any possible exposure and that using soap is important. This
very simple piece of 1st aid is an important step to take, followed by
obtaining medical help as soon as possible. It doesn't replace it but
it is important and widely recommended. In many countries, obtaining
anti-rabies immunoglobulin and immunization may not be easy (or even
possible).

[Nick is correct, of course, and washing the wound is of proven
benefit. I apologise for missing the needed correction. - Mod.MHJ
