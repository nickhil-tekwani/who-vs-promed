State officials have revealed an 8th person has died following a Legionnaires' disease outbreak in western Illinois.

The Illinois Department of Public Health said that 4 new cases of the infectious disease in Quincy were not connected to an outbreak that has affected nearly 50 residents at a veterans' home in the city.

It comes as officials said 95 inmates at San Quentin State Prison in California were under observation for the disease.

Jerrod Welch, Adams County [Illinois] Health Department director, said that the 8th victim in Quincy was elderly and had underlying medical conditions. He warned that there could be more fatalities because the disease has a 2-week incubation period. As of Wednesday [2 Sep 2015], 49 people have become unwell in the city -- 45 of them at the veterans' home.

Experts at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said the outbreaks so far this year are not unusual, but the number of cases was larger than they typical amount.

The outbreak in Illinois was identified last week after an initial case at the home in early August [2015]. A team from the CDC is at the 129-year-old home to assist the state investigation.

Symptoms of Legionnaires' include breathing difficulties, coughing, fever and muscle aching. Infected patients are treated with antibiotics. It is usually contracted through inhaling bacteria from warm water -- including vapour from contaminated water systems.

Dr Nirav Shah, Illinois public health director, said that officials "do not believe there is an increased risk of Legionnaires' disease to the Quincy community."

The home, which has more than 400 residents, has cleaned its hot water tanks and air conditioning system and shut down drinking water fountains.

6 inmates at San Quentin State Prison have been confirmed to have the disease and are being treated at the medical unit on site. Officials have yet to determine the source of the outbreak, but hot evening meals have now resumed for inmates and all non-segregated inmates have been allowed to have showers.
