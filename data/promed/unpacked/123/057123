A one-year-old boy suffered a massive, oozing lesion on his butt after he had been infected with anthrax. An Indian research team reports that the boy was brought in for treatment 7 days after the lesion -- which was painless -- appeared on his left buttocks. It erupted rapidly in the coming days, growing and eventually becoming necrotic as the tissue surrounding the lesion died.

The boy was diagnosed with cutaneous anthrax, the most common form of the infection. It is the least deadly version of the condition but is still dangerous in its own right. It is often transferred to humans via interaction with a cow, goat, or sheep -- though this child had no known contact with an infected animal.

When this event occurred was not revealed by researchers from the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research, on the southeastern tip of the South Asian country. The case report was published Wednesday [17 Aug 2022] in JAMA Dermatology (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2795013).

The young child's lesion was painless, but 7 days after forming he was brought into a pediatric emergency department. Doctors report that it started small before "enlarging rapidly" and covering his entire left buttocks. Five days later, the lesion became necrotic, meaning that blood was having trouble flowing to the skin tissue, causing it to die and then decay.

Researchers described the lesion as "an oozing, violaceous, edematous plaque with central eschar and surrounding edema," effectively saying it was violet colored, swollen, and excreting pus. They did not detect any issue with the boy's lymph nodes, which is common in many anthrax cases. At this point, he suffered a fever as well, though it subsided after only 2 days.

Doctors were able to recognize his infection as cutaneous anthrax, a version of the infection that erupts via skin exposure. He was treated with the antibiotics ciprofloxacin and benzylpenicillin for 10 days before his symptoms improved. Researchers did not reveal how long he remained hospitalized or whether he made a full recovery.

Abstract
--------
A one-year-old boy was brought to the pediatric emergency department with complaints of a painless reddish skin lesion on the left buttock for 7 days. The lesion began as a small erythematous discrete papule, which became vesicular and enlarged rapidly. After 5 days, the center of the lesion became necrotic. The patient had no history of open wounds or prior trauma. He had a fever for 2 days initially, which then subsided; no other systemic complaints were noted. No other family member was affected, and there was no history of any contact with infected cattle or sheep. On examination, there was an oozing, violaceous, edematous plaque with central eschar and surrounding edema (Figure [see source URL]). No local lymphadenopathy, warmth, or tenderness was noted. A Gram stain from the eschar and vesicle fluid revealed the presence of large and thick boxcar-shaped gram-positive bacilli. A diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax was made, and the child was administered treatment with ciprofloxacin, 150 mg, twice daily, along with benzylpenicillin, 700 000 units, every 4 hours, for 10 days, after which the clinical symptoms improved.

[Anthrax, in whatever form, is very rarely seen in infants. There was one case among the 21 cases related to the 2001 anthrax letters. That and this came about by handling the infant with contaminated hands. In this India case, it was by a parent who had likely been handling contaminated meat from a butchered infected bovine carcass. The US case would have been from an adult who had been handling a spore-contaminated letter. The latter was a single lesion. This child had an infected buttock, which indicates a bloody hand.

This Indian child was successfully treated with repeated ciprofloxacin and benzylpenicillin over 10 days. Caught early, I prefer doxycycline for 3 days, as it quickly kills the _B. anthracis_. But the Indian child had a secondary infection.

This is a valuable report because it targets a dimension of this human disease that we can miss, that of secondary cases due to careless behaviour of the possible primary cases. And in a rural village, whether in Africa, India, Kazakhstan, or wherever, a farmer will butcher a sick or dead cow and give the meat to his neighbors and relatives and/or sell it in the local market -- one can perceive the possibility of infants being exposed. - Mod.MHJ
