Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) a disease which is fatal to rabbits and hares but of no risk to humans, has been confirmed in the wild in Ireland for the 1st time.

RHD causes death within a few days of infection, with sick animals having swollen eyelids, partial paralysis and bleeding from the eyes and mouth. In the latter states close to death, animals exhibit unusual behaviour such as emerging from cover into the open and convulsing or fitting before dying.

Irish domestic rabbits were 1st reported to have the disease in 2018, but it has now been confirmed in the wild from a rabbit in Co Wicklow and another in Co Clare. On [Fri 9 Aug 2019], a hare in Co Wexford was also found to be infected by the virus.

In all cases individual animals were tested at Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine laboratories where RHD2 was subsequently confirmed. The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is asking the public to report any suspected cases to them.

While all 3 locations continue to support apparently healthy wild populations, NPWS conservation rangers continue to monitor the situation.

The disease is highly contagious and can be spread directly between animals and in the faeces and urine of infected animals, as well as by insects and on human clothing. In addition, the incubation period may last several days and seemingly uninfected animals may in fact be carriers.

As a result, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has decided to suspend the licenses issued to the Irish Coursing Club to capture and tag hares for the 2019/20 hare coursing season with immediate effect until a clearer understanding of the extent, spread and implications of the virus emerges.

Dr. Ferdia Marnell, from the NPWS scientific unit, said this was concerning because rabbits are "central to wild ecosystems". "A decline in our wild rabbits will have numerous knock-on consequences. Of further concern is the potential for the disease to spread through the Irish hare population," he added.

Dr. Marnell stressed that the disease presents "absolutely no threat to human health and it is entirely safe to handle infected or recently dead rabbits or hares provided normal hygiene is followed".

Josepha Madigan, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, encouraged members of the public to report any suspected cases to the NPWS. "This is a serious development for the wild Irish hare and the decision to suspend the licenses issued to the Irish Coursing Club to capture and tag hares is in the best interests of animal welfare," Ms Madigan said.

"I encourage members of the public to report any suspected cases to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. While there is no threat to human health, experts advise that this disease is highly contagious among rabbits and hares, and I am acting on this advice," she added.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

RHD-2 is a variant form of the original RHD-1 virus and differs in the following ways.
- Rabbits infected with the RHD-2 virus typically DO NOT show the symptoms that are common with RHD-1 infection so it is far more difficult to diagnose from simple observations.
- Death from RHD-2 occur later and over a longer period of time than RHD-1: typically this is 3-9 days following infection and can last up to 5 days, instead of 2-6 days infection and lasting 3-4 days as generally observed with classical RHD-1. Although this is marginal it is important to note from a quarantine perspective.
- Only following post-mortem examination will initial diagnosis be possible, however further tests are required to definitively confirm RHD-2 which is now recommended for unexplained deaths.
- In mainland Europe, RHD-2 is now very common particularly in France where it was 1st identified in 2010 and spread country-wide where it was mainly transmitted through the wild rabbit population with cross-over with domestic rabbits. In Italy it has not spread very wide given the differences in wild rabbit population density. A research study has been published that describes the proliferation in RHD-2 in France since 2010 and of relevance to the current situation in the Great Britain and Ireland.
- RHD-2 is a genetically and antigenically different from RHD-1, and the immunogenic differences occur at the serotype level, for which vaccination against both variants is needed.

These viruses, which have been circulating in pet rabbits, have now reached wild populations in Ireland. The impact of this pathogen in these populations is a concern for the conservation of wild rabbits. Continued surveillance should be implemented to assess this impact.
