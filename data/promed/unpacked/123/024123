CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections linked to contact with pet hedgehogs.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. WGS performed on _Salmonella_ from ill people in this outbreak showed that [the isolates] are closely related genetically. This means that the ill people are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 27 Mar 2019, 17 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium have been reported from 11 states.

State / Ill people
Colorado / 1
Iowa / 1
Maine / 1
Minnesota / 3
Mississippi / 1
Missouri / 3
Nebraska / 1
Texas / 1
Virginia / 2
Washington / 1
Wyoming / 2
---------
Total / 17

Illnesses started on dates from 22 Oct 2018 to 1 Mar 2019. Ill people range in age from 2-95 years, with a median age of 13 years, and 53% are female. Of 14 people with information available, 2 (14%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. Of 15 people interviewed, 13 (87%) reported contact with hedgehogs before becoming ill. Ill people reported buying hedgehogs from various sources, including pet stores, breeders, or online.

The outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium was identified in samples collected from 8 hedgehogs in Minnesota, including 3 hedgehogs from 2 ill patients' homes. A common supplier of hedgehogs has not been identified. Regardless of where hedgehogs are purchased, these animals can carry _Salmonella_ germs that can make people sick. Hedgehog owners should always follow steps to stay healthy around their pet.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information becomes available.

[A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceidae, in the Eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are 17 species of hedgehog in 5 genera found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. A number of outbreaks of human salmonellosis have been linked to contact with these animals. - Mod.LL
