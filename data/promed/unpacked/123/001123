Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) continue to work
closely on efforts to control the exotic Newcastle disease (END) outbreak
in Southern California. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has
instituted a quarantine zone that serves as a buffer around the
END-affected area in southern California. The department has also declared
an extraordinary emergency to provide additional resources and authorities
to the eradication campaign for END in southern California.
The disease was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002 and has now spread beyond backyard
flocks to affect 4 commercial operations. Clinical signs in infected birds
include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal signs. Mortality is up
to 90 per cent of exposed birds. Investigations are ongoing, and all
figures are pending final validation. Veterinary Services (VS) is working
to rapidly expand staff on the task force and is exploring all options to
send APHIS and other federal government personnel and to work with the
state on considering additional resources to meet the labor demands.
Situation update (From California's 5:00 pm PST, 11 Jan 2003, report):
Number of premises positive: 339 (up 16 per cent from 10 Jan report)
Number of dangerous contacts: 848 (up 3 per cent from 10 Jan report)
Number of premises depopulated: 749
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 438
Birds depopulated to date: 155 495 (approximate)
Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, San
Diego,Ventura
Operational Update (as of 1:00 pm EST, 13 Jan 2003):
Of the 1187 premises designated for depopulation, 63.1 per cent have been
completed.
Four commercial flocks have been confirmed with END in Riverside, San
Bernardino, and San Diego Counties, CA. California governor, Gray Davis,
declared a state of emergency in the fight against the END outbreak in
California. The emergency declaration will enable state agencies to pool
resources and work cooperatively with CDFA in addressing the response to
the incident.
Effective 7 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates the
interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa
Barbara, and Ventura counties, CA. USDA has declared an extraordinary
emergency. The extraordinary emergency allows USDA to apply federal
authority within the state of California.
VS has worked with the US Postal Service to affirm that poultry will not be
able to move out of the quarantined areas through the mail.
State and animal health officials are conducting door-to-door surveys to
identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are following up on
epidemiological associations.
To date, depopulation, cleaning and disinfecting, and carcass disposal are
being conducted by CDFA and APHIS. CDFA has closed all poultry exhibits,
fairs, and expositions within the state of California's quarantined area.
Affected and exposed poultry are being euthanized and double-bagged. Task
force members are disinfecting the bags and transporting the carcasses to
restricted landfills for burial. Local commercial table egg layer birds and
spent-hen movements have been halted within the quarantined areas.
