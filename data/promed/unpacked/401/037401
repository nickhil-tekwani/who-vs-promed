[1] Outbreaks near Windsor and Queen's dairy herd
Date: 1 Oct 2007

Foot-and-mouth disease was last night [30 Sep 2007] threatening the
Queen's dairy herd of Jersey cattle at Windsor, as the government
confirmed an 8th outbreak in Surrey.
Cattle owned by Nigel Berryman, a Crown Estate tenant who farms in
Datchett, across the river from the Royal Home Farms, are to be
slaughtered today [1 Oct 2007] as dangerous contacts with infected animals.
A total of 161 cattle on 4 farms, including Mr Berryman's animals on
Englefield Green, Surrey, are to be culled after confirmation last
night [30 Sep 2007] of the 8th outbreak at Ankerdyke Farm, Wraysbury.
For the moment, his cattle at Southwood Manor Farm, Datchett, will be
spared, but will be subject to intensive inspection and testing.
Nevertheless, the sensitivity of Mr Berryman's position as a close
neighbour to the Queen was not lost inside the government.
A spokeswoman at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs insisted that no special measures to protect the Queen's
animals had been requested by the Royal Household.
A senior farming source said it was inconceivable that the Queen
would intervene to try to overturn current regulations and ensure the
vaccination of her animals while other farmers were suffering the
loss of their herds. However, a number of local veterinary surgeons
believe that the Queen should now take a stance and insist on the use
of vaccination.
This latest case of foot-and-mouth has delayed the return of meat
exports to the Continent from low-risk disease areas of Britain for
at least 2 weeks. There was relief that the 8th case of
foot-and-mouth remained inside the surveillance zone.
Farmers across the country are also alarmed by the possible spread
westwards of bluetongue virus from Suffolk to the East Midlands,
though last night [30 Sep 2007], there were still only 11 cases and
no confirmation of bluetongue outside East Anglia.
The desperate situation for many farmers fighting disease on 2 fronts
has prompted Gordon Brown to sanction an urgent aid package. Among
the options under discussion are: cash to fund a marketing offensive
to persuade consumers to buy British lamb that cannot be exported; a
public procurement scheme to buy up meat for use in hospitals,
schools, prisons and to feed military personnel; extra cash for hill
farmers; easing of red tape for pig and poultry farms; speedy
development of a bluetongue vaccine; and funding for a collection and
disposal scheme of animals killed by bluetongue. Hilary Benn, the
Rural Affairs Secretary, is to work on the details with farmers'
leaders this week.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Executive has agreed a separate welfare
package to slaughter and incinerate 250 000 lambs and to pay farmers
GBP 15 [USD 30] compensation for each animal. However, Defra and the
Treasury are refusing to fund such a scheme. Ministers and farmers'
leaders in England believe that the scheme is unpalatable and will
offend public opinion.

[2] Foot and Mouth update: FMD Risk Area reduced
Date: 1 Oct 2007
Source: DEFRA News Release [edited]
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/071001f.htm>

Defra has today [1 Oct 2007] announced that Kent, Essex, East Sussex,
Southend, Thurrock, Medway, Brighton and Hove will be removed from
the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) Risk Area. From midnight tonight,
these counties will fall within the FMD Low Risk Area and be subject
to the movement controls that apply in this area. This decision
follows a veterinary risk assessment revealing no evidence of
movements of FMD susceptible animals to, or have cause to suspect FMD
in, those counties. Areas remaining within the FMD Risk Area are kept
under constant review.
This decision means that livestock keepers in these areas will be
able to move animals from farm to farm. Pigs will also be allowed to
move an unlimited distance. The control measures in place within the
Bluetongue Protection Zone remain unchanged.
Also, the latest epidemiology report published last week concludes
that the risk of disease spread outside of the Surrey Protection and
Surveillance Zones is very low. Therefore, based on the overall
assessment of risk, Defra is today [1 Oct 2007] standing down
vaccination teams from their current level of alert. Teams could be
remobilised again in 5 days, if needed.
It remains essential for animal keepers to practice the highest
standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant for disease and report any
suspicions immediately. Livestock owners should examine their cattle
twice a day.

[3] Temporary Control Zone - border of East and West Sussex

Foot and Mouth Disease update: Temporary Control Zone established on
the border of East and West Sussex.
A 3-km Temporary Control Zone has today [1 Oct 2007] been put around
a premises near Haywards Heath on the border of East and West Sussex.
This is a precautionary measure following a veterinary assessment of
clinical signs. Laboratory tests are ongoing, and there is no
timetable for receiving these results.
It remains essential for animal keepers to practice the highest
standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant for disease and report any
suspicions immediately. All livestock owners should examine their
livestock twice a day.

[Location and timing are of course key elements of attempts to
eliminate any disease in animal populations, and this is especially
true for a very tricky, easily spread virus such as FMD.
A map of the temporary control area near Haywards Heath can be seen
at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/pdf/declaration-tcz011007.pdf>.
Also, it appears as if large areas of the Essex, Kent and other areas
in the eastern part of the country will be removed from the FMD Risk
Area. While progress is always appreciated, the decision described in
the news release appears to indicate that this decision is based on
last week's epidemiology report and assessment of risk. However, we
have had a temporary Control Zone announced today [1 Oct 2007] and a
new infected premise -- the 8th location -- reported yesterday. One
wonders whether standing down the vaccination teams might be a bit
premature, and the 5 day time gap, if vaccination were adopted, would
be costly. Clearly, this outbreak is threatening to spread, and it is
difficult to be confident that it will not spread extensively. On the
other hand, there may be few or no more infected premises; only time
will tell. - Mod.PC]
