[It is very good to continue to see negative reports from Thailand. It is
also encouraging to see a huge reduction in number of new districts
reporting and birds involved in Indonesia, down from 29 districts and 2
million birds in the 4 Mar 2004 OIE report. One might be tempted to
conclude that the battle has been won and only a few more weeks of cleaning
up is needed. The report from Viet Nam tells us "not so" loud and clear.

We have numerous examples in animal populations (Rinderpest in West Africa,
Brucellosis in the United States, etc.) in which the end stage of the
eradication program is the most difficult. Intense surveillance efforts
are required, there are problems with false positive diagnostic tests, and
a tremendous pressure to loosen the reigns on animal movement accrue. All
this is in the face of inexperienced or non-technical individuals who are
chaffing at the bit to get out from under the economic burdens of the
eradication program. Given the potential for new strains to evolve, all
necessary encouragement should be provided to countries in East Asia for
the maintenance of the infrastructure for the eradication programs. It is
best to extinguish this outbreak now, rather than let it smolder. However,
really putting the fire out takes time, money, energy and -- most of all --
patience and tenacity. - Mod.PC]
