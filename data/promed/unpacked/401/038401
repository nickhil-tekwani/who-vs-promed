[HPAI H5N1 has been circulating in Viet Nam since 2003. In February 2019, "Viet Nam has officially kicked off a USD 34.6 million national program for controlling avian influenza between 2019-2025. The objective is to control the spread of avian influenza; actively monitor for early detection; and early warning as well as solutions to prevent and tackle outbreaks. It also sees the establishment of safe poultry epidemic zones in accordance with OIE standards; contributing to minimizing the negative impact of avian influenza on Viet Nam's public health, food security and commercial activities, as well as creating favorable conditions for export of poultry products." (https://asian-agribiz.com/2019/02/25/vietnam-launches-avian-influenza-control-program/).

Currently, HPAI H5N6 is also circulating in Viet Nam. Since January 2020, 16 outbreaks have been reported. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=33160. - Mod.CRD
