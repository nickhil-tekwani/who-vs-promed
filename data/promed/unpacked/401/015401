- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2018 is 3.
- The latest case had onset of paralysis on 18 May [2018], from Dukki district, Balochistan province.
- 3 new WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported in the past week. All samples were collected on [10 Jul 2018], 1 in Islamabad province, 1 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and 1 in Punjab province.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- 4 WPV1 cases were reported in Nigeria in 2016, and no cases have been reported in 2017 or 2018. The most recent WPV1 case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno State, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- Since confirmation of cVDPV2 in Nigeria, virus has been isolated from environmental samples and 2 cases with onset of paralysis on [15 Apr 2018] and [16 Jun 2018]. The most recent case was detected in Geidam LGA in Yobe State.
- 2 cVDPV2 positive environmental samples detected in Sokoto State have been confirmed, following advance notification last week. The samples were collected on [5 Jun 2018] and [12 Jun 2018].
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country has conducted additional acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response and plan the October [2018] sub-national immunization activity.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria continues to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- Preparations continue for cross-border synchronized immunization activity in October [2018].

Central Africa
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- The country is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in the DRC in 2018 is 7.
- The geographic extent of the outbreak response to all 3 strains is being reevaluated, given the confirmed spread of 1 of the strains to Ituri and confirmation of the 3rd strain in Mongola. The risk of further spread is magnified given the proximity of Ituri to Uganda and known population movements between affected areas.
- The Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, remains fully committed to outbreak response in the affected provinces, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) across the country, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia is reporting a total of 4 cases (with a total of 5 viruses) in 2018: 1 cVDPV type 2, 2 cVDPV type 3 and 1 case with both cVDPV type 2 & type 3, with date of onset of the most recent case on 26 May 2018.
- Outbreak response to both strains is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria.
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].
- In an effort to heighten population immunity against type-2 among high risk populations, more than 5000 children aged 2-23 months have received inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in newly accessible areas of eastern Ghouta. In addition, a total of 33 836 children under 5 years of age have received bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). 23 vaccination teams were deployed between March and May 2018 through fixed centres and mobile clinics that also provided other routine immunization.
- WHO has supported further upgrades to the Syrian National Polio Laboratory to improve poliovirus diagnostic capacity. Seven national technical staff were trained on intratypic differentiation of poliovirus samples, which will allow for more comprehensive testing and faster identification of results.
- All empty and expired unopened vials of monovalent oral polio vaccine type-2 (mOPV2) have been destroyed according to global guidelines under the direct supervision of WHO staff in country.

Papua New Guinea
- Papua New Guinea officially launched the outbreak response campaign on [16 Jul 2018] in Morobe, Madang and Eastern Highlands provinces. Three more campaigns are planned for August, September and October [2018].

[2] Uganda, no cVDPV - Relief Web/WHO
Date: 27 Jul 2018
Source: Relief Web/WHO [edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/no-vaccine-derived-polio-outbreak-uganda


In response to allegations made in the UN Reporter concerning the spread of a vaccine derived polio outbreak in Congo to Uganda, The Ministry of Health and The WHO Country Office in Uganda would like to point out the following:

1- There hasn't been a wild polio case in Uganda since November 2010. However, the Democratic Republic of Congo has reported cases of vaccine derived polio close to the border with Uganda.

2- Like any polio-free country, Uganda maintains a high routine immunization and sensitive surveillance against importations and against vaccine-derived virus until polio is completely eradicated.

3- Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus. VDPVs are strains of poliovirus which emerge after prolonged multiplication of attenuated strains of the virus contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the guts of children with immunodeficiency or in populations with very low immunity. After prolonged multiplication, this vaccine virus derived strain changes and reverts to a form that can cause paralysis in humans. Some VDPVs have shown a capacity for sustained circulation in communities if the population immunity against polio is low in that community. Low coverage of polio vaccine under routine immunization is the single most important factor that leads to the emergence of VDPVs.

4- OPV is extremely safe and effective at protecting children against lifelong polio paralysis. OPV has been the vaccine of choice for over 195 countries, Uganda inclusive, that have successfully eradicated polio. It remains the Global Polio Eradication Initiative's (GPEI) recommended vaccine of choice to finish global eradication. More than 10 billion doses of OPV have been given to more than 2 billion children in the past 10 years.

5- As part of the polio endgame strategy, countries around the world, including Uganda, switched from trivalent to bivalent OPV, which reduces the risk of VDPV, and introduced at least one dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in the routine immunization programme.

6- Polio eradication can be achieved with continued global commitment and support from all country governments.

[The above global update report is noteworthy for the confirmation of previous advanced notifications: the WPV1 associated polio case in Afghanistan and the cVDPV2 isolates from environmental samples in Nigeria. Other noteworthy information includes the continued isolation of WPV1 from environmental samples in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The media report from Uganda is a confirmation from Uganda that, up till now, there have not been any cVDPV-associated cases diagnosed in Uganda, in the face of a case of cVDPV identified in Ituri, Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the border with Uganda.

My question is whether we are really approaching the end of polio as a disease threat globally, or will mother nature pull another surprise package on us, further delaying eradication of the polioviruses causing human disease?
