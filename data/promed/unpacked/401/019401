There is growing concern among livestock farmers in Svay Rieng province after a mystery disease struck more than 100 cows and buffaloes. Residents in Chantrea district said the disease killed at least 19 animals since Tuesday [31 May 2022].

A district veterinary official said an officer was dispatched to the area to investigate the disease.

On Wednesday [1 Jun 2022], Sok Daro, the director of Infectious Disease Monitoring Office, led a team of officials to find out what caused the outbreak. They visited Koh Kban Khang Cheung village in Samrong commune and suggested measures to livestock owners to prevent the spread of the disease. They also sprayed chemicals to disinfect areas that reported the outbreak and collected samples from the sick animals.

Local people said the disease affected 44 cows and 54 buffaloes.

Pov Thyda, an official with the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries of Svay Rieng Province, said that sick buffaloes and cows bought at a low price could be the source of the infection.

Paen Chanty, a veterinary official said that change in weather conditions and unvaccinated animals could have carried the infection from the fields.

Veterinary officials have urged the people to get their livestock vaccinated as it protects them from diseases for up to a year.

[According to another media source, the described event started several weeks ago; during the mentioned recent visit of experts, led by Dr Sok Daro, samples were collected from 2 sick animals and "the lungs of 2 dead animals were examined and diagnosed" (https://www.rfa.org/khmer/news/health/cattles-disease-spread-in-svay-rieng-province-06022022050133.html; in Khmer).

Urging the owners to vaccinate their animals and the observation that "unvaccinated animals could have carried the infection from the fields" may mean that an infectious disease affecting cattle and buffalos is suspected. Other etiologies, infectious or otherwise, cannot be ruled out at this stage in view of the scarce available information.

Details of the gross pathology changes in the examined lungs which may have been recorded, details of the clinical signs, and other epidemiological data such as age distribution will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
