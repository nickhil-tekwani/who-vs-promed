HIV, hepatitis fears over dirty instruments
-------------------------------------------
Hundreds of people face an anxious wait after a failure in procedures
at a Queensland hospital led to fears they may have contracted HIV
[human immunodeficiency virus] or hepatitis [virus infection].
Authorities are contacting 274 people who were patients at the
Bundaberg Hospital dental health clinic between 6 and 13 Nov 2009
because of the scare.

Sunshine Coast-Wide Bay Health Service infectious disease physician
Dr David Sowden said one load of dental instruments cleaned on 6 Nov
2009 was not subjected to the final steam sterilisation process. But
he said the cleaning process that was undertaken, which included
detergent and an ultra-sonic cleanser, would have reduced the risk of
contamination considerably. "If there were blood-borne viruses
present at the onset of cleaning, the risk of transmission to a
subsequent client at the clinic is considered very low for hepatitis
B [virus] and extremely low for hepatitis C [virus] and HIV," he said.

Authorities have successfully contacted 31 of the 33 patients on whom
the instruments were used prior to the problem occurring. "Urgent
contact with the final 2 patients is currently being sought," Dr Sowden said.

Dr Sowden said these patients have been asked to provide their
medical histories and have all agreed to undertake a blood test. None
have indicated they have a blood-borne disease and the 1st of the
test results should be known from Friday [20 Nov 2009]. Queensland
Health is offering testing for any of the 274 patients who visited
the clinic after the problem occurred.
