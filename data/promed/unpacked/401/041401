2002/080 First report of Tomato chlorosis crinivirus in Morocco
----------------------------------------------------
In Morocco, tomatoes grown under protected conditions [have been subjected
to infection by] ... Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine
pest) and Cucumber yellow stunting disorder crinivirus (EPPO Alert List)
[since] ... 1998 and 1999, [respectively]. In 2000, Tomato chlorosis
crinivirus [ToCV] (EPPO Alert List) was [recorded] for the first time. ...
These invasive species are now complicating the IPM programmes currently
used in tomato production.
ToCV ... is now widespread in protected tomatoes grown in the Souss Valley,
[east of Agadir], where it caused serious damage in 2002. ... Severity of
symptoms and damage [ranged] ... from mild to very severe, [depending on
tomato cultivar].
The situation of Tomato chlorosis crinivirus in Morocco can be described as
follows: Present, found for the first time in 2000, widespread on protected

[There should be concern about possible spread of ToCV by its whitefly
vectors (_Trialueurodes vaporariorum_, _T. abutiloneus_, and _Bemisia
tabaci_) from glasshouses to tomato fields in the Souss valley. _Datura
stramonium_ and _Solanum nigrum_ are natural hosts of ToCV as well as being
preferential hosts for the whitefly vectors. Solanaceous weeds and other
species may be significant in maintaining the virus in the wild between
cropping seasons. If the vectors and their natural hosts are present
year-round, eradication of the disease from affected areas is likely to be
impossible. - Mod.DH]
