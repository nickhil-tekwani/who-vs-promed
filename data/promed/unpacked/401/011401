Across [British Columbia], hazelnut farmers are ripping out their crops before burning or chipping their dead trees to remove the Eastern filbert blight that has frozen the industry's production in all but a few farms.

Farmers like Canadian Hazelnut Inc., the largest organic hazelnut producer in Canada, are not expected to plant any seedlings this year [2015]. Manager Shelley Krahn [said that] the blight had been around for some years, but only in the last few seasons have crops really been hit hard. "We had approximately 7000 trees," she said.

A breeding program out of Oregon -- where the disease in B.C. came from -- has developed EFB-resistant [crop varieties]. These have only been tested on 6 farms locally. A farmer said he had 300 of the traditional variety of trees die on his farm, but the 650 EFB-resistant trees were left unscathed. "They're a better quality, even," he said. "They are a smaller tree; they produce a heavier crop, and they have more uses, for example, for oil and butter."

[Eastern filbert blight (EFB) caused by the fungus _Anisogramma anomala_ affects known hazels (_Corylus_ spp.; cultivated hazels also called filberts) to different degrees. It originates from eastern North America where it is a minor pathogen of indigenous hazel species but started killing off highly susceptible introduced hazel species (such as European hazelnut, _C. avellana_) when they were planted commercially. The fungus causes cankers on branches and trunks which lead to twig necrosis, branch dieback and general loss of plant vigour. Infected seedlings may be stunted and show leaf necrosis. It may take up to 2 years for symptoms to appear on infected plants. For highly susceptible hazel species, EFB can kill trees within a few years and has destroyed large areas of orchards in the eastern USA. Since the 1970s, it has spread to the west coast of both the USA and Canada.

EFB is spread within orchards by splashing rain and with infected plant material over long distances. Infected nursery stock or grafting material carry a high risk of spreading the pathogen to new areas. Wild hazel species serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management may include orchard sanitation and plant hygiene measures. Chemical control is being trialled. Use of certified clean planting material is essential. The considerable genetic diversity in the genus _Corylus_ is being used in developing hazel cultivars for commercial plantings which are resistant to EFB (as mentioned above).
