The Scottish Executive yesterday banned the slaughter of seals because of a
virus threatening their numbers. The order, signed by Ross Finnie, the
environment minister, means fishermen are forbidden from culling the seals,
which they claim attack fish stocks.
Experts fear it is only a matter of time before a fatal outbreak of phocine
distemper (PDV), already killing common and grey seals on England's east
coast, comes north. Since PDV struck in Scandinavia this year [2002], 5500
common seals have washed ashore in Denmark and Sweden. The virus has since
crossed the North Sea and 361 corpses were found on beaches around The Wash
in August 2002.
The virus last hit Scottish waters 18 years ago when it wiped out around 20
000 seals. Scotland is home to 47 per cent of the European common seal and
89 per cent of the grey seal population. Mr Finnie said: "Our scientific
experts advise that the disease could have similar effects this time
around. We therefore need to act now in order to protect these potentially
vulnerable species."
His order extends existing controls on killing, injuring, or capturing
common seals around Scotland and grey seals in the Moray Firth, and takes
immediate effect. But the minister said he was also aware of the concerns
of the fishing industry over the damage caused by seals and will keep the
controls under review.

the seal population. - Mod.TG]
