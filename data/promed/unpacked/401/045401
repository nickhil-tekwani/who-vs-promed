[The new LSD outbreak in the Tambov oblast situated less than 500 km (approx. 300 mi) south-southeast of Moscow, presents another leap of the disease west-northwards in the Russian Federation (RF), following the previous leap into the Voronezh oblast, in August 2016 (20160820.4429724).

LSD first incursion in the Russian Federation was observed in July 2015 in Daghestan Republic at the border with Georgia and Azerbaijan, continuing in Chechnya and South Ossetia. The disease recurred in May 2016 in Dagestan and since then has affected 14 other administrative divisions, spreading north, east, and now north-westwards. Since its re-emergence in May 2016, the LSD virus has caused 280 new outbreaks. For a map presenting them, including the most recent, furthest north outbreak, in the TAMBOV oblast - please see
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=20252.

The advance of the virus in the RF currently threatens Ukraine. Preventive vaccination seems to be the main effective way to stop its further spread during 2016's vector season; this should be combined with zoosanitary measures such as restrictions on animal movement from infected regions.

Another region in Europe in which LSD has been spreading rapidly since August 2015 is the Balkans, initially Greece into which the virus was introduced from Turkey.
