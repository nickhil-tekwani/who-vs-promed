Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in Canada
---------------------------------
See also: 15 Aug 2003
Emergency report
Information received on 6 Jan 2005 from Dr Brian Evans, Executive Director,
Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa:
Date of the report: 6 Jan 2005.
On 17 Dec 2004, a private veterinarian reported a "downer" cow and took
samples as part of the surveillance programme for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy that focuses on 4Ds: diseased, dying, down, and dead
animals, at the farm level.
Rapid tests were performed at the provincial TSE(1) Laboratory in Edmonton,
Alberta, and confirmed by immunohistochemistry at the National Centre for
Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD), Winnipeg, Manitoba.
The carcass was held and did not enter the human or animal food chain.
As a result of an ongoing investigation, the herd of origin has been
identified in the province of Alberta and a birth date of 5 Oct 1996
establishes the birth as prior to the 1997 ruminant feed ban. The cow was
resident in the birth herd until 1999 and did not calve in 2004.
Restrictions have been placed on the birth herd pending completion of the
tracing of birth cohorts and 2003 progeny.
(1) TSE: transmissible spongiform encephalopathy

[This animal is 8 years old, and the geographic location of its herd of
origin is Alberta, the same province as the 1st Canadian BSE case and the
herd of origin of the single U.S. case. Such epidemiologic details tend to
reduce the level of concern over this 2nd case of BSE in Canada. Canada
already has in place several risk mitigation measures such as the removal
of specified risk material (SRM) from the human food chain, a
ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban, a national surveillance program, and import
restrictions. See information on BSE at CFIA's website:
<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/heasan/disemala/bseesb/situatione.shtml>
OIE defines a minimal risk country as having had fewer than 2 cases per
million cattle over the age of 24 months. There are 5.5 million cattle in
Canada in this older age group and this is the 2nd case, so the USDA will
continue to move forward on its recent ruling allowing the importation of
young cattle, thereby lessening the economic impact of this new case on
Canadian agriculture. The good surveillance techniques put in place by
Canadian animal health officials appear to be effective. - Mod.PC]

Statement By Dr. Ron DeHaven Administrator, Animal & Plant Health
Inspection Service, 7 Jan 2005:
"The U.S. Department of Agriculture is working closely with the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency in their investigation of the Canadian dairy cow
that recently tested positive for BSE. This investigation is focused on
identifying birth cohorts -- animals born in the same herd within one year
of the affected animal. The preliminary investigation has shown that one of
these birth cohorts was imported into the United States in February 2002
for immediate slaughter. USDA, in collaboration with FDA, is currently
tracing the disposition of this animal and will provide further details as
the investigation evolves.
Even at the height of BSE infection in Europe and the United Kingdom, it
was extremely rare to have more than one animal in the same herd affected
with BSE, therefore USDA believes it is extremely unlikely that this
imported cow would have been infected. Nevertheless, as was the case in May
2003, when Canada had its 1st case of BSE and a small number of birth
cohorts were traced to the United States, USDA will make every reasonable
effort to obtain and provide information about the disposition of this
animal as well as any other birth cohorts that are traced to the United
States through Canada's epidemiological investigation.
USDA and FDA have had a strong program in place for years to protect the
U.S. livestock population from BSE. Import controls on live cattle and
certain ruminant products from countries at high risk of BSE were put in
place more than 15 years ago. In 1997, both the United States and Canada
finalized animal feed bans, which are the single most important safeguard
to prevent the spread of the disease through the cattle population. Public
and animal health in the United States and Canada have also been protected
through ongoing surveillance efforts and inspection of animals at slaughter
for neurological signs, and now by the removal of specified risk materials
from the human food supply.
USDA also continues the enhanced BSE surveillance program that began in
June 2003. To date, more than 170 000 targeted animals have been tested for
BSE. All samples have been negative."
