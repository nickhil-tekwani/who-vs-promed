Swine enteric coronavirus, Ecuador
----------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 9 Sep 2014 from Dr Diego Alfonso Viscaino cabezas, Ingeniero Agronomo, Ministro de Agricultura, Ganaderia, Acuacultura y Pesca, Ministro de Agricultura, Ganaderia, Acuacultura y Pesca, Quito, Ecuador

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 20 Jul 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 9 Sep 2014
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Morbidity: 9/12.2 percent
Mortality: 9.56 percent
Zoonotic impact: No
Causal agent: Swine enteric coronavirus

New outbreaks: 1
Summary of outbreaks Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak cluster 1: Cotopaxi, San Buenaventura, Latacunga, Cotopaxi
Date of start of the outbreak: 20 Jul 2014
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 10 908 / 1341 / 1043 / 0 / 512
Affected population: A farm of commercial type; the affected animals were piglets at least 10 days old.

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / 12.29 percent / 9.56 percent / 77.78 percent / 14.26 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive; contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering; swill feeding; fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc).
Epidemiological comments: Following the notification of an atypical mortality occurring mainly in piglets of 10 days old on average, the official service put into effect the health measures established in the contingency plan for porcine epidemic diarrhea: quarantine measures on the farm, reinforced control of animal movement, movement control towards other areas of the country, biosecurity measures on farms of all kinds and epidemiological surveillance at national level. The laboratory for animal health diagnosis carried out the molecular tests and genetic sequencing of the causal agent is ongoing. AGROCALIDAD is updating the case definition.

Control measures
Measures applied: Stamping out; quarantine; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); dipping/spraying; no vaccination; treatment of affected animals (supportive care)
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal Health AGROCALIDAD (national laboratory) / Swine / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 9 Sep 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The following information was obtained from the USDA-APHIS-VS "Case Definition for Swine Enteric Coronavirus Disease," updated on 5 Jun 2014 (http://tinyurl.com/m84qulr):

"Novel swine enteric coronavirus disease (SECD) is a disease in swine caused by emerging porcine coronaviruses, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV). SECD is characterized by an acute, rapidly spreading viral diarrhea of pigs; no other species are known to be affected and it is not a public health threat. Pigs develop varying degrees of diarrhea and inappetence depending upon age of the pig infected.

Etiologic agent: PEDV and PDCoV are members of the family Coronaviridae. Coronaviruses are divided into 3 known genera: Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus. A 4th genus, Deltacoronavirus, has been proposed. PEDV is an Alphacoronavirus and PDCoV is a Deltacoronavirus. Coronaviruses are positive-sense, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. Different strains of PEDV exist with virulence dependent upon the spike (S) gene sequence. Virological information about PDCoV is limited.

Distribution: PEDV was 1st reported in the United States in 2013 and quickly spread throughout the country. PEDV has also been reported in Canada and Mexico and is suspected in Central America, Colombia, Peru, and the Dominican Republic [Note: see ProMED reports 20140616.2544899 and 20140611.2532426. - Mod.CRD]. PEDV is thought to be widespread throughout most regions of Western and Central Europe and Southeast Asian countries, including China and Japan. PEDV is currently a source of concern in Asian countries, where outbreaks are often more acute and severe than those observed in Europe. Severe outbreaks with high mortality are typically rare in Europe, but recently have been commonly reported in Asia. China has seen a large increase in outbreaks since 2010, and the emergence of new strains has been attributed to this increase. PDCoV was 1st reported in China in 2012. It was subsequently detected in the United States in early 2014, followed by detections in Canada. PDCoV has not been reported in any other countries.

Clinical signs: Severity of disease caused by PEDV is variable and dependent on the age and epidemiologic status of the herd. The primary, and often only, clinical signs are acute watery diarrhea and vomiting. PDCoV is thought to cause disease similar to PEDV, but to date, no conclusive studies have proved this.
- Endemic herd: Persistent diarrhea in recently weaned pigs.
- Naive herd:
-- suckling pigs: vomiting, acute watery diarrhea, loss of appetite, dehydration, and metabolic acidosis with mortality typically between 50 and 80 percent.
-- feeder and grower pigs: clinical signs are variable and range from inapparent infections to diarrhea, anorexia, and depression. Mortality is low (1-3 percent) when present."

The following information was provided by Dr. Javier Vargas, Animal Health director, AGROCALIDAD: "Ecuador has in place a resolution on porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) -- 'Resolution DAJ-2014276-0201.0212' (http://www.agrocalidad.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/resolucion0212PED.pdf). This resolution provides the legal support to institute health measures that would help prevent the introduction and spread of PED in the country, including a contingency plan against the disease. This particular outbreak appears to have been controlled, and all clinically affected animals have been destroyed." [See information in the epidemiological comment section in this report.]

We thank Dr. Vargas for providing this useful additional information related to this event.
