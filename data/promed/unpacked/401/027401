7 cases of Alkhurma flu [sic] no cause for alarm
------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has confirmed 7 cases of the Alkhurma
hemorrhagic influenza in Makkah [Mecca] and Najran, but this was not
cause for alarm, according to Health Minister Dr Abdullah Al-Rabeah.
He said that there was a high rate of recovery from the flu even
though there is no specific medicine to treat sufferers. [It is
unfortunate that these cases are designated "flu", because Alkhurma
virus is a flavivirus totally unrelated to influenza virus.
Designating it as "flu" only serves to confuse the public. - Mod.TY]

Al-Rabeah was speaking in Riyadh Sunday [31 Jan 2010] at the launch of
an international scientific workshop being held to formulate a plan to
counter the Alkhurma disease. Also present at the event was Dr Fahd
Balghunaim, minister of agriculture.

Al-Rabeah assured the public that there was no need to be concerned
because there has only been a limited number of people afflicted with
the disease since 1994.

He said the workshop was being held in terms of royal directives to
take preventive measures against the disease. "The ministry and
related authorities have taken many preventive and precautionary
measures against the Alkhurma disease," he said. Al-Rabeah said that
joint committees and working teams consisting of experts from the
Kingdom and abroad have been formed to develop a national plan for
countering the Alkhurma hemorrhagic flu.

The teams would determine the epidemiological characteristics of the
disease, the way it is transmitted, and develop methods of combating
and controlling the disease and preventing it from spreading.

In his speech, Balghunaim dealt with the support the leadership
provides to the health sector. He said the participation of the
Ministry of Agriculture in efforts to counter the disease was a
national duty.

Dr Ziyad Meimish, assistant undersecretary of the Ministry of Health
for Preventive Medicine, gave a brief history of the disease. Then the
participants were divided into working groups to discuss the national
plan.

The Alkhurma virus is passed on to humans by ticks that live on
animals such as sheep, goats, and camels. Pets such as cats and
rabbits can also carry the ticks.

Preventive measures include wearing gloves when handling raw uncooked
meat. Also, livestock should be checked periodically to ensure that
they are free of ticks. Suitable insecticides should be used to kill
the insects [ticks are not insects. - Mod.JW] on the animals.
Furthermore, people should not drink unpasteurized milk [since related
flaviviruses can be transmitted through the milk of infected
livestock. - Mod.JW].

[The number of cases of Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF) has increased
from 4 to 7 in the past 2 months. The dates of the 3 recent AHF
infections are not indicated in the report above. The previously
reported 4 recent cases of AHF were linked to last year's Hajj and
diagnosed in the post Hajj period (late November/early December 2009).
The date of exposure (22 Nov 2009) to the risk factor -- the
slaughtering or processing of slaughtered sheep -- was shared by all 4
cases (see the report from Drs Shamsudeen Fagbo, Ziad A Memishand, and
colleagues in ProMED archive no. 20100123.0254).
