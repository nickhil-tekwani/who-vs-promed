----------------------------------------------------------------------
As has been typical of these prion diseases, speculation about
possible mechanisms and routes of transmission of CWD abound.

I too cannot recall solid evidence for retention of infectious PrP in
soil (but I may have missed it). There has been speculation about
'lateral' transmission amongst deer that congregate around winter
feeding stations based upon what I interpret to be quite compelling
epidemiological data, and speculation that retention in soil
at/around these sites has been one potential mechanism for spread. I
also cannot claim to be terribly conversant with the data relating to
rates of excretion of PrP from the body by infected cases, but was
vaguely aware of some claims in that regard.

Contact by ingestion of tissues from gut piles sounds to me like a
very plausible mechanism for spread. Crows, maybe not quite so
significant. For other TSE's PrP's can be found at comparatively low
levels quite early in the course of infection within the
lymphoreticular tissues of the tonsils and gastrointestinal tract
(relative to those reached in central nervous tissues). It has long
been postulated that they occur and develop in these tissues after
exposure via ingestion of contaminated food before they gain entry to
the central nervous system and develop there.

I have encountered ruminants feeding on the gut and carcasses of
fallen ruminants before, but usually only when there have been quite
significant mineral deficiencies in the surrounding
pastures/environment and the feeding animals exhibit a strong
specific salt hunger. In a couple of places in Australia with very
poor soils, cattle feasting on the rotting carcasses of fallen cattle
has been involved in quite significant botulism outbreaks. Bone
chewing is, however, much more common due to often severe phosphorus
deficiency (or Ca-P imbalance or both) and it too has been strongly
implicated in a great many botulism outbreaks. Solutions include
vaccination (not possible for any of the TSE's) and appropriate
mineral supplementation to reduce and control the specific salt
hunger. I therefore wonder whether salt/mineral supplementation may
be practically applicable to deer management to reduce feeding on gut
piles, or whether it may have an undesirable opposite effect by
attracting deer to congregate around supplementation stations and,
thereby, add to perceived lateral transmission risks and/or rates.

Given the nature of the infectious form of PrP, the way that it
appears to initiate infection and infection appears to develop within
the body of susceptible mammalian hosts, I still wonder whether or
not some gut or decomposition microorganisms (or insects or worms,
etc.) might be capable of harboring and/or amplifying and/or
transmitting the PrP from generation to generation and, thereby, be a
potential vector for apparent lateral spread amongst deer who
associate in communal groups and/or a vehicle for retention of the
PrP at potentially infectious levels within soil.

[Dave Thomson makes a good point regarding cattle eating carcasses
when they are mineral deficient. In the wild cervid population, that
has not (yet) been shown. We have not yet found botulism in cervids
consuming gut piles. It has been shown on various videos of wild deer
consuming gut piles, as well as a video on the net some years ago of
a deer raiding a bird's nest and consuming the eggs. It is quite
possible the various cervid populations are more carnivorous than we
have previously believed.

New Zealand is advanced in cervid medicine and perhaps a cervid
medicine person would be able to comment on the mineral deficiencies
vs consumption of gut piles. - Mod.TG]
