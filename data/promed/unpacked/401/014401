Bluetongue in the UK, 2008 -- an update
---------------------------------------
I have been requested by ProMED-mail to update interested parties on
the current status reference to bluetongue in the UK. I can confirm
that, as of 14 Oct 2008, we have had no evidence of BTV-8 circulation
in the UK. Throughout the 2008 transmission season in the UK we have
received many 'report cases' for testing at IAH [Institute for Animal
Health] Pirbright in which bluetongue has been suspected on clinical
grounds, however, none of these have been confirmed by laboratory testing.

The vaccination programme in the UK has been voluntary and the
take-up by the farmers has been good, especially in the areas where
disease was present in 2007. It is clear that high levels of vaccine
coverage (greater than 80 percent) have been achieved in the
high-risk areas where BTV-8 was circulating in 2007. The early
availability of significant amounts of vaccine (around 10 million
doses were delivered by the end of May 2008) that enabled the animals
to be protected before transmission commenced, combined with a high
level of vaccine coverage, is likely to be the major reason for the
lack of clinical cases in the UK in 2008. The challenge we now have
is to maintain the vaccination momentum into 2009 and beyond, which
will be vital in order to support possible eradication of BTV-8 from
the UK in the longer term.

We have however recently imported animals from continental Europe
into various parts of the UK that have tested positive by both PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] and ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay] for BTV-8 in post-import tests. Many of these imported animals
were in the early stages of infection and had both high levels of
viral RNA as well as viable virus circulating in their blood. At the
present time we have no evidence that onward transmission of BTV has
occurred from these imported animals and we hope that we may be saved
by the high levels of vaccine coverage and the cold British autumnal
weather, as these animals were imported late in the year at a time
when temperatures have been relatively low.

[We are grateful to Dr Oura for the above firsthand update. The
reported absence of new, locally acquired BTV-8 infections within the
UK during 2008 is encouraging. Let us hope that this situation will
be maintained throughout the remaining months of 2008.

The situation in France is less fortunate. As of 10 Oct 2008, 19 006
cases of BTV-8 and 2933 cases of BTV-1 have been recorded as the
outcome of viral circulation in 2008. 40 cases of the BTV-1 and BTV-8
cases were recorded within the same herds. A week earlier, as of 3
Oct 2008 (see ProMED-mail 20081009.3204), the figures were,
respectively, 17 257, 2750, and 14. Further updated information from
France, including a map updated 10 Oct 2008, showing all French
outbreaks accumulated during 2008 is available (in French) at
