[A major FMD serotype A outbreak was reported from Egypt in February 2006,
spreading to 9 of Egypt's governorates: Alexandria, Behera, Cairo, =20
Dakahlia, Dumyat, Fayum, Ismailia, Kalubia and Menofia. Samples were =20
tested by the FAO/OIE Reference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright; the =20
isolates were found to belong to serotype A.

Reportedly, this was an African strain. Pirbright lab's quarterly =20
report, April-June 2006, included the following commentary: "FMDV =20
type A that was reported for the first time in Egypt in February 2006 =20
has affected a large number of cattle before locally produced =20
homologous vaccine could be produced. Based on serological vaccine =20
matching tests, none of the existing vaccines stored as antigens in =20
the EU and UK vaccine bank look suitable to protect against this =20
strain, but the Merial vaccine A Eritrea 98 appears to be suitable".

No outbreaks were reported from Egypt during 2007; in Jan 2008, one =20
outbreak, caused by FMDV serotype O was reported from Al-Iskandariyah =20
governorate. In 2007, FMDV serotype A was reported from Jordan; this =20
was not similar to the Egyptian (African) 2006 strain but to A Iran =20
2005.

According to information obtained from a reliable source, the strain =20
eventually found to confer protection against the Egyptian FMDV =20
serotype A (2006) strain is vaccine strain A 4165. It will be of =20
importance, for all countries in the region, to note if the FMD =20
serotype A virus, currently active in Egypt, is similar to the 2006 =20
strain; if a homologous or other serotype A vaccine (such as A-4165) =20
is applied in Egypt; and if the said vaccine is found to confer =20
satisfactory protection in the field.

According to Egypt's 1st semiannual report for 2008, the vaccination covers
cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and camels.- Mod.AS]
