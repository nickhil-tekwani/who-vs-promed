The potato plants on vast tracts of land have come under attack with fungus and the attack has turned into an epidemic almost beyond resistance. The yield has come down to half in comparison with previous years [and this] has frustrated the growers.

According to [the] Agriculture Extension Department (AED), 1850 hectares [4571.5 acres] were brought under potato cultivation in Faridpur district in the current [2016/17] season. The condition of plants in the initial stage was good. But inclement [weather] has generated fungal disease affecting the potatoes. The growers could not resist the epidemic.

[A considerable number of potato diseases due to fungi and other pathogens have been reported from the region. In particular, late blight of potato and tomato (PLB; caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_) is rife in the country and the region.

A current outbreak of PLB in Bangladesh is being reported from the neighbouring Rajshahi division (ProMED-mail post 20170115.4767829), and this may be the disease referred to above. However, reliable diagnosis is essential before effective management strategies can be designed for the affected areas.
