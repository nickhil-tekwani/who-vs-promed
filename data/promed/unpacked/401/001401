EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE - WEST AFRICA (158): URGENT CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS
*******************************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
http://www.isid.org

[ProMED is brought to you through the good auspices of ISID, the International Society for Infectious Diseases, based in Brookline, Massachusetts, USA. Now ISID has been asked to spread the call for volunteer clinicians to go to West Africa to coordinate isolation units and supervise local staff in their care for patients with EVD.
We start with an e-mail from the hot zone. - Mod.JW]

Re: International Society of Infectious Diseases (ISID) request for how they can help
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The situation in Freetown [Sierra Leone] is rapidly deteriorating as there simply aren't enough isolation beds to contain suspected or confirmed cases. The country's 2 treatment centres are full so we are unable to refer confirmed cases out of isolation units to free up space. As a result suspected cases are now staying at home in their communities -- this will quickly lead to an exponential increase in cases. At Connaught (the government's main referral hospital) today [9 Sep 2014] our isolation unit is full with adult and paediatric cases and we have suspected cases in the waiting area and emergency room that we can't isolate -- I don't know how much longer the hospital will be able to stay open in these circumstances.

King's is working to urgently set up new isolation units and train local staff. We're working round-the-clock trying to set up a new unit every 48 hours, but we are the only partner undertaking this work and we simply won't be able to keep up with demand.

What we most need right now are international clinicians willing to come out and volunteer to help coordinate these units and supervise local staff in the larger isolation units. We can train them here [Freetown] when they arrive. If anyone can help advertise volunteering opportunities in the USA or UK that would be hugely helpful. The international response to the outbreak remains virtually non-existent, in terms of actual impact on the ground.

Dr Lewis Rubinson (cc), the incoming WHO doctor in Kenema, was delayed in transit in Guinea from Paris and his baggage was misplaced; however, hopefully he arrives in Freetown [Sierra Leone] today [9 Sept 2014]. He is aware of the WHO-Geneva announcement that the WHO doctor he is replacing in Kenema has tested positive for Ebola...You perhaps know more in Freetown...

Last evening [8 Sep 2014] I was fortunate to be able to talk with 3 senior persons in the International Society for Infectious Diseases ISID), a large global organization of clinicians. They asked what they can do as an organization to help in some way with the EVD crisis.

One of the 3 suggestions I made was to contact persons like yourselves in West Africa who are directly involved with the crisis, and ask you for your ideas on how they can help.

Dr Larry Madoff of ISID and Editor of the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED-mail) is copied here, and he or his colleague (Dr Britta Lassman) will contact you.

Already Larry, Jack Woodall, and ProMED have posted on ProMED-mail letters by 3 of you: Noa Freudenthal and Sara Hommel (29 Aug 2014) [archive no 20140829.2735183] and Vanessa Wolfman (31 Aug 2014) [archive no 20140831.2738054]. Perhaps the Connaught team would want to post a communication from Sierra Leone.

My 2nd suggestion to ISID was to work with the US CDC to advertise and endorse the new Ebola PPE [personal protective equipment] and treatment training course that CDC will offer 22-24 Sep 2014 in the state of Alabama (not as hot as Sierra Leone but good simulation for wearing PPE there). My understanding is that the training will be for volunteers who then are interested in either coming to West Africa and/or forming an 'Ebola response team' for their own US hospitals. I anticipate the official CDC announcement today (9 Sep 2014) about this program.

My 3rd suggestion to ISID was to contact directly other organizations globally and their leaders, to share ideas on how to respond and help during this long-lasting EVD crisis. For example, the head of Public Health England (PHE), Dr David Heymann (cc), who worked during multiple EVD outbreaks in Africa such as the initial one in 1976, and was himself a leader in the response to the 1995 Kikwit outbreak. (He also led the WHO global response to SARS). PHE also has sent physicians to Freetown, such as Dr Emma Aarons (cc) who worked in mid-August 2014 initiating the PPE training for the MOH in the auditorium near the Sports stadium. Emma, Dr Jattu Navo, Joseph, Doris (all from Sierra Leone), and I together helped train about 160 nurses and doctors in 9 days.

Andrew Hall from King's College London (KCL) has by now likely trained the same number of persons at Connaught hospital by himself over the past 2+ weeks. Marta and Oliver have trained many people at Connaught before they have gone into work in the Ebola Testing and Isolation Unit.

Yesterday [8 Sep 2014] I received from MSF the contract to go to Liberia for 6 weeks, departing Washington DC on 28 Sep 2014 and finishing in Monrovia on 10 Nov 2014. Let's stay in contact in the coming days and weeks and interact with colleagues wherever they might be in the world who are willing to help.

As Oliver says the situation on the ground in Freetown is near unbelievable with international response/rhetoric not translating into boots on the ground. Now I'm back in London and we have treated a case here; we were talking about the different resources we had available. What first registers is not the availability of ZMapp, or the ability to measure viral load and blood parameters, but the sheer volume of staff we had available to treat one patient versus the exceptional job that Oliver and the team are doing to both work clinically and operationally, given such limited human resources. That they have managed to stay afloat is a testament to their professionalism, but as Oliver says they urgently need help.

I've spoken a lot over the past weeks to ID fellows in the UK who want to contribute but feel they can't get time off given constraints with their rotas [schedules]. As this call will go to many senior physicians, that is, the leave granters, rota coordinators, and powers that be, could we include a line urging them to do whatever they can to facilitate anyone in their employ who wishes to volunteer to be relieved from clinical commitments.

[For a harrowing report from the field by an international physician who has returned from Sierra Leone's only pediatric hospital, read http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-doctor-shares-story-of-ebola-encounter-in-sierra-leone-a-990464.html

They had 150 beds, 3 children to a bed, being treated for malaria and other diseases, but had to close the hospital last month (August 2014) and send the sick children back home when they discovered one of them had EVD. - Mod.JW]
