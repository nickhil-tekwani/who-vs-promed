Fusarium wilt threatens canola
---------------------------------
A little known fungal disease of canola (_Brassica napus__, oilseed rape
and _B. campestris_, turnip rape), that first appeared in Alberta in 1999
is now appearing in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba this year.
Pathologists say the increase in Fusarium wilt appears to be due to a rare
combination of dry weather and susceptible cultivars, but it is not
expected to become a perennial scourge like sclerotinia or black leg.
"When you have a heavy year for sclerotinia, there are a lot of fields
infected, and so the total yield loss across the country can be huge," said
Ralph Lange, a pathologist with the Alberta Research Council and an expert
on Fusarium wilt. So far that has not been the case.
Jack Lesanko, who farms near Sturgis in east-central Saskatchewan seeded 60
acres to cv. Pioneer 45A55, an Argentine canola with a high-yield potential
in the black soil zone. He said that the crop looked good all season until
early September 2002, when plants that had podded out suddenly wilted.
Thom Weir, the Saskatchewan Agriculture agrologist at Yorkton, Sask., said
he has had reports of 30 infected fields in the area so far. He said that
the majority of them appear to be of one variety. He has seen adjoining
fields where one was significantly damaged and the other virtually
untouched, depending on the variety seeded.
According to Lange, there is a range of resistance and susceptibility in
existing cultivars and the industry must start to develop screening
protocols. He expects a full program can begin in a couple of years to
select resistant cultivars for use in canola breeding programs.
Lange said that _Fusarium avenaceum_ and _F. oxysporum_ are involved in the
disease. Both are widely found, but _F. oxysporum_ is coming to the
forefront. The disease is exacerbated when canola plants are under moisture
stress.
Currently there is no way to control the disease and variety selection
appears to be the only solution.

[Canola yields can be severely reduced by other pathogens such as
_Leptosphaeria maculans_,which causes blackleg, _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_
(wilt), and _Rhizoctonia solani_ (root rot). Disease management involves
use of adequate rotation with other crops (once in 4 years) and planting of
resistant cultivars. Perhaps our Canadian readers may have some estimates
on yield losses. - Mod.DH]
