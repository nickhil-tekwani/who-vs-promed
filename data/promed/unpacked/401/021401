Japanese encephalitis, a mosquitoborne disease, has killed 78 people in 8
districts of eastern Assam since April [2009] and the health department has
sounded a high alert to check its spread, an official said on Friday [28
Aug 2009]. A health department spokesperson said close to 1000 people have
been affected by the disease.

"We have alerted health officials across the state to take preventive
measures to stop Japanese encephalitis [virus] from spreading to newer
areas," Parthajyoti Gogoi, a senior health department official, said.

The disease, transmitted from pigs through mosquitoes, strikes during the
peak [mosquito] breeding period from April to September. Encephalitis
causes inflammation of the brain tissue, producing symptoms of high fever,
headache, rigidity of the neck, loss of voice, and involuntary movement of
the body.

Authorities in some areas have conducted an encephalitis immunisation
drive, besides fogging and spraying mosquito repellents to kill the
vectors. "People in Japanese encephalitis prone areas in the age group of
one to 15 should take vaccination available at all government hospitals."
Gogoi said, adding: "Prevention is the best way of dealing with Japanese
encephalitis."

[If the above figures are laboratory-confirmed Japanese encephalitis (JE)
cases, the numbers have increased significantly since the 26 Aug 2009
report (cited in ProMED-mail archive number 20090827.3015). The situation
in Assam and Uttar Pradesh is not clear currently, as there have been a
large number of "acute encephalitis syndrome" cases of suspected
enterovirus etiology in this area, which substantially exceed the numbers
of JE cases. ProMED-mail archive number 20090827.3015 reported, "In Assam,
according to the Government of India, 109 AES cases were reported from
July-August 2009. Of these, 33 were JE cases, of which 10 adults and 5
children (all unvaccinated) died. Non-JE AES samples are being tested at
the Regional Medical Research Center to determine other etiologies, and
results are expected soon."
