Hepatitis A cases in Hawaii climb to 241
----------------------------------------
The number of hepatitis A cases in Hawaii has reached 241, up 13, nearly 6 per cent, over the past week, state officials said today, 31 Aug 2016. The outbreak appears to have passed its peak, with the pace of infection slowing since the source was identified in August 2016 as contaminated scallops and they were pulled from the market.

The Health Department releases the total number of cases each Wednesday. Last week's [24 Aug 2016] total of 228 cases was nearly an 11 per cent increase over the previous week. So far, 64 people have been hospitalized as a result of the infectious liver disease.

The hepatitis A virus has a long incubation period, from 15 to 50 days after exposure. So cases will continue to appear even though people are no longer consuming the tainted product.

Health department officials traced the outbreak to frozen scallops contaminated with hepatitis A that were imported frozen from the Philippines and served raw at Genki Sushi restaurants on Oahu and Kauai. Those restaurants were closed on 15 Aug 2016 and the scallops were recalled by their importer, Sea Port Products Corp, of Kirkland, Washington, shortly afterward.

Hepatitis A is usually spread when a person ingests even microscopic amounts of human fecal matter through food, drink or other objects. A vaccine is effective in preventing the disease, and thorough hand-washing after using the toilet and before eating can help stem its spread.

[Since many cases of hepatitis A are subclinical (no symptoms) or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of hepatitis A infections in this already large outbreak is likely to have been much higher.

It is interesting that scallops have been implicated, since most of the time it only suggests that more than the adductor muscle was ingested (that is, the whole scallops, including the gastrointestinal tract) and that whatever was eaten was not cooked. If the whole scallop was not ingested, then contamination of the adductor muscle occurred during processing from the other parts of the scallop or from a food handler or water source.

The adductor muscle of scallops is larger and more developed than that of oysters, because they are active swimmers; scallops are in fact the only migratory bivalve.
