Another 15 outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) have been reported in farmed pigs and wild boar in Russia.

In total, 12 cases were reported in wild boar.

In farmed pigs, 31 cases were reported out of a total susceptible population of 284 pigs. The 10 affected farms are located in villages in [the oblasts (provinces) of Moscow, Penza, Tambov, Lipetsk, Saratov, Ryazan, and Vladimir].

[The locations of the 15 new ASF outbreaks in 7 provinces ("oblasts") in the center of European Russia, as well as relevant epidemiological statistics, are included in Russia's follow-up report no. 98, submitted to the OIE on 22 Jul 2016. The report, with an interactive map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=20526.

Since the start of the continuing ASF event in Russia, reportedly on 14 Jan 2014, a total of 276 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE. Their relevant accumulated statistics (from OIE/WAHIS archive), as of 22 Jul 2016, are as follows:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
(domestic) Swine / 221 129 / 3465 / 3062 / 216 708 / 0
Wild boar / not available / 726 / 528 / 266 / 0

The economic impact of the event, including the destruction of nearly 220 000 pigs, remains to be calculated.

For a map showing all ASF outbreaks in eastern and south-eastern Europe since its initial introduction, most probably by sea transport into Georgia in June 2007, please see OIE's map at http://tinyurl.com/jor5zwm (click on the cluster, zoom in). - Mod.AS]
