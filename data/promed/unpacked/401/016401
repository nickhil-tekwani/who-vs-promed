An outbreak of [an intestinal infection due to] norovirus at Palmerston North Hospital has prompted tight controls on movements in and out of ward 24. MidCentral District Health Board chief medical officer Kelvin Billinghurst said the virus had spread rapidly in the ward, but at this stage, it appeared to be contained.

There were 4 suspected cases and one confirmed case in the general ward. A total of 14 staff members were unwell with possible symptoms. The ward stopped admitting new patients on Tuesday [13 Jul 2021]. Only patients who could go to their own homes were being discharged. They would not be transferred to other wards or to residential care facilities.

The only visitors allowed in would be one designated support person for each patient, unless there were exceptional circumstances, which would need to be discussed with the charge nurse. Visitors had to use hand sanitizer on the way in and out of the ward and after patient contact. Staff were wearing gowns and gloves when they touched patients.

The source of the outbreak was not known, while the Infection, Prevention and Control team was working with the Public Health Unit and staff on strategies to make sure the virus did not spread. Billinghurst said norovirus was highly infectious and could spread in many ways, such as consuming contaminated food or drinks, or contact with an infected person. It could survive on contaminated surfaces even after cleaning with some disinfectants.

Common symptoms included vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pains. Most people recovered quickly, but it could be serious for some people, particularly if they became dehydrated. Children, the elderly, and people with weak immune systems were more likely to be seriously ill.

[It is not clear how the virus was introduced into the ward, but it appears that most of the cases are in staff and not patients.

The 1st sign of norovirus is usually a sudden sick feeling, followed by forceful vomiting and watery diarrhea. Some people may also have a raised temperature (over 38 C/100.4 F), headaches, stomach cramps, and aching limbs. Symptoms usually appear 1 or 2 days after exposure to infection, but they can start sooner. Most people make a full recovery within a few days. Apart from the risk of dehydration, the illness is not generally dangerous, and there are usually no long-lasting effects from norovirus infection.
