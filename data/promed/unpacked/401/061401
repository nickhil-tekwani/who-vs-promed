FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN MALAWI, Suspicion
(Date of last previously reported outbreak: 1986).
Emergency report
Text of a fax received on 29 October 1998 from Dr Chinthu B. Chizonda,
Director of Animal Health and Industry, Ministry of Agriculture, Lilongwe:
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 25 October 1998.
----------------------------------------------------
Location No. of outbreaks
------------------------------------------------------------
around Simion Chawinga dip tank, 1 (seven corrals)
Karonga district (09o 43' S - 33o 52' E)

Total number of animals in the outbreak:
----------------------------------------
susceptible 30
cases 16
deaths ...
destroyed ...
slaughtered ...
Diagnosis:
----------
The affected animals showed clinical lesions typical of FMD. The necessary
samples have been collected and are being despatched to Botswana Vaccine
Institute and the OIE World Reference Laboratory for FMD (Pirbright
Laboratory, United Kingdom) for confirmation.
Mode of spread:
---------------
It is highly likely that this outbreak is an extension of an FMD outbreak
reported in August 1998 in a neighbouring country.

[On following up on the discreet hint, I checked all the recent OIE reports
and there are none for this part of Africa this year. Karonga is in
northern Malawi, facing Lake Malawi. From the map reference given Chawinga
may well be close to the north/south M1 highway which becomes B3345 in
nearby Mbeya Province in southern Tanzania, raising the possibility that
this might be an extension from that country, maybe via marketed cattle. -
