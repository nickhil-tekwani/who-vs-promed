Highlights
- In the reporting week 41 (7-13 Oct 2019), 5 new confirmed cases were reported from Edo (2), Ondo (2), and Bauchi (1) states with no new deaths. [A confirmed case is any suspected case with laboratory confirmation. from positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation.]
- From 1 Jan-13 Oct 2019, a total of 4099 suspected cases have been reported from 23 states. Of these, 726 were confirmed positive, 19 were probable, and 3354 were negative (not a case). [A suspected case describes any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either (a) a history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents or (b) a history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms, or any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.]
- Since the onset of the 2019 outbreak, there have been 154 deaths in confirmed cases. Case-fatality ratio in confirmed cases is 21.2%.
- 23 states (Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Plateau, Taraba, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Kwara, Benue, Rivers, Kogi, Enugu, Imo, Delta, Oyo, Kebbi, Cross River, Zamfara, Lagos, and Abia) have recorded at least one confirmed case across 86 local government areas [LGAs] - Figure 1.
- 93% of all confirmed cases are from Edo (38%), Ondo (30%), Ebonyi (7%), Bauchi (7%), Taraba (6%), and Plateau (5%) states - Figure 1.
- Predominant age group affected is 21-40 years (range: greater than one month to 98 years; median age: 34 years) - Figure 6.
- The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1 - Figure 6.
- In the reporting week 41, no new healthcare worker was affected. A total of 19 healthcare workers have been infected since the onset of the outbreak in 10 states: Edo (6), Ondo (4), Ebonyi (2), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1), Benue (1), Delta (1), Plateau (1), and Kebbi (1), with 2 deaths in Enugu and Edo states.
- A total of 10 patients are currently being managed at various treatment centres across the country: Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) Treatment Centre (9) and Federal Medical Centre, Owo (1).
- A total of 8392 contacts have been identified from 21 states. Of these, 360 (4.3%) are currently being followed up, 7955 (94.8%) have completed 21 days follow-up, while 12 (0.1%) were lost to follow-up. A total of 132 symptomatic contacts have been identified, of which 65 (49.2%) have tested positive.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate response activities at all levels.

[The 5 new confirmed and 4099 suspected cases (up from 4019 suspected cases in the report of week ending 6 Oct 2019 indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing. Nigeria should be in the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3 (at the source URL above), but more cases are still occurring. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again next year (2020).

The number of confirmed deaths remains the same at 154 over week 40 (30 Sep-6 Oct 2019) reporting period. Fortunately, there are no new healthcare workers infected during this reporting period, and the total number of infected healthcare workers remains at 19, a likely indication that effective barrier nursing and the use of personal protective equipment are being employed. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 23 states, and the number of affected LGAs remains at 86. ProMED-mail readers may wish to see the maps and graphs (Figures 1-6) that are available at the source URL above.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/

There is no mention in the plans above of public education for avoidance of contact with these rodents and their excreta. - Mod.TY
