[2] FDA/CDC: PCA plant report

The Georgia peanut plant linked to a salmonella outbreak that has
killed 8 people and sickened another 500 across the country knowingly
shipped out contaminated peanut butter 12 times in the past 2 years,
federal officials said yesterday [26 Jan 2009].

Officials at the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and the CDC
(US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), which have been
investigating the outbreak, said that the Peanut Corporation of
America (PCA) found _Salmonella_ in internal tests a dozen times in
2007 and 2008 but sold the products anyway, sometimes after getting a
negative finding from a different laboratory. Companies are not
required to disclose their internal tests to either the FDA or state
regulators, so health officials did not know of the problem.

The peanut butter and paste made at the company's Blakely, Georgia,
plant are not sold directly to stores but are used by manufacturers
to make crackers, cookies, energy bars, cereal, ice cream, candies,
and even dog biscuits. Some of the country's biggest food makers,
including Kellogg and McKee Foods, which produces Little Debbie brand
snacks, have recalled more than 100 products made with the tainted
ingredients, and the list keeps growing.

Federal investigators also said yesterday [26 Jan 2009] that they had
found 4 strains of _Salmonella_ at the Georgia plant, including one in
a sample taken from the floor near a washroom. One strain, _S._
Typhimurium, has been linked to the outbreak.

"There is a salmonella problem at the plant," said Robert Tauxe,
deputy director of the CDC's division of food-borne, bacterial, and
mycotic diseases. The outbreak, which has spread to 43 states and
Canada, is ongoing, but the pace has slowed "modestly," Tauxe said.
Half the people made ill have been children.

Though Peanut Corporation of America, based in Lynchburg, Virginia,
was not required to inform regulators about its internal tests,
Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition, said it appears that the company violated federal
law. "Foods are supposed to be produced under conditions that do not
render them damaging to health," he said. Sundlof said he could not
say whether the company might face criminal charges.

FDA officials said they still do not know the how the plant was
contaminated and how the bacteria got into the peanut products,
although state inspection records show a pattern of unsanitary
conditions over several years. In each case, inspectors flagged the
problems but said they required routine follow-up. There is no
evidence that Peanut Corporation of America was ever closed by the
state or otherwise penalized.

management and the state inspectors. - Mod.LL]
