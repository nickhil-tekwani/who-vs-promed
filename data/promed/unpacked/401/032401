[Caprine arthritis and encephalitis (CAE) is caused by a lentivirus, 1st
identified in 1974. Infection results in lifelong infection and manifests
as arthritis in adults and encephalitis in kids (not children but juvenile
goats) 2-6 months old. Other clinical presentations can include a hard
udder or mastitis, hypogalactia, chronic interstitial pneumonia, and
progressive weight loss. CAE is a herd problem best prevented by
maintaining a closed herd. Culling of positive animals and other
segregation strategies can help to prevent horizontal transmission.
Australia and New Zealand have voluntary CAE accreditation programs. - Mod.PC]
