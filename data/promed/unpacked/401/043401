During spring of 2016, lambs and kids in Kyrgyzstan have again been suffering a health condition referred to by the farmers in Kyrgyz as "kara öpkö" ("black lungs"). The animals suffer principally respiratory symptoms, starting at the age of 3-4 months (end of maternal immunity?) and become anorexic and listless with high fever. In untreated animals the mortality is usually high. In the dead animals, striking pneumonia changes can be seen (pictures attached). This undiagnosed syndrome has locally been causing serious losses and farmers are searching for vaccines and treatment, but so far largely in vain as nobody can tell them what the cause(s) is/are. Veterinarians report that they manage to get lambs through with antibiotics, but in goats the result of treatment is usually disappointing. A similar condition is known to prevail in Kyrgyzstan's neighbours with cross-border grazing, namely Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The etiology of this syndrome has not been established: PPR [peste des petits ruminants], CCPP [contagious caprine pleuro-pneumonia) and pasteurellosis have been mentioned as candidates to be considered. FMD [foot and mouth disease] involvement has also been considered as possible occasional contributor to the losses.

These recurrent losses are a heavy drain on farmers' income and their fortune. There is an urgent need for epidemiological, lab-backed, unbiased investigations, which should essentially maintain transparency.

While CCPP, PPR and pasteurellosis cause severe pneumonia, the apparent absence of digestive-tract involvement, expressed by diarrhea, in the affected animals, may exclude PPR as a part of the syndrome. Having said this, the possible presence of PPR virus in goats and sheep certainly deserves to be looked at in the region. This is particularly related to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, from which PPR has not (yet) been reported. PPR has been reported as circulating in China and Tajikistan. It will be surprising if this highly infectious virus has remained limited to the said neighboring territories. PPR has become, during recent years, subject to international eradication efforts; accurate knowledge of its distribution is essential.

CCPP, a serious mycoplasma infection, has been reported in the past from Tajikistan (see 20091104.3812). Pasteurellosis is regarded endemic in most countries worldwide, usually enhanced by viral and/or mycoplasma co-infections. - Mod.AS
