2 patients infected with both influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and
dengue fever have died in Hanoi, Nguyen Hong Ha, deputy head of the
National Institute of Tropical and Infectious Diseases, said on
Wednesday [11 Nov 2009]. Ha said both patients had been admitted to
the institute last week in critical condition.

The nation's 1st 2 patients with the combination of swine flu
[pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] and dengue [fever virus]
detected early this month [November 2009] had also been treated at the
institute. They have been discharged after full recovery.

According to the Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization
(WHO) so far has reported 7 cases with both dengue fever and swine
flu, with one death in Barbados, the island in the West Indies. ["This
week, Barbados reported 8 cases of co-infection with pandemic
influenza and dengue-3, diagnosed by RT-PCR." ProMED archive

Viet Nam has so far recorded 41 deaths related to swine flu since May
2009. A 16-year-old girl who was 6 months pregnant in the Mekong Delta
province of Kien Giang was the latest victim, the Ministry reported.

The Ministry's Preventive Health and Environment Department said a
meeting on [pandemic 2009] H1N1 vaccine distribution among 8 Southeast
Asian countries will be held Thursday [12 Nov 2009] in Bangkok. The
1.2 million doses of vaccine that WHO will sponsor for Viet Nam are
expected to arrive next month [December 2009]. The US will support the
countries with syringes and training for H1N1 vaccination campaigns,
the department said.

In the meantime, the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Viet Nam Company has
applied for a license to import and distribute the vaccines, according
to the Drug Administration of Viet Nam, which also said all procedures
will be completed as soon as possible.

Viet Nam plans to import 500 000 doses of the vaccines as a preventive
measure for high-risk population segments like pregnant women and
patients with chronic diseases.

[Two of 4 Vietnamese patients diagnosed with a combination of
influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection and dengue virus
infection have died. Elsewhere in the world in dengue endemic areas,
there has been one death among 7 patients diagnosed with pandemic
influenza/dengue co-infection. Without information on the number of
dengue virus infections and fatalities in Viet Nam currently, the
increased risk of dengue virus co-infection on the outcome of
infection with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus cannot be
quantified. However, in endemic areas, dengue virus co-infection is
likely to increase the risk of a fatal outcome.
