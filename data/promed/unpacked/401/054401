Bitten by rabid coyote
----------------------
Dressed only in underwear and a T-shirt, a man rescued his wife from the
jaws of a rabid coyote that attacked her in their back yard yesterday,
clubbing it with a piece of lumber. The woman, aged 44, was bitten on the
left hand by a 45 pound female coyote at about 7 a.m. as she tried to shoo
it away from her dog. The dog was tethered to a run in the back yard of the
residence. The victim's husband beat the coyote down with a 2-by-2, and
police later killed it. The victim is believed to be the 1st person ever
attacked by a rabid coyote in Massachusetts and only the second person ever
attacked by a coyote in the state, according to state wildlife officials.
The only other recorded attack on a human by a coyote also occurred on Cape
Cod. In 1998, a coyote snatched a 3 year old boy from a swing set in
Sandwich. His mother intervened and the boy was not badly injured.
The victim was treated at Cape Cod Hospital and released before noon.
Doctors gave her tetanus shots and started a regimen of rabies
vaccinations, [presumably this waspost-exposure prophylaxis - Mod.TG]
although they did not know then that the animal was rabid.
Last night, after the state health department diagnosed the coyote as
rabid, the victim's husband said doctors told his wife she would need
additional shots over the next 28 days.
A Barnstable Animal Control Officer retrieved the coyote's carcass, and
prepared it for rabies testing at a state lab in Boston. Biologists
interviewed yesterday said coyotes can carry rabies, but rarely do. From
1992 to 2002, only 6 of 65 coyotes tested for rabies in the state
registered positive, according to Tom O'Shea of MassWildLife, a division of
the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Coyote sightings have become
common throughout Massachusetts in recent years, coinciding with growing
reports of disappearing cats, dogs, and, in at least one case, turkeys.
But biologists do not have any reliable population estimates, or evidence
of a population explosion, they said yesterday. Coyotes tend to move in
packs of 3 or 4 and occupy a territory of 5 to 10 square miles, according
to Jonathan Way, a Boston College doctoral candidate who tracks coyotes on
the Cape. Way said housing developments in once-wild areas have brought
people and wildlife, including coyotes, closer together. "The Cape is
pretty much saturated with coyotes," he said. "The key is to learn how to
avoid interaction."
The victim said coyotes are a common sight in her neighborhood, which
borders several acres of undeveloped water department land, but none has
ever menaced her or her family until yesterday. Neighborhood pets are
another matter. The victim's husband stated he believed his was the only
cat left in the neighborhood. The victim's dog was taken to the
veterinarian later in the afternoon yesterday. The veterinarian said the
dog showed no signs of puncture wounds, but suffered a sprained leg.
[Hopefully the dog was vaccinated against rabies. The veterinarian should
have re-vaccinated the dog - Mod.TG]
