Egypt: Hepatitis C infection reaches alarming figures
-----------------------------------------------------
Egypt's spiralling threat of hepatitis C virus (HCV) -- already the highest
incidence rate in the world -- is alarming researchers who fear that a
potential epidemic of the bloodborne disease could spread across the most
populous Arab country. The findings of a recent study published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [Evidence of intense
ongoing endemic transmission of hepatitis C virus in Egypt. By Miller FD,
Abu-Raddad LJ. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010 Aug 17;107(33):14757-62. Epub
2010 Aug 9;
<http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/07/26/1008877107.short?rss=1>]
showed that more than 500 000 new HCV infection cases occur in Egypt every
year. Much of the problem behind the soaring infectious rates is poor
health care oversight and erratic medical hygiene.

"Nearly 7 out of every 1000 Egyptians acquire HCV infections every year.
This is the highest level of HCV transmission ever recorded at a national
level for a disease transmitted by use of non-sterile medical instruments,"
says Dr F DeWolfe Miller, lead author of the study.

Prevalence of hepatitis C in Egypt dates back to the 1970s. It was then
that health authorities in the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt were injecting
patients with tartar emetic to stop the spread of the waterborne disease
known as bilharzia. But many of the needles were unsterilized, causing HCV
to spread to thousands of Egyptians.

Nowadays, many blame the government for not halting the virus'
proliferation throughout the country of about 80 million people. The
Egyptian National Committee on Viral Hepatitis states that 9.8 per cent of
Egyptians are HCV infected, whereas doctors and researchers claim that the
real figure is between 15 and 20 per cent.

"Most HCV patients come from Egypt's most rural and poorest areas and they
rely on the medical insurance programs," said Dr Lotfi Wanees, an expert on
hepatitis. "Medication cost for every hepatitis C patient stands at an
average of 70 000 Pounds [USD 12 250] and the government has failed to
provide this sum for most of the patients."

He added: "There are also the deals signed between the Ministry of Health
and medicine companies. Many virus C medicines produced by Egyptian
pharmaceutical firms are not verified in the West and proved to be
inefficient. But they are still being prescribed to patients and the
government pays millions of pounds to purchase them."

According to Wanees, the "community acquired" virus has also been
accompanied by culture and literacy problems, as many of the poor,
uninsured patients resort to superstitious and primitive medical
substitutes, which worsen their cases.

Complications of hepatitis C lead to liver cirrhosis or liver failure. Many
people infected with the virus have no symptoms and are only diagnosed when
liver damage appears many years later.

[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with
hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a
few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C is usually spread
when blood from a person infected with hepatitis C virus enters the body of
someone who is not infected.

Hepatitis C can be either "acute" or "chronic". Acute hepatitis C virus
infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the 1st 6 months after
someone is exposed to hepatitis C virus. For most people, acute infection
leads to chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis C is a serious disease than
can result in long-term health problems, or even death. There is no vaccine
for hepatitis C.

At least 11 different genotypes of hepatitis C virus have been
differentiated which tend to be geographically restricted in their
prevalence. Hepatitis C virus genotype 4 has predominated in Egypt.
Unfortunately patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 4 tend to
respond poorly to interferon alpha, one of the most effective treatment
options available for control of HCV infection.
