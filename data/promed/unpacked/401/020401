The PACNEWS report of the so-called "Pig Belly" disease in the Solomon
Islands is an important one and needs follow-up. This is likely to be the
same disease as the one known as "Pig Bel" in PNG [Papua New Guinea]. If
confirmed it would be a serious situation and one which needs co-ordinated
approach and possible vaccine intervention. Just to inform everyone on the
aetiology of what we call pigbel in PNG.
The aetiology of the decease in PNG is noted to be the result of sweet
potato intake as a food staple. Sweet potato contains anti-trypsin. With
sweet potato intake one gets into a state of low trypsin production in ones
digestive system. Trypsin, as you know, is an enzyme responsible for the
breakdown of protein. When people have feasts or heavy intake of protein
contaminated by _Clostridium perfringens_ (_C. welchii_ type C) they have
inadequate trypsin in the digestive system to break down protein and
therefore the clostridia have the opportunity to multiply in the small
intestine utilising the undigested protein. In the process of
multiplication it produces the enterotoxin which necrotises the small
intestine.
The disease has also been reported in Europe (Germany) during the first
world war and in times of famine. Symptoms are usually constipation,
colicky abdominal pain initially and followed by swollen distended abdomen,
fever, vomiting and often if not treated leads to toxaemia and death due to
perforation of the small intestine. The antibiotic of choice is
chloramphenicol in the early stages. If late a surgical secession of the
small intestine may be warranted.
PACNET would appreciate any further information on the confirmation of this
out break and steps being taken in the Solomon Islands to prevent any
further outbreaks. Some descriptive epidemiology of the current situation
would also be most helpful for others to assist where possible.
