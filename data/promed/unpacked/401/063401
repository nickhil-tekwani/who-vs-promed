Local residents in Dohuk governorate reported Thursday [12 Aug 2021] that some villagers were infected with anthrax north of Dohuk, while the governorate's health department announced that it had taken the "necessary" measures to control the disease. People who live in the Brifka (Breivka) area in the Amadiyah district, north of Dohuk, told IQ News that "4 people who handled animals were infected with anthrax and were taken to hospital."

For its part, the Dohuk Health Department said, in a statement received by IQ News, that the city's health and veterinary directorates began "taking the necessary preventive measures to control anthrax after suspicions of infections," stressing "the ease of treating those infected with it."

Anthrax is a rare and serious disease caused by spore-forming bacteria called _Bacillus anthracis_. Anthrax mostly threatens livestock and game. Humans become infected through direct or indirect contact with infected animals. There is no evidence, according to medical research, that anthrax can be transmitted from one person to another, but it is possible that anthrax skin lesions are contagious through direct contact or through contact with an infected object (the infection tool). Usually, anthrax bacteria enter the body through a wound in the skin. The infection can also be acquired by eating infected meat or inhaling the spores.

[We are grateful to Mahmoud for forwarding these reports, which had to be translated from the Arabic and edited. Many thanks!

Owing to the unrest in the country, current animal disease reports to OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) are lacking. There is a singular Handistatus report for 2004 involving 78 outbreaks in sheep and goats with 156 cases and 108 deaths; in that year, 424 878 sheep and goats were vaccinated out of a national flock of 15 million animals.

Between 1976 and 1980 between 200 and 269 human cases in Iraq were reported each year. In 1981, there were 74 human cases. This renewal of local human reporting might be taken as an indicator of the relative peace in the north and the increased prosperity there.

When I visited Erzurum in eastern Turkey in 2006, it was made clear to me that their southern border was porous to livestock movements and therefore to the anthrax situations in the adjoining 2 countries. Put another way, the disease was enzootic in the Kurdish areas. Dohuk (also spelled Dahuk) forms about three-quarters of the Iraq/Turkey border. Elsewhere, who knows at this time, as the veterinary services are less than rudimentary.

Dohuk is the capital of the Kurdish regional government 's Dohuk governorate. Dohuk province in the north of the country can be located on the map at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/iraq.pdf. - Mod.MHJ
