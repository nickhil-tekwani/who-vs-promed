DRC receives part of 1st batch of 2nd Ebola vaccine in Goma
- The provincial health minister, Moses Kakule Kanyere has received 11 000 doses of the 50 000 planned for the 1st batch of the 2nd vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) against Ebola;
- "Indeed, this 1st batch, which arrived by the airport of Goma in a cargo flight of Ethiopian Airways, comes to relieve the population of North Kivu and moreover a possible epidemic with the Ebola virus disease," said the provincial health minister of North Kivu;
- For the general coordinator of the response to Ebola virus disease, Prof Steve Ahuka, this vaccine is a new tool that will be used in the response activities to protect a number of compatriots against the Ebola virus. For the moment, this vaccine comes from Belgium and has the advantage of being kept at the same temperature as the traditional vaccines used by the DRC." With the experience of the DRC in the Expanded Routine Immunization Program, as well as with the one that has just been done with the 1st Ebola vaccine, we will be able to preserve it, and this vaccine will be stable," said Prof Ahuka;
- Vaccine coordinator for MSF / Goma, Veronique Urbaniak, reported that the vaccines have arrived frozen at Goma and will be stored in the freezers. They will be transported frozen at vaccination sites and thawed according to vaccine requirements throughout the day. "MSF is delighted to participate in this clinical study, which is an important asset for our institution in the fight against Ebola," she says.
- This vaccine complements the 1st Ebola vaccine (which uses the belt strategy in EVD infected areas) and will target populations in areas not infected by the 10th Ebola virus outbreak.

Vaccination
- Since the beginning of the vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 245 999 people have been vaccinated;
- The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 20 May 2018.

Monitoring At Entry Points
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature measurement) at the health control points is 112 182 928;
- To date, a total of 111 entry points (PoE) and sanitary control points (PoCs) have been set up in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri to protect the country's major cities and prevent the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/11/news-scan-nov-01-2019

One new case was reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak today [1 Nov 2019], nudging the outbreak total to 3273, according to numbers reflected on the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard. Health officials are still investigating 500 suspected cases, and the number of deaths held steady at 2183.

The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) yesterday [31 Oct 2019] had locations for 3 cases reported yesterday; all were from Mandima health zone. Over the past few weeks, one of the outbreak's last remaining hot spots is the Biakato Mines area in Mandima health zone.

In its weekly snapshot of the outbreak, the WHO yesterday [31 Oct 2019] said activity over the past week stabilized, with 19 cases reported for the week ending on 29 Oct 2019, similar to the previous week. Most of the recent cases link back to Biakato Mines area, including 3 detected outside of Mandima health zone in people who had recently traveled from Biakato.

Onward transmission is occurring in a limited number of towns and villages, including 7 cases in Mabalako, 2 of which are linked to Biakato. Butembo -- after going 21 days with no new cases -- had 2 cases this week, both of them residents of Kalunguta where they were likely exposed to the virus. So far, there is no evidence of onward Ebola transmission in Butembo, a former Ebola hot spot. But WHO said the cases highlight the risk of reintroduction and resurgence in areas that have cleared the virus.

WHO: Disease Outbreak News [abridged, edited]
<https://www.who.int/csr/don/31-Oct-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces saw a stabilization in the number of new cases this past week, with 19 confirmed cases reported in the past week (23-29 Oct 2019), essentially equivalent to the 20 confirmed cases the week before. The majority (63%) of newly confirmed cases link back to chains of transmission in Biakato Mine Health Area, Mandima Health Zone, including a further 3 cases detected outside of Mandima in individuals who recently travelled from Biakato.

Onward local transmission has been observed in a limited number of towns and villages within family/social networks or health centers where cases visited prior to their detection and admission to treatment. In Mabalako, 7 new cases were reported, of which 2 were linked to Biakato, 2 reported local family contact, and 2 were contacts within local health facilities, suggesting possible nosocomial exposure; investigations are ongoing for the remaining case. In Mambasa Health Zone, one additional case was reported, linked to a large cluster of cases. In Butembo, after over 21 days with no cases, 2 were reported this week. Both were residents of Kalunguta Health Zone where they were likely exposed. Thus far, there is no evidence of onward transmission in Butembo; nonetheless, these events demonstrate the high risks of reintroduction and resurgence in previously cleared health zones.

During the past 21 days (from 9-29 Oct 2019), 59 confirmed cases were reported from 8 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (figure 2, table 1) with the majority reported in 3 health zones: Mandima (49%, n=29), Mabalako (20%, n=12), and Mambasa (10%, n=6). As of 29 Oct 2019, a total of 3269 EVD cases were reported, including 3152 confirmed and 117 probable cases, of which 2182 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1841) were female, 28% (n=926) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=163) were health workers.

- Thu 31 Oct 2019. South Sudan: violence led to closing of screening centers
ABC News [abridged, edited]
https://abcnews.go.com/International/suspends-ebola-screening-aid-workers-killed-south-sudan/story?id=66661896

[byline: Morgan Winsor]

The United Nations migration agency has halted Ebola screenings at 5 border crossings in East Africa after 3 of its aid workers were killed.

The International Organization for Migration said several of its volunteers were caught in the crossfire during clashes between rival groups on Sat [26 Oct 2019?] morning in South Sudan's Central Equatoria region. Two men and one woman died, and 2 male volunteers sustained non-life-threatening injuries. A female volunteer and the 4 year old son of the slain female aid worker were both abducted during the attack, and their whereabouts were unknown, according to a press release from the agency, which did not identify any of the victims by name.

South Sudan begins vaccinating health workers and other front-line responders against Ebola virus disease on 28 Jan 2019. "We grieve alongside our staff in South Sudan for the families of the victims and reiterate that humanitarians and civilians are not and should never be subjected to such heinous acts of violence," the International Organization for Migration's director-general, Antonio Vitorino, said in a statement. "We are not a target."

The aid workers were stationed in borderlands between South Sudan, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and were tracking the transmission of the deadly Ebola virus disease. The International Organization for Migration announced on Wed [30 Oct 2019] that it has since suspended Ebola screening at 5 points of entry in South Sudan.

"The safety of our personnel is paramount and will not be further jeopardized until we secure guarantees for the security of all our personnel operating in Morobo County," the agency's chief of mission in South Sudan, Jean-Philippe Chauzy, said in a statement. "No effort will be spared to support the grieving families, and we reiterate our commitment to support the people of South Sudan."

- Fri 1 Nov 2019. Appeal to reopen screening centers
Radio Mazuj [abridged, edited]
https://radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/yei-officials-call-on-iom-to-reopen-ebola-screening-centres

Authorities in South Sudan's Yei River State are appealing to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to reverse its decision closing down 5 Ebola screening points along the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.

In a press statement on Wed [30 Oct 2019], IOM said it had suspended Ebola screening at Isebi, Bazi, Kirikwa, Lasu, and Okaba entry points until the safety of their personnel is guaranteed. The suspension followed the death of 3 of its workers who were caught in the crossfire on Sun [27 Oct 2019] morning in Isebi.

Yei River State health minister Christine Anite Philip told Radio Tamazuj today [1 Nov 2019] that the suspension has put South Sudan at high risk of importing the Ebola disease. Anite said thousands of people move across the border daily. "We are appealing to IOM to re-open at least 2 screening points in Okaba and Bazi because of the huge movement of people along those routes. Ebola is a dangerous disease, and Yei is near to DRC. I am worried that if the people are not screened, and if there is an Ebola outbreak in Yei, it will spread all over the country," she pleaded.

For his part, Yei River State deputy governor Yusto Baba said the government is working to improve the security situation to allow humanitarian organizations to scale up Ebola activities along the border. Baba said after an assurance to beef up security, IOM promised to reopen the centres. "We have concluded a meeting with the chief of IOM, who has considered our appeal to reopen these centres," he said.

There are more than 15 porous entry points along the South Sudan-DRC border. Last Sun [27 Oct 2019], government forces clashed with the opposition National Salvation Front rebels in Morobo.

- Fri 1 Nov 2019. Infection of presumed survivor
News Medical [abridged, edited]
https://www.news-medical.net/news/20191101/Tightening-of-Ebola-care-practice-rules-following-survivore28099s-death.aspx

[byline: Dr Liji Thomas]

WHO and the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo are taking a fresh look at guidelines for the safe care of Ebola patients. The change has come after a patient died due to a 2nd infection from Ebola. So far, it has been thought that Ebola conferred permanent immunity on its survivors. However, Ebola survivors ("the winners" or "les vainqueurs") have been crucially important in caring for the stricken, especially children. They were thought to be immune, which meant they wore lighter protective gear, and had more extended contact periods with the patients, providing an opportunity for the human touch which is so vital for a sick person. In contrast, medical personnel have to observe maximum security precautions, and spend minimum time in contact, to prevent transmission.

The woman who died was a survivor, taking care of Ebola patients in an ALIMA (The Alliance for International Medical Action) treatment center in Beni, a red zone area, which means it is at the highest risk of infection transmission. She, along with dozens of other Ebola survivors, was assumed to be protected against the Ebola virus. However, when she fell sick, her test results showed an Ebola infection. She died in July 2019 before she could even be admitted for care.

The case has raised several questions and is a "big red flag event" for all clinical staff involved in Ebola management. For instance, researchers are questioning whether the 1st test was a false positive, making the 2nd episode the 1st true exposure she had. Alternatively, perhaps it could have been a relapse following an incompletely cured Ebola infection. There is not currently an answer.

Ebola care is already difficult because of internecine conflict in the war-torn region, where medical center staff and community workers all face danger from both guerillas and the virus. Several have been killed during clashes and targeted attacks. Furthermore, containment is problematic as patients at high risk of infection still occasionally slip the quarantine net, posing a danger of spreading the infection to other places.

Research on Ebola immunity is lagging behind the knowledge of its management and prevention. Yet, the case has spurred authorities to draft new guidelines warning against exposing survivors to possible reinfection, for fear of incomplete immune protection. Several cases of relapse are known, of course. For instance, a foreign nurse fell sick 10 months after she recovered from the infection. However, in previously known relapses, symptoms are more localized and non-fatal, says the head of the Biosecurity Program at the University of New South Wales' Kirby Institute, Raina MacIntyre.

No reinfection has ever been confirmed since its 1st discovery, in 1976. Furthermore, one study showed that 14 survivors of the 1st Ebola outbreak still exhibited an immune reaction to at least one Ebola virus protein after 40 years. For the most part, there has been an assumption of immunity. All this could change now. Ebola survivors will have to exercise more caution when working in treatment centers, maybe following standard precautions if they do. Some possible high-risk criteria for Ebola survivors being re-infected might be the initial infection being mild with a low viral load in the blood. This might indicate that their immune system could not generate complete immunity, leaving them at risk for a 2nd infection.

In addition, pregnant women, whose immune system is downregulated, and people with HIV or tuberculosis infections, may also be barred from caring for Ebola victims. The woman who died was pregnant at the time, though she did not reveal this fact to the staff at the center.

The Congolese health research team is still studying the case to try and develop a better understanding of what occurred. Moreover, the authorities have taken a close look at the clinical details of all the vainqueurs working with sick Ebola patients, and treatment centers have been nudged to make sure that biosafety rules are being followed by all employees.

Meanwhile, Johnson and Johnson has made a 2nd experimental vaccine available, and it will probably come into use next week. Though its use is said to be part of a clinical trial, up to 500 000 people could be protected for free with the donated vaccine. The emergence of effective new drugs is a beacon of hope and a salute to the dedication of doctors, researchers, and other staff engaged in fighting the disease in the midst of war.

[This death from Ebola following presumed prior infection is disturbing and needs further investigation to seek the explanation for how this could have happened. This is important because of the assistance survivors provide to care for infected patients. Until it is clear how reinfection may have occurred, the guidelines for care of patients must be revised to be more stringent, even in the case of survivors. - Mod.LK]

[byline: Betsy McKay]

The Ebola virus kills in terrifying ways, shutting down the body's organs and draining victims of the fluids that keep them alive. In outbreaks, it has claimed as many as 9 in 10 patients.

In a medical breakthrough that compares to the use of penicillin for war wounds, 2 new drugs are saving lives from the virus and helping uncover tools against other deadly infectious diseases. They were proven effective in a gold-standard clinical trial conducted by an international coalition of doctors and researchers in the middle of armed violence.

The work of Congolese virologist Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum yielded one of the new Ebola drugs. Dr. Muyembe had dedicated years to finding how to save people from the disease that emerged in 1976 from a remote village near the Ebola River. He was among the 1st scientists to identify the Ebola virus, which has killed an estimated 3000 men, women and children in his country and threatened many more around the world.

The virus, once thought isolated to remote areas of central and eastern Africa, proved it could jump oceans. In 2014, international travelers spread Ebola to cities in the US and Europe, including Dallas and Madrid.

Researchers tested 4 experimental drugs, and 2 were most effective. The treatments are remarkable for their potential to save lives, as well as for the way they came about. The trial was conducted at 4 Ebola treatment centers, essentially tent-sided field hospitals, scattered across a violent swath of northeastern Congo during the world's 2nd-largest outbreak of the disease. In addition to the threat from the contagious virus, researchers dodged attacks by warring local groups. Two of the treatment centers were set on fire. Despite the obstacles, doctors healed patients sick with Ebola, often just days after a single intravenous dose.

"Ebola is now a disease we can treat," said Dr Muyembe, director-general of Congo's National Institute of Biomedical Research, known as the INRB, and a co-principal investigator in the trial. Preliminary results were released on 12 Aug 2019, days after the trial ended. Final results are expected to be published soon in a medical journal.

Beyond Ebola, the new drugs open a pathway for antibody-based treatments for other infectious diseases, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which ran the trial with the INRB and a research group coordinated by WHO. Dr Muyembe had long believed that antibodies -- proteins that the immune system produces to fight infection -- could bolster patients' defenses against Ebola. He faced doubts from scientists skeptical about drawing conclusions from his research.

In the trial, patients given a single-antibody drug had a 35% mortality rate, according to results presented at an infectious-diseases conference this month [October 2019] in Washington DC, compared with as high as 90% without treatment. The NIAID-led drug, mAb114, was developed from an antibody of an Ebola survivor found by Dr Muyembe. Among patients treated with a drug made of 3 antibodies by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., called REGN-EB3, 34% died. Trial patients who were treated with either drug soon after falling ill fared even better, preliminary results found. The overall results included patients who were sick for days before seeking help.

Many Ebola patients don't seek medical treatment or come too late to be helped. As a result, of 3250 cases of Ebola since August 2018, 2174 have died, yielding a 67% mortality rate. A new vaccine given to more than 240 000 people in north eastern Congo helped prevent further spread of the virus.

Regeneron and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, a Miami biotech company that licensed the NIAID drug, said they each planned to seek approval from the US Food and Drug Administration under a speedy review process for breakthrough drugs.

The Congolese have suffered through a 15-monthlong epidemic that WHO has designated a global public health emergency. While new cases have declined in past weeks, the virus has surfaced in hard-to-reach rural areas where violence by rebel militias impedes health workers.

Since the clinical trial ended, doctors have been administering the 2 drugs to Ebola patients, while researchers continue to study their effects. "The people who come early, the vast majority of them get better with these drugs," said Muhindo Karumba, who showed Dr Fauci and other visiting US officials an Ebola treatment center last month [September 2019] in Butembo, a dense mountain city crisscrossed with red-dirt roads near Congo's border with Uganda.

The 1st trial patients enrolled last year [2018] in November. Researchers thought it would take more than one outbreak to get enough patients, but the virus kept spreading. "We had no idea the outbreak was going to be as devastating as it turned out to be," said Richard Davey, deputy clinical director at the NIAID and co-principal investigator.

The drugs in the randomized controlled trial, considered in science the most reliable, were shipped each week aboard United Nations flights from Kinshasa to Beni. The shipments were usually delivered to the treatment centers in convoys. Sometimes, there were maddening delays. "You were always keeping your fingers crossed," said Jerome Pierson, director of the NIAID's Office of Clinical Research Policy and Regulatory Operations. The drugs had to be kept in refrigerators or freezers that relied on generators for electricity. The staff monitored temperatures to make sure the drugs stayed cold. Workers sent patient data each day to Kinshasa via satellite dishes. The information was then relayed to the NIAID in Bethesda, Maryland.

In August 2019, an independent group of experts reviewed the results. It found that REGN-EB3 and mAb114 outperformed the other 2 drugs in the trial with startling outcomes. Researchers stopped the trial on 9 Aug 2019. The following day, doctors began giving patients one of the 2 successful drugs. "People say it's unprecedented that you have this great result," Dr Fauci said. "What is equally as unprecedented is the conditions under which it was done."

Dr Muyembe set out on his path to an Ebola treatment during the 1995 outbreak. He transferred blood from 5 survivors to 8 patients, hoping that the antibodies that kept some people alive would keep others from dying. Seven of the patients who received the blood transfusion recovered. He published the results in a scientific journal in 1999. Other researchers said the study was small and had failed to include a control group, a comparison set of patients who weren't given the treatment, to fully test its efficacy. In 2005, Dr Muyembe met with NIAID scientist Barney Graham, who had come to see Dr Muyembe about collaborating on monkey pox and HIV vaccine research. Their conversation turned to Ebola, and Dr Muyembe suggested the NIAID study antibodies from one of the Ebola survivors who had donated blood.

Regeneron, a Tarrytown, NY-based company, started developing an Ebola drug in October 2014. Years earlier, the company had developed a technology to create treatments against viruses using human antibodies produced in a genetically-modified mouse. It identified 3 antibodies to attack the Ebola virus and created REGN-EB3. In May 2018, an Ebola outbreak erupted in a western province of Congo. Eager to test their drugs, Regeneron and the NIAID sought permission to supply their experimental treatments. The outbreak ended 1st. But a few weeks later, the current outbreak began. Sabue Mulangu, a researcher at the INRB and the trial coordinator in Congo, helped secure permission from the NIAID and the Congolese government to give patients mAb114.

They offered treatment at a hospital in the town of Mangina where several nurses were sick with Ebola. It had been tested on only a few people. "People were not very confident that it was a good idea," Dr Mulangu said. "We said, OK, Ebola kills. We have to do something." The nurses agreed to the hourlong infusions. The 1st patient vomited and had diarrhea for 2 days. On the 3rd day, she improved. By the 4th day, "she was putting on make-up," Dr Mulangu said.

All 13 patients in Mangina survived. Doctors soon began administering mAb114, REGN-EB3 and other experimental drugs. They were given to patients under WHO guidelines allowing experimental therapeutics during deadly outbreaks. Researchers moved quickly to design the clinical trial that confirmed what Dr. Muyembe 1st suspected, that antibodies from those who survived the virus held the key to saving others.

After almost 40 lulls, a new case of Ebola virus disease has been confirmed in the Beni Health Zone. This is a biker who was staying in Biakato in Ituri before returning to the city of Beni carrying a patient.

To avoid such incidents, the interim coordinator of the Ebola Virus Disease Response sub-coordination in the Beni Health Zone, Dr Bibiche Matadi, calls all taximen-motos to trust the checkpoints installed at the entrance of large cities: "To our bikers, we ask them to avoid taking the wrong ways. We have entry points in every community; we ask our community to trust these points of entry and not to go back and forth."

These points of entry are designed, she says, not to slow down bikers, but rather to monitor their health. "If the sick person is retained at the point of entry, we save a whole community that would attend its reception, or we spare all our health facilities that would receive and treat this case," she said.

WHO AFRO: Review of the strategic response plan for the Democratic Republic of the Congo
---------------------
"The response to Ebola has required enormous resources. Let us put the emphasis on using this crisis as a means of strengthening the health system. The implications go far beyond the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC); the world is watching us." This was the core message from Dr Eteni Longondo, Minister of Health of the DRC, to the participants of the Mid-Term Review of the Strategic Response Plan 4 for Ebola, which took place in Goma this past week.

In response to a rapidly evolving Ebola outbreak, the Ministry of Health, the United Nations, and other partners launched Strategic Response Plan 4 on 1 Jul 2019, which calls for scaling up the Ebola response around 5 pillars:
-strengthening the public health response to the Ebola outbreak;
-strengthening political commitment, security and operational support;
-strengthening support for communities;
-strengthening financial planning, monitoring and reporting; and
-strengthening preparedness.

The plan covers the period of 1 Jul-31 Dec 2019.

During the 3-day meeting, some 200 participants representing partners involved in the fight against Ebola evaluated the ongoing response activities. In addition to identifying the impediments and challenges to an efficient response, working groups focused on how to optimize the synergies between the 5 pillars of the plan; the reorganization of local responses; preparations needed for risk areas and other provinces; and the strategy for getting to zero transmission of the Ebola virus disease. The participants also reviewed funding allocations to determine whether they need to be revised.

WHO is leading the public health operations and regional preparedness pillars of the response. In recent weeks, the number of new Ebola cases has experienced a downward trend. "This meeting served as an opportunity to take a critical look at what has been done so far and to propose an ambitious plan to get to zero cases," said Dr Michel Yao, emergency operations manager in the WHO Regional Office for Africa. "The progress we have made is due not only to our consolidated efforts but also because we have incorporated lessons learned along the way."

The principal recommendation arising from the meeting is to move forward with a "zero-transmission" strategy, which involves ensuring high-quality interventions in current outbreak hot spots and preventing the return of the disease in areas where it has been controlled. Other recommendations include: Ensuring the transfer of skills to local and national experts; Assisting the DRC in "building back better" and in strengthening its health system; and Developing a transition plan while maintaining current response capacity.

The country's 10th Ebola outbreak was declared on 1 Aug 2018. The previous Strategic Response Plans guided the deployment of the resources needed to support the government and its partners. An operational review of the response was organized in June 2019 to assess appropriateness with the evolution of the epidemic, which led to this latest plan and its validation in September 2019.

[byline: Natalie Rahhal]

US airports have hired Ebola screeners to test blood samples from travelers coming to the US from countries plagued by the deadly virus. Several agencies in the Washington, DC and Las Angeles, California areas recently put out quiet job postings for Ebola screeners.

A representative of the Northern Virginia Emergency Medical Services Council confirmed that more than one part-time position had been filled. According to the job posting, the screeners will not be required to have direct contact with passengers but will test blood or perhaps saliva samples for Ebola.

Ebola has spread in recent months to countries neighboring the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it originated. Its spread triggered the WHO to declare Ebola a public health emergency of international concern [PHEIC], and encourage heightened precautions. No cases have been reported in the US or neighboring countries, but the Bahamas yesterday [31 Oct 2019] said it is now on high alert for the arrival of Ebola.
