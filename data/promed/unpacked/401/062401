Hand-foot-mouth disease spreads throughout Viet Nam
---------------------------------------------------
Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is spreading throughout all 63
Vietnamese cities and provinces, getting more than 71 470 people
affected, of whom 130 were dead, as of Monday [17 Oct 2011], local
Thanh Nien (Youth) newspaper reported.

While HFMD is expanding across the country, the Vietnamese Ministry of
Health (MOH) has not yet declared it as an "epidemic" because it is
still under "control", said the report. Nguyen Van Binh, director of
MOH Preventive Medicines Department, said the disease is under control
while there are about 2000 newly affected cases per week, or 8000-10
000 cases per month.

However, in September [2011] alone, the country had more than 26 000
newly affected HFMD patients with 31 dead, and in the 1st half of
October, the figures were reported at 10 000 and 16, respectively,
said the report. So far, southern Ho Chi Minh City and central Quang
Ngai province are the most hit localities.

The MOH will announce the epidemic nationally when there are at least
2 localities reporting that the disease is out of their control. The
epidemic announcement will be made under 2 circumstances: 1st, when
the number of affected patients is more than those estimated by the
centrally-run medical agencies; 2ndly, when the disease develops
out-of-control or when there appears some new agent that causes high
fatal rate while there is not yet medicines for treatment, explained
Binh.

The HFMD, caused by Human enterovirus 71 (EV71), has such symptoms as
fever, throat pain and vesicle on the hand palms and foot soles. The
patient can recover after about one week. However, sometimes the
disease is out of the doctor's control because it develops fast and
leads to death, just within 24-72 hours when 1st symptoms are found.

Patients are normally children under 3 years of age, but by the end of
September there were 8 adults having tests with EV virus, who had
taken care of the affected children, reported the Viet Nam's central
Nha Trang Pasteur Institute.

Medical experts warned the disease would become more complicated in
the coming months due to the lack of preventive vaccines and specific
medicine for treatment. The disease is contaminated [transmitted ?]
through the digestive system or direct contact, hence the rate of
infection is high, especially now when there are adults affected by
HFMD but they have no apparent symptoms.

[From these figures it seems inevitable that the Vietnamese
authorities will have to declare that HFMD has acquired "epidemic"
status throughout Viet Nam.

CB Tran and colleagues have recently published an analysis of the
epidemiology of hand, foot and mouth disease in Viet Nam (PLoS One.
2011;6(7):e21116. Epub 2011 Jul 12). They conclude that
EV71-associated hand, foot and mouth disease has emerged as a serious
public health problem in South East Asia over the last decade. To
better understand the prevalence of EV71 infection, these authors
determined EV71 seroprevalence and sero-incidence amongst healthy
infants and children in Ho Chi Minh City. In a cohort of 200 newborns,
55 per cent of cord blood samples contained EV71 neutralizing
antibodies and these decayed to undetectable levels by 6 months of age
in 98 per cent of infants. The EV71 neutralizing antibody
seroconversion rate was 5.6 per cent in the 1st year and 14 per cent
in the second year of life. In children 5-15 yrs of age,
seroprevalence of EV71 neutralizing antibodies was 84 per cent and in
cord blood it was 55 per cent. Taken together, these data suggest the
EV71 rate of infection is high and highlights the need for more
research into its epidemiology and pathogenesis in high disease burden
countries.
