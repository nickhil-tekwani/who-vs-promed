The United Nations on Wednesday [17 Dec 2008] played down fears over
an outbreak of bird flu in China, saying a few cases in winter wasn't
a worry.

Authorities in China announced on Tuesday [16 Dec 2008] that they had
begun destroying and vaccinating poultry after the virus was detected
in the eastern province of Jiangsu. "We are going to see how it
evolves. If for some reason there were more outbreaks and it was
spreading, then I would say I am concerned, but today not at all,"
said Vincent Martin, senior technical adviser for the UN Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FOA) in China. "Today we are just
monitoring the situation. Having a few outbreaks in the winter time
in this place is not a real concern."

The H5N1 strain of bird flu was found on a chicken farm in Dongtai
city and in another farm in Haian county, China's Agriculture
Ministry said.

The discovery had prompted local agricultural authorities to step up
vaccinations, while culling 377 000 chickens in the area around the
farms. The virus had not been detected in any other locations.

China has had several bird flu outbreaks this year [2008], leading to
the deaths of 3 Chinese, according to earlier reports.

Martin said the FAO had been notified by Chinese authorities on
Tuesday [16 Dec 2008] about the outbreak, which could have been
triggered by migratory birds.

"The situation in China has been improving for the past 4 years, and
during the last year, we had less outbreaks of avian flu," Martin
said. "The Chinese government is doing quite a lot of surveillance,
and they are also implementing a massive vaccination campaign."

As confirmed by test results from the National Avian Influenza
Reference Laboratory, the avian influenza virus found on some layer
farms in Jiangsu's Dongtai and Haian is the avian influenza H5N1 Re-4
variant strain, highly homologous to the variant strain that appeared
2 years ago in Shanxi Province and different than the strain[s] which
1st circulated in the south [of China]. Research by the national
reference lab shows that this virus [strain] has an extremely low
rate of transmission to mammals, and there has never been a human
case involving this virus [strain].
