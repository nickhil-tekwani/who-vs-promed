Louisiana citrus growers need to be on the lookout for sweet orange
scab of citrus caused by the fungus _Elsinoe australis_. The disease
recently was found on a satsuma tree [_Citrus reticulata_ - Mod.DHA]
in Orange, Texas, about 3.5 miles [ca. 5.6 km] west of the Louisiana
border, according to LSU [Louisiana State University] AgCentre.
Previously, this disease had only been reported in South America.

"This disease differs from the citrus scab that we typically see on
satsumas primarily in terms of its host range," said LSU's Don
Ferrin. Citrus scab commonly occurs on lemons, tangerines, grapefruit
and satsumas and rarely occurs on sweet oranges, Ferrin said. Sweet
orange scab occurs primarily on sweet oranges, tangerines and satsumas.

Ferrin said: "It's mostly cosmetic, but it affects ability to sell
the fruit for the fresh market. It can be controlled with fungicides
applied at and shortly after bloom."

The US Department of Agriculture began conducting a survey for sweet
orange scab within a one-mile [ca. 1.6 km] radius of the infected
tree in Texas this past weekend, Ferrin said. They will begin to
check citrus for the disease in Calcasieu Parish [Louisiana] this week.

[Sweet orange scab caused by the fungus _Elsinoe australis_ has been
reported from several countries in South America as well as New
Caledonia, Eritrea, and Sicily. In areas where it is absent, its
introduction is considered a serious risk to crops for the fresh
fruit market. In the US, the pathogen had previously been declared a
quarantine threat (ProMED-mail post 20060513.1361). Symptoms on fruit
may include cream coloured round lesions and pustules (scab), furrows
and cracks in the rind, discolouration of the rind surrounding the
lesions, and deformation of young fruits which usually disappears
during maturation. In rare cases, lesions and pustules may also
appear on leaves and twigs.

The pathogen overwinters in the tree canopy, primarily on fruit. In
the absence of fruit, it may survive in old leaves and stem lesions,
but it is unclear how this can occur. Spores may be spread by rain
splash between trees, on air currents for short distances, and with
plant and other materials. Long distance spread appears to be mainly
due to movement of contaminated fruit. Disease management relies on
quarantine for pathogen exclusion and properly timed fungicide applications.

Common citrus scab (or sour orange scab) is caused by the related
_Elsinoe fawcettii_. Differences include the host range (as described
above), the common occurrence of symptoms on leaves, and a lower
optimal growth temperature.
