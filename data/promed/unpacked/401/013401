A Northern Territory Health Services entomologist, Mr Peter Whelan, said
two types of mosquitoes that [can] carry [dengue viruses] were found on a
freight ship last week. It was only the third time in three decades that
inspectors had found evidence that such mosquitoes may have made it ashore,
Mr Whelan said. It was possible that [the] mosquitoes could breed in
Australia, he said. "It's a risk but it's risk that's being looked at
closely," Mr Whelan said.
Yesterday insecticide was sprayed around the Hudson Bay docklands, where
the ship had docked after sailing from the West Timorese port of Kupang.
The ship arrived on 21 Jan 2000 and had been docked for 6 days before
inspectors identified [the] mosquito larvae. The inspectors found the eggs
of _Aedes aegypti_, already present in north Queensland, and _Aedes
albopictus_, which is not found in Australia. While such larvae had been
found on fishing vessels, yachts and other ships about 30 times over the
past 30 years, evidence that they had come ashore had been established only
twice before. In both cases, they had been eradicated on land, Mr Whelan said.

[That's "Dr." Peter Whelan. It is difficult to tell whether what Peter
found was eggs or larvae but in either case, if they were viable, that's
not good news. There already are enough mosquitoes in the Northern
Territory. Given the competitive nature of these species, they might even
survive under these ideal conditions, so a ruthless effort will undoubtedly
be made to eradicate them before they can become established. If Peter
Whelan or Richard Russell would care to comment on any of this, please do
so. A "success story" some weeks from now would be welcomed. - Mod. CHC]
