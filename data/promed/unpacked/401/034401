*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 6 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- It has been 20 years since the inception of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), a close WHO partner that has responded to emergencies in 85 different countries, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The WHO regional director for the Americas, Dr Carissa F Etienne, warned that reducing social distancing measures "too soon could accelerate the spread of the virus and open the door for a dramatic upsurge or for spread to adjacent areas."
- In the "Subject in Focus", we provide details on a webinar that WHO hosted yesterday [5 May 2020] to find out more about how young people are contributing to the COVID-19 response and how they see their future in a post-pandemic world.

Subject in Focus: COVID-19 -- Learning from the youth of today
--------------------------------------------------------------
- As the COVID-19 pandemic has left communities around the world reeling, young people have mobilized their networks and placed themselves firmly in the forefront of the COVID-19 response. WHO hosted a webinar on 5 May 2020, with 808 participants from around the world, to find out more about how young people are contributing to the COVID-19 response and how they see their future in a post-pandemic world.
- The panellists included representatives from the Global Health Workforce Network Youth Hub (GHWF Youth Hub), the International Federation of Medical Students' Association (IFMSA) representing 1.3 million students; the Global Shapers representing over 9000 youths; and the #MOREVIRALTHANTHEVIRUS global movement with hubs in over 100 countries.
- The representative from GHWF Youth Hub highlighted the fact that all over the world young people have stepped up to respond to COVID-19. She spoke about the many healthcare students who have been drawn into delivering care, assisting in contact tracing and working for COVID-19 hotlines and call centres.
- The representative from IFMSA shared inspiring stories of how young people have helped their own communities by developing technology-driven solutions, such as apps to support the delivery of supplies to vulnerable, isolated people, and the creation of an online dashboard to monitor university and school closures around the world while linking online training and alternative learning resources to areas of need.
- The representative from the #MOREVIRALTHANTHEVIRUS movement described how they started as a group of medical students but soon realized that all students everywhere were affected, and all had something to share and give. Young people have an unparalleled potential as networkers and amplifiers of information. At the beginning of the pandemic there was a lack of youth-focused communication; this prompted young people around the world to share information.
- With extensive global networks, digital know-how and creativity, youth organizations and movements can rapidly detect rumours, identify common information needs and disseminate accurate information. WHO's European region (EURO) has a successful ongoing collaboration with the Global Shapers in Denmark to do just this, and IFMSA is collaborating with the Infodemic Management Team of the WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) to crowdsource fact-checking and myth-busting worldwide.
- There was a collective sense at the close of the webinar that young people living through the COVID-19 pandemic will emerge an empowered generation: a generation that values solidarity and collaboration.
- The representative from the Global Shapers stated: "It was fantastic to see youth organizations and movements all around the world taking the initiative and solving different problems that have arisen due to COVID-19. Thanks to this session, I have personally reached out to some of them to see how we can collaborate and amplify our efforts together as one."

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 29 701 new cases (41.5% of the global newly reported cases), and 1480 deaths (36.1%) were recorded for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 54.5% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 22.3%, and Peru and Mexico both at 4.8%. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 49.1% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru and Mexico at 10.6% each, and Chile at 10.1%.

The European region reported 27 179 new cases (38% of the global newly reported cases) and 2178 deaths (53%). Russia reported 38.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 16.2%, Turkey 6.7%, Spain 4.8%, and Italy and France 3.8% each.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7854 new cases (10.9% of the global newly reported cases) and 175 deaths (4.3%). Saudi Arabia reported 20.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran at 16.8%, Pakistan at 13.1%, Qatar 12.1%, Kuwait at 6.7% and the United Arab Emirates at 5.8%.

The African region reported 1403 new cases (1.9% of the global newly reported cases) and 90 deaths (2.2%). South Africa reported 15.6% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria at 13.5%, Cameroon at 13.4%, Nigeria at 10.5%, Equatorial Guinea at 8.8%, and Guinea at 7.2%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1016 new cases (1.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 40 deaths (0.9%). Singapore reported 62.2% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines at 19.5%, Japan at 12.1%, and Malaysia at 2.9%.

The South East Asia region reported 4310 new cases (6.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 139 deaths (3.4%). India reported 68.6% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 18.2% and Indonesia at 11.2%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 58.1% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 35.7%, Sri Lanka at 3.9% and the Maldives at 2.1%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 6 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend. Europe has not been rebounding as high at the end of the weekend, demonstrating decreasing newly confirmed cases. South East Asia has been gradually increasing as the cases continue increasing in India.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.UBA]
