I would like to point out a minor but important error in the 24 November
ProMed-mail message [first reference cited above.
The cestode agent whose prevalence has increased in Germany and elsewhere
in Europe, with potential important public health implications, is
_Echinococcus multilocularis_, not _E. granulosus_ as stated. The latter
primarily cycles in domestic dogs and sheep and other livestock species.
_E. multilocularis_ occurs in life cycles involving foxes and their rodent
prey and the disease it causes in humans, alveolar echinococcosis, is a
serious and potentially fatal malignant-type mass lesion affecting the
liver and other organs.
The increase of this disease in Germany has been temporally associated with
the increase in the fox host density, however, interpretation of the
numbers of human cases is complicated by increased awareness and improved
diagnosis.

[Thanks, Peter, for correcting our error and providing additional comments
urging caution and sophistication when it comes to interpreting causality
in this situation. The error was in the text we received and I,
unfortunately, failed to weed it out. Apologies to our readers. At least
it gives us a good excuse to post the GIDEON information from Steve Berger
that follows. - Mod.PC

Regarding transmission of _Echinococcus granulosus_ from foxes to humans, I
would be more concerned about _Echinococcus multilocularis_. The following
background information on this disease in Europe was extracted from the
GIDEON software program:
The agent of multilocular echinococcosis, Echinococcus multilocularis, is a
cestode found in foxes, wolves, coyotes, dogs, cats, voles, lemmings,
shrews and similar mammals in Europe and Asia. Humans acquire the disease
through ingestion of feces-contaminated material. Infection is
characterized by an expanding mass in the liver which may appear years
following acquisiton. Resection, and even liver transplantation, may be
required - an addition to intensive and prolonged administration of
albendazole.
The status of disease in selected European countries is as follows:
The parasite is found among foxes in the southern region of Belgium, and
the area of Gdansk in Poland. Human infection has also been reported from
Sardinia, Gdansk (Poland) and the Siberian tundra. Most cases in Turkey
are reported from eastern Anatolia.
Austria: 128 cases were reported between 1854 and 1991, most from the west
(Tyrol and Vorarlberbg) and south (Carinthia, Salzberg and Styria). 3.6%
of foxes are infested, primarily those from northwestern Styria. Infection
of foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) is found in 6 of 9 provinces.
France: 69 cases were registered during 1969 to 1992. Highest
seroprevalence rates (0.1%) are found in Doubs Departement (Eastern region
bordering on Switzerland) and Massif Central.
Germany: Human disease is found in the central and southern regions. 58
cases were identified in Bavaria during 1985 to 1989, with highest rates in
Swabia and Upper Bavaria.
Switzerland: Human disease is localized to northern cantons. 267 cases
diagnosed were during 1956 to 1983 (0.18/100,000 in 1980) and 65 during
1984 to 1992 (88% acquired locally). 34 infections by _Echinococcus_
species were registered in 1993; 48 in 1994; 40 in 1995; 41 in 1996.
Carriage rates among foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) in the endemic region (21 of
26 cantons) range from 1.7% to 54%. Seroprevalence among blood donors is
0.01%.
