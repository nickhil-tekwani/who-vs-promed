At least 11 people have been killed and several hundred admitted to hospitals after a gas leak at a chemicals plant on the east coast of India, officials said on Thursday [7 May 2020]. Another 1500 people were evacuated, mostly from a neighbouring village, some 14km (9 miles) inland from the east coast city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh state.

Footage on Indian television channels showed people, including women and children, lying motionless in the streets of Visakhapatnam, an industrial port city. Srijana Gummalla, commissioner of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, said styrene leaked from the plant during the early hours of the morning, when families in the surrounding villages were asleep.

Gas emissions had fluctuated throughout the day and had largely stabilised, he said. The plant, which makes polystyrene products for use in fan blades, cosmetic containers, and other plastic, was being reopened after India began to relax a nationwide lockdown imposed on 25 Mar 2020 to contain the spread of the new coronavirus [COVID-19].

In a televised address on Thursday [7 May 2020], Andhra Pradhesh's chief minister, Jagan Mohan Reddy, said the leak occurred because the styrene had been stored for a long period of time. "We are looking into the exact damages, cause of the death and details of the incident," LG Chem said in a statement.

South Korean battery maker LG Chemical Ltd, the owner of the facility said the gas leak had been brought under control. "We are looking into the exact damages, cause of the death, and details of the incident," the company said in a statement.

Rani earlier told AFP news agency the gas leaked out of 2 5000-tonne tanks of the plant located in Andhra Pradesh state. "We received an emergency call from the local villagers around 3:30am local time [22:00 GMT] in the morning today [7 May 2020]. They said there was some gas in the air," she said. "We reached there [almost] immediately. One could feel the gas in the air and it was not possible for any of us to stay there for more than a few minutes. Prepared rescue workers started working from around 4 am [22:30 GMT]."

Areas within an approximately 3-kilometer (about 2-mile) radius of the plant were vulnerable, the municipal corporation said in a tweet. In an interview with local news channel NDTV, SN Pradhan, director general of the National Disaster Response Force, said the situation is now under control at the site. "The gas leakage has been stopped and the quantities should now be more manageable and we should be able to evacuate people to safety," said Pradhan.

According to the Times of India newspaper, the incident led to panic among the residents with many people seen lying unconscious on the roads. Others were having breathing problems and complained of rashes on their body and sore eyes, it added. Ambulances were shown arriving to collect the injured on the roadside to take them to hospitals in the area.

Historical
----------
India witnessed in December 1984 one of the worst industrial disasters in history when gas [methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas] leaked from a pesticide plant in the central city of Bhopal. About 3500 people, mainly in shanties around the plant operated by Union Carbide, died in the following days and thousands more in the following years. People continue to suffer its after-effects today. Government statistics say at least 100 000 people living near the Union Carbide plant have been victims of chronic illnesses. Survivors still suffer from ailments such as respiratory and kidney problems, hormonal imbalances, mental illness, and several forms of cancer.

["Styrene is primarily a synthetic chemical that is used extensively in the manufacture of plastics, rubber, and resins. It is also known as vinylbenzene, ethenylbenzene, cinnamene, or phenylethylene. Many workers, including those who make boats, tubs, and showers, are potentially exposed to styrene. Health effects from exposure to styrene may involve the central nervous system and include complaints of headache, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, drowsiness, malaise, difficulty in concentrating, and a feeling of intoxication" (https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/styrene/index.html.)

"Health effects of styrene include irritation of the skin, eyes, and the upper respiratory tract. Acute exposure may also result in gastrointestinal effects. Chronic exposure affects the central nervous system showing symptoms such as depression, headache, fatigue, weakness, and may cause minor effects on kidney function. The following references aid in recognizing occupational hazards and health effects associated with styrene" (see https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/styrene/hazards.html).

"Styrene oxide is considered toxic, mutagenic, and possibly carcinogenic. Styrene oxide is subsequently hydrolyzed in vivo to styrene glycol by the enzyme epoxide hydrolase.[1] The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has described styrene to be "a suspected toxin to the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and respiratory system, among others. [2,3]" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styrene)

Styrene does not seem to be associated with immediate death. While it produces irritation, especially to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, and transient gastrointestinal effects, even high doses are not expected to produce death immediately. Death is related to the long term effects from cancer affecting various organ systems in the body. Consequently, this story seems odd in the sense that deaths are being reported as due to immediate exposure. While high concentrations and prolonged exposure may lead to skin and eye irritation and irritation of the respiratory system, generalized body failure and death are not usually acute signs. While styrene may be produced at the plant, I have to wonder if there was a leak of something else or if the styrene was mixed with something else. The reported clinical signs do not seem to match what we know about straight styrene exposure. - Mod.TG
