Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2

Common Teal: _Anas crecca_ (Anatidae) / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Mallard: _Anas platyrhynchos_ (Anatidae) / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Eurasian Wigeon: _Anas Penelope_ (Anatidae) / - / 2 / 0 / 2 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: HPAI H5 viruses belonging to the 2.3.4.4 B clade have just been detected in northeast Italy in 4 hunted wild birds, namely 2 wigeons (_Mareca Penelope_) and one mallard (_Anas platyrhynchos_) sampled in a hunting area in Rovigo province (Ca Zuliani, Porto Tolle) and one common teal (_Anas crecca_) shot in a hunting area in Venice province (Valle Figheri, Campagnia Lupia). The HA sequence surrounding the cleavage site is highly related to that of HPAI currently circulating in Northern Europe. Identification of the NA subtype and characterization of the full genome is in process.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, screening, control of wildlife reservoirs; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of the Venezie-Padova (National laboratory) / Common Teal / real-time PCR / 20 Nov 2020 / positive
Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of the Venezie-Padova (National laboratory) / Eurasian Wigeon / real-time PCR / 20 Nov 2020 / positive
Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of the Venezie-Padova (National laboratory) / Mallard / real-time PCR / 20 Nov 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
