Hundreds of holiday-makers are being tested for Hepatitis E after an
outbreak on board P&O liner Aurora. Seven passengers contracted the
virus during an 11-week world cruise which ended in Southampton on 28
Mar 2008. A further 600 on board have been sent a letter from the
Health Protection Agency (HPA) requesting a blood sample.

The HPA advises that the virus, which affects the liver, can be fatal
but only in rare cases. P&O said it was cooperating fully with the
inquiry.

It is thought the passengers caught the virus through eating or
drinking contaminated food. The ship has rigorous public health
procedures and underwent a formal public health inspection recently
in which it scored very highly. The HPA said 1100 passengers
volunteered to be screened, but only a sample of 600 have been
selected to be sent a questionnaire asking them what they ate and
drank on board and requesting a blood sample if they have been
exposed to the virus.

In a statement, it said: "Seven cases of Hepatitis E have been
confirmed amongst passengers on the Aurora world cruise who travelled
between 7 Jan and 28 Mar 2008. The agency has been coordinating a
study of the incident by inviting passengers from the cruise to
answer a questionnaire and provide a small sample of blood to test.
The cruise has visited many locations including countries in which
Hepatitis E is endemic. The illness was most likely contracted by
eating or drinking contaminated food or water during the cruise.
Person-to-person transmission is very uncommon and unlikely. The ship
has rigorous public health procedures and underwent a formal public
health inspection recently in which it scored very highly."

Symptoms of the illness, which is a severe form of liver
inflammation, include yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and
darkening of the urine. It can take up to 60 days to appear in
patients and takes up to 4 weeks to clear.

[The number of confirmed cases of hepatitis E has increased from 4 to
7 since the liner ended its world cruise in Southampton on 28 Mar
2008. Another 600 asymptomatic passengers are being screened. In view
of the long incubation period of hepatitis E -- up to 60 days -- it
may be that a small number of additional cases will be identified.
However, in view of the fact that the liner docked at ports in
countries where hepatitis E is endemic, it is unlikely that the
source of the infection will be identified. - Mod.CP]
