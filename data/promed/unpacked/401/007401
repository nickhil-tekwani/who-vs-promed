More Sussex measles cases
-----------------------
Latest figures reveal there have been 314 confirmed reports of the virus so far this year and more are expected to be confirmed in the coming weeks. At the end of June, the number had reached 232, and on July 28 it was 304. The county has more cases than anywhere else in the country apart from Merseyside.

Brighton and Hove is the hardest hit area, with 186 reports, while East Sussex has 88 and West Sussex, 40. There were 173 cases across the county in 2011. The actual number of cases is believed to be higher because not every suspected measles case is sent for testing.

Health bosses say measles is potentially a serious condition. The most common complications of measles are ear infections, pneumonia, diarrhoea and related dehydration. Other less common complications include convulsions and encephalitis, an infection that causes the brain to swell. Health bosses say poor take up rates for the two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine have contributed to the outbreak. Clinics are being held in Brighton and Hove during the summer holidays to get people up-to-date with their measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations.

Measles cases increase
-------------------
There have been almost twice the number of measles cases in England and Wales in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year, official figures show. The figure had risen from 497 to 964, the Health Protection Agency said. There are currently significant measles outbreaks in Merseyside and Sussex.

The agency is urging parents to ensure children are up to date with their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations before the school begins. Measles can cause serious illness and can, in some cases, be fatal.
Complications can include meningitis and encephalitis -- inflammation of the lining of the brain. Rarer disorders of the eye, heart and nervous system can also develop.

Rubella, known as German measles, has also increased, with 57 cases reported between January and June in England and Wales - more than the annual totals for each of the previous nine years.

Measles is usually a mild infection. But if a woman becomes infected in early pregnancy, it can cause birth defects.
Latest data on immunisations across England shows uptake rates of 93% for the first MMR jab and 87% for the second.
In Wales, the figures are 92% and 87%. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the Health Protection Agency, said: "Measles can be very serious and parents should understand the risks associated with the infection, which in severe cases can result in death. "Although uptake of the MMR has improved in recent years some children do not get vaccinated on time and some older children, who missed out when uptake was lower, have not had a chance to catch up.
"Therefore, there are still enough people who are not protected to allow some large outbreaks to occur among unvaccinated individuals." She added: "It's vital that children receive both doses of the MMR vaccination and ahead of returning to school after the holidays, we are urging parents to ensure their children have received the two doses, which will provide the best protection against the risks associated with measles, mumps and rubella." The HPA is advising parents to check with their GP to see if their child has had both doses of MMR.

Confirmed measles and rubella cases in England and Wales: update to end-June 2012
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of laboratory confirmed cases of measles with onset dates to the end of June 2012 has reached 964. This compares with 497, 84 and 786 in the same periods of 2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively. Nearly half of the 2012 cases to date have been confirmed in the last two months and a further 138 infections have been confirmed in individuals with symptoms onset in July. The majority of cases in 2012 have been from the North West (associated with the outbreak in Liverpool and Merseyside [1]) and the South East regions.

Clusters of measles cases have been reported from mid-May with links to the travelling communities in south east England (genotype D4) and Yorkshire and Humber region (genotype B3). Since June, 49 suspected traveller cases have been identified in the South West, South East, East of England and West Midlands regions. Many of these cases have attended events open to members of this community from across England and involve both D4 and B3 genotypes. Over recent years, several large measles outbreaks have been reported in Irish traveller communities and, with the exception of 2011, increased national transmission often occurs in association with traveller social events starting in the early summer months [2-5]. Only 15 cases have been confirmed so far, but the incident is being handled as a Level 3 Outbreak within the Agency because of the potential for national spread. A leaflet for the traveller community has been produced and is being uploaded onto websites aimed at that community [6].

The number of cases of confirmed rubella so far in 2012 (57) has exceeded the annual totals for each of the last nine years. The cases have mainly been associated with importation from Europe; they include two large clusters in the South East region - the first affected seven teenagers in a boarding school where the index cases arrived from Romania and the second was linked to unvaccinated siblings returning from a boarding school in France with limited secondary transmission within the local community. This reflects the current epidemiology in the EU and EEA countries contributing to enhanced surveillance of measles and rubella in Europe. Of the 17,821 cases of rubella reported in January to June 2012, 99% were from Romania and Poland [6]. Of the 4513 cases of measles reported for the same period over 90% were from France, Romania, Italy, Spain and the UK [7].

Pakistan's Measles Deaths Hinder Global Goals
---------------------------------------
PESHAWAR: Measles outbreaks, which have killed at least 100 children in Pakistan's militancy-hit border areas since May, have prompted calls by experts for better cooperation in territories adjacent to Afghanistan with international immunisation campaigns. "The latest victims of this paediatric disease are children in the Mohmand Agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) where nine deaths have been confirmed as a result of non-vaccination," Dr. Anwar Shah, top health officer in the agency, told IPS. Shah blamed unsettled conditions caused by Taliban militancy as well as poor public awareness of the value of vaccination for the outbreak of measles in the seven agencies and six border regions that make up the FATA and in adjacent Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

"My eight-year-old son died of measles last month. He hadn't been immunised," a farmer in the Lakaro area of Mohmand Agency, told IPS over telephone. He said he had to take his three surviving children to Charsadda, one of the 25 districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, to have them vaccinated against measles.

In FATA's North Waziristan, where the outlawed Tehreek Taliban Pakistan group banned oral polio vaccination (OPV) in June, an estimated 163,000 children are said to be exposed to poliomyelitis. The result of the ban on OPV is that the FATA is now the only polio-endemic region in the world that harbours two strains of poliovirus, posing a threat to countries certified polio-free, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) officials. According to Asghar Ali, a WHO doctor, most of the FATA's seven agencies have less than 45 percent vaccination coverage against the national target of 95 percent set by the 'Prime Minister's Emergency Polio Eradication Plan 2012'.

The situation is worst in the South Waziristan agency where the Taliban has ordered a ban on all vaccinations, leaving the children vulnerable not only to polio but also to measles and other infectious diseases. On Jul. 31, South Waziristan's chief surgeon Azmat Hayat Khan issued a warning that the Taliban's blanket ban could result in a measles outbreak and more deaths. "The problem is complex because apart from the ban on vaccination there is a shortage of vaccines," Khan told IPS. "Measles-affected children need to be admitted to hospital within 24 hours and this is not possible in the tribal areas where people lack transport or resources to move their children to facilities in KP," Khan said.

Khan said that besides the 100-odd children known to have died of measles since May about 3,000 have been treated in hospitals. "When unvaccinated children get measles, they need to be rushed to hospitals if they are to survive," Muhammad Aman, a pediatrician at the Khyber Teaching Hospital in Peshawar, told IPS. Dr. Jan Baz Afridi, top immunisation officer in KP, told IPS that additional vaccinators were being deployed in KP districts. "Our staff now visits villages and makes announcements from mosques over loudspeakers to encourage people to get all children up to 15 years of age immunised," he said.

Fawad Khan, FATA's chief health director, said: "Law and order is another problem hampering the government's effort to promote vaccination. We are looking to the government to ensure security of the health workers to carry out immunisation activities." "Vaccine-preventable ailments do not discriminate between cultures, religions, borders or language," Michael Coleman, communications specialist with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), told IPS. "A small number of unvaccinated children could put at the razor's edge the lives of thousands of children."

In April, UNICEF joined WHO and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States in launching a global strategy to reduce measles deaths to zero by 2015. But the new strategy relies on high vaccination coverage and close monitoring of the spread of measles as well as rubella, using laboratory-backed surveillance and effective communication - grossly lacking in the FATA. Studies by the WHO, published in April, showed that accelerated efforts to reduce measles deaths had resulted in a 74 percent reduction in global measles mortality, from an estimated 535,300 deaths in 2000 to 139,300 in 2010. The WHO study estimated that during the 2000-2010 period, measles vaccine had saved over 9.6 million children.

"Since April, we have immunised 8,000 children against measles in the Jalozai refugee camp (outside Peshawar), where people displaced by military action against the Taliban in FATA are lodged," WHO's Dr. Junaid Shah told IPS. "It is much harder to immunise children in the FATA." Shah said that propaganda by the Taliban against oral polio vaccine had not only harmed the immunisation efforts in the FATA but was now proving to be a setback to global efforts to reduce deaths from measles.

Measles vaccines could have caused infants' deaths in Doti, says DPHO
-----------------------------------------------------------
DIPAYAL: The Doti District Public Health Office today said primary investigations pointed at measles vaccines for the deaths of four infants in Kadamandau of Doti. Four infants between nine and 14 months had died in the remote village in Doti 24 hours after inoculation with measles and DPT (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus) vaccines on Sunday. The two other infants who were also vaccinated on the same day at Deukanda vaccine centre at Kadamandau are undergoing treatment at Doti District Hospital.

Mahendra Dhwoj Adhikary of Doti DPHO said the infants who were administered with other than measles vaccines have not developed any life-threateningsigns. Dr Phanindra Baral at Doti hospital said they could, at this point of time, only surmise that there was something wrong with the vaccines. Few hours after the vaccination, the infants had started vomiting profusely and developed a deathly pallor. The vaccines that were administered to infants were not expired though, said DPHO, adding that the vials of measles vaccines had labels showing expiry date of September 2013. The vaccines were brought to the hospital from Dhangadhi 10 days ago.

Adhikary said with the deaths of four infants, he is in a dilemma whether to continue the vaccination campaign. Condition of those undergoing treatment is improving. Kadamandau locals today staged a sit-in in front of the hospital demanding a thorough investigation and punishment to the guilty. Doti-based human rights organisations also demanded that a probe be launched immediately. Experts to submit report by Sunday

The Child Health Division under the Ministry of Health and Population in Katmandu has formed a committee to investigate into the deaths of four infants in Kadamandau of Doti. CHD Director Dr Taranath Pokhrel said a team will reach Doti by Thursday to find out what went wrong. "An emergency meeting of adverse events following immunisation monitoring committee was held today and it has decided to send a team to Doti," said Dr Pokhrel. "The team comprising representatives from CHD and World Health Organisation and two child specialists will submit its final report by Sunday."

[Death within hours of vaccination suggests gross contamination of the vaccine or during the process of administration of the vaccine, and cannot be accounted for by exposure of the vaccine to extremes of temperature. Further information is awaited.

Doti District is one of the 75 districts of Nepal. The Doti district, with Dipayal as its district headquarters, covers an area of 2,025 km² and has a population (2001) of 207,066. Its location is shown in the map at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doti_District. - Mod.CP]

CDC On Vaccines: Measles Cases Highest Since 1996
--------------------------------------------
The anti-vaccination culture is making headway. CDC has reported 17 outbreaks and 222 measles cases from 211, mostly in unvaccinated people -- the highest since 1996.

To identify areas of under-vaccination for measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases, state and local health departments monitor compliance with school immunization requirements using annual school vaccination assessment reports, supported as a CDC immunization funding objective for the 64 grantees, including the 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), five cities, and eight other reporting areas. CDC also monitors progress toward meeting Healthy People 2020 objectives for the vaccination of children entering kindergarten.

Median coverage with 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was 94.8% among 47 reporting states and DC. Total exemption rates, including medical, religious, and philosophic exemptions, among 49 reporting states and DC, ranged from <0.1% to 7.0% (median: 1.5%). Although statewide levels of vaccination coverage are at or very near target levels, locally low vaccination coverage for extremely transmissible diseases such as measles remains a threat to health.

All reporting grantees allowed medical exemptions, 47 allowed religious exemptions, and 20 allowed philosophic exemptions; two grantees (Mississippi and West Virginia) did not allow exemptions for religious or philosophic reasons.

Overall, among grantees in the 47 states and DC that reported 2011-12 school vaccination coverage, median MMR vaccination coverage was 94.8%, with a range of 86.8% in Colorado to 99.3% in Texas.

The median MMR and 2-dose varicella vaccination coverage levels for children entering kindergarten for the 2011-12 school year were below the Healthy People 2020 target of ≥95%. The high number of measles cases reported in Europe in 2011 contributed to record numbers of imported cases in the United States. Among the U.S. measles cases in persons aged 16 months through 19 years reported in 2011, 76% were in persons not vaccinated for a nonmedical reason.

MMR vaccination coverage and exemptions aggregated at national or state levels can mask substantial vulnerability at the local level, since exemptions cluster geographically. See:
