By press time, 8 Ugandan soldiers on the Somali peacekeeping mission
were still in intensive care at a Nairobi hospital battling a strange
ailment suspected to be a result of poisoning. The soldiers are
feared to have been poisoned through water sources by the Islamist
fundamentalists, Al Shabaab, who are opposed to the interim
government in Somalia and the peacekeeping mission, sources told
Daily Monitor. But Maj Barigye Ba-Hoku, the African Union Peace
Keeping Mission spokesman, yesterday [29 Jul 2009] dismissed the
poisoning claims. "It's not true because this ailment is general and
it has affected the Somalis outside the camps. It's not only the
peacekeepers," he said.

"[Kenyan and Amisom (African Union Mission in Somalia)] doctors are
studying the cause of the illness and they will soon come up with the
report," Maj Ba-Hoku told Daily Monitor by telephone from Mogadishu.
The infected Ugandan peacekeepers are part of the over 50 who have
contracted the ailment that has in the last 3 weeks hit the Burundian
and Ugandan camps in Mogadishu. Al Shabaab early this month [July
2009] claimed they had poisoned Burundian peacekeepers.

Sources who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of
the subject said 4 of the Ugandan soldiers were evacuated from the
Somali capital, Mogadishu, and flown to Nairobi on Tuesday [28 Jul
2009] for treatment at Nairobi International Hospital. The Ugandan
and Burundian camps are about 2 kilometres [1.2 mi] apart, each with
its water tanks. Last week [week of 20 Jul 2009], the Deputy Amisom
Commander, Gen Juvinele Niyoyunguriza, told a group of Ugandan
journalists in Mogadishu that Burundian forces had been infected with
a strange disease.

Gen Niyonyunguriza said 50 soldiers had been admitted and 4 died at
Nairobi International hospital. Mr Gaffel Nkolokosa of the African
Union Mission for Somalia [Amisom] in Nairobi yesterday [29 Jul 2009]
said 12 of the 50 were evacuated from Mogadishu 3 weeks ago and
brought to Kenya for treatment after exhibiting symptoms similar to
those of their colleagues who had been admitted. He, however, said
they had recovered and returned to Burundi.

According to sources, the Ugandan soldiers had developed fever and
skin rash, before developing body organ failure. Amisom Medical
Officer James Kiyengo said on Friday [24 Jul 2009] that the strange
ailment is a bacterial infection caused by rat urine. He identified
the infection as leptospirosis. "It is spread by a rat. A rat could
have urinated in the water tank. We need to keep hygiene and keep
rats off," he said last week [week of 20 Jul 2009]. He said the
ailment causes fever and skin rash, but added that its spread can
stopped through isolation of cases and giving them doxycycline injections.

Col Kiyengo said they had received drugs from the Islamic Relief
Association in the United States and Korean International Cooperation
Agency for treatment of the force and the general Somali community.
Amisom, which comprises 4300 Ugandan and Burundian soldiers, has come
under intense attack from Al Shabaab, who consider the peacekeepers
as an occupying force. 12 Ugandan peacekeepers have been killed since 2007.

Al Shabaab, a youthful group that has been terrorising Somalis since
2006, has now turned to using both psychological and combat war to
scare Somalis from supporting Amisom and the Transitional Federal
Government, which has been in place for barely 7 months.

The African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom) has ruled out water
poisoning as the cause of a ''strange'' disease that has struck its
soldiers in Mogadishu. Amisom spokesman Gaffel Nkolokosa said in
Nairobi on Monday [3 Aug 2009] that the organisation was waiting for
an official medical report on what has made Ugandan and Burundian
soldiers to fall sick. The soldiers have been admitted to Aga Khan
Hospital [in Nairobi, Kenya]. "It is not true the water was
poisoned," he said. The AU soldiers are defending the Somali
government from an array of Islamic rebels fighting to topple it.
Al-Shabaab, the biggest of the rebel groups, had claimed that it
poisoned water used by Amisom.

In Kampala, defence and military spokesperson Felix Kulayigye
confirmed that 11 UPDF [Uganda People's Defence Force] soldiers
admitted to hospital had been discharged. 2 of the 6 remaining
soldiers are still in intensive care. The rest of the soldiers have
been released and would not be returning to their camp in Somalia,
sources have said. 17 Ugandan soldiers were flown to Aga Khan
Hospital after exhibiting symptoms similar to those afflicting
Burundian troops.

Doctors have also confirmed that the Ugandans had not been poisoned
as had earlier been claimed by al-Shabaab. Symptoms of the illness
include fever, swelling in the lower limbs, and jaundice (yellowing
of the skin and eyes).

The illness is believed to be leptospirosis, also known as Weil's
syndrome. It is said even the locals around the Amisom bases were
suffering the same ailment, thus ruling out poisoning. The World
Health Organisation has been carrying out investigations but is yet
to release results.

Re: ProMED-mail Leptospirosis - Somalia: susp, RFI 20090802.2706
----------------------------------------------------------------
I ran this scenario through Gideon [Global Infectious Disease &
Epidemiology Network]. Assuming that these findings represent a
single infectious disease, the most likely diagnosis is anthrax. If,
as claimed, the peacekeepers were intentionally infected, anthrax is
the only relevant disease in Somalia, which has bioterror potential.

[Although according to the news releases, officials seem sure that
leptospirosis was the diagnosis for the disease affecting the Ugandan
and Burundian peacekeepers in Mogadishu, the clinical picture that
was given in the prior ProMED post (Leptospirosis - Somalia: susp,
RFI 20090802.2706) lacked certain features that are characteristic of
leptospirosis, such as myalgias, conjunctival suffusion, and
jaundice. However, the 2nd news release above now includes jaundice
in the clinical picture. In addition, although the outbreak was
thought to be intentionally perpetrated by Al Shabaab, who consider
these peacekeepers as an occupying force, the news releases above
discount this, mentioning that Somalis in the community were
suffering from the illness as well.

Dr Berger brings up the possibility that the cause of the outbreak in
the Ugandan and Burundian forces is anthrax, having assumed this
event was bioterrorism. I presume he means the inhalation form of
anthrax, which could account for chest pain and difficulty breathing
that has been part of the clinical picture (see ProMED post
Leptospirosis - Somalia: susp, RFI 20090802.2706), and multiorgan
failure mentioned in the news release above.

"Skin rash" that was not further characterized in the news release
above could be cutaneous anthrax that was seen in half of the 22
infected persons exposed to anthrax spores in the 2001 bioterrorism
event in the USA. However, the appearance of cutaneous anthrax is
distinctive and I assume would be identified as such by the
physicians in Nairobi. A detailed description of the skin rash in the
Ugandan and Burundian cases would be helpful.

In addition, many of the patients with the clinical picture that
included respiratory symptoms were said to have recovered, whereas
the mortality rate for inhalation anthrax is very high; even in the
2001 outbreak in the USA the case-fatality rate for inhalation
anthrax was 45 percent. Also, no mention was made in the Ugandan and
Burundian cases of radiologic findings of mediastinal widening
consistent with adenopathy or large pleural effusions, which are
commonly seen in patients with inhalation anthrax, and no one was
said to have meningitis, which was seen as the presenting illness in
the index case in the 2001 outbreak in the USA, and occurred in half
the autopsied cases with inhalation anthrax in the 1979 Russian
outbreak. For these reasons, I doubt anthrax is the cause of illness
in the Ugandan and Burundian peacekeepers.
