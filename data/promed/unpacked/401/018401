Latest information on Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------
Outbreaks of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in poultry
were reported in Thailand, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Indonesia during
the preceding month [March 2005]. A new outbreak is currently being
investigated in Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). FAO's
diagnostic laboratory and surveillance network project for East Asia
is providing assistance in diagnosis. Although the number of
outbreaks have decreased in Thailand and Viet Nam, the need for
vigilance to find potentially new cases and their rapid isolation
remain high priorities. Biosecurity in the domestic poultry
production system is of utmost importance.
Country situation
Viet Nam:
Last known outbreak: 29 Mar - 4 Apr 2005. A total of 1300 ducks have
either died or been culled in Tra Vinh Province. The confirmed human
cases in Viet Nam reported by WHO have been 33 since 30 Dec 2004, of
which 15 were fatal.
Thailand:
Last known outbreak: 10-17 Mar 2005. A total of 50 birds have died or
been culled in Ban Dan Lan Hoi district, Sukhothai Province.
Cambodia:
Last known outbreak: 22-28 Mar 2005. A total of 139 chickens and
ducks have been culled in Keatha Vong Leu village near the Vietnamese
border. A 28-year-old man who died on 22 Mar 2005 and an 8-year-old
girl who died on 07 Apr 2005 both from Bantey Meas district, Kampot
Province were confirmed to have been infected with H5N1.
Indonesia:
During Jan - Mar 2005, HPAI had killed a total of 281 730 birds in
Central Java, South Sulawesi and West Java Provinces. In Central Java
Province, some quail farms have been affected and over 77 000 poultry
have either died or been culled. The disease also attacked the native
chicken in Bojolali and Sragen districts. In South Sulawesi Province,
the deaths of the birds were observed in Maros, Parepare, Pinrang,
Sidrap, Soppeng and Wajo Regencies. Inter-island chicken trade from
South Sulawesi has been banned since mid March 2005. In West Java
Province, 21 000 dead chickens were reported between Jan - early Mar
in Cirebon, Subang, Indramayu, Purwakarta and Sukabumi
Regencies/municipalities. Cirebon municipality had the [highest]
reported cases with about 12 000 chickens affected. No bird flu cases
were reported in Cirebon last year [2004]. HPAI had mostly affected
quails in West Java. In Cirebon, destroyed quails were said to have
been brought from Sleman (Yogyakarta).
Some 200 000 doses of vaccine against H5N1 infection had been
distributed to infected areas, and the government has set aside Rp
750 million (USD 79 000) and Rp 250 million [USD 26 000] backup fund
to assist poultry breeders who destroyed their bird flu-infected
flocks. Since 31 Mar 2005, West Java authorities have stopped all
poultry traffic into the area. Cirebon has been declared as an
epidemic area. The poultry-check operation targeting chickens, quails
and ducks was held in the Losari area, which is on the border and
main route of poultry trucks from Central Java, Yogyakarta and East
Java.
Democratic People's Republic of Korea:
Outbreak of avian influenza was reported in 3 chicken farms including
the Hadang Chicken Farm in Pyonyang province. The State Emergency
Veterinary and Anti-Epizootic Committee has been organized and
movement control, and increased surveillance in poultry farms has
been implemented. A total of 219 000 poultry have been slaughtered.
Increased mortalities were observed in Hadang Farm (160 000 - 200 000
layers), and in 2 neighboring farms belonging to the same company
(approximately 4 km from the Hadang farm with 560 000 and 300 000
layers, respectively). Veterinary authorities have vaccinated birds
in these farms and the surrounding area. There is a suspicion of HPAI
after local tests were made, but due to lack of reagents no
scientifically sound diagnosis could be made. A FAO expert from China
is working with DPRK authorities in the diagnosis. Indirect evidence
suggests that the strain is H7. Additional characterisation is
awaited.
