Exercise Demonstrates Disease Outbreak Would be Costly
-------------------------------------------------
A foreign animal disease outbreak in Texas could cost government entities
more than $50 million per county, according to estimates tallied up in
early November, when livestock health officials simulated an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in South Texas to test emergency preparedness.
Worse yet, the figures compiled by the Hidalgo County emergency management
coordinator do not include indemnity payments to pay producers for
livestock destroyed to prevent the spread of disease, or lost revenue due
to inevitable state and federal quarantines that would restrict livestock
and livestock product movement for months, or possibly, years. Marketing
opportunities would be restored only when an affected region could prove it
is disease-free.
"FMD, without a doubt, is the most economically important livestock
disease, and recent outbreaks around the world make this highly contagious
virus a tangible threat to our domestic livestock. This disease also
strikes a variety of species, so it was an excellent choice for a test
exercise. If we could develop our ability to fight FMD, we could stop any
disease," said Dr. Linda Logan, Texas' State Veterinarian and head of the
Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock health
regulatory agency.
Dr. Logan said the $50 million cost estimate was just the initial economic
impact on Texas agriculture. Costs were calculated by Hidalgo County
Emergency Management Coordinator Charlie Montgomery, who worked with
personnel dispatched to the site of the first simulated case in the
practice exercise.
"FMD outbreaks can devastate an animal agricultural-based economy," said
Dr. Logan. "In addition to the enormous direct costs of fighting the
disease, there are also the lost opportunities for trade. A region's
credibility regarding disease prevention and control also could be
critically damaged."
"This exercise gave us a 'homegrown' demonstration about how fast FMD can
get out of hand," pointed out Dr. Max Coats, TAHC's head of animal health
programs. "Immediate action is required. We hope to use this experience
to reinforce the need for producers to report animal illnesses or deaths to
private practitioners or regulatory agencies."
A planning team of livestock health regulatory officials from the U.S.,
Canada, and Mexico developed the exercise with the goal of testing
international communications and decision-making regarding distribution of
the limited supplies of FMD vaccine among the 3 countries.
Within the state, Dr. Coats said the Texas Emergency Response Team (TERT)
practiced working within the state's emergency management system. The
system is a network of county and state agencies capable of providing
much-needed manpower, equipment and technical support. TERT is a
cooperative effort of the TAHC and Texas' U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Veterinary Services staff and is prepared to address disease outbreaks or
natural disasters affecting animals.
The disaster scenario began in mid-October, but for purposes of the
exercise, was not reported to livestock health officials until the first of
November. Officials were told that on October 15 [2000], a South Texas
swine producer retrieved food scraps for his animals from a foreign ship
docked in Brownsville. He fed the uncooked waste food to his pigs, unaware
bits of the meat contained the FMD virus. Although it poses no human
health danger, the virus causes severe blistering in the mouth and around
the muzzle, teats and feet of cloven- or split-hooved animals, including
goats, sheep, cattle, pigs and deer. A very high percentage of animals
exposed to the FMD virus will become ill, and many never recover.
Within a few days, the fictional producer's swine exhibited signs of
illness and several litters of piglets had died. The owner finally
contacted the TAHC on 1 Nov 2000, but by then, he had sold several pigs
from the premises, and more than 1200 susceptible animals had moved through
a nearby livestock market. These animals were exposed to the disease when
the virus became airborne.
"What began as a one-site foreign animal disease investigation in Hidalgo
County literally 'blew up,' within 2 days, as we received reports of sick
animals next door in Cameron County and as far away as Dallas County in
North Texas," said Dr. Dee Ellis, a TAHC area director who headed the TERT
team in South Texas.
"Furthermore, the storyline included our need to 'catch' a truck that had
been contaminated with the virus. The driver had criss-crossed the country
from Harlingen to Canada and back, and from Missouri to the Rocky Mountains,
potentially spreading disease far and wide, " said Ellis.
"To stop the spread of disease, immediate action is required to stop animal
and livestock vehicle movement," said Dr. Ellis. "We needed immediate
producer cooperation to stop livestock hauling, close sale barns, rodeos
and other events in affected areas."
"We also discovered how quickly TAHC commissioners must impose formal
movement restrictions to avoid a massive outbreak," commented Dr.
Logan. "The commissioners must also decide when to request a disaster
declaration, so that affected and exposed animals can be depopulated and
owners can be compensated with government funds. Thanks to the state's
emergency management system, we can draw on staff and equipment needed for
a wide variety of tasks, including depopulating sick animals, maintaining
movement controls and tracing movement of livestock that may have been
exposed to the disease."
"By the third day of the exercise, we were chasing disease and had not been
able to contain infection," commented Dr. Dee Ellis. "Hidalgo, Cameron and
Willacy Counties were placed under a simulated quarantine to slow the
spread of infection. In the exercise, the deer hunting season was
suspended." Dr. Conger explained deer can be affected by the disease, and
moving infected carcasses can spread infection.
By the final day of the exercise, TAHC commissioners stopped livestock
movement statewide. Livestock movement into and out of the state was shut
down, and Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado embargoed Texas livestock. A goat
herd near the infected swine operation became ill and was set for
depopulation, said Dr. Ellis.
In the test scenario, Mexican-imported cattle that were held temporarily at
the livestock market in Hidalgo County developed lameness and
blisters. The Mexican imports had already been transported to a Starr
County feedlot and had exposed 20 000 head of cattle, which would have to
be destroyed.
"For more than 2 years, the TERT team had prepared for a disease outbreak
or natural disaster involving animals," said Dr. Logan. "Thankfully this
was an exercise, and we will continue to fine-tune our plan, sharpen skills
and strengthen partnerships with producers, practitioners and other
agencies in order to be ready when a real disease is introduced or a
natural disaster hits."
Dr. Logan stressed global travel of humans and livestock has greatly
increased the risk of a foreign animal disease outbreak or pest
introduction. She urged producers to report potential signs of disease to
private practitioners, the TAHC area offices, or agency headquarters.
Danger signs in a herd or flock include: blistering around an animal's
mouth, teats, muzzle or hooves; unusual ticks or maggots; staggering,
falling or central nervous system disorders; and severe sudden illness or
death loss affecting a high percentage of animals.
