The Department of Epidemiology of the Municipal Health Foundation (FMS) of Teresina (FMS) received laboratory confirmation of a case of human infection with the Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) on 7 Dec 2021. An adult patient developed neurological symptoms in March of the same year [2021]. Although she lived and became ill in Lagoa do Mato - Maranhao (probable place of infection), the patient sought medical care and was admitted to the Emergency Hospital of Teresina (HUT), where she received treatment. There was a good clinical evolution and the ELISA-IgM exams and neutralization test by plaque reduction performed at the Evandro Chagas Institute were positive for SLEV - thus fulfilling criteria for case confirmation.

At the time of hospitalization, the case was reported and the investigation began through the Surveillance Program for Neuroinvasive Diseases caused by Arbovirus - started in Teresina in 2013. This surveillance strategy is implemented in all public hospitals (municipal, state and federal) and private institutions in Teresina, with the support of teams from the Hospital Epidemiology Centers. Currently, the public hospital network in Teresina has 13 hospitals and 13 Hospital Centers for Epidemiology. Through epidemiological surveillance, cases of neuroinvasive syndromes are investigated in order to detect infections by dengue, Zika, chikungunya, West Nile virus and other viruses transmitted through mosquito bites (arboviruses). To date, more than 700 cases with neurological syndromes have been reported and investigated -- 107 in the recent year, but this is the 1st confirmed case of human SLEV infection diagnosed by the program.

Sporadic cases or small outbreaks of the disease have already occurred in some Brazilian states, as well as infections in birds and animals. Saint Louis encephalitis is not transmitted from person to person, even through mosquito bites: for transmission to occur, it is necessary for a mosquito vector to bite a bird with a high amount of virus in its bloodstream and, then bite a human. Still, very few individuals bitten by infected mosquitoes develop neurological disease, manifested by meningitis (fever, vomiting, headache and neck), encephalitis (fever, mental confusion, seizures, paralysis, tremors, coma), myelitis (muscle paralysis, loss of sensation and control of urination and evacuation) or polyradiculoneuritis (muscle weakness, numbness, shortness of breath). Most of the mild cases evolve well, but up to 20% of the elderly affected by neurological forms may die.

According to Amariles Borba, director of Health Surveillance, as soon as the results were received, the State Health Department of Maranhão and the Ministry of Health were advised. Among the recommended public health measures, she highlights: strengthening surveillance of neuroinvasive diseases caused by arboviruses and vector control strategies (similar to what is done for dengue control), as well as recommendations to the population to minimize the exposure of individuals to potential transmitting mosquitoes. In view of the diagnosis of a case of infection by SLEV, the Management of Epidemiology of the FMS issued an alert aimed at health professionals in the country.

[St Louis encephalitis cases are rare and occur sporadically in Brazil in humans and even more rarely in horses. This is the 1st SLEV case that ProMED has posted in Maranhao state. According to the above report, the case occurred in March (2021) but the laboratory confirmation was announced on 7 Dec 2021. Should additional human cases occur in Maranhao state, their arbovirus neurological disease surveillance system is likely to detect them. - Mod.TY
