[The 1st Ukrainian ASF outbreak was detected end July 2012 on a small backyard holding with 5 swine, of which 3 were found infected. The location was on the northern shores of the Azov Sea, in the Zaporizhia (Zaporiz'ka) oblast, southeastern Ukraine, about 170 km from the border with ASF-infected Russia. According to media-derived information, the possible source of infection were people from Russia coming to Ukraine on holidays with meat products; no confirmation has been obtained.

Thanks to early diagnosis and to effective measures, probably supported by some good fortune, the Ukrainian outbreak has remained solitary. This is good news.

Russia has experienced 233 officially-reported ASF outbreaks since 2009; the most recent officially reported outbreak took place in August 2012.
