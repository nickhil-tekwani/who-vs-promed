The Hospital Authority has received 9 pneumonia cases of unidentified
cause, involving 7 men and 2 women who visited Guangdong, Hunan,
Hubei, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces before the onset of symptoms.
The figure brings the total number of reports to 90 since an enhanced
surveillance programme began [15 Jun 2006].
Public hospitals are providing rapid tests for these patients, and
the cases have been reported to the Centre for Health Protection.
The Hospital Authority boosted its surveillance programme following
notification from the Guangdong Health Department of a suspected
human case of avian flu in Shenzhen.
Under the programme, public hospitals report to the authority's
electronic flu system all patients who have pneumonia of an
unidentified cause and who had travelled to affected areas or
countries with confirmed human cases of bird flu in the seven days
before the onset of symptoms.

In view of a human case of avian influenza H5N1 in Shenzhen, the
Hospital Authority (HA) started the 3-week Enhanced Surveillance
Programme from 15 Jun 2006.
Public hospitals should report to the Authority's e-Flu system all
patients fulfilling the case definition of having pneumonia (all
types) of unidentified etiology and who had travelled in the 7 days
before the onset of symptoms, to affected areas/ countries with
confirmed human cases of avian influenza infection in the past 6 months.
HA today (20 Jun) received the report of a total of 14 cases (8 male,
6 female, aged 2.5- months to 85 [years?]). So far a total of 70
cases (39 male, 31 female, aged 2.5 months to 89 [years]) have been
received. These patients have visited Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian
and Zhejiang before the onset of symptoms. HA has reported the cases
to the Centre for Health Protection.
Public hospitals are providing rapid tests for these patients.

[In response to the report of a human case of H5N1 infection in a
person in Shenzhen, the health sector in Hong Kong has implemented
active surveillance for pneumonia of unknown etiology in people with
a history of travel to the Chinese mainland. Since the
implementation of this heightened surveillance there have been 70
cases reported. While this number may sound alarming, one does not
know what the baseline rate of pneumonia of unknown etiology is in Hong Kong.
With a population estimated at 6.9 million, a report of 70 cases of
pneumonia in one week yields a rate of approximately 1 case per 100
000 population. In contrast, in a report on pneumonia surveillance
in the state of Connecticut over a 3-year period (2001-2004), there
were an average of 305 hospital admissions per week, with an increase
to over 350 pneumonia cases per week during the influenza season in
2003-2004 (Hadler JL, Siniscalchi A, Dembek Z. Hospital Admissions
Syndromic Surveillance --Connecticut, October 2001-- June 2004. MMWR,
26 Aug, 2005 / 54(Suppl);169-173, accessible at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su5401a27.htm#fig1 >).
With an average population of 3.5 million during the 3-year period
(<http://www.ct.gov/ecd/cwp/view.asp?a=1106&q=250666>), the weekly
pneumonia rate was an estimated 8.8 per 100 000 population. While
the reported pneumonia admissions as presented in the Connecticut
study did not differentiate by etiologic agent, the estimated rate in
Connecticut is almost 9 times higher than that seen in Hong Kong
during the past week of active surveillance. Clearly more
information from knowledgeable sources in Hong Kong would be greatly
appreciated to help put the above reports into perspective. - Mod.MPP]
