The following background information on dengue in Singapore was extracted
from the GIDEON software program: <http://www.cyinfo.com>
Dengue has been an administratively reportable disease in Singapore since
1966.
Highest rates occur among ethnic Chinese and during July to October. The
eastern region accounts for 30.7% of cases, the northeast 22%, and the
southeast 16.7%. In 1993, seroprevalence was 39%, with rates of 65% to 69%
in the eastern region.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever was first recognized in Singapore in 1960 (200
cases, one fatal). Massive outbreaks of DHF were recorded in 1966 and 1967.
846 cases of DHF (18 fatal) were reported in 1968; 71 in 1970; 64 in 1971;
1,479 (27 fatal) were reported in 1973; 384 (2 fatal) in 1978; 253 in 1980.

reported among ethnic Chinese (141.4/100 000) and residents of landed
