[1] Cholera - Malawi (Dedza, Mangochi districts)

2 people are reported to have died while 102 others are currently receiving
treatment in Dedza following the outbreak of cholera in the district. Dedza
becomes the 2nd district in the country to experience cholera outbreak
after Mangochi, which detected its 1st cholera case in November 2005.
Director of preventative health services in the Ministry of Health, Habib
Somanje, said on Tue 13 Dec 2005, that only 2 people have died in Dedza
since the outbreak started in November 2005. He also said that, since Sun
11 Dec 2005, no new cases have been reported. But Somanje said the outbreak
has indicated that health officials in Dedza failed to implement strategies
on how to contain cholera that were formulated during a meeting his
ministry had with health officials from various districts.
Mangochi was the 1st district in the country to report a cholera outbreak
in 2005, with about 50 people already infected. Somanje said the district
was still reporting cases despite there being no casualties. The district
recorded about 200 cases in 2000. Last year (2004), 70 cases were reported.
But in 2002, the district registered 678 cases with 16 deaths. Countrywide,
a total of 2425 cases and 44 deaths were reported in 2002.
Malawi recorded its 1st case of _Vibrio cholerae_ infection in 1973 with
about 35 000 infections and since then the epidemic has been claiming a lot
of lives in the country. In 1998/99 cholera attacked 3000 people, while
2000 lives were lost in 2001/02. In 2004, the country registered about 12
040 cases of cholera.

5 people reportedly died last Thu 8 Dec 2005 evening after a sudden
extensive outbreak of cholera at Kumawu in the Sekyere East district of
Ashanti. 25 students of the Tweneboah Koduah Secondary School had to be
rushed to the local Health center that evening for treatment.
Most of the affected students were admitted while others were treated and
discharged. By Fri evening, 9 Dec 2005, as many as 55 cases including
members of the townsfolk had been recorded, and admissions at both Kumawu
Clinic and the Effiduase hospital had increased.
So alarming was the situation that the headmaster, Mr Gaspa Ahover, in
consultation with the District Chief Executive, Mr Philip Basoah, and the
express approval of the board of directors of the school, had to order the
early closure of the school last Friday 9 Dec 2005. School was to vacate
for the Christmas holidays on 21 Dec 2005.
Tweneboah Koduah Secondary School had been hard hit by the epidemic because
the pumping machine regulating the mechanized borehole at Wonoo, which
feeds the water tanks provided by the GETFund, had broken down.

[3] Diarrhea, fatal - Liberia-Guinea Border

At least 7 Liberians are said to have died in Gbakedou, Lofa County as a
result of an outbreak of diarrhea and over a dozen others are reportedly on
critical list, seeking medical attention at the Voinjama Health Center.
Gbakedou in Lofa County forms part of the boundary between Liberia and
Guinea and plays host to over 1000 Liberians and Guineans. It is 15 km from
the provincial city of Voinjama.
Speaking to a team of journalists who visited Voinjama, ICRC medical field
officer Mohammed Dehada attributed the cause of the outbreak of the
epidemic to over-crowdedness of the town, poor sanitation conditions, and
drinking of contaminated creek water.
According to the ICRC medical field officer, medical practitioners have
been trying to treat affected persons, but were finding it increasingly
difficult due to the lack of any health center in Gbakedou.
"The outbreak of diarrhea is posing serious health problems to ordinary
Lofans," the ICRC medical field officer said. He disclosed that the
Voinjama Health Medical Center [is treating] dozens of diarrhea patients,
most of whom are children and the elderly.
"Authorities at the Voinjama Health Center said that they receive over 4
diarrhea victims a week," Mr Dehada noted.
Besides the outbreak of bloody diarrhea at the Liberia-Guinea border,
health practitioners also spoke of the outbreak of cholera in Zorzor, Foyah
and Kolahum districts.
In these areas, these diseases are reportedly taking the lives of women,
children and the elderly. Health practitioners told newsmen that due to the
unavailability of cars to transport the affected patients to the county's
only referral hospital in Voinjama, the number of deaths continues to rise.
