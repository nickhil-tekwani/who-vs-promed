In response to ProMED-mail posting of information published by UK Press
Association:
British and Canadian public health authorities recently became aware of
this outbreak of acute gastroenteritis and have initiated a full
epidemiological investigation on board the affected vessel with the full
cooperation of the company, Airtours plc, Lancashire, UK. The UK PHLS has
identified Norwalk Virus from a sample from an ill passenger. Further
information will have to await the outcome of the investigation.
Because the vessel did not board any additional passengers and is currently
sailing across the Atlantic for an extended period, there is no need, at
present, to issue travel advisories.
Canadian authorities investigated the suggestion that this outbreak was
related to possible sources in British Columbia. At present, there is no
evidence of Norwalk Virus outbreaks in that province or elsewhere in
Canada.
