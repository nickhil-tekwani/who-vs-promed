The use of street drugs known as "bath salts" can lead to flesh-eating disease, a new study warns. It describes the first known case of necrotizing fasciitis caused by an intramuscular injection of bath salts.

So-called bath salts are sold as synthetic powders that "often contain various amphetamine-like chemicals," according to the United States National Institute on Drug Abuse, which in February [2011] warned that injections might cause the ravaging skin condition.

Study authors Dr Russell R Russo, a third-year orthopedic surgery resident at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans School of Medicine, and colleagues, saw the effects firsthand. They treated a 34 year old woman who developed forearm pain and redness after she attended a party. She had no other symptoms but did have a small red puncture wound on her arm. The woman eventually admitted that she injected bath salts two days before her symptoms began.

The doctors reexamined her and determined that she had necrotizing fasciitis. The disease progressed so rapidly that the doctors had to amputate the woman's arm, shoulder, and collarbone and perform a radical mastectomy. The woman later underwent skin grafting and rehabilitation.

The study was published in the January issue of the journal Orthopedics [Russo R, Marks N, Morris K, et al. Life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis due to "bath salts" injection. Orthopedics 2012;35(1):124. Available at http://www.orthosupersite.com/view.aspx?rid=91162].

"Despite the drug's legal status, it must be treated as illicit, and one must be suspicious when examining a patient with this clinical history because the diagnosis of flesh-eating bacteria can masquerade as abscesses and cellulitis," the authors said in a journal news release.

[The article described in the above news release is said to be the first report of necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis from intramuscular injection of bath salts [Russo R, Marks N, Morris K, et al. Life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis due to "bath salts" injection. Orthopedics 2012;35(1):124. Available at http://www.orthosupersite.com/view.aspx?rid=91162]. The patient in the report described injecting "bath salts" intramuscularly (because she could not obtain intravascular access) 2 nights prior to developing symptoms of increasing right forearm pain and erythema. She initially had 1 small red puncture wound at the injection site and rapidly developed skin sloughing around the injection site with a malodorous drainage. Necrotic tissue, including non-contractile muscle, was extensively debrided at surgery. Bacterial isolates from this patient were reported to be a mixture of aerobes and anaerobes, namely the aerobes, alpha hemolytic _Streptococcus_, _Streptococcus viridans_, and the anaerobes, _Gemella morbillorum_, _Peptostreptococcus micros_ and _Actinomyces odontolyticus_.

Necrotizing fasciitis, also called "flesh-eating disease" is a rapidly progressive bacterial infection that destroys the soft tissues covering muscle (fascia). Patients usually complain of intense pain in the involved region that initially may seem out of proportion to the external appearance of the overlying skin. Aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue and administration of antibiotics are necessary. However, surgical intervention is often delayed after hospital admission, because these infections can be difficult to recognize in their early stages, and deep muscle necrosis may not be appreciated early on. The commonest type of bacteria causing necrotizing fasciitis is _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A streptococcus), but fungi (such as mucor) and other bacteria (such as _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Vibro vulnificus_ and mixtures of multiple aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species can cause necrotizing fasciitis.

A variety of infections, including anthrax, tetanus, botulism, clostridial gas gangrene, necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis, can follow injection of illicit drugs. If the injected material contains anything that could cause vasoconstriction (such as epinephrine), it would set up anaerobic conditions that would enhance the risk of disease with obligate anaerobes.

"Bath salts" contain a variety of drugs that have central nervous system stimulatory effects. These drugs include methylenedioxy pyrovalerone (MDPV), mephedrone (methylmethcathinone, also known as M-Cat, Meow, 4-MMC, or Bubbles), and methylone (methylenedioxymethcathinone, also known as bk-MDMA, M1, or Explosion) (http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20110908/bath-salts-used-to-get-high-are-now-illegal). Mephedrone and methylone are synthetic chemical derivatives of the psychedelic herb khat. These drugs can cause agitation, paranoia, hallucinations, anorexia, anxiety, insomnia, or muscle tremors. These drugs were made Schedule I substances in the United States in September 2011 (http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20110908/bath-salts-used-to-get-high-are-now-illegal); schedule I by definition have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and, therefore, may not be prescribed, administered, or dispensed for medical use (http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/). "Bath salts" can be snorted, smoked, or injected.
