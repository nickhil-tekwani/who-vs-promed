I read with interest your correspondence concerning hippo carnivory. I
witnessed this phenomenon in the Serengetti a couple of years ago. The
hippos that I observed were a group of around 30-40 animals that had become
marooned in a pool along a riverbed that was drying up fast; there was no
other water for them to escape to for more than 20 to 30 miles. The hippos
were being menaced by crocodiles, who were lining up on the bank of the
pool. I saw a female hippo attack a small calf, kill, and devour it. I have
often wondered what the trigger was for this unusual behavior. Perhaps the
mother felt that the crocodiles were going to get the calf, so she might as
well get it before they did.
My father may comment on this anthrax outbreak in Uganda. In the late
seventies, we witnessed hippos dying of anthrax at the famous "Hippo Pool"
in the then Queen Elisabeth National Park. I don't remember seeing
cannibalism at that time, but I would imagine that the whole area would
have been heavily contaminated with anthrax spores. Interestingly, we
didn't see other contact species being affected. Is there a possibility
that there are species-specific strains of anthrax?

[Thanks to John for his comments verifying Joe Dudley's observations. John
spent many years in Tanzania. There is only one strain of _Bacillus
anthracis_ found essentially in only one species, and that is the one
associated with wood bison in northern Alberta and the Canadian North West
Territories. The issue is not so much species-dependence as
behavior-dependence. In those Canadian areas, there are very few other
target species sharing the wood bison areas; the caribou are elsewhere;
wolves have disappeared for unknown reasons; and only the occasional moose
will be affected, as it prefers to feed in flooded areas. In areas where
there is scrub, blow flies and browsers are involved (i.e. kudu or white
tailed deer); grazing animals in open savannah are rarely afflicted. With
these hippos, there is contaminated water involved as well as, apparently,
feeding on infected carcasses. In Africa, contaminated water, whether in
river ponds or in artificial troughs, has long been seen as a risk to wild
and domestic ruminants drinking there. But, with the activity, they may
well be going elsewhere to drink. - Mod.MHJ]
