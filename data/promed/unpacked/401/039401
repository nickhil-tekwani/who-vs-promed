Montana loses federal disease-free status for cattle
----------------------------------------------------
Montana has lost its federal disease-free status for brucellosis,
triggering mandatory testing of cattle being shipped out-of-state.
[The state will move from free to Class A. - Mod.TG]

Brucellosis, which can cause female cattle to abort their young, has
been found twice in Montana in the last 2 years near Yellowstone
National Park. Eradicated elsewhere in the country, the disease
persists in Yellowstone's bison, elk, and other wildlife and is
occasionally transmitted to cattle.

State Veterinarian Marty Zaluski said Montana must wait until May
2009 to request reinstatement of its disease-free status. That's a
year after brucellosis was most recently found in a cow from a ranch
near Pray. An earlier infection on a ranch in Bridger in May 2007 was
Montana's 1st since 1985.

Federal DNA testing points to wildlife as the source of the Pray
infection. Since no bison are found in that area, Zaluski has said
elk are the most likely culprit.

The testing of cattle is expected to cost ranchers in the state's
billion-dollar cattle industry an estimated USD 6 million to USD 12
million. It will be required of export cattle that are capable of
breeding and over 18 months of age, at a cost of USD 7.50 to USD 12 per head.

A small number of cattle, including those being sent directly to
slaughter, will be exempt from testing.

To regain its disease-free status from the US Department of
Agriculture (USDA), state officials plan to expand cattle
vaccinations and find ways to keep cattle from interacting with wildlife.

"Everyone knew this was coming," Zaluski said. "No one is happy about
losing our brucellosis-free status, but we're optimistic that, by
working together, we can develop practical approaches that reduce the
risks of transmitting the disease."

Meanwhile, Wyoming also is at risk of losing its disease-free status
after an infection was discovered in June [2008] on a ranch near Daniel.

Officials from both states have complained that federal regulations
for the disease are too rigid, and fail to account for the unique
situation of brucellosis in Yellowstone's wildlife.

But in announcing Montana's loss of disease-free status, the
Department of Agriculture contended the potential economic toll would
be far greater -- an estimated USD 80 million annually -- if the
disease spread to other states.
