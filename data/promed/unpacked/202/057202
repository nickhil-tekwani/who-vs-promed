Cases of measles in the Greater Manchester area fell during June 2013, with 36 confirmed cases. This is down from 49 cases in May 2013 and follows the nationwide rollout of the national MMR catch-up programme. Across England as a whole, there were 113 cases in June 2013, compared to 193 for May 2013. In Rochdale, there was only one confirmed case in January 2013 followed by a 4-month period of no cases.

The catch-up programme, run by Public Health England, NHS England, the Department of Health, and local authorities, aims to prevent measles outbreaks by giving MMR to as many unvaccinated and partially vaccinated 10-16 year olds as possible. Progress in the campaign has been monitored using data on the MMR status of children aged between 10 and 16 years old, gathered from around 2000 general practices in July 2013.

When compared with similar aged children in 2012, the numbers point to almost 60 000 previously unvaccinated children having now had one dose in England. Additionally, a slightly higher number have now completed the 2-dose course.

Professor Martyn Regan, Greater Manchester Centre Director said: "While it's too early to say the MMR catch-up campaign is responsible for the declining number of measles cases, we can say definitively that children who have not had the MMR vaccine remain at high risk of catching the disease. We are making good progress towards the 95 percent target, but there still remains a number of 10-16 year olds within the Greater Manchester area, together with some younger children and adults, who are under-vaccinated. We'd urge parents of children that haven't had the MMR vaccine to contact their GP and get them vaccinated."

Screening and Immunisation teams in each of the 25 NHS Area Teams across England are reinforcing work done so far by general practices to sustain the MMR catch-up and to plan for additional efforts to identify pockets of remaining unvaccinated children in the target age range.

Two cases of measles in Sheffield children were confirmed in one month, new health figures have shown. The new cases for June 2013 mean the total number of children with measles in the city has now reached 12 this year [2013]. And the statistics come after the city's Director of Public Health, Jeremy Wight, said a large number of children still need at least another dose of the measles vaccine to ensure they are completely protected from the condition. Letters have been sent to all parents and children at schools reminding them to check with their GP that they are vaccinated. There were 6 cases of measles across the Yorkshire and Humber region in June 2013 and 5 in May 2013.

Dr Stephen Morton, centre director for Public Health England in Yorkshire and the Humber, said: "The number of measles cases is remaining stable in the Yorkshire and Humber area at the moment, but we are still seeing a small number of cases every month."

A national catch-up programme, run by Public Health England, NHS England, the Department of Health and councils, aims to prevent measles outbreaks by giving MMR jabs -- which protect against measles, mumps and rubella -- to as many as possible unvaccinated and partially vaccinated youngsters aged from 10 to 16. Dr Morton added: "We are making good progress towards the 95 per cent target, but there still remains a number of 10 to 16-year-olds together with some younger children and adults who are under-vaccinated. While it's too early to say the catch-up campaign is responsible for the overall decline in the number of measles cases nationally, we can say definitively that children who have not had the MMR vaccine remain at high risk of catching the disease.

Public health officials in Somerset have said measles is now "circulating more widely" in the county following a further outbreak. It brings the number of suspected and confirmed cases to 16 since July 2013; all those affected are aged between 10 and 24. Those affected live in the Street, Glastonbury and Shepton Mallet areas and were all unvaccinated. Before July 2013, there had been just one case so far this year [2013]. Officials are once again "urging" parents to take up the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Stewart Brock, a public health specialist at Somerset County Council, said officials were doing what they could to make sure the disease does not spread in the county.

"Recent outbreaks have been in young people from age 10 to early 20s, as many in these age ranges missed out on vaccination when the now-discredited report linking MMR to autism was published when they were young children." Mr Brock added that public health officials in the county had been working on a catch-up programme for anyone aged 10 to 16 who has not had the MMR vaccine.

"By getting immunised, you protect yourself, or your child, but you are also protecting other more vulnerable people in the community who could become seriously ill if they catch the disease."

A severe measles epidemic has affected the whole territory of the Central African Republic, which lacks any strong health infrastructure, Health Minister Aguid Sounouk announced Tuesday [13 Aug 2013]. "I call on the national transitional government and all partners in health care to mobilise for urgent measures ... to minimise the impact of this epidemic," Sounouk said in a radio broadcast.

The minister blamed the spread of the disease on "outbreaks of measles in several administrative districts of the country where no action had been organised to contain the epidemic" since December 2012. At that time, the landlocked nation was undergoing an insurgency that led in March 2013 to the ousting of president Francois Bozize and placed power in the hands of a rebel coalition, which has since joined with other forces to form an interim government.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) warned in early July 2013 that the country was on the verge of a public health catastrophe, since widespread unrest and the coming to power of the rebels had been accompanied by the systematic plundering of health facilities. The non-governmental organisation said that this situation would likely lead to an "increase in the mortality rate in coming months," including from "common and curable" diseases such as measles, which can kill people in developing countries if they develop complications without adequate care. Sounouk warned of the risk for very young people, because of "the highly contagious nature of measles" and since "the affected children have for the most part not been vaccinated against this disease."

A vaccination campaign took place in the capital Bangui in May 2013 and reached 122 000 children, but nothing has been done for about 1.5 million children who live in the depths of the country.

[Measles remains largely uncontained in the Central Africa Republic due to the remoteness of the country and the lack of stable infrastructure. Development of vaccination programmes is impeded by both lack of finance and poor communications. No improvement is in sight.

A measles outbreak in northern Nigeria's Katsina State has come to an end after 28 weeks. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) supported the Nigerian authorities throughout the outbreak by providing epidemiological surveillance and case management in Katsina's 34 local government areas. The outbreak began in December 2012 in the southern part of the state during the dry season and gradually spread to all 34 provinces. The outbreak lasted 28 weeks, during which time 36 428 cases of measles were reported, and 198 people died.

MSF began providing support to the Nigerian Ministry of Health (MoH) in February 2013, regularly visiting 300 health facilities and donating treatments for 14 290 measles cases, including for 420 complicated cases. Unfortunately, due to the shortage of measles vaccines in Nigeria, initially only 10 percent of the vaccines required to conduct a mass vaccination campaign were allocated to Katsina State. In response, in the 1st week of March 2013, MSF decided to further support the authorities by conducting a mass vaccination campaign in 5 of the 34 local government areas. Some 217 500 children aged 6 months to 5 years were vaccinated. Due to this campaign, a decline in the number of cases was observed in these 5 areas.

Due to the relationship between measles and malnutrition, MSF also conducted systematic screening for malnutrition. A total of 215 038 children aged 6 months to five years were screened. The severe acute malnutrition rate was found to be 1.8 percent, and the global acute malnutrition rate was 6 percent. Following MSF's intervention in Katsina, Epicentre, MSF's epidemiological research branch, conducted a vaccination coverage and malnutrition survey to provide a more thorough analysis of the situation, with results expected by the end of August 2013.

Officials are pleading with the public to check their immunisation records after the 2nd lab-confirmed case of measles. A child, under the age of one, is the 2nd person within a month to test positive for the disease; however, officials don't think the 2 are connected.

Anyone who may have visited Food Basics on Dundas St in Woodstock on 9 Aug 2013 between 6:45 p.m. and 9 p.m. should check their immunization record, or contact a health care professional if they are experiencing symptoms of measles. Symptoms are very similar to the flu, including fever, runny nose, red blotchy spots, drowsiness and irritability among other things.

Kern County Public Health Service officials received confirmation that a case of measles found in a minor had traveled through and spent the night in Kern County while infectious on Friday [16 Aug 2013]. The last reported case in the county of the contagious virus was back in 2004.

Dr. Claudia Jonah, a county health officer, said residents should be informed of the signs and symptoms of measles so that everyone can take proper precautions.

Measles is highly contagious, and the virus stays in the air for up to 2 hours after the infected person is no longer present. Anyone exposed to the virus that has not been vaccinated can become ill anywhere from 8 to 21 days after being exposed.

According to Public Health officials, some symptoms to look out for when contracting measles include: Measles typically begins with a mild to moderate fever accompanied by cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. Fever often spikes as high as 104 to 105 F. A red, blotchy, raised rash appears, usually on the face 1st, along the hairline and the ears. The rash can rapidly spread downward to the chest, back, thighs and feet. In approximately one week, the rash fades in the same sequence that it appeared. Public health advises residents with any of the above symptoms between now and 2 Sep 2013 to stay home. Do not go to school or to work; do not use public transportation or go anywhere else in public.

It's the 1st confirmed cases of the disease [measles] in Tarrant County since 2011. Health officials did not give any details on the 2 people who contracted measles, other than it is a parent and child, and the case was reported in northern Tarrant County. Health officials said one of the people who has measles recently traveled to a country where measles is common. Measles was largely wiped out after a vaccine became widespread in the 1950s, making cases rare in the United States.

"The public health investigation and response is currently ongoing," said Tarrant County Public Health Chief Epidemiologist Russell Jones in a statement. "Local physicians and other health-care providers are being advised to consider measles in their initial diagnosis of patients with compatible symptoms."

Measles, according to health officials, causes a reddish rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes and usually lasts one to 2 weeks. The measles virus can stay suspended in the air for up to 2 hours after an infectious person has been present.

Nine of the 14 cases of measles reported in Texas this year [2013] are in Tarrant County, and 4 of the others are elsewhere in North Texas, public health officials report. Seven of the Tarrant County cases were confirmed Friday [15 Aug 2013], said Vanassa Joseph, a spokeswoman for Tarrant County Public Health.

The 9 Tarrant County cases have been traced to a parent who traveled to a foreign country and brought back the infection, Joseph said. A child of that parent came down with measles. The 7 cases confirmed Friday [15 Aug 2013] were people who came in contact with the parent or child, she said. "The number of people involved is changing very rapidly and is not static," said Dr. Russell Jones, chief epidemiologist for Tarrant County Public Health. "Whatever I say now will change very quickly."

All 9 people live in northern Tarrant County and have been asked to "self-isolate," Joseph said. No measles cases were reported in the state or Tarrant County last year [2012]. In 2011, the state had 6 cases, and the county had 2. Before that, measles had not been reported in Tarrant County for 17 years.

Two cases each have been reported this year [2013] in Dallas and Denton counties, with one case in Harris County, said Christine Mann, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. All the state cases are "import-associated," meaning that someone contracted the disease abroad, Mann said.

Although often recognized by the rash that spreads over the body, measles is a respiratory disease caused by a virus. It lives in the mucus of the nose and throat and is spread by coughing and sneezing. "Measles is the most deadly of all childhood rash/fever illnesses," according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Six to 20 percent of people who contract the disease will get an ear infection, diarrhea or pneumonia. One in 1000 people with measles develops brain inflammation, or encephalitis. Of every 1000 children who get measles, one or 2 will die, the CDC says. Pneumonia is the complication that most often causes death in young children. Ear infections can lead to permanent hearing loss. Pregnant women who get measles may have a miscarriage, give birth prematurely, or have a low-birth-weight baby.

The parent and child in northern Tarrant County who were initially infected have recovered but spread the virus for about 9 days, according to health officials. Investigators are tracking down people who have been in close contact with the pair or with the other 7 people infected.

Three healthcare providers have reported individuals who might have the disease, Jones said.

The Texas Department of State Health has issued a measles alert for the state.

One confirmed case is here in the Houston area. The state says they have had 4 new confirmed cases this month [August 2013], bringing the total to 9 for the year [2013]. The 4 most recent confirmed cases are all from Tarrant County, but the other cases this year have been in Dallas County (2), 2 in Denton County and one in Harris County.

Measles is so contagious that if a person infected with the disease coughs or sneezes, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune or vaccinated will become infected with the measles virus. The incubation period of measles is about 2 weeks from exposure to onset of rash on the face, and then spreads to the body. People are contagious about 4 days before the onset of rash to 4 days after the appearance of rash. Other symptoms include fever higher than 101 F, cough, runny nose and sore eyes.

The State Health Department is asking doctors to consider measles in their diagnosis if any patient has a rash and a fever. Immunizations are the best protection against the spread of measles.

Citing 9 confirmed measles cases in the last month and 14 cases for 2013, the Texas Department of State Health Services issued a state-wide health alert on Fri 16 Aug 2013. Tarrant County's Public Health Department reported 2 measles cases Thursday and was informed Friday [15-16 Aug 2013] of 7 other confirmed cases. The initial case was an adult who had traveled outside the United States. Three were contacts of the 1st case. "We understand the trip was in late July 2013, and those 2 initial cases have recovered from the illness," said Vanessa Joseph, the department's spokeswoman. "We will release further details as we receive them."

The 7 additional cases were confirmed Friday [16 Aug 2013] by the state health department, which is assisting in the investigation. State health officials are asking health care providers to be on alert for potential exposures and patients with measles symptoms, particularly in the North Texas area. In addition to the cases in Tarrant County, Dallas County had 2 recent measles cases as did Denton County. Harris County has reported one.

There were no measles cases reported in the state in 2012 and only 6 cases in 2011.

Vaccination even shortly before or after exposure may prevent the disease or lessen the symptoms in people who are infected with measles. Immune globulin given up to 6 days after exposure may prevent disease among susceptible or unvaccinated people at high risk for complications, such as pregnant women, people with weak immune systems, and children too young to be vaccinated.
