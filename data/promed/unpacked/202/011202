FMD outbreak confirmed in Qinghai Province
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] Asia 1 Type has occurred
in a village called Dayu in Guinan County in northwestern Qinghai
Province, China's Ministry of Agriculture announced on Sunday [12 Mar
2006]. 19 cattle and 2 pigs on the farm that reported the outbreak
have been culled by the provincial veterinary bureau. The disease was
reported on 4 Mar 2006, and it was confirmed by the state laboratory
as FMD. The ministry said the disease is under control at present.
The Qinghai provincial government and the Ministry of Agriculture
ordered an immediate disinfection and quarantine of the outbreak
site, as well as a thorough inoculation of all vulnerable animals in
the region.

[During 2005, one FMD outbreak was officially reported in Qinghai (map at
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2003-04/03/content_815411.htm>).
This province is adjacent to Gansu, where FMD was reported just 3 days ago.
The current information on the possible involvement of pigs, prolific
virus producers, is of significant epidemiological importance. An
official update on the current situation in China will help. - Mod.AS]
