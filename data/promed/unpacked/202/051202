As the flood water recedes after unprecedented rain in Assam, the fear of Japanese encephalitis is looming large in the state. Usually, when flood-affected people go home from relief centres, the risk of mosquito and waterborne diseases is high.

Since the outbreak of the disease, 52 people have died so far [3 Aug 2022], according to the National Health Mission in Assam. On 2 Aug 2022, 4 people died in Nagaon district, which is one of the worst affected districts of Assam. While a total of 305 people were detected with the mosquitoborne disease in one month, 3 among them were infected on 2 Aug 2022. Nagaon district has recorded 44 cases -- the highest so far -- followed by 39 cases in Jorhat and 34 cases in Golaghat.

According to state health officials, besides Japanese Encephalitis, acute encephalitis syndrome has killed 16 people this year [2022] and there are 143 cases so far [3 Aug 2022]. The state health department has taken steps to create awareness and has undertaken various preventive measures.

Meanwhile, Japanese encephalitis tests have been made free in all district hospitals and government-run medical colleges. Besides, the state government has kept all the 9 medical colleges and 10 district hospitals on alert, readying up intensive care units and laboratory test facilities. Medicines for acute encephalitis syndrome and Japanese Encephalitis are available at all designated hospitals.

Fogging with Malathion is being done regularly and 6.8 lakh [680 000] insecticide-treated mosquito nets have been distributed in the affected areas, according to the National Health Mission.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase at several locations in this state. Since 1 Jul 2022, the number of deaths has increased to 52. The number of JE cases has risen rapidly from 183 reported on Tuesday (19 Jul 2022) to 305 cases on 2 Aug 2022. Interestingly, these 305 cases were classified as JE and not acute encephalitis syndrome. However, 16 fatal AES cases are mentioned above and it is not clear if they are included in the 305 cases but a total of 143 AES cases are mentioned as well and appear to be different from the JE cases. Dr T Jacob John provided an insightful comment on the difficulty that AES presents since it is not a specific diagnosis with a defined etiology (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (04): comment 20220425.8702831. Although there is still no mention of a vaccination campaign in the state fogging with malathion is being done. The current JE virus transmission season may last an additional 2 or more months, so more cases can be expected. - Mod.TY
