Quebec public health officials have confirmed that an outbreak of whooping cough -- or pertussis -Â­ has led to 151 confirmed cases in the Mauricie-Central Quebec region. At the beginning of October 2015, there were about 40 cases. Since then, that number has tripled. Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection that affects the lungs and upper respiratory system, releasing toxins that cause inflammation and swelling.

The Mauricie-Central Quebec outbreak has mostly affected young children. Close to a dozen elementary schools, 2 high schools and at least 10 daycare centers in the region reported cases of whooping cough earlier this fall. The outbreak is already 4 times the annual average.

Babies are at the highest risk of complications from pertussis, and they most often are infected by adult caregivers who might not realize they're infected. It takes 2 weeks to get the results of a test for pertussis, and because of that, public health authorities in the region have told doctors to advise patients to stay at home if whooping cough is suspected until they receive a firm diagnosis.

In Canada, between 1000 and 3000 people a year contract whooping cough, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Worldwide, the airborne bacterium that causes the illness affects 20 to 40 million people annually, killing some 400 000 people each year.

There is a vaccine for whooping cough which prevents the disease or, at least, leads to fewer complications. Quebec's Health Ministry recommends that all children be vaccinated with a 1st shot at 2 months. Children must receive 5 shots in all to be protected from the disease: at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 18 months, then a final booster between the age of 4 and 6. Teens receive a 6th dose of the vaccine in their 3rd year of high school. Adults need to get a one-time booster as well to be fully protected. The whooping cough booster is a combination vaccine, with diphtheria and tetanus. Once an adult receives the combination booster, they still need a further booster for diphtheria and tetanus once every 10 years.

Several provinces and at least one territory are experiencing outbreaks of pertussis, better known as whooping cough, and public health officials are encouraging Canadians of all ages to make sure their vaccinations are up to date. The bacterial infection, which often but not always causes a "whoop" sound when breathing or coughing, is particularly dangerous for very young babies, say doctors. The disease can lead to hospitalization and, in rare cases, death.

Manitoba is dealing with an outbreak of pertussis in its southern region, where 44 of the province's 51 cases so far in 2015 have been reported. Most of those who developed the infection had not been inoculated against pertussis, which is included in a vaccine that typically also protects against diphtheria, tetanus and polio. Some provinces also include _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B vaccine (Hib) or hepatitis B vaccine in the shot.

"You have outbreaks from time to time, but we're usually around 10 per year, so this is significant," Dr. Michael Routledge, Manitoba's chief public health officer, said Thursday, 12 Nov 2015, from Winnipeg. Most of those who got sick were young children, but some teens and adults also contracted the infection, Routledge added. "We're concerned this is happening in kids who are quite young, and they can have serious complications from it." While the disease is endemic, or always present in the community to some extent, outbreaks tend to be cyclical, with a spike in cases every 2 to 5 years.

New Brunswick has also been dealing with a pertussis outbreak. The province has recorded 56 confirmed cases in 2015, all in the Greater Moncton area, including 4 new cases reported between 6 Nov 2015 and 12 Nov 2015 in residents aged 9 to 24, a spokesman said. The Northwest Territories has also had a jump in whooping cough cases in 2015.

While Ontario has had some isolated outbreaks, Dr. Shelley Deeks said 2015 has "not been a huge year" for pertussis, at least compared to some previous years. Deeks, medical director of immunization and vaccine-preventable diseases, said Public Health Ontario has received reports of about 500 cases to date, far below the peak of more than 1200 cases recorded in 2006. Deeks said: "So adults should talk to their physicians and make sure they receive a dose of pertussis [vaccine]," she said, noting that the shot would typically also contain diphtheria and tetanus components. "It's really important for their health, but the other thing we know is that parents and grandparents are an important source of pertussis for babies. And because the disease can be quite severe in infants, we want to make sure adults are protected for it so they don't pass it onto their children, especially newborns."

British Columbia is also seeing a bit of a jump in whooping cough in 2015, with double the number of cases reported in 2012, but half the case count in 2000, reflecting the cyclical nature of the infection, said Dr. Danuta Skowronski, an infectious disease expert at the BC Center for Disease Control. The highest proportion of cases in BC is among pre-teens aged 10 to 13, suggesting that waning immunity could be at play, as children that age would have had their most recent dose as 4 to 6 year olds, said Skowronski. While the goal of public health officials isn't to eradicate pertussis -- an impossible goal given its endemic nature -- it's not clear how more consistent protection can be achieved. Giving boosters more often would be like "chasing a moving target," Skowronski said. "Do you add more doses? Or are we approaching the kind of program like we have with influenza ... where you have to give it annually or at least every few years?"

Because about 80 per cent of the serious outcomes due to whooping cough occur in babies under 3 months, Skowronski believes that's where the primary focus of immunization should be placed. "It's most important that we get that 1st dose into children in a timely way, without delaying. Parents should be on that." At the same time, drug companies may need to come up with a better vaccine that could be given sooner than 2 months old, offering earlier protection, she said. "We're getting signals now of concern that we need to address, and especially if we are accumulating cohorts (groups) of children with waning immunity," Skowronski said of the outbreaks. "It's not scary monsters right now. But we want to look to the future and anticipate if this gets higher yet with the next cyclical peak. And what are the options that we might implement to try to mitigate that?"

[In the latest Public Health Agency of Canada's Update on Pertussis Vaccination in Pregnancy http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/naci-ccni/acs-dcc/2014/pvip-vcpg_0214-eng.php, last published in 2014, it is stated:

"National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) does not recommend a universal program for vaccination of pregnant women given the current epidemiology in Canada.

"In special circumstances, such as a regional outbreak situation, immunization with Tdap may be offered to pregnant women (26 weeks or more of gestation) irrespective of their immunization history.

"Every effort should be made to administer one dose of pertussis containing vaccine in adulthood. Therefore, one dose of combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis containing vaccine (Tdap) can be offered to pregnant women (at 26 weeks of gestation or more) who have not been previously vaccinated against pertussis in adulthood."

In the USA, however, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6207a4.htm) states: "In October 2011, in an effort to reduce the burden of pertussis in infants, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that unvaccinated pregnant women receive a dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Vaccination of women with Tdap during pregnancy is expected to provide some protection to infants from pertussis until they are old enough to be vaccinated themselves. Tdap given to pregnant women will stimulate the development of maternal antipertussis antibodies, which will pass through the placenta, likely providing the newborn with protection against pertussis in early life, and will protect the mother from pertussis around the time of delivery, making her less likely to become infected and transmit pertussis to her infant. The 2011 Tdap recommendation did not call for vaccinating pregnant women previously vaccinated with Tdap. On 24 Oct 2012, ACIP voted to recommend use of Tdap during every pregnancy. This report summarizes data considered and conclusions made by ACIP and provides guidance for implementing its recommendations. These updated recommendations on use of Tdap in pregnant women aim to optimize strategies for preventing pertussis morbidity and mortality in infants."

Most of the morbidity and mortality from pertussis occurs in infants less than 6 months of age, especially neonates. Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.

A 2014 publication confirms the safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes.
