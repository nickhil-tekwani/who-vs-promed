[These figures are not substantially different from the previous update on
8 Aug 2005, although the number of people under surveillance has increased
slightly. It has been more than a month since the last confirmed death in
Uige province, and the outbreak can be considered to be virtually at an
end. Attention can perhaps turn now to investigation of the source of the
outbreak. - Mod.CP]
