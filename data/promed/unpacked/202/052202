Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 67
--------------------------------
Weekly update
-----------------
As of [20 Sep 2009], there have been more than 300 000 laboratory
confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1, 3917 deaths, in 191
countries and territories reported to the World Health Organization
(WHO).

As more and more countries have stopped counting individual cases,
particularly of milder illness, the case count is significantly lower
than the actually number of cases that have occurred. While the case
counts no longer reflect actual disease activity, the WHO is actively
monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent
consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and
through monitoring of multiple sources of data.

In the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere,
influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity continues to increase in many
areas. In North America, the United States has reported continued
increases in activity above the seasonal baseline for the last 2 to 3
weeks, primarily in the southeast but now also appearing in the upper
midwest and the northeast. In Europe and Central and Western Asia,
the United Kingdom is reporting regional increases in ILI activity in
Northern Ireland; and Scotland and the Netherlands, France, Ireland,
and Israel are reporting rates above the seasonal baseline. In Japan,
influenza activity continues to be slightly above the seasonal
epidemic threshold. The increases in ILI activity have been
accompanied by increases in laboratory isolations of pandemic
influenza H1N1 2009 in most of these areas.

In the tropical regions of the Americas and Asia, influenza activity
remains variable. In parts of India, Bangladesh and Cambodia,
influenza transmission continues to be active, while other countries
in the Southeast Asia have been recently reporting declining
transmission (Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand). Although most
countries in the tropical regions of the Americas are still reporting
regional to widespread geographic spread of influenza activity, there
is no consistent pattern in the trend of respiratory diseases. Peru
and Mexico have reported an increasing trend in some areas, while
most others are reporting an unchanged or decreasing trend (most
notably Bolivia, Venezuela and Brazil).

In the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, influenza
transmission has largely returned to baseline (Chile, Argentina, and
New Zealand) or is continuing to decline (Australia and South Africa).

All pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses analyzed to date have been
antigenically and genetically similar to A/California/7/2009-like
pandemic H1N1 2009 virus. See below for a detailed laboratory
surveillance update.

Weekly update (Virological surveillance data)
---------------------------------------------
Systematic surveillance conducted by the Global Influenza
Surveillance Network (GISN), supported by WHO Collaborating Centres
and other laboratories, continues to detect sporadic incidents of
H1N1 pandemic viruses that show resistance to the antiviral
oseltamivir. To date, 28 resistant viruses have been detected and
characterized worldwide. All of these viruses show the same H275Y
mutation that confers resistance to the antiviral oseltamivir, but
not to the antiviral zanamivir. 12 of these drug-resistant viruses
were associated with the use of oseltamivir for post-exposure
prophylaxis. 6 were associated with the use of oseltamivir treatment
in patients with severe imunosuppression. 4 were isolated from
samples from patients receiving oseltamivir treatment. A further 2
were isolated from patients who were not taking oseltamivir for
either treatment or prophylaxis. Characterization of the remaining
viruses is under way. Worldwide, more than 10 000 clinical specimens
(samples and isolates) of the pandemic H1N1 virus have been tested
and found to be sensitive to oseltamivir.

The WHO has just concluded its Vaccine Composition Meeting for the
Southern Hemisphere (held in Melbourne, Australia) and has made
recommendations for the composition of the influenza virus vaccine
for use in the 2010 southern hemisphere influenza season. The WHO
recommends that influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2010
influenza season (southern hemisphere winter) contain the following
strains: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus; A/Perth/16/2009
(H3N2)-like virus; and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus. For more
information see the links below.

The WHO has recently announced 2 new candidate reassortant vaccine
viruses (X-181 and X-181A) which have been developed and are now
available for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine development. For
more information see link below.

*Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the
Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries
in tropical regions are defined as those between these 2 latitudes.

Qualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 37: 13 Jul - 13 Sep 2009)

The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of
influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of
respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on
health-care services.

Human infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus: updated interim WHO
guidance on global surveillance
<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/x_181_x_181a.pdf>

A description of the WHO pandemic monitoring and surveillance
objectives and methods can be found in the updated interim WHO
guidance for the surveillance of human infection with pandemic (H1N1)
virus.

The maps below display information on the qualitative indicators
reported during weeks 29 to 37. Information is available for
approximately 60 countries each week. Implementation of this
monitoring system is ongoing and completeness of reporting is
expected to increase over time.

No new countries and overseas territories/communities have newly
reported their 1st pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed case(s) since the
last web update (Number 66).

Cumulative totals as of 20 Sep 2009
Region: Cases* / Deaths
WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO): 8264 / 41
WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO): 130 448 / 2948
WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO): 11 621 / 72
WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO): At least 53 000 / Over 154
WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO): 30 293 / 340
WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO): 85 299 / 362

Total: At least 318 925 / Over 3917

*Given that countries are no longer required to test and report
individual cases, the number of cases reported actually understates
the real number of cases.

[We recommend following the URL links to maps available on the WHO
website, showing the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 activity by country, the
severity of activity by country, and the impact on healthcare
delivery services. From the above report, it appears as though the
southern hemisphere countries in the Americas are starting to see
decreased influenza activity, and northern hemisphere is beginning to
increase in activity -- expected trends given the seasonal changes. -

Epidemiologic update
--------------------
All 27 EU [European Union] and 4 EFTA [European Free Trade
Association] countries are reporting cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009
influenza. Since April 2009, a total of 54 119 confirmed cases and
173 deaths have been reported (Table 1 [available at URL link
provided above). In the past 24 hours 606 cases were reported from
the EU and EFTA countries. Amongst the 173 deaths Hungary reported
one additional fatality; Spain confirmed 4 additional fatalities
since their last report, and the UK confirmed 4 additional deaths as
well. The latest available updates on hospital admissions per Member
State are presented in Table 2 [available at the above given URL
link]. The latest available updates as of [24 Sep 2009], at 16:00, on
new and on confirmed fatal pandemic (H1N1) cases outside the EU/EFTA
area by country, are presented in Table 3 [provided in the above
given URL link].

[For those readers who are interested in country specific data, Table
1 provides the number of confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009
virus infection and number of deaths by country in the EU and EFTA
countries. ("Reported new confirmed cases and cumulative number of
Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza and cumulative deaths among confirmed
cases by country as of 25 Sep 2009, 09:00 hours (CEST) in the EU and
EFTA countries"). Table 2 provides detailed information by country on
"Reported number of confirmed Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza cases
admitted to hospitals and intensive care by country as of 25 Sep
2009, 09:00 hours (CEST) in the EU and EFTA countries." Table 3
provides by country information on the reported number of deaths
attributable to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection in countries outside
of the EU and EFTA countries "Reported number of new and cumulative
confirmed fatal Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza cases by country as of
24 September 2009, 16:00 hours (CEST) outside of the EU/EFTA area."

This report is issued daily, Monday through Friday.

Given the reduced activity in confirmation of cases of pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection, the numbers of reported cases is clearly
under-reported, making hard fast comparisons on H1N1 activity between
countries hazardous at the least. Readers should bear in mind that
during influenza season in non-pandemic years, surveillance
activities are not directed at getting complete case counts, but
rather trend data (such as sentinel reporting unit information on
pneumonia and influenza deaths) are used by countries as a means of
measuring the severity of influenza activity. Given the widespread
activity of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus, it does not
appear justified for countries to attempt to "count every case,"
hence the caution in interpretation of any data presented. For this
reason, ProMED-mail has not been posting frequent "case count"
updates, but rather is following the WHO lead in periodic updates. -
