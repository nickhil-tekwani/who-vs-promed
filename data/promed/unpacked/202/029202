Contrary to what government promised, the yellow fever [YF] vaccine
may take another 2 weeks before it can reach the country, further
delaying the mass vaccination against yellow fever in northern
Uganda. The health ministry had earlier said vaccination would
commence last Saturday [1 Jan 2011], but the director, Clinical and
Community Health Services, Dr Kenya Mugisha, yesterday [2 Jan 2011]
said the vaccine is limited in supply. "The medicine [sic; vaccine]
is scarce. There is a possibility of it having to be manufactured but
we are working with the International Coordinating Group (ICG) to see
that it is here as soon as possible." The ICG is the body charged
with distributing yellow fever vaccine worldwide.

The scarcity comes at a time when Cameroon is also battling yellow
fever and the available 1.5 million doses have to be shared between
the 2 countries. The vaccination targets 2.5 million people in 26 districts.

Dr Mugisha, who headed the National Task Force on Yellow Fever to
Northern Uganda, said the situation is now under control with no new
cases registered in recent days while most of those who were admitted
have been discharged from hospital. "The situation is calm, by Friday
[31 Dec 2010] , only 23 people were still contained in hospitals," he said.

The disease, which has killed 48 people and affected 190 others, is
prevalent in Abim, Agago, Lawo, Pader, Kitgum, Gulu, Arua, Kabong,
Kotido, and Lira. Dr Isa Makumbi, a health ministry official said
about 3 million Ugandans are at the risk of contracting the disease
if no immediate vaccination programme takes place across the region.

Yellow fever is a viral haemorrhagic disease that is transmitted by
female _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, nausea, bleeding,
and vomiting. If untreated, yellow fever may result into kidney
failure or death. The disease last hit the country in 1972.

[Alas, the likely delay in obtaining YF vaccine that Mod.JW warned
about in the previous post [see ProMED-mail archive no.
20110102.0017] has come to pass. The encouraging news from the report
above is that no new cases have appeared recently, which may buy the
Ugandan health authorities some time as they await delivery of the
vaccine. There is no mention of any effort to reduce the vector
mosquito populations in the affected areas. One hopes that a vector
control effort has been initiated aggressively.
