From: Jacques Morvan <morvan@intnet.cf>

By request of the Cameroonian sanitary authorities, a joint mission WHO -
Centre Pasteur du Cameroun - Institut Pasteur de Bangui (Central African
Republic) went from March 23 to 28 to the spot of the epidemic in
Ngoila (Cameroon).
Stools and serum samples were taken. The Institut Pasteur of Bangui
isolated from stools:
*_ Shigella dysenteriae_ type-1 multiresistant to antibiotics (9 patients)
*_Shigella boydii_ multiresistant to antibiotics (2 patients) and
*_Escherichia coli_ producer of Shiga-like toxin (10 patients) (typing in
process).
As far as virology is concerned, from 22 sera onwards, Ebola tests (PCR,
immunocapture antigen and immunocapture IgM) are negative. There is an
absence of serologic markers of a recent infection (IgM) for Marburg, RVF,
Yellow fever, CCHF [Congo-Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever and Lassa viruses.
The epidemic of bloody diarrhea seems to be related to a bacterial etiology
(_Shigella_ and _Escherichia coli_- producing Shiga-like toxin).
