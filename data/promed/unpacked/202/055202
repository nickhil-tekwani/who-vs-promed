Abstract
--------
Rift valley fever (RVF), a vector-borne zoonotic disease, is caused by a _phlebovirus_ (family _Bunyaviridae_). The virus was initially characterized approximately 80 years ago in Kenya and disseminated to many countries in the continental Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. The infection has not been reported in Turkey. In this study, blood serum samples collected from camel (_Camelus dromedairus_), goitered gazelle (_Gazella subgutturosa subgutturosa_), and buffaloes (_Bubalus bubalis linneaus_) from 2000 to 2006 were investigated for RVF using C-ELISA. Camel samples (n of 72) were obtained from private small enterprises in Aydın province in the Aegean region. Gazella samples (82) were taken from the biggest captive gazelle herd in Şanlıurfa province in the southeast Anatolia. Buffalo samples were collected mostly from small private family type farms in Afyon (168), Amasya (80), Samsun (69), Ankara (35), Sivas (21), Tokat (19), Konya (10), and Elazıg (8) provinces in the central, north, west, and east Anatolia. All of the gazella samples were negative; whereas, one of the 71 camel samples (1.3 percent) was positive for RVF-specific antibodies. Buffalos from Sivas, Tokat, Konya, and Elazıg provinces were negative. However, 35 of the 410 samples (8.5 percent) from rural areas in the following 4 provinces were positive: Amasya (12/80, 15 percent), Ankara (5/35, 14.2 percent), Samsun (8/69, 11.5 percent), and Afyon (10/168, 5.9 percent). To our knowledge, this is the first report of presence of RVF infection in Turkey.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favoring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterized, in the susceptible animal species, by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an unapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality and abortion occurs and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.

Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. It is recommended that laboratory workers be vaccinated if possible.

Until 1977, RVF was known to be limited to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly as an animal disease with zoonotic potential; in humans, it was mainly manifested as a self-limited febrile illness with the occasional complication of retinal lesions. During these years, the interest in the disease beyond Africa was practically limited to those engaged in potential biological warfare agents. In 1977, the disease was recorded, for the 1st time, in Egypt where it caused a major event with critical impact upon human health, continuing during 1978. The disease was associated with severe and fatal hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. An official Egyptian report counted 598 deaths. Estimates of clinical cases from field workers exceeded 200 000 (Egypt's population at that time was 41 million). The animal industry suffered serious losses due to clinical disease, abortions, decreased production and deaths. Mortality was high in sheep and cattle; it was intermediate or low in buffaloes, camels and goats. The disease spread throughout many of Egypt's governorates, one of the heaviest affected being Sharqia, bordering the Suez canal.

The Egyptian event, which was signified by an unprecedented severity of the disease in humans combined with the spread of the virus into the Mediterranean basin, caused alarm elsewhere and attracted the attention of the international community and to its potential to spread further into receptive ecosystems. During the event, one seropositive goat was recorded in northern Sinai, some 60 km [approx. 36 mi] east of the Suez canal which divides Africa from Asia (Bir el-'Abd, map at http://tinyurl.com/y7j2v7xd). This animal was found not to be an endemic case since it had been transported from Sharqia. In 1979, 7 Swedish UN Emergency Forces soldiers serving in Egypt and the Sinai peninsula tested serologically positive to RVF virus. It was considered that they had contracted RVF while on duty in their posts in western Sinai, or while visiting Egypt. On the other hand, in 1979 RVF was diagnosed in Canada, in a 41-year-old Canadian woman who likely contracted the infection in Kenya; this case was cited as a potential exposure to Canadian livestock had she returned directly to her rural Canadian home.

Since 1978, exacerbations of RVF have been reported several times from Egypt, Mass vaccination of ruminants have been applied there annually to the present day. In 2000, Yemen and Saudi Arabia became the first Asian countries infected by RVF, which most probably originated in East Africa. This was preceded by a major outbreak in East Africa which started in late 1997 and sickened some 90 000 people, of which almost 500 people died; animal herds were seriously affected. In March 2001, the accumulated number of human cases in Saudi Arabia was reported to be 882, of which 124 died. The disease re-emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2004 and 2010. No other countries outside Africa are known to have been infected so far; a reported suspicion of the disease in Iraq, 2001, remained unconfirmed.

In the discussion chapter of the current paper, which deals with samples collected in northern Turkey between 2000 and 2006, the authors suggest that RVF infection was introduced into Anatolia at the time of outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, probably through Syria and Iraq via uncontrolled movement of animals and vectors. No clinical or suspected RVF cases, in humans or animals, have been reported from Turkey. The authors conclude that large scale serological and virological studies are necessary to determine the status of the infection to prevent possible dangers to Turkey and Europe.

This conclusion is compatible with several scientific assessments of RVF potential and epidemiological studies; some of them are presented in the following reference list.
