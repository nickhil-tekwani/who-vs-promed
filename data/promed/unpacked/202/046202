Australia fights to save vineyards from fatal fungus
----------------------------
Quick thinking by a quarantine officer in Darwin has saved Australia's
booming wine export industry from almost-certain annihilation by a deadly
Asian fungus.
Matthew Weinert, a plant pathologist with the Australian Quarantine and
Inspection Service, spotted a "sick looking" grapevine on which the leaves
were yellowed and many of them were covered in powdery spores. The tests
confirmed that the vine was infected with grapevine leaf rust (GLR), a
fungal disease widely found throughout Asia, but never previously seen in
Australia. If unchecked, GLR has the potential to destroy Australia's
commercial vineyards.
The Northern Territory's agricultural department is dispatching staff to
inspect grape vines grown at more than 30 000 homes in the Darwin area.
Vines carrying the fungus, and those beside them, will be destroyed.
Officials say they expect to eradicate at least 3000 vines at a cost of
$700 000 [it is unclear if this is Canadian dollars or Australian dollars
-- another newswire from an Australian paper mentioned $1,000,000,
suggesting this article is discussing the amount in Canadian dollars -
Mod.MPP], including compensation payments.
The GLR pathogen (_Phakopsora euvitis_) causes defoliation, weakening of
the vine, and severe fruit loss and has already spread to vineyards in
Russia and North America.
Warren Truss, Australia's agriculture minister, says it is imperative to
wipe out the disease before it spreads to the leading wine-growing regions
of Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, and Western Australia.

[This is the second outbreak of GLR in Darwin, the first one being recorded
last year. The concern is that spores of the pathogen may spread to
commercial grapevine production areas in other states in Australia.
According to EPPO, the disease is well established in Asia. Known locations
of the disease include the following countries: Bangladesh, China (Anhui,
Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hong Kong, Hunan, Jiangsu,
Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Sichuan), India (Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar
Pradesh), Indonesia (Java), Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Ryukyu
islands, Shikoku), Korea, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Myanmar,
Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand). There are many records of
grapevine leaf rusts in the Americas, but they were either described under
other names or the pathogen could not be definitely identified.

Reference has been made that GLF occurs in USA. Can any of our readers
confirm that GLR is a pathogen of grapevine in USA? - Mod.DH]
