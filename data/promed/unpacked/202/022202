[A 28 Jun 2022 report stated that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Tuesday (28 Jun 2022) the activation of its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to respond to the US monkeypox outbreak. The activation of the EOC "allows the agency to further increase operational support for the response to meet the outbreak's evolving challenges," the agency said in a news release. (https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/28/health/cdc-eoc-monkeypox/index.html)

A ProMED reader, John Klopfer (<johnklopfer@gmail.com>) asks, "Would ProMED be able to post an RFI on efforts to expand wastewater testing for monkeypox (how many sites are operational, and what plans are there to expand the network on what timeframe)? There are some concerning reports that clinics are refusing to test individuals who don't meet the narrow population criteria (e.g. MSM or recent travel). Wastewater might be a better way to get on top of how many cases there are in circulation, and where."

Promed thanks John Klopfer for the question and would welcome a response from the San Francisco or other officials who are operating the waste water testing effort. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
While the Monkeypox outbreak is growing, little is known about the general public's levels of knowledge, their trusted sources of information and attitudes towards a Monkeypox vaccine. In our representative survey of the US general public, we find that almost half the respondents (47%) feel that their knowledge level about Monkeypox is poor or very poor. The most trusted sources of information about the outbreak are healthcare professionals and officials, but also known doctors and researchers with a large online following. Being vaccinated against COVID-19 was a strong predictor of willingness to receive a Monkeypox vaccine if recommended (Adjusted Odds Ratio 32.1, 95% Confidence Interval 16.7-61.7). Our findings point to the urgent need for clear communication.

This Wednesday [29 Jun 2022], the Puerto Rico Health Department confirmed the 1st case of monkeypox on the Island and requested that the population be alert in order to halt any transmission chain.

The patient remains in isolation in his home, in stable condition according to the announcement by the Health Department.

"This is the moment when we all must be alert to the clinical symptoms and the epidemiological criteria of the virus in order for us to prevent infections and halt whatever transmission chain," the Secretary of Health, Carlos Mellado López, said.

This 1st case was identified through the surveillance system for required notification of diseases, that coordinated sample taking. The Health Department established an Epidemiological Surveillance Guide for Monkeypox at the beginning of June [2022] that included information for diagnosis and management of cases for healthcare providers and health institutions.

Before the 1st case was confirmed, the main health official, Melissa Marzán Rodríguez, emphasized that "it is important that people who present with symptoms associated [with monkeypox] consult with your healthcare provider immediately."

Yesterday evening [28 Jun 2022] health officials from the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a new vaccine strategy to target the growing monkeypox outbreak in the United States.

Rapidly scaling up the delivery of monkeypox vaccines and targeting at-risk groups with vaccination is the main goal of phase one, White House officials said last night [28 Jun 2022] during a press briefing. To date, 9000 doses of vaccine and 300 courses of antiviral smallpox treatments have been deployed to 32 states.

Under the new plan, 296 000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine will be made available throughout July [2022], 56 000 of which will be allocated immediately.

Over the coming months a combined 1.6 million additional doses will become available, the administration said. The vaccines will be distributed equitably to states based on population, and at-risk communities will be targeted in the vaccination campaign.

"This includes those who had close physical contact with someone diagnosed with monkeypox, those who know their sexual partner was diagnosed with monkeypox, and men who have sex with men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where monkeypox is spreading," the White House said in an HHS press release.

"While monkeypox poses minimal risk to most Americans, we are doing everything we can to offer vaccines to those at high risk of contracting the virus. This new strategy allows us to maximize the supply of currently available vaccines and reach those who are most vulnerable to the current outbreak," said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.

Officials said they now have the capacity to test 10 000 Americans per week for the virus now that 5 major labs are authorized to conduct tests.

During remarks today [29 Jun 2022], World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said he was concerned current monkeypox outbreaks could spread to children and pregnant women.

"I am concerned about sustained transmission because it would suggest that the virus is establishing itself and it could move into high-risk groups including children, the immunocompromised and pregnant women," Tedros said. "We are starting to see this with several children already infected."

It was unclear from his remarks if pediatric cases were being seen in endemic or non-endemic countries. Household transmission is more likely in West and Central African nations, while non-endemic countries report mostly cases in men who have sex with men.

In Nigeria, where the virus is endemic, 62 cases have been reported this year [2022], nearly double the number for the whole of last year [2021], according to Reuters. In 2017, Nigeria reported 88 cases.

Today [29 Jun 2022] during a Clinical Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) call to healthcare providers, CDC experts said the median age of monkeypox cases in the United States was 36, and no cases had been reported in children. Of the 305 US cases, all but 5 have been in men.

Monkeypox outbreak: epidemiological overview
--------------------------------------------
Current epidemiological situation as of 26 June 2022
----------------------------------------------------
Cases of monkeypox infection were confirmed in England from 6 May 2022. The outbreak has mainly been in gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men without documented history of travel to endemic countries. Further details on the epidemiology are available in the monkeypox technical briefing.

Up to 26 Jun 2022, there were 1076 laboratory confirmed cases in the UK. Of these, 27 were in Scotland, 5 were in Northern Ireland, 9 were in Wales and 1035 were in England.

Table 1: Number of laboratory confirmed cases by UK nation of residence, 6 May to 26 Jun 2022
UK nation / Confirmed cases / Change since last report (24 Jun 2022)
England / 1035 / +162
Northern Ireland / 5 / +2
Scotland / 27 / +1
Wales / 9 / +1
Total / 1076 / +166

A high proportion of England cases were known to be London residents (79%, 659 of 833 with reported home address). For confirmed cases in the UK, where gender information was available, 1033 (100%) confirmed cases were male, with 5 confirmed female cases. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 36 years (interquartile range 31 to 43).

Table 2: Number of laboratory confirmed monkeypox cases by region of residence, England, 6 May to 26 Jun 2022

The monkeypox virus has been diagnosed in a child in the Netherlands for the 1st time. The child is of primary school age, says a spokeswoman for the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). It is not yet known how the child contracted the virus.

For privacy reasons, the spokeswoman cannot say how the child is doing now. Monkeypox has now been diagnosed in 257 people in the Netherlands, 46 more than last Friday [24 Jun 2022]. Except for this child, in all cases it concerns men who have sex with men.

[A 16 Jun 2022 published report stated that the estimate of the mean incubation period of monkeypox in this outbreak was 8.5 days, in line with the typical values for complex, invasive exposure. Among the analysed cases in this outbreak and using this best-fitting (lognormal) distribution, the mean incubation period of monkeypox was estimated to be 8.5 days (95% credible intervals: 6.6-10.9 days), with the 5th percentile of 4.2 days and the 95th percentile of 17.3 days.

This result is supported by the epidemiological observation that all notified cases currently reported in the Netherlands are MSM, mostly with lesions in the anal and genital regions. Direct contact between respective broken skin or mucous membranes during sexual activity might be the most likely route of transmission among cases reported in the current outbreak.

[10] Mass gathering transmission

Scientists assess potential of monkeypox transmission at mass gatherings
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a recent study posted to the medRxiv preprint server, researchers assessed the potential of monkeypox transmission at mass gatherings.

Since May 2022, several non-endemic countries have reported monkeypox infections. Moreover, owing to the strict measures undertaken due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic over the past 2 years and the collective desire of the general public to regain their normal lives, mass gatherings held in Summer 2022 are expected to be very crowded.

Social contact and mass gatherings
----------------------------------
In the present study, researchers explored the likelihood of monkeypox transmission at settings and venues of mass gatherings that would facilitate infection spread.

Many social and mass gatherings such as music festivals like Glastonbury in the UK, the Zurich Street Parade in Switzerland, and Summerfest in Wisconsin are held in the summers and have an attendance of between 200 000 and 850 000 people. Since restrictions related to COVID-19 were imposed in 2020 and 2021 led to either event cancellation or restricted attendance, these events are expected to be highly attended in 2022.

Social contact surveys showed that the average number of contacts recorded on a Saturday in Germany was 19.5 while in the UK it was 20.3. Additionally, social mixing patterns observed at an event were calculated using video analysis. An experiment that measured the direct contact incidents in an indoor mass gathering of almost 1100 attendees revealed contacts with 8.9 to 14.1 distinct persons for more than 15 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively.

Human-to-human monkeypox transmission
-------------------------------------
The increasing number of monkeypox infections reported in endemic countries along with the current monkeypox outbreaks in non-endemic countries indicated the potential of monkeypox transmission from human to human. The team estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) from endemic countries using previous years' data wherein a large percentage of the population had received the smallpox vaccine. Taking this into account, R0 within a completely susceptible population was found to be approximately 2. Furthermore, secondary attack rates (SAR) estimates could be used to estimate the R0 value.

R0 for monkeypox in mass gatherings
-----------------------------------
The team investigated the potential of monkeypox transmission among humans in a mass gathering under several scenarios, considering the number of close contacts. The researchers assumed that one infectious individual attending such a mass event would have 2 to 10 contacts including family and friends as well as 5 to 50 other contacts. In this scenario, the R0 was calculated using estimates of the SAR for unvaccinated individuals. The team also employed SAR estimates for household persons for close contacts as well as non-household persons for contacts with fellow attendees. The simulations performed showed that the SAR for unvaccinated close contacts was 7.57 and that for unvaccinated other contacts was 2.69.

The simulation results showed that the mean R0 could increase to 2.1 for individuals having a high number of close as well as other contacts. Notably, R0 could be more than one for an infectious person who had contact with more than 30 individuals, even if that person had close contact with only 2 or 3 persons. Moreover, having contact with 8 to 10 people could result in more than one secondary infection case even if the person had less than 15 other contacts.

Overall, the study indicated that enforcing awareness and timely detection of the monkeypox virus is imperative to control infection transmission and curb its spread.

[11] WHO: advice for gatherings
Date: Tue 28 Jun 2022
Source: WHO [edited]
https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MPX-Gatherings-2022.1


Public health advice for gatherings during the current monkeypox outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose
--------
The purpose of this document is to provide public health advice to:
- host governments, public health authorities, national or international organizers and professional staff involved in the planning and delivery of gathering events;

- people organizing smaller gatherings or attending gatherings of any size and type.

Information on this outbreak is changing rapidly as we learn more. Check Monkeypox outbreak 2022 - Global (who.int) [https://bit.ly/3btVVm3] for the most up to date information.

Background
----------
- The unexpected appearance of monkeypox in several WHO regions in the initial absence of epidemiological links to areas that have historically reported monkeypox suggests that there may have been undetected transmission for some time. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

- Most reported monkeypox cases have presented through sexual health or other health services in primary or secondary healthcare facilities.

- The identification of confirmed and suspected cases of monkeypox with no direct travel links to previously affected areas is atypical, and even a single case of monkeypox in a newly affected country is considered an outbreak.

- For the latest information on transmission, signs and symptoms please refer to Clinical management and infection prevention and control for monkeypox: Interim rapid response guidance [https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/355798].

Scope
-----
- Gatherings are events characterized by the concentration of people at a specific location for a specific purpose over a set period of time, and may be public or private, planned or spontaneous, recurrent or one-off, and also of varying size, duration and visibility. They can be of different nature, including, although not limited to, sports, religious, cultural, entertainment, political, business and health-campaign events.

- During gatherings, the likely high density and mobility of attendees (crowding) represents a conducive environment for close, prolonged and frequent interactions between people. Some gatherings may lead to attendees socially interacting with people previously unknown to them. For some, these new interactions could lead to sexual activity which can play a role in the spread of the monkeypox virus.

Risk-based approach for gatherings
----------------------------------
Principles
----------
- WHO recommends that the decision-making process related to holding, modifying, postponing or cancelling gatherings of any size and type should rely on a risk-based approach, tailored to the characteristics of the event under consideration and be repeated at regular intervals.

- The risk-based approach entails 3 steps:
1. Risk evaluation: identification and quantification of the baseline risks based on the characteristics of the event and the context in which it takes place;
2. Risk mitigation: application of a package of precautionary measures aimed at decreasing the baseline risk;
3. Risk communication: proactive dissemination of information on the measures adopted, their rationale and purpose, and on how the relevant decisions were taken.

- In the context of the current outbreak, monkeypox-associated risks should be considered and factored in when planning a gathering event.

- Postponing or cancelling gatherings in areas where monkeypox cases have been detected is not required as a default measure.

Monkeypox-associated risks during the current outbreak
------------------------------------------------------
- In the context of the current monkeypox outbreak, cases have been primarily identified among some gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men including those who have reported recent sex with a new partner or multiple partners.

- Key transmission routes include skin-to-skin, mouth-to mouth and mouth-to-skin contact during sexual activity. Transmission can also occur through skin-to-skin contact not related to sexual practices, face-to-face contact via respiratory droplets and from contaminated surfaces or material; it is still unclear if infected people with no symptoms can transmit the monkeypox virus, making it important for anyone attending gatherings to exert additional care.

Public health advice for decision-makers (authorities and event organizers)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following precautionary measures can be considered to decrease risk of monkeypox transmission associated with gathering events:

- Health authorities are invited to:
• identify those events in their jurisdiction that are most likely to be associated with risk of monkeypox virus transmission, based on the prevailing modes of transmission and the likely profile of the attendees;

• ensure that monkeypox is included among the diseases regularly reported through routine surveillance; WHO has published guidance on surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing for monkeypox;

• make provision to ensure prompt isolation and adequate clinical management of identified cases; WHO has published guidance in this regard;

• keep the general population and event organizers informed on the evolution of the outbreak, and adequately monitor and address rumours and misinformation about monkeypox.

- Event organizers should establish a liaison with the relevant health authorities and be aware of the epidemiology of monkeypox in the host area

- Gatherings should be used as opportunities for information outreach and for risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) activities; these should also target individual behaviours associated with side gatherings, unplanned congregation, and unstructured socialization in public or private spaces.

- Health authorities and event organizers should facilitate the adoption of appropriate public health and social measures, including those aimed at infection prevention and control, to decrease the risk of transmission of the monkeypox virus in conjunction with the event.

- Staff responsible for dealing with people who fall ill at the event should be provided with information on how to identify and manage people with signs and symptoms consistent with monkeypox, and with the relevant personal protective equipment

- RCCE activities including the development of communication materials for travellers on signs and symptoms consistent with monkeypox, on infection prevention and control measures, and on how to seek medical care in countries where monkeypox cases have been reported, should be considered at points of entry.

Public health advice for people organizing smaller gatherings or attending gatherings of any size and type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- People with signs and symptoms consistent with monkeypox should refrain from close contact with any other individual, should avoid attending gatherings, and should follow advice issued by relevant health authorities.

- Close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has signs and symptoms consistent with monkeypox should be avoided.

- Anyone who feels they may have been exposed to monkeypox should exercise additional care

- Information specifically designed for communities of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men is now available, including updated public health advice. [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/monkeypox-public-health-advice-for-men-who-have-sex-with-men].

Gathering attendees should always be reminded to apply individual-level responsibility to their decisions and actions, with the aim of preserving their health, that of the people they interact with, and ultimately that of their community.

WHO continues to monitor the current monkeypox closely for any changes that may affect the advice included in this document. Should any factors change, WHO will issue a further update.
