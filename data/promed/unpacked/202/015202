[So far, only in one of the 15 Immediate notifications which were submitted by China since 3 Aug 2018, when the 1st ASF outbreak was reported from Liaoning, was the origin of infection stated. This refers to the 1st outbreak in Chongking, reported on 5 Nov 2018 (see at http://www.promedmail.org/post/6127486). The report said - "Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: swill feeding". However, according to media reports, citing official sources, more than 60% of the outbreaks are attributed to swill feeding. This may have happened by wide distribution of ASF-contaminated human food, leftovers finding their way to the pig feed. See item 2. - Mod.AS]

Of all major swine producers in China, the Chinese WH Group has recently received the most attention with regards to African Swine Fever [ASF].

The Taiwanese Council of Agriculture reported in early November [2018] that it found ASF virus in a crispy sausage. It was found in a garbage container on a ship travelling between China's Fujian province and the Kinmen islands, wrote the Taipei Times. The Kinmen islands are located just off the Chinese coast, but are under control of Taiwan. Interestingly, so far, from the Chinese Fujian province no official ASF outbreaks in live pigs have been reported.

According to Taiwanese agricultural deputy minister Huang Chin-cheng, the sausage was manufactured by the WH Group. This company was formerly known as Shuanghui or Shineway Group and calls itself 'the world's largest pork company'. Smithfield Foods in the United States is one of its subsidiaries.

Ever since ASF has been found in China, the Taiwanese authorities stepped up quarantine checks of items brought into the island. In total, 690 items have been examined.

For WH Group, the allegations are serious as they would imply that ASF infected pigs are still being sent to meatpackers. The company told news agency Reuters that it is looking for proof for this allegation. Inside China, no report of ASF infected meat has been made.

WH Group was connected to ASF in an earlier period. The 2nd outbreak in China was at a slaughterplant in Zhengzhou city, Henan province. The slaughterhouse belonged to Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development, a subsidiary of the WH Group. That outbreak cost the company RMB6.6 million (835 000 EUR).

Even before the finding of the virus in pork in Taiwan, WH Group already reported financial challenges. The company stated that in the 1st months of 2018, its net profit decreased for a variety of reasons, including lower prices, higher supplies and trade disputes. To news agency Reuters, WH Group's executives stated that they expect pig prices in China to rise next year due to ASF.

The map [link in the source URL] below shows the latest state of affairs with regards to the reported outbreaks of African Swine Fever in China. In total, 59 outbreaks have now been reported to the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE). They were found in 14 different provinces and municipalities.

The latest outbreaks reported come from the south of the country and happened in Hunan and Yunnan provinces and Chongqing municipality. Perhaps most worth noting is a reported outbreak near Pu'Er City in the south of Yunnan province, as it is relatively close to the borders with Laos (170 km or 105 mi), Myanmar (210 km or 130 mi) and Vietnam (245 km or 152 mi). To put these figures in perspective: all other outbreaks in Yunnan province are at least 1000 km [621 mi] north of Pu'Er City.

In the meantime, 3 formerly infected provinces have now been declared 'free from ASF' again: Jiangsu, Anhui and Henan provinces. In the map, they therefore no longer have an orange colour. In provinces coloured blue - the ones adjacent to infected provinces - a trading ban is still in effect. This means that their pigs are not allowed to cross province borders.

[Spread of ASF by untreated swill presents an example of harmful recycling in the setting of industrialized countries with centralized food and/or feed production and supply channels (see also BSE, dioxin...).

Reports on the detection of ASF-contaminated China-sourced pork products at the entrances to S. Korea, Japan and Taiwan underline possible international ramifications of the issue.

As of 8 Nov 2018, following China's notification to the OIE of Hubei's 1st outbreak, ASF has been detected in a total of 63 villages/sites in 15 Provinces/Autonomous regions or Municipalities in China: Liaoning (n=25), Anhui (n=8), Inner Mongolia (n=4), Hunan (n=5), Jiangsu (n=2), Heilongjiang (n=2), Henan (n=2), Jilin (n=2), Zhejiang (n=2), Yunnan (n=3), Shanxi (n=3), Guizhou (n=2), Tianjin (n=1), Chongqing (n=1) and Hubei (n=1).

Since 13 Sep 2018, China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) announced the regulation on strengthening of pig feed supervision. Currently, live pig markets in infected provinces are closed and movement of live pig and pork products from infected provinces is prohibited. The government set a 3 km (1.86 mi) epidemic zone and a 10 km (6.2 mi) buffer zone around the epidemic zone.

On 24 Oct 2018, China State Council issued a notice to further strengthen ASF control including more stringent measures including strict nationwide ban on swill feeding to pigs, record keeping of livestock transportation vehicles.

On 30 Oct 2018, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs launched the "Special Action Plan for Preventing and Controlling ASF Prevention and Control in the Field of Slaughtering Pigs": from 30 Oct 2018 until the end of Jan 2019, a 3-month campaign on fight against illegal pig slaughter for further ASF prevention and control has been launched in the ASF epidemic province and neighboring provinces. - Mod.AS
