Health emergency in Cochabamba due to increase of cases of animal rabies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This morning, authorities of the Departmental of Health Services (Headquarters) reported that a health emergency will be declared in Cercado [Cochabamba Department] because from January of this year [2015], about 40 cases of animals infected with rabies have been reported within the city, and around 41 other cases were reported in other municipalities of the department.

"The cases of canine and feline rabies are presenting in animals younger than 1 year, the rabies virus is circulating more in the city of Cochabamba, especially in the south area. It is a chronic problem: compared to last year [2014], the cases have increased," informed the head of the Epidemiology Unit, Efrain Vallejo.

A mass action to vaccinate all pets of Cochabamba, in all districts of the city, was announced.

"The goal is to vaccinate more than 250 000 animals; we will try to act through checks and sweeps in different areas of the city. It is the only disease in the world whose diagnosis invariably means death, and a rabid dog bites between 4-6 times," Vallejo said.

Cochabamba, so far this year [2015], has registered 2 cases of human rabies; both people died because they did not go to a health center to receive the vaccine.

Moreover, Libertad Lujan, head of the Rabies Program Offices, advised the general public not to buy pets from unknown sources and not to take ownership of stray animals since they are the most vulnerable to rabies.

"We had a case in which a motorcyclist stopped to help a dog that had been run over, was bitten by the animal's natural reaction and instinct, and it turned out that the dog tested positive for rabies. People have to take preventive measures to avoid such incidents," Lujan said.

It also recommended that animals under 1 year should receive at least 4 doses of the vaccine at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

Any person who is attacked by a dog or cat must go immediately to the health center nearest to their home.

Authorities announced that focus controls in all municipalities of Cochabamba are planned for the coming months.

[With an outbreak of this magnitude it seems the Bolivian government would institute mandatory rabies vaccination of all animals.

The number of times these animals must be vaccinated is staggering. I wonder what type of vaccine they are using. The rabies vaccine in the USA calls for animals to be vaccinated at 4 months old and again at 1 year, and then if vaccinated with a 3 year vaccine, again at that 3 year time. The amount of immunity when done this way is shown to be very high by a number of different studies.

People who have been bitten need to wash the wound or wounds with soap and water, and seek medical treatment, including post exposure prophylaxis (PEP). There is a short period of time to receive these injections and people are advised to seek medical attention after any animal bite. - Mod.TG
