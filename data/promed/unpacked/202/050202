Britons hospitalised in ship disease outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
There are fears of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease on a cruise
ship after 6 passengers fell ill. At least 6 people, including 5
Britons, have been admitted to hospital in Sweden after falling ill
on a 17-day cruise of Europe.
The Black Watch ship, owned by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, is cutting
its trip short as a precautionary measure. Swedish disease specialist
Jerker Jonsson said the patients were "in [a] stable condition,"
adding that this was "probably a case of Legionnaires'disease."
The BBC reports that Swedish officials have tested water samples on
the ship as part of their investigations into the outbreak of the
disease. A spokeswoman for Fred Olsen Cruise Lines said passengers
were experiencing "pneumonia-like symptoms."
"It is important to remember that we do not know what the infection
is, nor do we know how it was contracted," she added. The spokeswoman
said the ship will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected upon its
return to port.
Legionnaires' disease can cause pneumonia and its symptoms are
similar to those of the flu. It can be treated with antibiotics.

[Patients on a cruise ship in Europe were said to have
"pneumonia-like symptoms" in the above news release; however the
exact etiology has not as yet been determined, although legionnaires'
disease is suspected. The diagnosis of legionnaires' disease requires
detection of _Legionella_ in respiratory tract secretions by culture
or by use of fluorescent antibody; use of _Legionella_ serology;
detection of _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup I urinary antigen, or
detection of _Legionella_ DNA by polymerase chain reaction in
respiratory secretions.
Cruise ships have been associated with legionnaires' disease in the
past. _Legionella_ are water organisms. Warm water, for example in
water heaters or warm water plumbing systems, at temperatures of
25-40 degrees centigrade (77-104 degrees F) supports the highest
concentrations of the organism. Usually the disease is acquired by
inhalation by a susceptible person of an infectious dose of the
aerosolized organisms. Aerosols can be generated by air conditioning
systems, shower heads, whirlpool spas, or water misters.
Person-to-person transmission is not known to occur. - Mod.ML]
[More information on the results of further investigation of this
outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
