Democratic Republic of the Congo's traditional leaders, the main influencers and keepers of ancestral customs, are the key to community safety and surveillance against the ongoing outbreak of Ebola.

In this context, heightened surveillance is undeniably the ultimate step leading to the adoption of safe practices and considerations. In most affected areas, engaging community leaders as key decision-makers has been essential to ensuring openness of communities and effective behaviour change.

Jean-Baptiste Youka Ibongo is a traditional chief and main leader of a large territory of Bikoro, covering 275 villages. Through his exemplary commitment to the fight against the current Ebola epidemic, he has become an important focal point for his community and today he acts as one of the main links in the chain of community-based surveillance. "During the early stages of the outbreak, we did not know what Ebola was all about. We could not protect ourselves and our families against its devastating effects," he said.

"Our ignorance about the disease gave space to rumours and misinformation. People were even asking whether Ebola is real, or some would remain confined in their homes to avoid being contaminated. We were all complacent with safety measures provided by aid agencies." Understanding the epidemic, its symptoms and especially how to avoid being contaminated, became imperative for Jean-Baptiste, in order to play the role of an agent of change in his territory. "Receiving key knowledge about Ebola gave me adequate arguments and tools to speak to my community and progressively help them understand the dangers and risk involved," he explained.

The commitment of traditional leaders like Jean-Baptiste has been a great asset to the community engagement efforts of the Red Cross. Partnering with traditional leaders instills trust and feeling of ownership towards the relief activities and the actions undertaken to promote safe practices.

One of the main targets of the Red Cross intervention has been adopting ways and mechanisms that allow teams to safely enter communities and to interact with them. Improving the work of community volunteers has consisted of building their capacities to be able to support families to adopt safe prevention attitudes and to monitor and report community events. More than 270 volunteers were trained to conduct awareness-raising sensitization in the 3 most affected heath zones of Wangata, Bikoro, and Iboko. The traditional leaders, knowing the people and being custodians of the cultural heritage, help the communities apply culturally compatible approaches. This builds stronger trust for community-led solutions and reduces fear and misinformation.

In Bikoro, more than 150 community awareness agents, led by community animation focal points, are working under the leadership and supervision of Jean-Baptiste. On a daily basis, these community agents visit households with messages for safe practices. "I believe it has been a good thing for us to be supported by aid organizations in acquiring essential knowledge about Ebola and the communication skills to ease the work we are doing," Jean-Baptiste said.

In order to preserve knowledge acquired from the Ebola operation, and to support ongoing efforts in reaching remote villages with sensitization messages, traditional leaders consult each other as often as possible. Jean-Baptiste said: "It is an approach that allows us to strengthen the solidarity of the group, and also to continue sensitizing the communities. However, because of limited financial means, these capacity building initiatives do not take place frequently."

The current outbreak started in Bikoro and Ikoko-Impenge areas in Equateur, where 5 suspected cases were found in May, of which 2 tested positive for Ebola. So far, Bikoro has recorded the highest number of Ebola cases.

Thomas Bokundu Itofe, the DRC Red Cross president for Equateur province, said: "Building trust between the communities and the Red Cross is key to ensuring that the teams enjoy safe access to the villages. "We guarantee that the people are duly informed and engaged in taking the necessary steps to protect themselves and their families, while respecting the local values."

Antibodies taken from Ebola survivors may offer novel treatments
----------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), have discovered a new set of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the blood of Ebola survivors, which proved protective against disease caused by _Zaire_, _Bundibugyo_, and _Sudan_ ebolaviruses. The findings were published today in the journal Immunity.

In the study, the researchers analyzed plasma from 17 Ebola survivors and found that 2 survivors produced antibodies that bound to an essential virus protein, called glycoprotein, from _Zaire_, _Bundibugyo_, and _Sudan_ ebolavirus species -- the most deadly to humans. Those antibodies prevented the viruses from entering host cells.

Antibody therapy is a promising treatment for Ebola, but the current experimental therapy, ZMapp, targets only one of the 5 known species of the virus -- the _Zaire_ strain.

"These mAbs and related clones are promising candidates for development as broadly protective pan-ebolavirus therapeutic molecules," the authors concluded.

"Highlights
-----------
- Broad human antibody recognizes a quaternary site of vulnerability on ebolavirus GP [glycoprotein].
- The antibody possesses pan-ebolavirus neutralizing and protective capacity.
- The antibody mediates protection principally by direct virus neutralization.
- The antibody uses several mechanisms for contributing to broad immunity."

Ebola virus uses GP to attach to cell membranes and initiate infection. In a series of experiments, the team delineated interactions between various forms of viral GP and 3 of the newly isolated bNAbs (broadly neutralizing antibodies). The results provided evidence of multiple mechanisms by which the antibodies inhibit actions of all forms of GP, thus preventing infection by halting viral entry into the host cell. The team also determined that one of the bNAbs, EBOV-520, recognizes and binds to a portion of virus GP in such a way that prevents it from interacting with a cell surface protein called NPC1 and initiating the infection cycle.

The researchers conclude that these broadly neutralizing antibodies are promising candidates for further development as therapeutic molecules against several ebolavirus species (from https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/broadly-acting-antibodies-found-plasma-ebola-survivors). - Mod.LK]

[4] Vaccine effectiveness

Congo's Ebola outbreak is all but over. Did an experimental vaccine help?
----------------------------------------------------
An Ebola outbreak that erupted 8 May [2018] in a remote region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and then threatened to explode in a highly populated city appears to have been quelled. On 12 Jun [2018], the last known person infected with the deadly hemorrhagic fever had recovered, twice testing negative for the virus. That started the 42-day clock for an official declaration, expected on 24 Jul [2018], that the outbreak is over.

The quick end to this outbreak -- after 53 cases in Equateur province, 29 of which were fatal -- is a striking contrast to the Ebola epidemic that devastated West Africa from 2014 to 2016, which sickened more than 28 000 people, killing 11 310. "I certainly haven't seen an Ebola-response time frame that looks this compressed," says epidemiologist Peter Salama, who heads the Health Emergencies Programme at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland, and led the agency's DRC response. Much of the credit goes to unusually rapid and vigorous surveillance, contact tracing, containment, and public education efforts by the DRC, WHO, and other international partners, Salama says. "Some of the most important lessons from the West African epidemic were truly learned." But a new factor played an unknown, and perhaps important, role: an experimental vaccine, used for the first time early in an outbreak.

No one can say for sure that the vaccine -- tested during the waning days of the West African epidemic -- actually protected against infection. But DRC minister of health Oly Ilunga Kalenga calls the vaccination program a "game changer", as it clearly boosted morale and encouraged other public health efforts.

Experts suggest next steps for Ebola treatment studies
---------------------------------
Ebola experts agree that a randomized, controlled clinical trial based on a combination strategy of a monoclonal antibody and a direct-acting antiviral would be the most useful to conduct during the next Ebola outbreak, but they cautioned that achieving the desired sample size would be challenging. Their opinions were gathered by researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and published yesterday in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Because of a number of factors, including logistical challenges and lack of controls, only one clinical trial of an Ebola treatment was conducted during the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak. That trial, PREVAIL II, compared treatment with ZMapp (an experimental monoclonal antibody) to standard of care, but the trial ended prematurely and suffered low enrolment.

According to leading pharmaceutical experts, academics, and government officials, monoclonal antibodies should be the backbone of future Ebola treatment studies, and could be combined with direct-acting antivirals in any study conducted during a future outbreak.

"There is a clear scientific and moral imperative to develop consensus on the most appropriate clinical research strategies to be undertaken in advance of the next outbreak," the authors concluded. "Having this consensus clearly articulated in advance might lead to earlier and more-effective introduction of clinical research initiatives in areas of disease outbreak and more-rapid acceptance both internationally and by the affected communities."

Abstract
--------
Background
The 2013-2016 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa led to unprecedented morbidity and mortality. Although different classes of putative antiviral agents with supportive preclinical data were available for testing, and although several attempts to perform meaningful evaluation of these agents were undertaken during the epidemic, different research methods, a lack of appropriate controls in most studies, and formidable logistical challenges to completion of studies under field conditions hampered the success of these efforts. Ultimately only 1 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (PREVAIL II) was performed in this setting, and, owing to a decrease in the number of new cases available for study, it, too, ended prior to reaching definitive results. Retrospective review of the lessons learned from this outbreak argues strongly for the need for much better preparedness in terms of selecting the trial design and drug(s) for use during the next outbreak.
