The Office of the Director of the Rural Hospital of Epuyen [HZE] stated that, given the confirmed case of a hantavirus infection, they have taken coordinated action per the protocol consisting of the isolation of 6 people, companions of the patient who is hospitalized in the HZE. The isolation is being controlled by health personnel and the local police as well as with the assistance of Social Action of the municipality.

[The above report provides no information about the case other than that it is confirmed as a hantavirus infection. The circumstances under which the patient acquired the infection and how the 6 companions were in contact are not given.

The hantavirus involved is not mentioned but is likely to be Andes virus. Last year (2019), there were 34 confirmed Andes virus cases with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), 12 fatal. The initial spillover occurred in Epuyen, province of Chubut, in the Andean region. The Andes virus (ANDV, genus _Orthohantavirus_, family Hantaviridae) was confirmed as the etiological agent in the Epuyen outbreak. Its most common host reservoir is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_).

Transmission from rodent to humans usually occurs through close contact with infected urine and excretions. Secondary human-to-human infections are considered uncommon but may occur through direct contact with infected saliva, urine, or blood. However, in the situation above, because of the human-to-human transmission in the Epuyen outbreak, the patient's 6 companions have been placed in isolation until proven free of infection or will be treated if infected. - Mod.TY
