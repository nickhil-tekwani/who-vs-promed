A 64-year-old Taos man is dead of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The
state Department of Health said it was the 1st hantavirus case in New
Mexico this year [2008].

The often deadly disease is transmitted through the urine, droppings
or saliva of infected rodents -- especially deer mice [ _Peromyscus
maniculatus_]. People contract the disease by breathing in the dried
particles infected with the virus.

Early symptoms include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills,
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and cough.
Symptoms develop within one to 6 weeks after exposure.

There's no specific treatment for hantavirus, but health officials
say the chances for recovery are better with early medical attention.

"The best defense against hantavirus is to avoid disturbing areas of
rodent infestation, including nests and droppings," said Dr. Paul
Ettestad, public health veterinarian for the Health Department. He
said people should air out cabins and sheds before entering them for
the first time as the weather warms up.

The department also suggests sealing homes and cabins so mice can't
get in; trapping mice until they're all gone; using disinfectant to
clean up nests and droppings; moving hay, wood and compost piles as
far from the house as possible; eliminating trash and junk piles; and
not leaving pet food where mice can get to it.

New Mexico has had 77 hantavirus cases and 32 deaths since hantavirus
was 1st identified in the Four Corners area in 1993.

Last year [2007], New Mexico reported one hantavirus fatality out of
3 cases. In 2006, the state had 8 cases of hantavirus and 3
fatalities. There was one case in 2005 and 4 in 2004.

[As rural outbuildings and cabins undergo spring cleaning, care
should be taken to avoid exposure to hantaviruses in the dust that
usually is produced. The hantavirus involved in this and the previous
New Mexico 2007 cases is doubtless Sin Nombre virus.
