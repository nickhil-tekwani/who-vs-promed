[The United Kingdom (UK) is the 4th country in Europe to detect and report HPAI H5N6. The Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany are the other affected countries.

The information below was published by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and the Animal and Plant Health Agency, and is related to the most recently conducted risk assessment for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Europe (on 21 Dec 2017):

"Given the uncertainty in the distribution and prevalence of H5N8 in wild birds in northern Europe and the developing situation with H5N6 in the Netherlands, it is appropriate to keep the risk level for incursion of HPAI into UK at "MEDIUM" for the present but keep under continuous review. Because of the proximity of the Netherlands to the UK and possibility of wild birds flying to the UK from Europe, the main focus must now be on H5N6 in wild birds in the UK rather than H5N8, the risk of which appears to be diminishing within Europe at least. The risk of introduction of infection onto individual poultry premises in the UK remains "LOW" now, but will depend on levels of biosecurity, which we recommend should be increased."

"We strongly recommend that all poultry keepers (including backyard keepers) review their biosecurity measures and business continuity plans now, as the risk level may well increase in the coming weeks. They should familiarise themselves with government guidance on good biosecurity and how to report suspicion of disease appropriately."
