As the summer comes to a close, ticks, a seasonal menace, continue to
cause illness and death around the country, with 6 people dying last
week of tick-borne Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), thus
bringing the year-to-date tally of CCHF victims to 61.

According to data from the Ministry of Health, between 1 Jan and 31
Aug 2009, 274 cases of CCHF were detected, 61 of which were fatal,
whereas 1298 cases were diagnosed in the same period of 2008, and only
59 lost their lives.

Efforts to eradicate ticks, which can be found in almost 1200 Turkish
villages, continue at full speed. Ministry of Health officials carry
out education and awareness campaigns, distribute tick repellent and
spray for ticks in affected areas. Officials warn, however, that many
citizens do not take necessary precautions to avoid tick bites and
their resulting illnesses.
