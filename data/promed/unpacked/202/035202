Chinese fowl still imported during bird flu resurgence
-----------------------------------------------
Just as bird flu resurfaced again after a one-year absence, authorities
reported that an alarming 4 tons of illegal Chinese fowl arrived in Viet
Nam since December last year [2006] in a northern province bordering China.
Lang Son provincial authorities also said they confiscated nearly 2 tons of
fowl transported from China on 3 occasions on Tuesday [2 Jan 2007] alone.
In Quang Ninh province, also in the north, as the New Year was approaching
last Thursday and Friday [28-29 Dec 2006], local authorities confiscated
1.2 tons, said Nguyen Dang Truong, head of the province's market management.
A Lucrative Business: A Tuoi Tre journalist in the role of a fowl trader on
Tuesday [2 Jan 2007] managed to convince an experienced middlemen called
Trung to take him to the Na Pan Bridge in Lang Son's Bao Lam commune
bordering China. Trung said the area is most active at midnight and is the
most hectic under-the-counter fowl market in the nation. Several steps
away, a big youth holding a walkie-talkie in a heavily tattooed hand
appeared from inside a small hut temporarily erected on the street. He
blocked their path, asking insolently who the journalist was. Only after
Trung explained they were looking for chickens did the guy grant them access.
Passing the "sentry box," Trung said the man is a "barn owl," meaning a
guard. Every fowl transporter has to pay him VND 2000 [USD 0.12] per trip
on "toll fees," he added.
A while further, we saw many chicken pens lying haphazardly somewhere on
the Viet Nam-China border. The scene was sickening. Each pen was cramped
with over 20 chickens, mostly having pale-white cheeks, dull eyes, drooping
heads, feathers being stuck together and all emitting foul smells. Some
even salivated.
A dozen or so men and women started carrying the pens on their shoulders, 2
on one. Trung said they were taking them to the Tam Lung area in Thuy Hung
commune, a 2-hour walk, for a fee of VND 3000-4000 [up to USD 0.25] per
chicken. Thus, they can earn over VND 100 000 [USD 6.25] a trip, a fortune
for rural residents. The masterminds behind the scene, the traders, then
transported the chickens, mostly very cheaply, to downtown areas for sale.
One kilogram of chicken is sold for only 5-6 Chinese yuan [USD 0.65] in
China, while the price is 5 times higher in Viet Nam, around VND 50 000
[USD 3], said Do Van Duoc, head of the province's Animal Heath Department.
He said minus transport and "toll" fees, each trader doubles his initial
purchase. On average, it is estimated that several tons of Chinese chicken
are smuggled into Lang Son daily.
At Ky Lua market, a woman offers chickens for VND 32 000 [USD 2] a
kilogram. Here, the journalist found no officials or guards. However, Hoang
Van Son, deputy head of the province's market management department,
dismissed this, saying there have never been any Chinese chickens being
sold illegally in Ky Lua. But he admitted, "Many times as authorities were
going to stop an illegal transport, a fleet of motorbikes boldly rushed
head-on into the officials."

[As Tuoi Tre states, this is a "lucrative business," and though illegal,
the local authorities without support are unable to stop it. I am sure that
this is not a unique situation in one distant corner of Viet Nam. To stop
such trade, one needs effective and coordinated government action to stop
the exportation and to hinder the importation. For example, the Chinese
provincial authorities are doing nothing in the patently illegal trade
events described above. This does nothing to help the Vietnamese provincial
authorities. Bureaucratic denials and hollow claims do nothing to stop this
trade. Before any of us are tempted to point fingers, I would say "Get your
own house in order, your people prepared and trained, and local agriculture
and communities fully on your side." Otherwise, when HPAI does come
knocking, as it well might, you will, as the Chinese say, have a most
interesting time. - Mod.MHJ]
