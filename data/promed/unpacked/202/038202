https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/03/why-did-covid-disappear-from-our-collective-consciousness-so-quickly


After a mass trauma comes the mass forgetting. No one really wants to talk about COVID any more, even though it tore through every dimension of our lives. But now it's as if the disruption was so great, weird, terrible and abrupt, that we cannot incorporate it into our present and future narratives. And so we have done a remarkable and largely collective job of acting like the pandemic is over, and -- even more -- of trying to forget that it even happened.

The pandemic barely came up as an election issue [in the UK]. It didn't form part of either party's main pitch or talking points, rarely rating a mention despite it dictating the most significant policy shifts (a doubling of jobseeker, a mass business subsidy in form of jobkeeper, closed international borders, widespread stay-at-home orders) in our lifetimes.

COVID-related deaths were announced each day by a grave-faced premier. One death was "too many." Now COVID-related deaths are on the rise and no one blinks.

In popular culture, the pandemic also shows signs of leaving few, if any, trace elements. For a collective experience that literally everyone on earth will relate to, it forms very little of our cultural content (an exception being Bo Burnham's Inside and now Inside the Outtakes -- 2 iconic comedy specials that never mention the pandemic but are very much of it).

Sitting in a writers' room last year [2021] for a television show, it was decided pretty quickly to not mention the pandemic in the series we were making; it would be too much of a downer to have our characters wearing masks or checking in with QR codes. And so it's not mentioned.

Publishers tell me they are also steering clear of what they call "lockdown novels" -- books written in lockdown about the pandemic -- for the same reason. Readers, after they've recovered from 2 years of lockdowns, don't want to be reminded of the experience.

Even our health and medical decisions seem somehow tainted with a backlash to the last 2 years. Take-up of the 3rd dose of the vaccine is sluggish and people are slow to get the flu shot, maybe because they have jab fatigue.

In the United States, the Washington Post reported this week that despite "recording more than 100 000 infections a day -- at least 5 times higher than this point last year [2021]" a sort of collective act of mass rejection of the pandemic is taking place.

"Parents of children too young to be vaccinated are making cross-country travel plans," they write. "Octogenarians are venturing to bars. And families are celebrating graduations and weddings with throngs of mostly unmasked revelers -- mindful they may get sick. Again."

In Australia it's the same story. Cases are at least 35 000 a day, but with a vaccinated population, it's 2019 all over again.

At a party in a crowded pub on Saturday [28 May 2022] night, the windows were steamed up and people were just sort of draped over each other. The birthday girl blew out the candles (saliva particles propelled through the air, across the cake) and then we all ate the cake.

At the opening night party of a recent writers' festival, masks were off and people jammed into a space, hugging and kissing -- while publishers told me their authors were "dropping like flies" due to COVID and cancelling their events. So deep is the dissociation that we seem willfully blind to the link between standing 5 cm away from someone's face while salivating on them and the sickness that results.

One friend, who is immunocompromised but has cautiously started venturing out, told me this week, "I was walking home late past the Imperial the other night and the dance floor was packed. It was jarring to me though...so normal but it also felt extraordinary."

What feels extraordinary to me is that lockdowns were less than a year ago. The things of that time -- Gladys and Kerry, Dan and Brad, the daily press conference and "the numbers," police fining people for sitting alone on a bench eating a kebab, the 5 km limit, the "LGAs of concern" -- seem like they are from another era, one we've tacitly all just agreed not to talk about, or remember, or dwell on. It's an era that somehow has a taint of embarrassment about it.

All these things feed into the collective consciousness that this thing is over -- sort of. Well not really, but yes, let's just call it over, because we all, so badly, want it to be over. I'm curious as to what it is in the human psyche that makes such a collective volte-face possible. How, as a collective, have we gone from fear to abandon so very, very quickly -- and done so on such a mass scale?

It's happened before. At the start of the pandemic in 2020, I went looking for the novels, art and music that came out of the 1918 Spanish flu -- and found virtually nothing. It's as if an entire society made a decision just to move on from it, leaving very little cultural artefacts for future generations to pick through. In April 2020, this huge omission made no sense to me. But now in June 2022, it does. It's happening right now.

In May 2020, when things were just beginning, The New York Times asked, "When will the COVID-19 pandemic end? And how?"

"According to historians, pandemics typically have 2 types of endings," they say. "The medical, which occurs when the incidence and death rates plummet, and the social, when the epidemic of fear about the disease wanes. When people ask, 'when will this end?,' they are asking about the social ending," said Dr Jeremy Greene, a historian of medicine at Johns Hopkins.

What we are experiencing right now is the pandemic's social death, which is fascinating to watch from a sociological perspective (or horrifying, if you are vulnerable or immunocompromised).

Vaccinations have eased the severity of the disease and the need for lockdowns; the abandonment of the COVID-zero policy has meant the government no longer has to create measures to stop the spread; and a society-wide fatigue with homeschooling and stay-at-home orders have meant that there is little opposition to a return to business as usual.

An era has ended, and maybe one day we'll wonder if it even happened.

[The world is easily distracted. Interest in COVID has waned despite the case numbers partly because everyone wants it to be over, but I think also because the Russian invasion of Ukraine took away our attention. Then the horrific shooting in Uvalde occurred, further distracting us. Certainly people can pay attention to more than one unfolding event at a time, but they tend not to. - Mod.LK]

[2] CIDRAP update
[A] COVID-19 rises in Portugal, India
Date: Thu 2 Jun 2022

As new omicron subvariants fan out across the globe, a few more countries are reporting rising cases, including Portugal and India.

Portugal is reporting a fresh spike in COVID-19 activity, with a 7-day average of daily cases at 2447, according Reuters, which said the level has reached just over one-third of its omicron variant peak in January [2022] (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/omicron-sub-variant-fuels-portugals-covid-19-surge-2022-06-02/).

Public health officials in Portugal said the BA.5 omicron subvariant has been detected in 90% of sequenced samples from newly infected patients, a level thought to be the highest among European nations. The BA.4 subvariant has also been detected in Portugal. Both were first identified in South Africa, which recently had a modest 5th wave, but it's not clear where the 2 subvariants originated.

Meanwhile, India's case increase is mainly led by a surge in Mumbai, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/india/rapid-rise-mumbai-pushes-indias-covid-numbers-month-high-2022-06-02/). The nation's cases are at their highest levels in a month. A government official said the wave is mild and involves omicron variants, though it's not clear which subvariants are involved. So far, hospitalizations aren't rising in Mumbai.

Elsewhere, cases are rising in most parts of the Americas, except for the Caribbean region and the Atlantic islands, officials from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said yesterday [1 Jun 2022] at a briefing. Overall cases in the region were up 10.4% last week compared to the previous week, with deaths up 14%. South America's cases rose 43.1% (https://www.paho.org/en/news/1-6-2022-covid-19-cases-rise-americas-countries-also-face-threat-seasonal-flu-hurricanes-paho).

Countries in the Americas are also battling other respiratory viruses, including influenza, PAHO said, with levels higher than expected in Mexico and Peru and flu hospitalizations up in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay.

In other global COVID developments:
- The COVID-19 pandemic slowed progress toward universal energy access, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [1 Jun 2022] in a report. It said lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, and fiscal resource diversions affected the pace of progress toward a 2030 Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring that all people have access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy (https://www.who.int/news/item/01-06-2022-report--covid-19-slows-progress-towards-universal-energy-access).

- A recent WHO analysis in Lancet Global Health projects that COVID-19 deaths in Africa will fall 94% this year [2022] compared with 2021 owing to vaccination, improved pandemic response, and immunity from earlier infections. Officials from the WHO African regional office spotlighted the report today [2 Jun 2022] in a briefing, noting that cases are estimated to drop by a little over 25% (https://www.afro.who.int/news/covid-19-deaths-african-region-fall-nearly-94-2022-who-analysis).

- The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization yesterday [1 Jun 2022] posted an interim assessment of hybrid SARS-CoV-2 immunity and population seroprevalence, part of an effort to help countries navigate their latest vaccination strategies. SAGE members said hybrid immunity from vaccination and infection appears to improve protection, compared to immunity from infection alone, and that high vaccine coverage is important, especially in high-risk groups (https://www.who.int/news/item/01-06-2022-interim-statement-on-hybrid-immunity-and-increasing-population-seroprevalence-rates).

[C] Pfizer: FDA consideration

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/06/covid-19-rises-portugal-india-pfizer-seeks-vax-approval-young-kids


Pfizer and BioNTech said yesterday [1 Jun 2022] that they have finished submitting an application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use their COVID-19 vaccine in kids ages 6 months through 4 years old, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/06/01/coronavirus-vaccine-young-children-pfizer/). The developments sets the scene for FDA vaccine advisers to consider the application on 15 Jun 2022, when they will also consider an EUA for the Moderna vaccine in kids ages 6 months through 5 years old.

Pfizer's EUA submission comes in the wake of findings about 2 weeks ago that found strong efficacy and good tolerability for a 3-dose regimen of a child-sized dose in young children. In February [2022], the companies abruptly delayed the EUA application for the vaccine in youngsters after a 2-dose regimen showed underwhelming immune response in kids ages 2 and older, suggesting that 3 doses would be better.

Yesterday [1 Jun 2022], the United States reported 198 403 new COVID-19 cases, along with 384 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker. The nation's cases have been rising slowly but steadily since late April [2022], partly due to a more transmissible BA.2.12.1 subvariant, which was first detected in New York (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases).

[3] Vaccination during pregnancy
Date: Thu 2 Jun 2022
Source: Center for Infection Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/06/covid-19-vaccine-during-pregnancy-may-protect-infants


COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy protects babies from SARS-CoV-2 infection in their first 4 months of life, according to a study yesterday [1 Jun 2022] in JAMA Internal Medicine (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2793109).

In the cohort study, which included all infants born in Norway late last year [2021] and early this year [2022], COVID-19 incidence was lower in babies born to women who received either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine during the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Protection, however, was more than twice as high during the period dominated by the delta variant as during the omicron period.

The researchers -- primarily from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health -- note that studies have shown that babies born to women vaccinated during pregnancy are protected against diseases like pertussis (whooping cough) and flu. So they aimed to assess whether the phenomenon held true for COVID vaccines.

They note that, of 21 643 Norwegian babies born from September 2021 through February 2022, 9739 of them (45.0%) were born to women who received a 2nd or 3rd dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy.

The investigators analyzed data on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for mothers and their babies, all of which are registered in the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases. They included data on the 1st SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR test for babies at least one day after birth up to 4 months of age, as well as information on women who had a positive test 14 or more days before giving birth. In Norway, free PCR tests are widely available.

The incidence rate of a positive COVID-19 test for infants 0-4 months old overall was 5.8 per 10 000 follow-up days. For babies born to vaccinated women during the delta period, it was 1.2 per 10 000 follow-up days, versus 3.0 for babies born to unvaccinated mothers, for a vaccine effectiveness of 71% (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.46).

In the omicron period, however, the incidence rate was 7.0 per 10 000 follow-up days in the mother-vaccinated group, compared with 10.9 per 10 000 follow-up days in the unvaccinated group. That translates to a vaccine effectiveness in the newborns of 33% (aHR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.79).

Compared with vaccinated mothers, unvaccinated mothers were younger and had more children and less education, and a lower proportion of them were born in Scandinavia. The percentage of infants born to vaccinated mothers increased during the study period. Most newborns with a positive COVID-19 test during the fall of 2021 were born to unvaccinated mothers, but an infant's age at the time of a positive test was similar between the groups.

The rate of infant hospitalization for COVID-19 as the main diagnosis was 0.07% in both groups.

The authors say the strengths of the study include the breadth and depth of the Norwegian population data, which is possible because of mandatory reporting in the country. They write, "We believe our study results are generalizable to other pregnant populations. This assumption is strengthened by the fact that the findings align with the results from the US study examining maternal COVID-19 vaccination and risk of infant hospitalization for COVID-19."

Limitations include lack of testing for variants, the possible antibody protection provided by breastfeeding, potential healthy vaccinee bias, varied follow-times, and a lack of information on the infants' disease symptoms. They did not characterize any of the limitations as major, however.

The authors conclude, "The findings of this study provide early evidence to suggest that infants benefit from passive protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection following maternal COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy."

[The following is from the Discussion section of the study discussed above (references can be found at https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2793109):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"It is not unexpected that maternal COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy could reduce infant risk of COVID-19, as similar protective benefits against infant infection have been documented for pertussis and influenza vaccination during pregnancy in randomized clinical trials and observational studies (2,3). Because the newborn's immune system is naive, with limited antibody response during the 1st months of life, an important protection against infection comes from maternally transferred antibodies (2,3). Infants are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 compared with older children (1). As to our knowledge no COVID-19 vaccines are licensed for use in children younger than 5 years, an added benefit of maternal vaccination during pregnancy could be a protection of infants against SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 1st months of life (4).

"We observed a lower risk of infection among infants born to women who received their 3rd dose in pregnancy compared with the 2nd, suggesting a stronger level of protection following the booster dose. This aligns with studies showing a waning of vaccine effect after the 2nd dose unless a booster is received (11). Infants born to women with only one mRNA vaccine dose received during pregnancy also had a lower risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test than those born to unvaccinated women, but results were not statistically significant." - Mod.LK]
