Sudden death syndrome (SDS) has been found in many Nebraska soybean
fields over the last two weeks. This disease was only first confirmed
in the state in 2004. Calls and samples across the eastern half of
Nebraska suggest the disease is widespread, but in most fields large
areas are not affected.
Sudden death syndrome of soybean is caused by the fungus _Fusarium
solani_ f. sp. _glycines_. This is a different fungus than the one
that caused early season damping off problems associated with soybean
stands. This year's weather with moisture in the early season and at
the early reproductive stage has been conducive to SDS. It should be
possible to see full symptom expression now.
Early planting favors SDS. With all the information on increasing
yields with earlier planting, we expect to see more of this disease.
Soil compaction and high fertility levels also have been associated
with increased levels of SDS.
The foliar symptoms start with interveinal necrosis and the spots
coalesce to form brown streaks between the leaf veins with yellow
margins. Leaves eventually drop with the petiole (leaf stem)
remaining attached. The root system will have a deteriorated tap-root
and lateral roots will only be evident in the upper soil profile. The
root cortex is light-gray to brown and may extend up the stem.
Typically, plants can be pulled from the ground easily and will have
a dark blue fungal growth on the roots. The blue color will not be
evident in dry soil conditions.
At this time SDS appears to be widespread in Nebraska, but it can be
effectively managed. If a large area of the field is affected, early
planting should be avoided and resistant varieties used next year.
Thus far, seed treatment has not been shown to be effective.

[SDS was 1st discovered in the USA (Arkansas) in 1972 and has now
become widespread in soybean-growing regions in the United States,
Argentina, and Brazil. Plants turn yellow and die quickly after pod
set and symptoms often appear in patches in a field. Yield losses may
be more than 80 percent, depending on variety and timing of
infection. Appearance of SDS at early pod fill is reportedly more
damaging than its appearance at a later stage of plant development.
Yield reduction is the result of reduced photosynthetic area,
defoliation, flower and pod abortion, and reduced seed size.
_Fusarium virguliforme_ (previously _F. solani_ f. sp. _glycines_)
has been described as the causal pathogen in North America and _F.
tucumaniae_ in South America. Phylogenetic evidence indicates the 2
SDS pathogens do not share a most recent common ancestor, but appear
to have evolutionary origins in the southern hemisphere since they
are deeply nested within a South American clade of the _F. solani_
species complex. The fungi cannot be isolated from tissue above the
soil line. Foliar symptoms are thought to be the result of a
fungus-produced plant toxin.
It is suggested that any stress factor (biological, mechanical, or
environmental) may magnify SDS symptom expression and cause
SDS-affected plants to deteriorate earlier. In particular, Soybean
cyst nematode (SCN), although not required for severe SDS to occur,
is reported to exacerbate foliar symptoms and lead to early and
severe SDS, if present at sufficient levels. Other soybean pathogens
affecting leaves, roots, or stems are being studied for a potential
role in SDS development.
