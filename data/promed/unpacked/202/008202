At least 350 people, including women and children, have been poisoned after eating food at a funeral reception in the Dawlat Shah district of eastern Laghman Province, an official said on Thursday [9 Aug 2018].

Sarhadi Zwak, the governor's spokesman, told Pajhwok Afghan News that the incident took place in Masmuti village of the district on Wednesday [8 Aug 2018]. He said 350 people were poisoned after consuming food at the funeral gathering and were immediately transported in ambulances to a nearby clinic. According to Zwak, the provincial public health department has dispatched an investigative team to the site, and a probe is currently under way into the incident.

Gulab Shah, a resident of the area, said the people who had fallen ill were in critical condition, as there were no transportation facilities to shift the poisoned people to healthcare centers.

[The timing of the outbreak appears to have been such that the incubation period was short. Knowing the incubation period, what symptoms were present (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or non-gastrointestinal) and whether fever was present can help in the differential diagnosis. Knowing what foods were served can also help. For short incubation foodborne diseases, 2 most noteworthy are staphylococcal enterotoxin illness or heavy metal poisoning, the latter from ingesting liquids from containers that may leach the metal. Food contaminated with chemicals such as insecticides can also present with a short incubation illness.

Laghman is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the eastern part of the country. - Mod.LL
