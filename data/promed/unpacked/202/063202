Clinical EEE in a healthy adult is unusual -- as is clinical EEE in a
child -- but one needn't postulate immunosuppression to explain an adult
case. Of 36 cases of EEE that occured in the USA between 1988-1994, 29
(81%) were in patients aged 20 or older. Neither was age of the patient a
statistically significant predictor or outcome, although patients with
favorable outcomes tended to be younger than those with unfavorable
outcomes (New Eng J Med 336:1867-74, 1997).
