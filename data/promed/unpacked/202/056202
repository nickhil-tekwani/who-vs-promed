Black dead arm and basal canker of _Vitis vinifera_ cv. Red Globe caused by
_Botryosphaeria obtusa_ in Chile
-----------------------------------------------
J. Auger, M. Esterio, G. Ricke, and I. Perez, Departamento de Sanidad
Vegetal, Facultad de Ciencias Agronomicas, Universidad de Chile, Casilla
1004, Santiago, Chile. Plant Dis. 88:1286, 2004; published on-line as
D-2004-0913-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication 19 Aug 2004.
Several years ago, _Vitis vinifera_ cv. Red Globe vines (over 6 years old),
started to show disease symptoms approximately 10 weeks after bud break.
Symptoms 1st appeared on the leaves at the base of the shoots and then
spread to other leaves, continuing to appear throughout the growing season.
2 forms of the disease (severe and mild) were observed, each case leading
to premature leaf fall. The severe form was characterized by dieback of one
or more shoots accompanied by leaf drop and shriveling and drying of fruit
clusters. The mild form was characterized by wine-red spots on the leaf
margins or the leaf blade, which coalesced to form large zones of necrosis
between the veins and the margins of the leaf. Fruit clusters may wither.
When the bark was scraped off, a brown streak, one to 2 cm wide, was often
seen in the wood. The streaking began at the base of the affected shoot and
extended upward to the ground level, eventually resulting in a basal canker.
_Botryosphaeria obtusa_ (Schwein.) Shoemaker (anamorph = _Sphaeropsis
malorum_ Berk.) was isolated from 86 percent of samples from vines that
were 6 to 10 years old from 12 locations in IV, V, VI, and metropolitan
regions of Chile. Isolations were made from brown-streaked wood. Isolates
were identified on the basis of a previous description (1,2) and internal
transcribed spacer (ITSI-5.8S-ITS2) rDNA sequences identical to those of
_B. obtusa_ (culture KJ9356, GenBank Accession No. AF027759). _B. obtusa_
is established as one of the main fungi associated with black dead arm of
grapevine (2,3).
Pathogenicity tests were completed by inoculating approximately 20
microliters of mycelial suspension via injection into the pith of 16
single-node, rooted cuttings of _V. vinifera_ cv. Red Globe. 16 control
cuttings were injected with an equal volume of sterile distilled water. 20
weeks after inoculation, all _B. obtusa_-inoculated cuttings exhibited
brown streaks in the wood extending 50 to 60 mm from the point of
inoculation. The wood streaking observed in inoculated plants was identical
to symptoms observed in naturally infected black dead arm vines in the
vineyard. No symptoms were observed in the controls.
_B. obtusa_ was re-isolated from the region of brown streaking in all the
inoculated cuttings. _B. obtusa_ was not isolated from the water-treated
controls.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _B. obtusa_ causing black dead
arm and basal canker on Red Globe grapevine in Chile. The fungal isolates
have been deposited in the plant pathology laboratory of the Sanidad
Vegetal Department of Agronomy Faculty of the University of Chile under the
name _V. vinifera_/_B. obtusa_ from N 1 to 16.

[_Botryosphaeria obtusa_ [Bo] is common on dead or moribund wood of a wide
range of hosts. In North America, Bo is reported to cause an important leaf
spot, canker, and fruit rot of apple, while in England and New Zealand it
is chiefly a weak secondary pathogen associated with, but not necessarily
the primary cause of, leaf spots, cankers, and fruit rots. It has been
associated with various wood diseases of grapevines in several viticultural
regions of the world. Frequently, it is found on tissues that have been
damaged by physical factors or killed by primary pathogens. This species
can be distinguished from other _Botryosphaeria_ spp. by the large, dark
brown, mostly aseptate conidia, and the distinctly annellate conidiogenous
cells. It is probable that the disease is caused by a complex of species.
Control of diseases caused by Bo is difficult, as information on disease
control, especially chemical control, is very limited. Currently, there are
no fungicides registered for use against _Botryosphaeria_ dieback in South
Africa (Nel et al., 1999). France is one of the very few countries in which
a fungicide is registered for control of black dead arm caused by Bo, _B.
dothidea_, and, in some cases, _B. stevensii_. Sodium arsenite is
recommended and must be used under the same conditions as for the treatment
of Esca disease (Larignon & Dubos, 2001; Lehoczky, 1974; 1994). Good
sanitation practice, specifically removal and burning of pruning debris, is
recommended.
