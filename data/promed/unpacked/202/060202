Antibodies of Schmallenberg virus detected in mainland Finland
--------------------------------------------------------------
Antibodies of the Schmallenberg virus have been detected in several cattle herds in Southwest and South Finland. Based on the results of analyses completed on 29 Oct 2012, the virus has spread to South Finland during the summer and early autumn of 2012. The disease is not transmitted to humans and will not give rise to measures by the authorities, and any treatment can be agreed on with the local veterinarian.

The 1st antibodies of the Schmallenberg virus were detected in Finland in late September 2012 in samples taken from healthy cattle in the Aland Islands. Evira [Finnish Food Safety Authority] has continued to survey the spread of the disease and, on the basis of the results, the virus is found south of the line drawn between the towns of Vaasa and Savonlinna. Samples from 47 different farms have been analysed so far, and antibodies have been found in 25 of these farms. The studies continue.

The Aland Islands and the coastal areas in Southwest and South Finland have been regarded as a risk area in terms of the disease. In future, samples from outside this risk area will also be tested for antibodies of the Schmallenberg virus. That way, it will be detected how far north and east the virus has spread so far.

The Schmallenberg virus is transmitted from one ruminant to another via midges. The spread of the virus depends on the ambient temperature and the number of midges suitable for spreading the disease and ruminants susceptible to the disease. When the temperature falls, the midges are no longer active, and this will stop the virus from spreading. It is currently not known whether the virus is able to overwinter in Finland. It is probable that midges carrying the virus will continue to arrive in Finland driven by southerly and southwesterly winds. The symptoms have not been reported as yet. Sometimes the viral infection may result in deformed foetuses.

[2] Europe: update, UK

Schmallenberg virus in Northern Europe
--------------------------------------
1. Disease report
-----------------
Our previous report in July [2012] (ref 1; http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/files/poa-schmallenburg-update-20120725.pdf) reported that the number of cases of deformities in newborn ruminants across Europe was decreasing, in line with the breeding season rather than as a result of decreasing disease transmission. Countries are not required to routinely report the number of cases identified. Nevertheless an update is pertinent given the research, which is now being reported and updates on disease spread, including UK surveillance activity.

Currently, countries which have reported evidence of SBV infection include Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, while Austria, Finland, Poland, Sweden [and Norway; see ProMED-mail post 20121026.1366841. - Mod.AS] have recently reported evidence of SBV infection, which mirrors the EFSA [European Food Safety Authority] report on the predicted likely spread of infection.

The map [see at source URL above] is only to give an indication of the spread of disease as not all Member States are reporting on a regional basis because this is not required for official notification. The UK has reported to date 278 premises with SBV positive offspring: 224 in lambs and 57 in calves with 3 premises where affected lambs were first identified and then affected calves several weeks later. In addition, there have been 21 premises with acute disease identified in dairy cattle over the last 3 months, from North Yorkshire and Cheshire to Cornwall. Evidence of historical infection with the virus has been found throughout most of England, from Northumberland to Cornwall and also in Wales, in Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, and Powys.

2. Situation assessment
-----------------------
Defra funded serological surveillance across England and Wales in counties which had not reported evidence of SBV infection occurring in 2011. As a result of testing random samples from sheep and goats collected as part of another annual statutory survey, several counties were identified as having animals exposed to SBV, where previously no reports had been made about disease in offspring. The date of infection is not possible to ascertain, as this is a one-off test, based on antibodies which only develop after infection. In all cases, the last recorded official movement to these premises was noted as being from a county not previously known to have SBV infection, although the possibility of evidence of historical infection on that premises being acquired through movement onto farm cannot be discounted. The map [see at source URL above] shows where in Great Britain there is evidence of SBV infection, either through this serology survey, reports of acute infection in dairy cattle over the last 3 months, or where infection was identified in deformed offspring during 2012. Data are correct as of 26 Oct 2012. It is therefore reasonable to suppose infection is throughout England and Wales and the low level of reporting reflects the low impact of disease.

A study in Germany has looked at the distribution of the virus throughout the central nervous system in affected animals (lambs, kids, and calves which had tested positive by PCR) (ref 2). 10 out of 82 animals tested positive using the technique, predominantly in lesions in the brain. This relatively low number of positive reactions for the technique in comparison to the PCR may be a result of low levels of viral load because of the time between infection and birth. This is in keeping with the low number of confirmed cattle cases confirmed through testing deformed offspring.

Initial research as part of the joint EU -- Member State funded work on SBV vectors has been reported by Elbers et al. [see ref 3]. Pools of midges collected at various sites across Netherlands were identified by species where possible and tested for SBV. At the same time, the disease prevalence of the livestock at the collection sites was determined through serology. Seroconversion in the livestock was high (more than 96 percent on one site) and the most commonly infected midges were _Culicoides obsoletus_ complex and _C. pulicaris_, although other species may also be involved in transmission. Prevalence of SBV among the midges was between 0.25 and 0.56 percent which is similar to that seen for _C. brevitarsis_ infected with Akabane virus in Australia, but 10 times higher than that reported for the bluetongue virus. The high prevalence and high level of virus in the midges explains the rapid spread of SBV across Europe.

We have previously reported that deer have tested positive for antibodies to SBV. In another recent study on red and roe deer, foetuses and newborn deer were also necropsied (ref 4). There was no evidence of any neuropathological lesions associated with SBV infection in the foetuses although seroprevalence in adults was high: 43 percent in 225 samples taken in 2011; 0 percent in 299 samples collected in 2010. However, the authors point out that aborted foetuses, or deformed nonviable fawns could be scavenged quickly and therefore samples were not collected. The virus only causes deformities if infection occurs once the placentome has developed. As roe deer embryos are in diapause until January, infection of adults in September to December is unlikely to result in foetal abnormality. However red deer are mated in September and the placentome is functional in September therefore a (likely) low level of affected foetuses for red deer may be expected the following spring.

3. Conclusions
--------------
We continue to encourage farmers to be vigilant and inform their private vet of any clinical signs in the adults, such as milk drop, diarrhoea, fever, and inappetance. We are aware that vaccines are in development, although not yet licensed in the EU and suggest farmers discuss with their vets about the cost benefit of vaccinating against a disease which spreads so rapidly among a naive population and causes only a low impact.

It is clear that disease has circulated throughout the year across Europe and it is possible that regions, which did not experience SBV-infected deformities in offspring, may see a low level of deformities in offspring during the coming season. Farmers may therefore wish to discuss with their private vets what to expect and whether any action is worth taking, such as commercial testing of flocks or herds to check past exposure to the virus, and optimising the timing for mating within the herd or flock.

[The 2012 SBV vector season in Europe is approaching its end. During 2012, the virus continued its spread within and beyond its 2011 boundaries. One of the countries into which the virus spread during 2012, where intensive surveillance has been undertaken, is Switzerland. According to the recent report of the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office (FVO), a large part of the country's susceptible animals have, by now, undergone infection; consequently, there is no point in continuing the SBV serosurvey.
