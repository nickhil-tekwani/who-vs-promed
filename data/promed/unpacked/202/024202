The potentially devastating varroa mite, which could wipe out the Australian beekeeping industry, has been detected in Victoria.

A bee colony infested with the varroa mite was detected on [Wed 27 Jun 2018] at the Port of Melbourne on a ship from the United States.

A colony was found in a wooden crate and tests revealed some bees were infested with varroa mite, but the exact variety of the varroa mite is yet to be determined.

Australia is one of the last remaining countries in the world to be free of the blood-sucking varroa destructor, which has already devastated bee colonies in New Zealand, the United States, and Europe.

_Varroa destructor_ is the breed of mite that affects European honey bees, which agriculture industries around the world rely on for pollination.

However, north Queensland has had recent incursions of the less dangerous _Varroa jacobsoni_, which only infects Asian honey bees.

Agriculture Victoria chief health plant officer Nigel Ainsworth said the master of the ship reported seeing dead bees on the ship, which was immediately investigated by Agriculture Victoria and the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR) upon docking at the Port of Melbourne.

Mr Ainsworth said the colony had been destroyed and Agriculture Victoria was "confident" the situation was contained to the single colony.

He said 3 other wooden crates on the ship from Texas had also been secured.

"We haven't had final confirmation as it's a fairly specialised area to formally ID them, but unfortunately we're fairly sure that it's going to be _Varroa destructor_," Mr Ainsworth said.

"[That is] the bad varroa mite, given that it came from the US where that's the form of varroa that is prevalent."

Mr Ainsworth said cold weather conditions meant the bees were lethargic and "pretty unlikely" to have flown beyond the ship.

Laboratory tests of the established sentinel hives at the port returned negative readings for varroa.

As a precaution, more sentinel hives have been installed and floral sweep netting has been undertaken within the port precinct and the adjacent parkland.

Biosecurity officers are also inspecting gardens within a 2-kilometre [1.24 miles approx.] radius of the port.

"[This is] an example of how the system should work."

Australian Honey Bee Industry Council chairman Lindsay Bourke said the industry was "very concerned" about the detection.

"We are on the lookout for this all the time," Mr Bourke said.

"The only thing in our advantage is that it arrived in Victoria, because Victorians are the most proactive in this department."

Mr Bourke said it was likely the variety was varroa destructor, which is considered more serious than _Varroa jacobsoni_.

He said _Varroa destructor_ had been detected in Australia on "a number of occasions".

Mr Bourke said New Zealand, which carries _Varroa destructor_, typically posed the biggest threat to Australia.

It has been reported that hived bees in the United States dropped by about 30 per cent when it was found there, and native bee populations in New Zealand dropped by 90 per cent when it hit NZ.

Last year [2017] it was reported bees in the United States and Europe were starting to evolve through natural selection to survive the mite decimating their populations.

At the time, Professor Stephen Martin, chair of animal ecology at Salford University in the United Kingdom, said in some instances bees were living with varroa mites and an associated virus, without any other treatment.

Professor Martin said although the process of evolution was slow, it gave the industry hope and sparked an interest in better beekeeping methods, with people entering the industry to try to save the bees.

He said while the varroa mite sucked the blood of the bee, it was the transmission of a virus into the bee that really caused the damage.

"In areas where there is no virus, the bees and the mites can live together, but this is extremely rare," he said.

"The mite is simply the vector for the virus to get into the bee.

"In Europe and America almost every single bee has got the virus."

[There are 2 species of _Varroa_ mites. These species were once listed as one. The more damaging _Varroa destructor_ was previously included under the name _V. jacobsoni_, until DNA sequencing revealed a difference in the mites. Based on DNA sequencing, and close observation _Varroa jacobsoni_ is the species of mite which parasitises _Apis cerana_ (Asian honey bees).

Australia has either just completed an exercise dealing with this mite or is still in the exercise. So based upon the exercise to heighten awareness and methods of dealing with this tiny invader, they should be well prepared for the situation and likely did not expect to put their practice into action so rapidly.

Varroa is a reportable disease according to OIE. Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals Chapter Part 2, Section 2.9, Chapter 2.9.5.

This mite can be very destructive to naive colonies of bees.

An excerpt from that chapter includes:
"The mite _Varroa destructor_ (formerly _Varroa jacobsoni_) is a parasite of adult bees and their brood. It penetrates the intersegmental skin between the abdominal sclera of adult bees to ingest haemolymph. It can sometimes be found between the head and thorax. The number of parasites steadily increases with increasing brood activity and the growth of the bee population, especially late in the season when clinical signs of infestation can first be recognised. The life span of the mite depends on temperature and humidity but, in practice, it can be said to last from some days to a few months.

Identification of the agent: The clinical signs of varroosis can only be recognised at a late stage of infestation, so that diagnosis entails the examination of the hive debris. The debris produced during the summer is especially useful for diagnosis. The earliest and most precise diagnosis can be made only after the application of a medication that forces the mites to drop off the bees or kills them directly. Larger amounts of debris can be examined using a flotation procedure. Bees are washed in petroleum spirit, alcohol or detergent solution. However, this method is less accurate due to the unequal distribution of mites and the usually small sample sizes.

In heavily infested bee colonies, clinical signs of varroosis can often first be seen in the latter part of the season when the brood is reduced. Heavy infestations are usually reached 3-4 years after the primary invasion, but can occur within weeks if infested by bees from nearby colonies that are collapsing.

Essentially, the brood is damaged by the parasitic mites. Bees and their offspring that have been infected during the brood phase by only one parasitic mite show various ill effects, such as a shortened life span, changes in behaviour and an increased disease susceptibility. The parasitism is critical if more than one mite enters the brood cell for reproduction. Only in the lethal stage immediately before the collapse of the colonies do clinical signs, such as shrunken wings and shortened abdomen, appear. This is due to an increased susceptibility to deformed wing and acute paralysis virus, as well as to the infection of wounds and loss of haemolymph. If the brood dies shortly before or after sealing, clinical signs of European foulbrood appear without the presence of the specific agent _Melissococcus pluton_. If the brood survives, the emerging bees show various behavioural changes and their life span is considerably shortened."

Although there are many tests to verify the presence of the mite, there appears to be little in the way of treatment for the colonies. There are some products providing limited success. From the OIE chapter cited above:

"There are no biological products and vaccines available. Formic acid, oxalic acid, lactic acid and thymol can be used to control Varroa mites (http://www.apis.admin.ch/english/Themes/Varroa.htm). Some hygienic strains are less susceptible to Varroa parasites."
