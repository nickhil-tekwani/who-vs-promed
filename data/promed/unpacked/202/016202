Farmers are being urged to keep equipment clean after the unfortunate news that soybean cyst nematodes (SCN) have been confirmed [in Manitoba]. The nematode, which can spread through water, has been present in North Dakota [USA, neighbouring Manitoba] for years and has been expected to spread north through the Red River. This year [2019] is the first that researchers noted both symptoms and molecular confirmation of SCN.

Mario Tenuta, University of Manitoba, said the pest has likely been in the soil for "a few years" quietly multiplying. "Every time soybean is grown, it will increase its numbers." Tenuta's team has been on the watch since 2012.

Fourâ€‚municipalities have come down with visual symptoms, one field in each has tested positive. A total 106 fields in 18 municipalities were tested. With [one] exception, the nematode has cropped up alongside waterways, exactly where expected. "Given the large gap between positive identifications, there is a possibility that SCN may be present in fields not included in the survey, or may have established since sampling," Manitoba Pulse and Soybean Growers said.

Tenuta hopes to see monitoring expand. Some areas newer to soybeans than the Red River Valley are now approaching enough history with the crop for SCN loads to grow.

[Soybean cyst nematode (SCN; _Heterodera glycines_) is considered one of the most destructive pests of the crop, with potential yield losses of more than 30 percent. Symptoms are distributed unevenly in affected fields and may include yellowing and stunting of plants as well as reduced nodulation of roots leading to loss of plant vigour. Symptom severity depends on nematode numbers and environmental conditions. SCN has also been reported to contribute to disease complexes such as sudden death syndrome and top dieback.

Cyst nematodes can often persist in the soil for many years and are spread by plant material, soil, water and mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an area, eradication is extremely difficult. Disease management is generally aimed at keeping nematode levels below economic thresholds. An integrated approach is required, including phytosanitation (exclusion), cultural measures (such as long crop rotation with non-host species), nematicides and use of resistant crop varieties.

Pathogen strains with resistance to agrochemicals, increased host range or an ability to overcome resistance of crop varieties are emerging frequently worldwide (for example, ProMED-mail post 20170120.4778606). Ongoing crop breeding programmes are required to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

In Canada, SCN has been reported from Ontario since the late 1980s (see links below).

Other species in the genus can affect crops like maize (_H. zeae_), cereals (_H. avenae_) and sugar beet (_H. schachtii_).
