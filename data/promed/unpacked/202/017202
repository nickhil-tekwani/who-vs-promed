[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a serious disease of horses worldwide
and particularly in North America and parts of Europe. Characterized by
anemia, its symptoms vary a great deal, but are generally summarized as
having 3 phases: acute, chronic, or inapparent. Horses in the latter group
act as a long term reservoirs.
The USDA-APHIS (United States Department of Agriculture - Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service) website
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/eia/downloads/fs_eia.pdf>
introduces the disease as follows: Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is an
infectious and potentially fatal viral disease of members of the horse
family. The equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is categorized as a
lentivirus: it contains genetic RNA material, which it uses to produce DNA.
This DNA is then incorporated into the genetic makeup of infected cells.
Identified in France in 1843, and first tentatively diagnosed in the United
States in 1888, EIA has commanded a great deal of attention over the years.
No vaccine or treatment exists for the disease. It is often difficult to
differentiate from other fever-producing diseases, including anthrax,
influenza, and equine encephalitis.
For further info, see the full EIA fact sheet.
One point of note is that the proper name for the widely used EIA agar-gel
immunodiffusion test is the "Coggins test". Yes, there is an "s" at the end
of Leroy's name. It is neither "Coggin test", nor "Coggin's test" (as if
the name employs a possessive), nor "test de Coggin" as used in this OIE
report. I can attest to the correctness of the statement above, because
Leroy Coggins, the developer of the test, was the 1st person to award me a
faculty position. It has been the "gold standard" test since its inception
in 1970, and over a million horses a year undergo testing with it. - Mod.PC
