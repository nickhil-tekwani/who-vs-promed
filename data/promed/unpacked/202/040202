Sri Racha Tiger Zoo: 60 more may be culled. Emergency anti-viral
treatment is last hope for cats suffering from bird flu
-------------------------------------------------------
The 60 tigers at Sri Racha Tiger Zoo that are currently being treated
for bird flu will be culled, unless they can be cured, local
officials said yesterday [28 Oct 2004].
Chon Buri Governor Pisit Ketphasuk told a press conference at the
Provincial Hall yesterday [28 Oct 2004] that the tigers were being
given medicine designed to specifically treat avian influenza. The
tigers will be put down if they cannot be cured with the treatment,
said Werawit Wiwattanawa-nit, the province's deputy governor.
Medical check-ups on 500 zoo employees found no bird-flu infections,
Pisit said. The situation at the zoo is returning to normal, he
added, and it would be reopened 3 weeks after the end of tiger deaths
there. At least 83 tigers at the zoo have either died or been culled
after becoming infected with the deadly virus. The tigers were found
to have been fed chicken carcasses infected with avian influenza.
Meanwhile, the government will put into writing its updated bird-flu
warning about "contact with chickens" in order to include living in
risky environments, in addition to close contact with the birds. At
Government House yesterday [28 Oct 2004], Deputy Prime Minister
Chaturon Chaisang said the Public Health Ministry had been ordered to
publish leaflets that contain the new information.
On Wednesday [27 Oct 2004], Chaturon warned that, contrary to earlier
belief, people could contract bird flu indirectly as well as through
direct contact with carriers. He said yesterday [28 Oct 2004] that
the leaflet would warn the public about the dangers of playing with
their pets after they had been in contact with dead carcasses of
infected fowl or other birds.
