Hippos eat zebra and croc feeding frenzy
----------------------------------------
"Truly one of the most incredible sightings I have ever had on safari! A huge crocodile killed a zebra during a crossing of the Mara River during the Great Migration, and promptly had it stolen by 2 young hippos! Hippos are herbivores, but have been known to eat small amounts of meat from time to time. I am not sure exactly how much meat the hippos actually consumed, but they certainly gave the zebra a good working over. They managed to keep the zebra away from the hungry crocs for a good 45 mins."

[If any of you had doubted the veracity of the previous communication on carnivorous hippopotami, here you have visual supporting evidence. Hippos are a notorious risk to people in kayaks in Africa. And if they will feed on zebra at a river crossing they will feed on a zebra carcass found while they are grazing away from any water. - Mod.MHJ]
