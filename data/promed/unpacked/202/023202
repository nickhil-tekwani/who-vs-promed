Up to 1300 hepatitis patients are under treatment at the Pakistan
Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), a senior health official
disclosed on Mon 5 Mar 2007. Dr. Sharif Ahmad Khan, the National
Programme Manager for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis, told the
Daily Times that 13 000 people had been diagnosed with hepatitis in
the country, and that 1300 of them were being treated at the PIMS. He
said the unnecessary and frequent use of syringes and contaminated
water were the main causes for the spread of the disease. "People
should pay attention to the fact that prevention is better than
treatment", he said.
Carelessness and unawareness among citizens were the other reasons
for the high number of hepatitis cases. "Impure water is still being
used all over the country and must be avoided," he warned. Though the
government is installing water filtration plants, yet more needs to
be done. Water pipelines passing along drains often lead to
contamination while un-sterilised shaving kits and medical
instruments are other sources of hepatitis.
Dr. Sharif said the percentage of hepatitis B in the country was
about 3 to 4 percent while those infected with hepatitis C reached 5
to 6 percent. "There are 5 types of hepatitis: A, B, C, D, and E."
"Hepatitis A and E occur due to consumption of unhygienic food or
contaminated water," he said while pointing out that these types
could be cured through vaccination. [A hepatitis E vaccine is not
generally available. - Mod.CP] "A occurs during childhood, whereas E
affects adults." On the other hand, B, C, and D hepatitis are caused
by infected blood, Dr. Sharif said. "The B and C types are dangerous,
cannot be treated through vaccinations, and only immunity can counter
these viruses. [In fact there is a cheap and available hepatitis B
virus vaccine for prevention of hepatitis B virus infection although
not appropriate for treatment. - Mod.CP] "These [bloodborne]
hepatitis viruses [survive] for 7 to 8 days if medical instruments
are not properly sterilised," he said and added that the virus could
not be removed completely.
Meanwhile, the government plans to establish 150 screening,
diagnosis, and counselling centres throughout the country for
treatment of the disease. Dr. Sharif said hepatitis B vaccine had
been supplied to the provincial health departments for health
workers, prison inmates, and dialysis patients.
He said national guidelines on various technical aspects were in
process. These aspects included the sterilisation of instruments used
in surgical, medical, and dental interventions, hospital and
biological waste management, and national community-based guidelines
for safe drinking water and sanitation. The guidelines also cover
advocacy materials for barbers, beauty parlours, and dentists [see

case-management and counselling.
