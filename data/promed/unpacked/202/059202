In Moscow, 40 children have been hospitalized with various forms of meningitis, and for 7 of them, a diagnosis of "serous meningitis" has been confirmed. In early June 2013, due to an outbreak of meningitis, more than 100 children in Rostov-on-Don were admitted to the hospital.

During a press conference, Professor of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology of MSMSU [Moscow State Medico-Stomatological University] Yuri Vengerov spoke about the disease, its symptoms and methods of treatment. He said that "meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, which is caused by many different organisms. And very much depends both on the pathogen and on the form of meningitis. In particular, enteroviral meningitis -- caused by an enterovirus or [other] intestinal viruses -- is included in the number of benign meningitis cases, which rarely provide any complications or adverse effects.

The name enterovirus, or intestinal virus, suggests that it is an intestinal infection, but the virus is capable of getting from the digestive tract through the bloodstream into the brain causing inflammation, i.e. meningitis. As with other intestinal infections, the spread of enteroviral meningitis occurs in the summer, and the incidence is related to the consumption of untreated water, not washing fruits, and bathing in polluted water. Meningitis may also be transmitted via droplets, i.e. close contact. Patients may be [infected] in this way and can infect each other.

The basis for the diagnosis of meningitis is fever followed by severe headache of unusual intensity. It is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. These symptoms, fever and headache with vomiting, are an indication for emergency hospitalization. Severe forms, which can be fatal, are very rare in the case of enteroviral meningitis.

Panic associated with an outbreak in Rostov ensued following diagnosis of a single case of pneumococcal meningitis. This is a severe form of meningitis which often leads to death. This was not divulged [by authorities] and was perceived to be part of the same epidemic. In fact, these are completely different diseases.

Most enteroviral meningitis cases used to be in the Far East. There, the Amur river [the longest river in the world] and its tributaries arising in China carry untreated waste water contaminated by enteroviruses downstream. Every summer, there are up to several hundred cases. Now, it has spread to the Ural Mountains and along the coast of the Black Sea.

[In Russian language reports, the term meningitis usually implies aseptic (serous) meningitis. During the past few weeks, there have been numerous reports of outbreaks of meningitis throughout Russia reported in ProMED-RUS and elsewhere. These are almost invariably outbreaks of serous meningitis and not the more dangerous meningoencephalitis. Outbreaks of serous meningitis occur habitually in the summer months.

The word "meningitis" means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. These tissues can be damaged by bacteria, viruses, fungi, cancers, and even some anti-inflammatory medications. Meningitis caused by bacteria is called septic meningitis. This is a medical emergency and calls for immediate treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Fortunately, this type of meningitis is less common than aseptic meningitis. Most of the time, aseptic meningitis is not life threatening. If the brain tissues also become inflamed (encephalitis), the situation is more serious. The classic findings of meningitis are fever, a stiff neck, and headache. Other signs include nausea, vomiting and worsening of headache and photophobia. Children who are old enough to talk may complain of headache or nausea.

The most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection. In fact, sometimes the terms aseptic meningitis and viral meningitis are used interchangeably, although in actuality, other things like an allergic reaction can also cause aseptic meningitis. The viruses that usually cause meningitis in children include the enteroviruses. Enteroviruses cause about 90 percent of all viral meningitis cases. This family of viruses usually causes a rash, nausea, vomiting, and some respiratory symptoms as well as muscle aches (myalgias). The most common symptoms, however, are just irritability, fever, and rash. - Mod.CP
