The state's Department of Public Health has confirmed a 3rd human case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), this one from northern Franklin County. The latest victim is a man older than 60. Since 2011, Massachusetts had not seen a human case of EEE until this summer, when 3 people so far have contracted the virus.

The risk level in the towns of Heath and Colrain in Franklin County has been raised to critical. A horse in Mendon and a horse in Uxbridge, both towns in Worcester County, have also tested positive for the EEE virus. The risk in those towns has also been raised to critical. The threat caused Mendon to cancel Saturday night's "Mendonfest" because it's scheduled during peak biting hours.

"2019 is really turning out to be not just an active year, but a very active year," said state epidemiologist Dr Catherine Brown. She said several factors are contributing, including changing temperatures and precipitation, along with the shifting types of mosquito species. "Because we're seeing an increase in the populations of the mammal-biting mosquitoes, we think that might be one of the reasons that the cycle is changing a little bit as well," Dr Brown said.

Earlier this week, DPH and the Department of Agricultural Resources said aerial spraying in specific areas of Worcester and Middlesex counties is scheduled to begin on Sun 25 Aug [2019]. As a result of the elevated risk in several communities, the spray zone has been expanded. The additional communities [located] either partially or fully in the spray zone are Blackstone, Douglas, Dudley, Holliston, Hopedale, Mendon, Millville, Oxford, Uxbridge, and Webster.

Across Massachusetts, a total of 23 communities are now at critical risk, 22 at high risk, and 52 at moderate risk for the EEE virus. So far, EEE has been found in 330 mosquito samples this year [2019], many of them from species that can spread the virus to humans.

EEE symptoms can range from a stiff neck, headache, and lack of energy to dangerous complications like inflammation and swelling of the brain. The risk of EEE will remain until the 1st killing frost.

[This summer, EEE virus transmission season has been a active one, now with 3 human cases. Prior to these 3 human cases this year (2019), all of the EEE cases posted on ProMED-mail have been in horses. These 3 cases remind us that human cases occur as well. As the report above indicates, the risk of human and equine cases will continue for about another 6 weeks until the 1st killing frosts of 28 deg F (-2 deg C) end mosquito activity. The USA National Weather Service indicates that, on average, the 1st killing frost occurs in late October in northern Massachusetts.

There is a vaccine available for equine animals, and their owners are wise to have them vaccinated. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the best preventive measure.
