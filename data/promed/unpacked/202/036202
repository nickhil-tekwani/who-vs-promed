DENVER - State officials here fear that some elk infected with a fatal
illness, Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), were sold to private ranches
in as many as 15 states and could spread the disease to the wild elk
and deer throughout the nation.
The state has confirmed 6 cases of chronic wasting disease, the elk
and deer equivalent of mad cow disease. So far 5 cases have been
traced to one ranch in northeastern Colorado, where the elk were
raised, sold, and transported for breeding. State officials also said
that over the last 5 years there appeared to have been 245 sales of
infected elk to ranches in states as far east as Pennsylvania.
"We're trying to figure out the extent of the exposure," said Wayne
Cunningham, state veterinarian with the Colorado Department of
Agriculture.The state has quarantined 1300 elk. On Friday, 9 were
killed to be tested. There is no live test. "This is a very, very
important native species, and that's why we're so concerned," said
Todd Malmsbury, spokesman for the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
CWD is similar to mad cow disease in beef cattle and variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in people. It is not known if CWD
disease can be transmitted to people who eat deer or elk meat or come
in contact with animal fluids. Nor is it known how animals become
infected, though it is believed that soil can be contaminated by the
remains of an infected animal for decades.
The creatures draw spectators and hunters to the state, [contributing
about $1 billion to the economy. There are more than 250 000 wild elk
and 550 000 deer in Colorado. Elk are raised on private ranches for
breeding, private hunting, meat, and velvet antlers, which can be used
for human nutritional supplements or medicines. There are about 14 000
captive elk in Colorado.
The federal Department of Agriculture has set aside more than $2
million to reimburse elk ranchers who lose their herds. Craig
McConnell owns the Elk Echo and All American Antler Ranches near
Stoneham, Colo., where he has 650 elk, all of which will be killed. At
this point, elk from his ranches appear to be the origination point of
the outbreak.

COMMISSION ADOPTS MORE EMERGENCY CWD REGULATIONS
----------------------------
The Colorado Wildlife Commission approved 2 emergency regulations on
18 Oct 2001 designed to reduce the risk of chronic wasting disease
(CWD) spreading to wild deer and elk herds outside the endemic area of
northeastern Colorado.
The first prohibits the movement of live deer and elk inside Colorado
except for scientific or wildlife management purposes and only if
specifically approved by the Division of Wildlife director.
The second requires deer and elk in captive facilities may not be
imported to Colorado from other states unless the animals have been
certified to be free of disease for at least 36 months through a
documented surveillance program. The Commission had adopted a similar
emergency ordinance in September requiring at least an 18-month
surveillance program.
Both ordinances become effective immediately and will remain in effect
for 90 days. They may be considered for permanent adoption by the
Wildlife Commission at a later date.
The emergency ordinances were adopted because of concerns raised by
the movement of elk infected with chronic wasting disease from a
captive facility in northeastern Colorado to game ranches near Del
Norte in the San Luis Valley and near Cowdry in North Park. Elk with
CWD have been found at both of these game ranches. Exposed elk from
the northeastern Colorado facility were shipped to more than 40
Colorado game ranches and game ranches in 15 other states. Testing is
underway to determine whether other elk have CWD.
The Colorado Department of Agriculture, which has regulatory authority
over some Colorado game ranches and alternative livestock facilities,
has already begun work to remove, destroy, and test elk exposed to CWD
at those ranches. The state Agriculture Commission has also adopted
regulations limiting the movement of captive wildlife.
The disease has been found in wild deer and elk for more than 3
decades in northeastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming and may have
existed in the wild for many years prior to its identification by
wildlife researchers in the 1960s. In the extreme northwest corner of
the Nebraska panhandle 2 deer with CWD were recently found.
