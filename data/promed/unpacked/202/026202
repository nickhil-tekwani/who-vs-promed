Six people in Minnesota have contracted salmonellosis after consuming the same brand of frozen chicken Kiev, prompting a consumer alert from the state Department of Health. While the department isn't ordering a recall of the tainted products, Antioch Farms brand "A La Kiev" raw stuffed chicken breast, it is urging people to either discard them or make sure they are cooked to a temperature of at least 165 deg F [74 deg C].

The salmonellosis risk was much commoner until 2008, when packaging was improved to clarify that these contained raw meat, the Health Department said on Thu 23 Oct 2014, "The problem arises when consumers don't realize that they are handling and preparing a raw product," said Dr Carrie Rigdon, an investigator for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Dairy and Food Inspection Division.

One of the 6 patients required hospital care for the illness.

State disease investigators isolated the source of contamination in part because all 6 cases involved infections with the same strain, _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis. The infections all occurred in August and September 2014. The products involved have a US Department of Agriculture stamped code of P-1358.

Six similar outbreaks involving the frozen, breaded chicken products occurred between 1998 and 2008, prompting new labeling to make clear that they contained chicken that was raw. This is the 1st such outbreak since then.

Minnesota typically sees about 700 cases of salmonellosis each year. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, and fever, and begin within 12 to 72 hours of consumption of tainted food.

[Some frozen chicken entrees contain uncooked chicken. In 2006, investigators from the Minnesota state health and agriculture departments said 29 people become ill after eating frozen chicken entrees that were not cooked long enough to kill the salmonella bacterium. They recommended against microwaving single-serving chicken products -- even when it's listed as an option on labels. As noted, the products should be baked in the oven to an internal temperature of 165 deg F (74 deg C). - Mod.LL
