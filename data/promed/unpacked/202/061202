An outbreak of measles has struck up to 21 children across South
Yorkshire. The Health Protection Agency said 5 cases had been
officially confirmed, and another 16 children were showing "extremely
convincing" symptoms. All those affected are children aged between
just 3 months and 12 years who have not had the MMR inoculation.
Eleven of the cases are in Sheffield, the 1st outbreak of the disease
in the city for 5 years. The others are in Barnsley and Rotherham.
Letters have been sent to family doctors to alert them to the outbreak.
Dr Rosy McNaught, from the South Yorkshire Health Protection Agency,
urged parents to let their children have the measles, mumps and
rubella (MMMR Triple) vaccine. She said: "It is the only way to
prevent measles. Measles is the most infectious childhood disease.
"It cherry-picks the children who have not been immunised. These
children who have been getting measles have been horribly ill with
it. It's only when your child gets measles that you can understand
what a horrible illness it is."
Dr McNaught said she expected more cases to come to light over the
next few days, as several of the children seemed to have contracted
measles during the last week of the school term. She said children
with weakened immune systems, such as those with cancer or leukemia,
could die if they come into contact with the disease.
The MMR vaccine was introduced in the UK in 1988, and by 1992, more
than 90 percent of children were being immunised. Children are given
a 1st dose at 12 to 15 months and a 2nd, booster dose, at between 3-5
years old. Take-up of the vaccine has dropped in recent years because
of research claims it may be linked to autism. But the research, 1st
published in 1998, has since been widely discredited.

Britain exported 3 cases of measles to the United States last year
[2006], more than most other countries, including Kenya, Ethiopia and
Uganda, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Experts say Britain may even be spreading the disease to poor nations
in Africa, which are far less equipped to deal with the disease.
"It's tragic that there is still measles in the U.K.," said Dr.
Samuel Katz, co-inventor of the measles vaccine and an infectious
diseases specialist at Duke University. "It's just ridiculous. We
should not tolerate this, but for some reason we do."
While measles deaths have fallen by 60 percent worldwide in recent
years, the virus remains a stubborn problem in rich countries like
Japan, Switzerland and Britain. In Britain, vaccination rates have
dropped significantly since 1998, largely because of rumors of the
vaccine's link to autism, which all credible medical evidence has rejected.
Measles is one of the most infectious diseases that exists. Unless
nearly 95 percent of a population is vaccinated, the disease easily
leaks across borders." As long as measles transmission is occurring
anywhere, all countries are potentially at risk," said Dr. Melinda
Wharton, deputy director of the CDC's national center for
immunization and respiratory diseases. In the United States, where
vaccination rates hover around 90 percent, all measles outbreaks are
traceable to imported cases. Last year [2006], there were 55
confirmed cases in 16 states. In Britain, where only about 80 percent
of children are vaccinated, there were 736 cases last year in a
nation with 20 percent of the U.S. population, though health
authorities said this number was "provisional" and might be revised downward.
For Africa and Asia, which have the biggest measles problem, rich
countries' inability to stamp out the disease may heighten their
exposure to the virus. "If you've got an industrialized country that
fails to control measles, that rich country could re-infect a poor
country that has made substantial efforts to eliminate the disease,"
said Dr. Peter Strebel, a measles expert at the World Health
Organization. "It is entirely possible for the U.K. to export a
measles case to Nairobi, which might then spark an outbreak in
Africa," Strebel said.
In Japan, a measles outbreak earlier this year [2007] that caused
more than 1000 cases led to the closure of at least 100 schools and
universities in June 2007. As of mid-July 2007, Switzerland reported
483 cases across the country. Of those, 30 percent of the cases were
in patients older than 16, including teenagers whose parents did not
want them vaccinated. Experts believe parents may be underestimating
the impact of measles. "People may think that because their children
aren't malnourished or malaria-infected, that they don't need to get
excited about measles," Katz said.
Last April [2006], for the 1st time in more than a decade, a
13-year-old boy died in Britain of measles. And an outbreak in the
Netherlands several years ago caused 3292 cases. Of those
hospitalized, 40 percent needed to be put on a ventilator, and 3
people died. In developed countries, the case fatality rate for
measles is usually about one percent.
In Africa, measles, whose symptoms include high fever and rash, can
be so serious that it has even been confused with the deadly Ebola
virus. In malnourished people suffering from other diseases, the
mortality rate can be as high as 30 percent.
While Western countries are in a better position to treat the
disease, the complications from measles can be significant: about 20
percent of patients suffer complications such as ear infections that
can lead to permanent hearing loss; about one in every 1000 results
in encephalitis. Ironically, when parents begin refusing to have
their children vaccinated, it is often evidence that the vaccination
program has worked. "Once the natural disease goes down to very low
levels, what parents see is not the disease, but the occasional
adverse event," Strebel said.
The measles vaccine can cause side effects including a fever or rash,
and, very rarely, encephalitis. While deciding to forgo a vaccine may
appear to be a personal decision, doctors warn that it can ultimately
have international consequences. "If nobody ever traveled, it would
not be a problem," said Dr. Joanne Langley, a pediatric infectious
diseases expert at Canada's Dalhousie University. But in today's
interconnected community, an infectious disease in one country can
quickly skip across the globe within hours. "When parents vaccinate
their child, it is not only their child they're protecting," Langley
said. "There are children all over the world that will benefit."
