7 more cases of E. coli poisoning reported
------------------------------------------
7 new cases of _Escherichia coli_ O157 poisoning have been reported in
Calgary, raising the count, since 16 Sep 2004, to 29. Most of the victims
are in their teens or 20s. One was admitted to hospital briefly last
weekend [14 to 15 Sep] for observation.

Dr Judy MacDonald, of the Calgary Health Region, says that at least 17 of
the victims had eaten a similar type of food from a number of food
establishments. She says that that fact raises a possibility that the
infection originated from the same supplier.
