[This report does not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations]

Madagascar has acknowledged the presence of the debilitating
mosquito-borne chikungunya virus, which has affected some 180 000
people on the neighbouring Indian Ocean island of Reunion.

Minister of Health Jean Louis Robinson announced on Saturday [4 Mar
2006] that Madagascar was facing both an epidemic of dengue fever --
a flu-like illness -- and "very sporadic" cases of chikungunya, which
has been linked to 93 deaths on Reunion.

Dr Lamina Arthur, director of disease control at the World Health
Organization (WHO) in Madagascar, told IRIN "the simultaneous
existence of dengue and chikungunya make it very difficult to provide
exact figures on [the prevalence of] each, as they exhibit nearly
identical symptoms and are spread by the same mosquito [_Aedes
aegypti_]."

Since 2005, chikungunya fever has spread among Indian Ocean islands,
beginning in Comoros and affecting Reunion, Mauritius and the
Seychelles. Chikungunya ('that which bends up' in Kiswahili) is
believed to have originated in Tanzania.

In early February [2006], media reports suggested that increased
cases of "unexplained fever" in Madagascar's coastal regions were
evidence of the chikungunya virus having arrived [see ProMED-mail
posting Chikungunya - Madagascar: susp., RFI 20060202.0340 - Mod.MPP]
.

A Ministry of Health team visited Toamasina, the worst affected town
on the east coast, where stocks of fever and pain medication had been
exhausted, to investigate.

The 1st samples sent for testing to the Pasteur Institute in France,
came back negative for chikungunya. However, a 2nd batch detected a
limited presence of the virus.

According to WHO, the main preventative measure is to stop
proliferation of mosquitoes by reducing their breeding grounds. Both
Mauritius and the Seychelles have instituted public awareness
campaigns and extensive cleanup operations.

[ProMED-mail did report on the earlier suspected cases of chikungunya
in Madagascar (see Chikungunya - Madagascar: susp., RFI
20060202.0340). The reports of the simultaneous infections with
chikungunya virus and dengue virus are intriguing (see prior
ProMED-mail posting Dengue/DHF update 2006 (09) 20060304.0701 where
co-infection was identified in 15 individuals in Reunion), and one
wonders if the reports of 93 deaths associated with the chikungunya
outbreak may be related to co-infections with dengue virus, where
either the dengue virus infection is responsible for the death or the
co-infection may potentiate more serious symptomatology. At present
we do not have clear information from knowledgeable sources about the
deaths, to have a better understanding of the underlying pathology
that may be predisposing a lethal outcome in cases where chikungunya
virus has been identified. ProMED-mail did post a single case report
submitted by a physician on the 1st reported death attributed to
chikungunya virus infection (see Chikungunya - Mauritius and Reunion
Island (08): Reunion 20060205.0378) in which only chikungunya virus
was identified, and the clinical course was described as a rapid
progression from fever and generalized body pains, treated by
paracetamol (acetaminophen), to obtundation (coma), and death. Had
there been a history of treatment with aspirin or other products
containing salicylate, one might have postulated Reye's Syndrome as a
possible etiology of the lethal outcome from the infection.
More information from knowledgeable sources on the newswire reports
of 93 deaths associated with chikungunya infection, co-infection with
dengue virus, and information on chikungunya activity in Madagascar
would be very much appreciated by ProMED-mail and its subscribers. -
