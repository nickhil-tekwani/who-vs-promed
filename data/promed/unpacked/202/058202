The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning hunters that deer with tuberculosis can transmit the bacteria to humans.

The report stems from a case in Michigan in 2017 where a 77-year-old man who had no exposure to people or countries with endemic tuberculosis was diagnosed with the disease. According to the CDC, the man was a regular hunter and had dressed deer in the state for 20 years. Following lab tests, the man was found to have been exposed to _Mycobacterium bovis_, a bacterium found in deer, cattle, bison, and elk which can be spread to humans and cause TB.

Two other cases in the state had also been linked to deer, leading doctors to believe the bacteria was inhaled during the removal of diseased portions of the deer when field-dressing carcasses.

The CDC is advising hunters to wear protective equipment while field-dressing deer as a result of the findings. Hunters in Michigan who submit deer heads which test positive for the bacterium could be at higher risk according to the agency.

FOX 17 News spoke with TWRA [Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency] Wildlife Veterinarian Dan Grove who says there has not been a confirmed case of TB in deer in the state but overall, the basic safety advice issued by the CDC is sound. "The advice is sound in general" Grove says. "If it looks like there is an abscess in a piece of meat then you want to avoid it. You always want to be cautious handling meat until you cook it and take basic precautions like wearing gloves. Sometimes everything looks good but you might get into dressing the animal and see something."

Grove says _M. bovis_, the bacterium in the Michigan cases usually is associated with cattle and spills over to other populations. "When cattle from other states are transported across state lines, a TB test is administered" Grove says. Michigan and Minnesota are the only states where TB in wildlife populations has been reported.

[Bovine tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ has one of the widest host ranges of all the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (MTC) and can readily spill over into a variety of domestic and wild mammals, including humans (it has been reported in 15 host species). Due to this, various species have a role in the maintenance of _M. bovis_ in wildlife communities, and thus can be a source of infection for domestic animals and humans. Systematic surveillance of wild elk and white-tailed deer begun in 1997 has since found 41/4542 (0.9%) elk and 11/7368 (0.1%) white-tailed deer bTB-positive by mycobacterial culture (USDA 2015). Bovine TB in people in contact with elk was reported in Canada in 1991 (Lancet 338: 1253-1255). - Mod.PMB

The following is extracted from the CDC article [1] referenced in the news report above. The full article, including references and figure, can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6837a3.htm?s_cid=mm6837a3_w.

"In May 2017, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services was notified of a case of pulmonary tuberculosis caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_ in a man aged 77 years. The patient had rheumatoid arthritis and was taking 5 mg prednisone daily; he had no history of travel to countries with endemic tuberculosis, no known exposure to persons with tuberculosis, and no history of consumption of unpasteurized milk. He resided in the northeastern Lower Peninsula of Michigan, which has a low incidence of human tuberculosis but does have an enzootic focus of _M. bovis_ in free-ranging deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_). The area includes a 4-county region where the majority of _M. bovis_-positive deer in Michigan have been found (1). Statewide surveillance for _M. bovis_ via hunter-harvested deer head submission has been ongoing since 1995 (1); in 2017, 1.4% of deer tested from this 4-county region were culture-positive for _M. bovis_, compared with 0.05% of deer tested elsewhere in Michigan (2). The patient had regularly hunted and field-dressed deer in the area during the past 20 years. 2 earlier hunting-related human infections with _M. bovis_ were reported in Michigan in 2002 and 2004. In each case, the patients had signs and symptoms of active disease and required medical treatment.

"Whole-genome sequencing of the patient's respiratory isolate was performed at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa. The isolate was compared against an extensive _M. bovis_ library, including approximately 900 wildlife and cattle isolates obtained since 1993 and human isolates from the state health department. This 2017 isolate had accumulated one single nucleotide polymorphism compared with a 2007 deer isolate (Figure), suggesting that the patient was exposed to a circulating strain of _M. bovis_ at some point through his hunting activities and had reactivation of infection as pulmonary disease in 2017.

"Whole-genome sequencing also was performed on archived specimens from 2 hunting-related human _M. bovis_ infections diagnosed in 2002 (pulmonary) and 2004 (cutaneous) that were epidemiologically and genotypically linked to deer (3). The 2002 human isolate had accumulated one single nucleotide polymorphism since sharing an ancestral genotype isolated from several deer in Alpena County, Michigan, as early as 1997; the 2004 human isolate shared an identical genotype with a grossly lesioned deer harvested by the patient in Alcona County, Michigan, confirming that his infection resulted from a finger injury sustained during field-dressing. The 2002 and 2017 cases of pulmonary disease might have occurred following those patients' inhalation of aerosols during removal of diseased viscera while field-dressing deer carcasses (4).

"In Michigan, deer serve as maintenance and reservoir hosts for _M. bovis_, and transmission to other species has been documented (1). Since 1998, 73 infected cattle herds have been identified in Michigan (5), resulting in increased testing and restricted movement of cattle outside the four-county zone. Transmission to humans also occurs, as demonstrated by the three cases described in this report; however, the risk for transmission is understudied. Similar to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, exposure to _M. bovis_ can lead to latent or active infection, with risk for eventual reactivation of latent disease, especially in immunocompromised hosts. To prevent exposure to _M. bovis_ and other diseases, hunters are encouraged to use personal protective equipment while field-dressing deer. In addition, hunters in Michigan who submit deer heads* that test positive for _M. bovis_ might be at higher risk for infection, and targeted screening for tuberculosis could be performed.† Close collaboration between human and animal health sectors is essential for containing this zoonotic infection."

_M. bovis_ and _M. tuberculosis_ are closely related genetically, and the standard nucleic acid amplification assay will only identify _M. bovis_ as a member of the "_M. tuberculosis_ complex," which includes _M. tuberculosis_, _M. bovis_, _M. africanum_, the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin strain (BCG), _M. microti_, _M. canetti_, _M. caprae_, and _M. pinnipedii_. _M. bovis_ causes bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in humans, an infection that is clinically similar to infection caused by _M. tuberculosis_. Like infection caused by _M. tuberculosis_, people who are infected but not ill have what is called latent TB infection (LTBI), which can become clinically apparent (TB disease) later in life, as was said to happened in the 2017 case presented in the CDC article.

Accurate speciation of isolates from clinical specimens is important for both epidemiologic and clinical reasons. _M. bovis_ is inherently resistant to pyrazinamide, a drug that is an essential component of "short course" therapy for infection due to drug-susceptible _M. tb_ (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm#tab2). If used for _M. bovis_ infection, "short course" therapy is more likely to fail. Resistance to pyrazinamide requires a 9-month treatment regimen instead of the 6-month, short-course therapy (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm#tab2).

The CDC report above describes 3 human cases of _M. bovis_ infection, 2 pulmonary cases (one case from 2002 and another from 2017) and 1 cutaneous case from 2004, in hunters in Michigan that were epidemiologically and genotypically linked to deer. Similar to the risk that pathologists had when doing autopsies on people with unsuspected tuberculosis, hunters field-dressing deer with unsuspected tuberculosis would be at risk of cutaneous TB from contact of ungloved hands with infected tissues or at risk of pulmonary TB from inhaling aerosols generated when handling diseased viscera, such as the lungs. - Mod.ML
