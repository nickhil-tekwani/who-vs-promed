Near the end of sanitation activities requested by the World Health
Organization (WHO), foot and mouth disease is still threatening Mato
Grosso do Sul.
The Ministry of Agriculture is currently investigating a possible
reemergence of the disease in Japora, in the southernmost area of
this state. There are some suspected foot and mouth disease cases
within the municipality. However, the first serological survey
performed on 134 suspected animals was reported as negative,
according to Mr. Jose Antionio Felicia, superintendent of the
Agriculture Ministry.
He added that official results are to be issued by competent
authorities in Brasilia. He added that the current results are not
definitive, and that new exams may be requested. "We are awaiting
instructions from Brasilia", he informed.
It is not clear whether the animals suspected of having the disease
are from an area that was affected by the infection last year.
According to the superintendent, the suspicions arose during routine
examinations in the region where outbreaks last October 2005 were
concentrated; i.e. Mundo Novo, Japora, Eldorado, Iguatemi, and
Itaquirai municipalities.
Mr. Felicio explained that technical personnel visited the affected
area and reported signs among animals. They also took samples which
were then sent to National Agriculture Laboratory (LANAGRO, according
to its Spanish initials) in Pernambuco last Friday, and the results
were reported last Tuesday. There is no official report from the
Agriculture Ministry yet.
Mato Grosso do Sul state reported 33 cases of foot and mouth disease
(FMD). Because of this problem, 56 countries will establish a total
or partial ban on importing meat products from Brazil. Of the 33
cases, 20 were discovered in Japora, according to the Agriculture
Defence Secretariat from the Ministry of Agriculture. Another 7 cases
were diagnosed in Parana.
Mr. Joao Cavalero, head of the State Agency for Animal and Vegetable
Sanitation (IAGRO, according to its Spanish initials), denied any new
FMD outbreak in Japora Municipality.
"The ministry collected samples to rule out any activity of this
infectious disease but no positive result has even been reported to
the agency", he said.
Meanwhile, IAGRO started the last phase of its activities to
reestablish "free-of-foot and mouth disease" status by implementing a
vaccination campaign. Sentinel animals (non-immunized) were taken
from Eldorado and Mundo Novo farms. Japora will be the next city
where the campaign will be carried out.

[In response to this outbreak, Parana has shut its borders to Mato
Grosso do Sul. Japora was included in the focus of an outbreak of FMD
in October 2005, which was also discovered in other towns within a
15-kilometer radius. In the 2005 outbreak it was believed that cattle
purchased from a farmer in MS were responsible for the infection of 6
herds in Parana.- Mod.TG]
