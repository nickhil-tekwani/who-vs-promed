[It certainly appears as though there is an ongoing outbreak in Riyadh, and with the addition of a healthcare worker as a case, it is highly suggestive of a healthcare facility based outbreak. With the addition of these 3 newly reported cases from Riyadh, the total number of cases from Riyadh since 11 May 2015 is now up to 23, with 13 having been reported since 21 Jul 2015. As mentioned in the previous post (MERS-CoV (99): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, MOH 20150804.3556273), all of the cases reported since 21 Jul 2015 have given either a positive history of contact with other known cases or a possible history of contact that was stated to be currently under review. The "new system" of reporting of information does not clearly specify the type and location of contact with other cases, so one cannot clearly state that these contacts are occurring in the healthcare environment. But, as mentioned in the 1st sentence of this comment, the addition of a healthcare worker as a reported case is highly suggestive that there is transmission occurring in the healthcare environment.

Of concern is the newly reported case in Najran, also in a healthcare worker who denied a history of contact with a known case of MERS-CoV. The most recent reported case of MERS-CoV infection from Najran prior to this case was reported on 9 May 2015. One can't help but wonder whether there were acute respiratory illness patients treated in the healthcare facility where this individual worked (in Najran) that were not diagnosed as having MERS-CoV infection.

[There have now been 31 consecutive days with no new cases reported in the outbreak that was associated with the returning traveler from the Middle East back in May 2015. Of the 12 individuals still undergoing treatment, 11 of the 12 cases have been PCR negative times 2 for MERS-CoV. Three of the remaining patients under treatment are in critical condition, either on respirator assisted breathing or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to maintain adequate oxygen saturations.
