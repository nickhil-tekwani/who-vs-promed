Toxin found in sardines that clogged US marina
----------------------------------------------
The millions of sardines that were found floating dead in a Southern
California marina this week tested positive for a powerful neurotoxin,
researchers said Friday [11 Mar 2011].

High levels of domoic acid were found in the sardines off the Los
Angeles coastline. The high levels of domoic acid may have distressed
them, and caused them to swim into the Redondo Beach marina,
University of Southern California biologist David Caron wrote in a
summary of his laboratory's findings which were reported by the Los
Angeles Times.

Caron said that he still believes that critically low oxygen levels
in the water caused the sardines to suffocate, but it's possible the
toxin may have been one explanation for why they crowded into the
marina. [This is rather confusing. First Caron says it was domoic acid
and then he says low oxygen levels caused them to suffocate. Can it be
both? What is the ultimate cause of death? â Mod.TG]

The California Department of Fish and Game has blamed the die-off on
oxygen deprivation and is also testing fish for toxins at its animal
forensics laboratory. Results are not expected until next week.

Domoic acid is often found in the stomach of fish that have been
feeding on plankton during toxic algae blooms. The toxin has been
linked to neurological disorders, illnesses and deaths in seabirds,
sea lions, sea otters and whales.

Caron's lab is working to determine if the poisoning was caused by a
toxic algae bloom spotted off Redondo Beach on Wednesday [9 Mar 2011].
The presence of the toxin in the sardines could lead to health
complications for pelicans, gulls and other sea life that have been
feasting on the dead fish. "There were tons of birds feeding on these
fish and it's conceivable that we'll see some bird mortality as a
result," Caron said.

The fish died late Monday and carpeted the water's surface the next
morning, stacking up to 2 feet deep in some places. Crews have already
scooped and hauled away more than 85 tons of fish to a composting
center where they will be turned into fertilizer.

[It will be interesting to see if the tests reveal any domoic acid in
the sardines.

If the tests reveal domoic acid, then it may be that the sardines
have unexpectedly been a sentinel animal for this, foreshadowing the
death of birds known to eat these fish.

Appropriately this incredible amount of dead fish is being hauled
off, as it is probable that as they decompose they would collect
maggots which are also delicacies for birds. The birds may then be
exposed to botulism for the rotting fish that accumulate in the
maggots or possibly from domoic acid in the maggots.

But at a compost site it is likely that they will not be exposed in
such a fashion, thus preventing this scenario.

Domoic acid, an acidic cyanotoxin, a neurotoxic tricarboxylic amino
acid structurally related to kainic and glutamic acids, associated
with certain algal blooms and possibly produced by the diatom
Pseudo-nitzschia is also called amnesic shellfish poison (ASP). â
