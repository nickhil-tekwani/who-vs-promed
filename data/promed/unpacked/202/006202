[The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD) monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation", May 2018 (see http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/FMD_reports_GMR/May_GMR_2018_270618.pdf) notes, re China:

"A new FMD outbreak, due to serotype O occurred on 5 May 2018 in a cattle and goat farm at Hubei, as confirmed by the Lanzhou National Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease (OIE reference laboratory) on cattle samples examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and gene sequencing.

"Previous outbreaks in the country due to the same serotype had occurred in February and March 2018, respectively in Xinjiang and Guangxi.

"While the source of the outbreak is unknown, the sanitary measures implemented are movement control inside the country, screening, quarantine, official destruction of animal products, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping out, disinfection, vaccine permitted if a suitable one is available. No treatment is being administered to the affected animals."

A summary table of the animals involved in the outbreak as well as a map with the location of the outbreaks are available in the same EuFMD May 2018 report.

Since the start of 2018, China has reported 21 new FMD outbreaks to the OIE, of which 16 in "immediate notifications", which means they were regarded as primary outbreaks. Of the 16, 10 were termed "recurring", 5 were "new strains", and one was "1st occurrence".

China's terminology and considerations, as applied in the OIE reports, are in need of some clarification. For example: the report of a "1st occurrence", dated 5 Mar 2018, addressed FMDV serotype O, in Anyang, Neihuang, Henan. The "affected species" was termed "sheep", the "epidemiological unit" was "backyard". The number of susceptible animals was 1200, of which 12 cases, 0 mortality, 1200 "killed and disposed of". The species named in relation to laboratory tests applied (RT-PCR and gene sequencing), were "goats"; see at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26061.

One of the rising questions: what does "1st occurrence" mean? 1st in country? 1st in province? 1st in species? Otherwise?

As to "new strains", China's policy to apply gene sequencing for each outbreak is most commendable; details on the sequencing results and identity rate with other strains, either in the OIE reports or elsewhere being electronically accessible, will be warmly welcomed. - Mod.AS
