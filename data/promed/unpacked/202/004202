In Europe the prevalence of VRE in chickens and meat products from chickens
is very, or at least it was very high before the ban of avoparcin as growth
promoter. However the VRE strains we isolated were always susceptible to
ampicillin and gentamicin which was reported to be the main difference with
the VRE strains isolated from humans in the USA. The finding of a
multiresistant VRE in chicken products in the USA may suggest that during
processing the product is contaminated with human VRE and that the strain
is not from animal origin.

I forwarded your yesterdays information to Dr. JP Lafont, a French
microbiologist (veterinary medicine). He commented this short report and
I think it might be interesting for other readers as well. As he does not
mind to be mentioned by ProMED-mail and has not (yet) subscribed I forward
his comments to the VRE in chicken feed to you.

In France we call this "l'arroseur arrose" from one of the first films by
Melies. The VRE in chicken feed has all the characteristics of the HUMAN
nosocomial US strains (Resistance to ampicillin and aminoglycosides in
addition to glycopeptides: European strains of VRE, human or animal, are
resistant to glycopeptides only). I would strongly suspect contamination
from a human source in the premises during the processing of feed. And yet
this information will be used to add vehement comments on the dreadful
menace animals represent for man etc...We know the song, music and lyrics.
Since the US VREs are more or less clonal, it would be easy to compare the
genomics of the "new" strain to the most prevalent hospital isolates (by
pulsed field electrophoresis for instance).
