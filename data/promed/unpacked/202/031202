On Tuesday there were 47 cases of the disease [dengue fever, none of
which were of the hemorrhagic type, considered to be the most dangerous.
In total there have been 112 cases of dengue -- principally in the city of
Limon -- since the past 3 July, when the epidemic was noted.

have specified the serotypes prevalent in this year's activity. However,
the Costa Rican website states: "The serotypes in circulation since 1993
are DEN1 and DEN3." Limon is situated in the Region Huetar Atlantica - MPP
