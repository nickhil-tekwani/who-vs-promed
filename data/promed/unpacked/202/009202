Update on cluster of vancomycin resistant enterococci cases at Tuen Mun Hospital
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

Regarding an earlier announcement on a cluster of patients confirmed to be carriers of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) in a medical ward, the spokesperson for Tuen Mun Hospital made the following update today [7 Apr 2021]:

In accordance with the prevailing infection control guidelines, the hospital has conducted contact tracing. 2 more male patients (aged 53 and 69) were found to be VRE carriers without any symptoms of infection. One of the patients is still hospitalised in stable condition, while the other one has been discharged.

The ward concerned has adopted the following enhanced infection control measures:
1. Enhanced hand hygiene and stringent contact precautions;
2. Enhanced attention to contamination-prone procedures; and
3. Enhanced disinfection and cleaning of the ward concerned.

The hospital will continue to adopt the enhanced infection control measures and closely monitor the situation of the ward concerned. The cases have been reported to the Hospital Authority Head Office and the Centre for Health Protection for necessary follow up.

During a routine vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) screening conducted by Tuen Mun Hospital [TMH], a 64-year-old male patient in a medical and geriatrics ward of TMH was confirmed to carry VRE on [15 Mar 2021]. In accordance with the prevailing infection control guidelines, the hospital has conducted contact tracing for the index patient. 9 more male patients (aged 51 to 95) were found to be VRE carriers without any symptoms of infection. A 78-year-old patient passed away because of his underlying disease. 6 other patients (aged 51 to 95) have been discharged and the remaining patients are still hospitalised in stable condition.

[Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci that are normal constituents of colonic flora of humans and other animals. They commonly cause both community-acquired and nosocomial infections, which include urinary tract infections, biliary sepsis (a systemic infection related to the bile duct}, secondary peritonitis (inflammation of the tissues lining the abdomen), intra-abdominal abscesses, wound infections, bacteremia (presence of bacteria in the blood), and endocarditis (infection of a heart valve).

The most common enterococcal pathogens are _Enterococcus faecalis_ and _E. faecium_. Enterococci exhibit intrinsic resistance, characteristic of the species, and develop resistance by mutation of chromosomal genes or transfer of resistance genes that are linked to mobile genetic material (that is, plasmids or transposons) from other bacteria. Antibiotic resistance has undoubtedly allowed enterococci to become very successful nosocomial pathogens.

Vancomycin was once relied on for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant enterococci. However, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have become increasingly common worldwide since they were 1st detected in the mid-1980s. Some of these infections, particularly those caused by _E. faecium_, are often difficult to treat since only a few antimicrobial treatment options are available.

Avoparcin, a member of the class of antibiotics (glycopeptides) to which vancomycin belongs, has been used in some countries in animal feed as a growth promoter. Because avoparcin confers cross-resistance to vancomycin, the use of avoparcin can select for VRE. In European countries that used avoparcin in animal feed for growth promotion in farm animals, human fecal VRE carriage in the community was much higher than in European countries and the USA that never used glycopeptides in farm animals. In the USA, VRE has been much more common in hospitals than in the community (http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/43/9/2215; http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/46/1/146). In China, where glycopeptides, including avoparcin, are banned in animal husbandry, VRE reportedly has been rarely found on farms (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/18/jac.dkt293.extract).

_E. faecium_ is more common than _E. faecalis_ among VRE, whereas _E. faecalis_ is more common overall, and clonal spread is noted to be common among VRE isolates (LM Deshpande et al: Antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci from North America and Europe: a report from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 2007; 58(2): 163-70; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17368801).

Certain genogroups of enterococci seem to be more capable of causing hospital outbreaks, perhaps because of the presence of a specific virulence factor. Of note, a particular hospital-adapted _E. faecium_ clonal complex 17 (CC17) based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has disseminated globally (Willems RJ, et al: Global spread of vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ from distinct nosocomial genetic complex. Emerg Infect Dis 2005; 11(6): 821-8; available from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367597/). In China, including Hong Kong, most of the human isolates have also been reported to be of the CC17 lineage (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/18/jac.dkt293.extract).

Of the several genotypes of vancomycin resistance, vanA and vanB are most common as they are located on mobile genetic elements that can readily move between enterococci. VanA strains have high MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) to both vancomycin and another related antibiotic teicoplanin; vanB strains have moderate to high MICs to vancomycin and are susceptible to teicoplanin (only vancomycin, but not teicoplanin, is an inducer of the vanB cluster). Additionally, _E. faecium_ is inherently more resistant to penicillin than _E. faecalis_, and penicillin-resistance among _E. faecium_ has increased since the late 1980s (1).

The press release above concerning this nosocomial VRE outbreak fails to say the species of the VRE strains and does not characterize the genotype of the vancomycin resistance, nor the multilocus sequence type. The press release attributes the hospital outbreak of VRE to lapses in infection control, but the specific lapses at fault are not mentioned. However, VRE are able to survive for prolonged periods on inanimate surfaces and clinical equipment shared among patients, including blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, ultrasound probes, tourniquets used in blood collection, pulse oximeter machines, and thermometers, which can be vehicles for cross-transmission of the pathogen (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4676153/). We described the 1st nosocomial outbreak due to a VRE in which an electronic thermometer was implicated as the vehicle of transmission (2).

Tuen Mun Hospital is an almost 2000-bed public hospital in Tuen Mun, New Territories, Hong Kong, that is governed by the Hospital Authority (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuen_Mun_Hospital).
