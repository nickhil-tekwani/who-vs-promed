FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, BOVINE - VENEZUELA (02)

Just until 11 Jun 2008 the Autonomous Service for Agricultural
Sanitation of Venezuela (SASA) finally confirmed 11 cumulative
outbreaks of foot and mouth disease (FMD) among cattle in 6 states of
the country. Last year, 2007, there were 43 confirmed FMD diagnoses
reported to Panaftosa (Centro Panamericano de Fiebre Aftosa -
Panamerican Center for Foot & Mouth Disease) and published by Cosalfa
(Comisi√≥n Suramericana para la Lucha contra la Fiebre Aftosa - South
American Commission for the Fight against Foot & Mouth Disease) in
March 2008.

Just in 2008, 6 positive FMD diagnoses and one 2007 result were
confirmed by SASA to PAHO/WHO/Panaftosa who published them as follows:

Week: 22 VENEZUELA G04C 8 71N FA - A (Tachira)
Week: 20 VENEZUELA I03A 7 72N FA - A (Tachira)
Week: 18 VENEZUELA G05C 8 71N FA - A (Merida)
Week: 14 VENEZUELA G23C 8 62N FA - A (Monagas)
Week: 11 VENEZUELA D10B 10 68N FA - A (Yaracuy)
Week: 8 VENEZUELA G05D 8 71N FA - A (Merida)
2007
----
Week: 44 VENEZUELA I03D 7 72N FA - O (Tachira)

Ref. OPS/OMS/Panaftosa. Informes Epidemiologicos sobre Fiebre Aftosa
y Estomatitis Vesicular. Semanas 1 a 23, 2008

As SASA does not officially report FMD outbreaks to the OIE (World
Organization for Animal Health), so Venezuela appears as free from FMD
in the OIE map of the disease. This is not correct. Since 1950 FMD is
still endemic in Venezuela. During the 1st semester of 2008, FMD
outbreaks have been confirmed in the states of Cojedes, Tachira,
Merida, Monagas, Portuguesa, Yaracuy, Zulia and Bolivar.

While FMD outbreaks are hidden from the public by SASA, Venezuelan
cattlemen and veterinarians keep demanding more transparency from the
animal health authorities. As the national 2008 FMD epidemic is
ongoing, hiding the true epidemiological situation just contributes
to the dissemination of the disease within and even outside the country.

Last May and June 2008 FMD outbreaks reported in Norte de Santander,
Colombia, 4 km [2.5 miles] from the Venezuela border, are said to be
caused by infected Venezuelan cattle being smuggled through the border.

Certainly FMD cases are regularly detected in Venezuela, but not
reported to the public nor to the OIE. Regarding the type of virus, in
2007 there were 29 confirmed virus "A" diagnoses and 14 of "O" virus.
Producers and veterinarians worry because the exotic type "C" virus,
which has never been diagnosed in the country, could enter through the
massive imports of live cattle for slaughter and breeding from Brazil.

Because of all this, the SASA claim of Venezuela becoming a FMD-free
country for 2009, is not feasible. The current national FMD
eradication plan must be revised and a new improved plan implemented
under OIE advice and supervision.

[It appears that Pinate is the author of the blog:
<http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:AP0E0lzoLbEJ:agronotas.wordpress.com/2008/06/27/escasa/+OPS/OMS/Panaftosa.+Informes&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1>

Venezuela did report to the OIE about the presence (in fact,
endemicity) of FMD until the end of 2006; no (any) reporting (thus
also no reported absence) available for 2007.

Suspecting the worst we checked out the PANAFTOSA reports at:
<http://www.panaftosa.org.br/SalSit/default.aspx?Idioma=i>
which are the weekly epidemiological reports. A number of things emerged:

[1] There are inconsistencies in these weekly reports
[2] There is a lot of VS [vesicular stomatitis] in Venezuela which
probably explains the low voluntary vaccination rates for FMD;
[3] One has to scan into later reports i.e., higher numbered weekly
reports, to get the confirmations, which will be reported a number of
times in reports subsequent to the original "pending" report
[4] The map locations are firstly national within country, and secondly for
South America using that archaic grid system imposed back in the early 1970s;
[5] There are repeated outbreaks within the location codes.

So what we found was:
Year, #wkly report, nat loc, So Am loc, FMD virus, report # with FMDv

2007, #24, F09C, 9 69N, A, #27
2007, #19, F09C, 9 96N, A, #25
2007, #16, F10B, 9 68N, A, #22
2007, #10, F10B, 9 68N, A, #14


This has all the marks of a disease totally out of control:
1) doubling/tripling incidence, 2005 vs. 2006;
2) government silence in 2007.

Clearly the lack of reporting is significant in causing those outside
the country to believe the country is disease free, which is far from
the actual case. However it would go along with the stated goals of
having an FMD Free country by 2009. 'Not reporting' and 'being free
of the disease' are not the same thing, especially in this case.

I wish to thank my fellow veterinary moderators, MJH, AS, and PC for
their assistance with this report. - Mod.TG

The fact that Venezuela has not provided any periodic report to the
OIE since January 2007 on its disease situation (FMD is just one of
approx. 100 notifiable terrestrial animal diseases!) should be of
concern to all trade partners of Venezuela and particularly to its
neighbouring countries; in fact, to the whole international community.
Such reports should be provided each 6 months according to the OIE
Code. This relates to all animal diseasaes, not only FMD. Imagine an
exotic or emerging disease popping up there, and not being reported
(eg HPAI H5N1 avian flu, AHS African horse sickeness, etc. - Mod.AS]
