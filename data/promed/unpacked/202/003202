The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 4 May 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1554, of which 1488 have been confirmed and 66 are probable. In total, there were 1029 deaths (963 confirmed and 66 probable) and 438 people healed;
- 213 suspected cases under investigation;
- 9 new confirmed cases, including 3 in Katwa, 2 in Musienene, 2 in Mandima, 1 in Kalunguta, and 1 in Mabalako;
- 10 deaths of confirmed cases, including 6 community/hospital deaths -- 2 in Katwa, 2 in Mandima, and 2 in Musienene; 4 ETC/CT deaths -- 3 in Butembo and 1 in Mabalako;
- 4 new recoveries released from the Beni ETC.

News of the response
Temporary paralysis of Butembo's response activities
----------------------------------------------------
- Response activities were temporarily paralyzed in Butembo and nearby health areas on Sat 4 May 2019 following a demonstration by motorcycle taxi drivers who had placed wooden barricades on the main road arteries of Butembo town. Protesters also attacked handwashing devices throughout the city.
- The day before, Fri 3 May 2019, the teams of safe and dignified burials (EDS [in French]) of the civil protection of North Kivu were called to carry out the EDS of a woman living in Katwa recently deceased of Ebola. At the end of the EDS, an altercation would have occurred after bikers tried to attack the EDS teams and their security escort. An investigation is underway.
- To ease tensions, the ATAMOV President, the Motorcycle and Vehicle Taxi Drivers Association, and the customary chiefs had an exchange with the bikers and asked them not to hinder the work of the response teams. The response activities had partially resumed this Sun 5 May 2019. An increase in the number of cases and deaths is expected in the coming days following this temporary cessation of response activities to limit the spread of the virus in the community.

Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 111 579 people have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo, and Haut-Uele provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Sat 4 May 2019. IFRC: death toll passes 1000
[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), edited]
https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/press-release/ebola-death-toll-passes-1000-outbreak-continues-worsen/

The Ebola outbreak in North Kivu is worsening as the death toll surpasses 1000 on the back of an alarming number of cases reported in recent days across multiple hotspots.

In the past week, 23 cases were reported in one day, the highest since the start of the outbreak in August 2018. Major security challenges and lack of community acceptance of the response continue to hamper efforts to end the outbreak.

Worryingly, many of these deaths are occurring within communities which means that people are not seeking care and treatment in health centres. This is accelerating the spread of Ebola within communities.

Nicole Fassina, Ebola Virus Disease Coordinator with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said:
"We are at a critical juncture where we need to step up our support to communities that are facing greater risk of infection, yet Ebola responders face massive security challenges and a lack of resources for the response. An under-resourced operation creates a very real risk of an international spread of Ebola."

Ebola response activities are costly. Safe and dignified burials are crucial to containing the outbreak. But they are also expensive--costing up to 500 000 Swiss francs a month--as they require specialized equipment which is often not reusable and must be disposed of after each single burial.

Despite security challenges, Red Cross volunteers continue to carry out safe and dignified burials where possible. Volunteers and other burial teams have responded to more than 5000 safe and dignified burial requests across North Kivu and Ituri provinces. They have been successful nearly 80 per cent of the time.

"Building community trust takes time and resources, but we have seen the investment pay off when it comes to acceptance of Red Cross safe and dignified burial teams. Since October 2018 the number of safe and dignified burials requested from communities has tripled, and this kind of work needs to continue if we are going to beat this disease," said Nicole Fassina.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launched an Emergency Appeal [https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/appeal/democratic-republic-congo-ebola-outbreak/ to support 15.5 million people to undertake preparedness and prevention work to stop the spread of the disease but has only received just under half the funding required.

IFRC is also supporting localized efforts to keep the outbreak from spreading to Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda. This includes supporting National Societies to mobilize and train volunteers, procure equipment and put in place preparedness measures should the outbreak spread to these countries.

[As stated in The Independent report on the case numbers surpassing 1000, "While the crisis is a long way off the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa's Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which killed more than 11 000, experts warn its true extent in DRC is not clear.
'There might be double this many cases in reality that we're just not aware of,' Tariq Riebl, emergency response director for the Ebola response crisis with the International Rescue Committee.
'The problem is that people in this area believe Ebola is a political thing, and that's why residents are still attacking the teams in retaliation.'" https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/ebola-congo-drc-outbreak-death-toll-civil-war-who-a8899391.html. - Rapp.MM]

- Fri 3 May 2019. Ebola deaths top 1000 in increasingly dangerous outbreak
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy, abridged, edited)]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/05/ebola-deaths-top-1000-increasingly-dangerous-outbreak
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Today [3 May 2019] Mike Ryan, MD, with the World Health Organization (WHO) outlined major response setbacks in trying to contain the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) -- including more than 100 violent attacks since January 2019 --- as cases continue to mount and deaths top 1000.

'Continued intense transmission'
"Every time we have managed to gain control over the virus, we have suffered major security events," Ryan said, as he explained that the situation on the ground in North Kivu and Ituri provinces is the worst it's been in months, marred by community distrust and a growing threat from rebel groups who are using the outbreak to harness political unrest in the region.

"We anticipate a scenario of continued, intense transmission," Ryan said. He is the WHO assistant director-general for emergency preparedness and response.

Ryan said outbreak response efforts this week were back to the high levels seen before the late April attacks on 2 Ebola treatment centers in Butembo and Katwa. He estimated that health officials are following "1000 contacts per day, receiving 1000 alerts, and vaccinating 1000 people."

But in an update yesterday, the WHO also said that access and activities in parts of Mandima, Masereka, Kalunguta, and Vuhovi remain irregular owing to the presence of armed groups and other security concerns.

Since January 2019, Ryan said, there have been 119 separate violent attacks in the region, with 42 of those attacks specifically targeting health facilities. 85 health workers have been injured or killed.

Ryan said security forces yesterday [2 May 2019] thwarted an attempted attack at an Ebola treatment center in Butembo. No one was injured.

Area violence by militia groups, such as Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) recently caused tens of thousands of Congolese to flee their homes and cross over to Uganda, Oxfam said in a news release today based on a report from Oxfam and 17 other humanitarian groups. The humanitarian situation began on 30 Mar 2019, and more than 60 000 people have been displaced throughout April 2019 -- half of them children.

Tamba Emmanuel Danmbi-saa, Oxfam's humanitarian program manager in the DRC, said, "This is a deeply worrying situation. These people fear going back to their homes and are being forced to live in cramped, unsanitary conditions in an area where Ebola remains a significant threat."

Francis Iwa, executive director of Care for Forced Migrants, said: "Once they enter Uganda, they also are avoiding official immigration procedures and registration as refugees -- which means they may not be screened for Ebola and will be unable to access the very services prepared to assist them."

In some cases, refugees are crossing safely into Uganda; in other instances they are being used as human shields by the ADF, the relief groups said. They are calling on DRC authorities to ensure displaced people are able to cross freely and safely into Uganda.

Second vaccine possible
In addition to addressing the insecurity issues facing the response effort, Ryan also fielded questions about the possibility of introducing another vaccine into the DRC, and the role of nosocomial transmission in this outbreak.

The 2nd vaccine, Johnson and Johnson's prime boost Ebola vaccine, would likely be used in communities that have not yet seen any Ebola infections.

"It would lay down [a] barrier to protect from the virus as a tactical approach," Ryan said. Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV, the only vaccine currently in use in the DRC, would still be used, but mainly on close case contacts [see most recent MoH report for number of individuals vaccinated. - Mod.LK]

Ryan said the WHO and DRC officials would launch tomorrow a new health campaign focusing on needle safety. The misuse of needles in suspected malaria patients, who actually have Ebola, may be playing a role in the nosocomial transmission of the virus.

"We are still seeing new cases that are not on any known transmission chains," Ryan said. "These often end up being nosocomial transmissions."

Deaths hit 1000
The WHO said the current hot spots are Katwa, Butembo, and Mandima. From 10-30 Apr 2019, a total of 292 confirmed cases were reported, 47% in Katwa, 13% in Butembo, and 11% in Mandima, the WHO added.

"In addition, notable recurring re-introduction events having been documented in previously affected health zones such as Mabalako and Musienene, followed by local amplification and extension to affect new heath area," the WHO said.

The DRC also noted today that the outbreak in Butembo was linked to reintroducing the virus in Kayna, Biena, Masereka, Vuhovi, and Kalunguta.

"While each of these areas had managed to spend more than 21 days without new confirmed cases between February and March 2019, the Ebola epidemic had resumed in these areas after contaminated people from Butembo or Katwa fled the teams of the riposte [response] to take refuge with relatives living in these neighboring areas," the DRC said.

[There are so many points raised that are disturbing in this report:
- Mike Ryan, MD, assistant director-general for emergency preparedness and response of WHO, states they anticipate "continued, intense transmission." Then why not call for a PHEIC [Public Health Emergency of International Concern] to be declared? He goes on to say that "access and activities" in some provinces are irregular because of the unrest in the region. This will lead to more cases and further spread of the virus.
- "85 health workers have been injured or killed", presumably because 42 of the 119 separate attacks have targeted healthcare centers. This number does not include health care workers who have been infected with Ebola virus (92). Both numbers are too high and taken together, a tragedy.
- The humanitarian situation resulting from the ADF is terrible, with "60 000 people have been displaced throughout April 2019 -- half of them children." On top of this, Ebola has disproportionately affected children (28% of cases are children under 18 years old).
- The reintroduction of Ebola virus into areas previously considered under control leads to a never-ending cycle of infections and spread. - Mod.LK]

- Sat 4 May 2019. Beni: 4 militiamen killed in new attack
[Actualite, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://actualite.cd/2019/05/04/rdc-4-miliciens-tues-dans-une-nouvelle-attaque-beni
[Byline: Yassin Kombi]

This Sat 4 May 2019, 4 Mai-Mai militiamen were killed in an attack on an army position in the town of Senga, 26 km [16 mi] west of the city of Beni, province of North Kivu.

According to the spokesman of the Operation Sokola 1, Major Mak Hazukay, the attackers belonging to the group Mai-Mami Mandevu were neutralized during the attack [on] the position of the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) in the locality.

They also abandoned 2 weapons, including an AK47 and a light automatic weapon, according to the officer. The local civil society that confirms this news has recognized the attackers killed.

Paluku Kavalami, secretary of the civil society of Mabalako affirms that among the neutralized attackers are 2 bikers of the area, a former machinist and a footballer.

The attack was launched at 3 am and "several residents of Songa town fled overnight to Kantine and Runzayi," the source said.

The Mai-Mai Mazembe dissident, the armed group Mandevu is one of the hundreds of armed groups that have been attacking the eastern provinces of the DRC for many years.

[Byline: Karen Graham]

Excerpts
--------
The Ebola outbreak is concentrated in 2 trading cities in North Kivu province.

The executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, Michael Ryan said that ... the WHO is planning to expand its vaccination efforts because the organization is fearing the worst. "We are anticipating a scenario of continued intense transmission," he said, according to Business Insider. However, attempts at vaccinating more people may be difficult due to the increasingly volatile security situation in DRC."

Ebola treatment centers have come under repeated attack, forcing international aid workers to withdraw, leaving government health officials to staff clinics in the hotspots of Butembo and Katwa.

The WHO has also been hampered in their care and treatment of people in the Ebola outbreak because only half of the currently requested funds have been received, which could lead to WHO and its partners rolling back some activities precisely when they are most needed.

There is cause for concern as to what could happen in the near future. Health officials are tracking 12 000 people who have come into contact with someone who has contracted the Ebola virus. As of Thu, the health ministry was tracking 286 possible cases across the region.

[It seems like a new approach is needed, as the current approach is not preventing the outbreak from spreading. It's not clear additional funding alone will help all by itself, since the problem seems to be lack of trust in Ebola treatment centers and need for identification and access to the contacts to be vaccinated. This will take funding support but equally, a major shift in the mindset of the population affected, with gain of trust and dispelling of misinformation. That needs a community approach where recognized community leaders with influence understand the threat Ebola poses to their community well-being and can convince their followers of the importance of adhering to well established recommendations on Ebola. It is not unlike the situation with MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Individuals will not allow their children to be vaccinated because of misinformation and lack of trust of authorities. How does one work through this thinking? - Mod.LK

Uganda receives 10 motorcycles to boost surveillance and Community engagement in Ebola preparedness
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has received 10 motorcycles from World Health Organization (WHO) with support from Irish Embassy to enhance the surveillance and community engagement pillars in Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) preparedness activities. The motorcycles will enable district officers to mentor health staff at the health facilities and in the communities on the identification of alerts or suspected EVD cases, conduct prompt investigations and raise community index of suspicion for EVD.

The motorcycles will be deployed in the 8 high-risk districts bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The districts are Bundibugyo, Bunyangabu, Kasese, Kisoro, Kanunugu, Kabarole, and Packwach.

Uganda has NO confirmed case of EVD. Active case search continues in all communities, health facilities and on formal and informal border crossing in all districts, especially in the high-risk ones. Alert cases continue to be picked, isolated, treated and blood samples picked for testing by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).
