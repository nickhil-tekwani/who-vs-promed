Some 5205 chickens and ducks were culled at Narayanpur village and
surrounding areas in Panchbib Upazila, following detection of bird
flu Saturday [16 Jun 2007] night.
The chickens were culled in the presence of Additional Deputy
Commissioner M Al Amin. District livestock office sources said that
since some chickens in Narayanpur village died due to unknown causes
on Thursday [14 Jun 2007], he took one of the dead chickens to the
livestock disease laboratory at the district headquarters for
testing. As the lab detected bird flu virus in the chicken, it was
sent to the livestock disease laboratory in Dhaka for confirmation.
As tests confirmed avian influenza in the chicken, a 16-member team
was formed, led by the Deputy Commissioner, to check the spread of
bird flu. They culled 5205 chickens and ducks in the village and
surrounding areas.
