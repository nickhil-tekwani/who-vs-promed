The mystery behind the unidentified fever that had baffled the Tamil
Nadu Health Department for some time now, has been cracked with the
Centre's report stating that it is nothing but a 'mixed fever' --
chikungunya and dengue [viruses] -- spread by mosquitoes.

There was no mystery behind the fever, health secretary VK Subburaj
said, adding that its spread could be checked if the mosquito menace
was controlled. He also attributed the disease's spread to adverse
weather conditions in the state.

Two teams from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, New
Delhi, and the National Institute of Virology, Pune, were in Tamil
Nadu last month [January 2010] to determine the cause of the fever
that has affected hundreds across the State. They took 80 samples
from patients in Madurai and Tirunelveli for analysis.

The Centre's report is believed to state that surroundings need to be
kept clean.

[Chikungunya virus infections were suspected in an outbreak in Tamil
Nadu in October 2009 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20091020.3612).
Assuming that the samples taken then were the ones tested and
reported in this article, there was a mixed chikungunya-dengue
outbreak going on there.
