In the moderator comments on the previous posting, [Avian influenza H5N2,
poultry - USA (TX)(04) 20040226.0600] the question was raised: "So why is
NVSL changing the diagnosis now? Did they report it prior to having the
sequencing complete, or did they report incomplete results? Authoritative
information regarding the sequencing would be appreciated."
The Texas Animal Health Commission reported that clinical signs indicated
the flock was most likely affected with low pathogenic avian influenza
(LPAI). Before laboratory studies began, USDA reiterated that available
clinical information suggested the infecting agent was LPAI virus.
For the record, the USDA, Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service,
Veterinary Services, National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) did
not report isolates as being LPAI virus. The NVSL reported that the
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) indicated avian influenza
virus of the H5 subtype on 20 Feb 2004. The hemagglutination-inhibition
and neuraminidase-inhibition test results on serum samples from this flock
showed the presence of specific antibodies to H5N2 avian influenza virus;
this was reported on 21 Feb 2004. Pathogenicity can be determined only by
sequencing of the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site and/or by chicken
inoculation.
Information was reported by the NVSL as test results became available. The
identification of the virus as high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus
was not made by the NVSL until 24 Feb 2004, when the genome sequence data
were available. Incomplete or preliminary results are not reported by the
NVSL.
While clinical signs in the flock suggested LPAI virus, from the RNA
sequencing data APHIS was obligated to report this virus as HPAI virus to
the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) [Manual of Standards for
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines. Chapter 2.1.14, High Pathogenic Avian
Influenza. 4th edition, 2000. Available at <http://www.oie.int>]. On 1
Mar 2004, the NVSL reported results of the chicken pathogenicity test that
showed the TX/04 H5N2 avian influenza virus as being avirulent for
chickens; the chickens remained healthy throughout the 10-day observation
period.
Consequently, the TX/04 H5N2 avian influenza virus meets the OIE molecular
criterion for classification as HPAI, but is not virulent for
experimentally inoculated chickens.
Discordant results between the molecular classification, derived by
sequencing the HA cleavage site, and virulence for chickens have been
observed with several H5 and H7 subtype avian influenza viruses (Dennis A.
Senne, NVSL). Some examples are: CK/PA/83 (H5N2), Pekin Robin/China/94
(H7N1), CK/Chile/02 (H7N3), and CK/TX/04 (H5N2).
With the CK/PA/83 and Pekin Robin/China/94 avian influenza viruses, each
contained multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site that would be
consistent with their classification as HPAI viruses, but the
viruses initially were not virulent for experimentally inoculated chickens.
Subsequently, both of these viruses became highly pathogenic for chickens;
the CK/PA/83 by a single point mutation in the HA and Pekin Robin/China/94
after additional passages in embryonating chicken eggs.
The initial Chilean H7N3 avian influenza virus possessed an HA cleavage
site sequence consistent with LPAI virus, but an RNA insertion (30
nucleotides) at the HA cleavage site made the virus HPAI even though it did
not match the expected HPAI virus sequence. Similarly, the H7N1 avian
influenza virus in Italy in 1999 started as an LPAI virus, but an RNA
insert (12 nucleotides) at the cleavage site made it an HPAI virus.
Among the H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses, we cannot predict which LPAI
viruses will remain low pathogenic and which will mutate to become highly
pathogenic.
Also, the type of mutation is not predictable. What we do know is that H5
and H7 subtype avian influenza viruses, when allowed to persist and
circulate in poultry, can undergo mutational changes that can have serious
consequences.
