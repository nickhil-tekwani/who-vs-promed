An epidemic of pertussis in California has had a particularly serious
effect in Hispanic children, as the 5 children who have died from the
disease in 2010 were Latino babies, less than 3 months old.

The Department of Public Health in California (CDPH) has launched a
Spanish-language ad campaign to warn the Latino community about the
importance of vaccinating infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, with
a booster between 15 and 18 months of age and another between 4 and 6
years.

"Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease," warned Dr Mark
Horton, director of CDPH in a statement. "Babies who are not
vaccinated or who have not completed the series of recommended
vaccines are particularly vulnerable. The disease in this age group
often results in hospitalization and can be fatal."

For the 1st half of 2010, state health authorities reported 1337
cases of pertussis in the state, a rate 3.4 cases per 100 000
inhabitants, representing an increase of 500 percent over the same
period in 2009.

CDPH statistics show that the highest incidence of pertussis in
infants under 6 months of age occurs among Hispanics at a rate of
94.2 cases per 100 000, more than double that of African Americans.

"Studies have shown that half of children with whooping cough are
infected by their parents, particularly their mothers," states the
CDPH instructive about its prevention. "Therefore, vaccination of
parents and caregivers against whooping cough before or just after
the birth of the child is the most important way to protect babies."

More people are getting pertussis in Michigan and across the nation.
The disease, better known as whooping cough, because of the intense
cough that children with the disease often exhibit.

Fatima Mamou is an epidemiologist with Genesee County Health
Department. She says pertussis is most often transmitted by adults,
who get the illness, but pass it off as a bad cough. "If they have
pertussis they can give it to an infant," she says, "And infants less
than age 1 are too young to be fully protected by the vaccine and
they can get pertussis and severe complications that can even result
in death."

There have been more than 600 cases of pertussis in Michigan so far
in 2010. That is compared to only 278 in 2009.

Some Georgia health officials are warning parents to vaccinate
children after cases of whooping cough have increased in Georgia.

Authorities tell WALB that 46 cases of the transmissible disease,
also called pertussis, have been confirmed in Georgia.

Health officials are looking into cases of other possible cases in
Tift, Turner, and Grady counties.

[Cases of pertussis in previously vaccinated older children and
adults are generally attributed to waning immunity without
considering potential differences in _Bordetella pertussis_ strains.
As pointed out in 2009 by Dr Frits Mooi (see ProMED-mail Pertussis -
Australia (02): (SA) 20091108.3876): "There are now many studies
which show that outbreaks of pertussis are often associated with
changes in the _B. pertussis_ population. Most recently, we have
shown that more virulent (P3) strains have appeared which we believe
to be (partly) responsible for the outbreak in the Netherlands. The
P3 strains have emerged worldwide. Any discussion on the causes of
sudden upsurges in infectious diseases should include changes in the
pathogen population. This is even true for pertussis. (1)"

As a reminder, the 5 dose primary series for
diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine in children is
recommended (2) at ages 2, 4, 6, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years. A
booster of Tdap (lower dose of diphtheria and pertussis immunogens)
is then recommended (2) between ages 11-12 or before age 18 if not
given. Additionally, a single dose of Tdap is now recommended in
adults (3) to be given to replace a dose of the every-10 year Td
booster for adults aged less than 65 years who have not previously
received a dose of Tdap. This dose is particularly important in
adults (pediatric health care workers, new parents, and grandparents)
who are likely to be in contact with young children of the age
precluding them from being adequately protected from pertussis. These
infants are the cohort group with the highest morbidity and mortality
from pertussis.

[In response to the ongoing epidemic, California has expanded their
recommendations for acellular pertussis vaccines,
<http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Pages/Pertussis.aspx>
now recommending the use of Tdap whenever tetanus toxoid is
recommended including in those over 65, and for all women of
childbearing age. DTap is recommended for those 6 months to 6 years
of age. - Mod.LM]
