The number of [cases of] reported gastrointestinal illnesses possibly
spread by a state-run waterpark has now grown to nearly 2000, according to
the State Health Department on Friday. Health officials reported 1738 cases
across 20 counties in western and central New York, up from 746 reported
illnesses Thursday. Seneca Lake Park's popular Sprayground has been closed
for the remainder of the summer as a result.
So far, 13 cases in 4 different counties have been confirmed as
cryptosporidiosis, a common waterborne disease. That's an increase from 5
confirmed cases Thursday. Crypto, as it is known, is very contagious and
can cause symptoms including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and fever that can
last for weeks.
The Health Department initially shut down the Sprayground temporarily
Tuesday after receiving more than 100 reported cases of illness dating back
to early July 2005. Once the public was notified of the outbreak, the
number of reported illnesses then jumped to more than 700 overnight.
Tests conducted by the Health Department have found the presence of
cryptosporidium in 2 storage tanks that supply water for the spray park,
officials said Friday. Additional water samples from the Seneca Lake State
Park beach showed no health concerns with the water quality, and the beach
remains open.
To prevent the further spread of illness, the Health Department advises the
thorough washing of hands after using the toilet, changing diapers or
coming in contact with fecal matter in any way. Swimmers should also avoid
swallowing water, especially in ponds, lakes and rivers, officials said.
Additionally, people experiencing gastrointestinal disease and who work in
food services, or with children or the sick should stay home from work
until they have recovered. Sick children should be kept home from daycare.
The disease usually goes away without treatment in healthy individuals.
