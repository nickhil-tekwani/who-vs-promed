LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY (8)
======================================
[For those who asked for more information on the cases reported in
the original query, "Legionnaire's epidemiology: RFI", the
available information is below. Some of this was already reported
in "Legionnaire's epidemiology (3)"; some additional details
are added here:]
I apologize for the shortage of information. I'm working from what is
largely anecdotal information from a friend of mine. I should add that
these cases occurred about three months apart, were unrelated and lived in
separate communities. Case A was mentally retarded and was being treated
for a seizure disorder with phenobarbital (20 mg. bid). Case B was an
epileptic being treated with tegratol, had been diagnosed with Burkitt's
lymphoma about 6 years ago, and had a portion of his colon removed in the past.
Both cases had WBC of 13 at time of admission and I am unaware of any
attempts to culture any organisms from case B though I do know that case A
was negative for RSV.
Legionnaires was not considered until after death in both cases.
Treament for case A consisted of amoxicillin 125 mg. tid, prednisone 1 tsp.
tid, aerosol treament with albuterol .05 cc with 3 cc of saline qid,
naldecon drops bid on prn basis.
Treatment for case B consisted of keflex 500 mg. bid for 10 days.
