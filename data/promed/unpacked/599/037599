Fighting in southern Somalia has hampered efforts to confirm a
possible spread of Rift Valley fever (RVF) from neighbouring Kenya to
the Lower Juba Region where 7 people have died after showing symptoms
of the rare, contagious haemorrhagic disease, Somali health officials
said. The deaths were reported in Dobley, 18 km north of the Kenyan
border, in the last 5 days. "The dead are mainly nomadic herders,"
said Hassan Mursal, a clinical officer in nearby Afmadow hospital.
"The number could be higher but because of the current insecurity in
the area there is no way of getting the full picture."
Mahamud Haji Hassan Jabra, an epidemiologist with the European
Union-funded Somali Animal Health Service Project, said numerous
reports of animal abortions -- a key indicator of the disease -- had
been received from the area. But plans to send 2 teams to verify the
outbreak would only go ahead once the security situation allowed.
"Our focal point in the area has reported the clinical signs of the
disease but we need to confirm this by testing the samples
collected," he said. "If it turns out to be RVF it will have a
devastating impact on the livelihoods of the pastoralists, who have
suffered 2 years of drought followed by heavy flooding."
Dobley is close to the Kenyan border where fighting continues between
Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) remnants and Ethiopian-backed Somali
government soldiers, who have been chasing them since the UIC were
forced out of Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia. A humanitarian
source in the area told IRIN on Tuesday [9 Jan 2007] that casualties
had been reported when planes carried out air strikes in villages
close to Dobley. "We have reports of 22 people killed by the
bombing," he said. International media reported that the planes were
American, targeting suspected al-Qaeda operatives.
"Most of those killed were in a convoy of donkeys carrying sugar to
the outlying villages," which have been rendered inaccessible due to
recent heavy rains, said the source, who requested anonymity. Another
source told IRIN there were reports of a number of armed militia in
the area. "We don't know whether they belonged to the Islamic courts
or not but some people are saying that they were there."
The bombardment took place in an area known as Jiiro, a "very good
pastureland, with the highest concentration of cattle in the Juba
valley", said the humanitarian source, adding that whether there were
militants in the area or not, "civilians had been hit". The fighting,
he added, was making "it impossible to access the area and help the
pastoralists".
An epidemic of RVF is first manifested in unexplained abortions among
livestock. However, Jabra cautioned that "some of the symptoms of
RVF, such as fever, headache and muscle pain are also common in flu
and malaria."
According to the World Health Organization, the disease is endemic in
Africa, naturally occurring in livestock but occasionally affecting
humans. Animals are infected with the RVF virus by the
_Aedes_ mosquito. Characterised by bleeding from all orifices, it is
spread to humans via infected mosquitoes; through contact with blood
or other body fluids; or from the organs of infected animals. The
disease mainly occurs after heavy rainfall -- southern Somalia has
been experiencing El Nino-type rains, which flooded many parts of the
country. "The conditions in Lower Juba region are conducive to an
outbreak," said Jabra.
At least 60 people in Kenya's North East Province have died from the
disease and last week, health experts warned it may have begun to
spread. "All evidence suggests that the disease is still spreading,"
said Kariuki Njenga, a virologist and laboratory director for the
United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Kenya. The worst
affected districts are Garissa, where 100 cases, including 40 deaths,
have been reported; and Ijara, where 20 out of 42 people infected
with RVF have died. The CDC has set up a field laboratory to test
suspected cases and is helping the Kenyan government to develop a
vaccination strategy.
A team from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is also working
with Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia to address the outbreak. "Together
with officials from the WHO and various international aid agencies
present in the area, the FAO team is helping to draw up preparedness,
communication, surveillance and response activities," according to a
FAO statement. The last outbreak of RVF in Somalia was in 1997 and
led to a ban on livestock from Somalia by the Arab Gulf States.
Livestock exports had been the backbone of the Somali economy.

[It is almost inevitable that Rift Valley fever will spread into the
regions of Somalia adjacent to the North East Province of Kenya if
the outbreak around Garissa in Kenya is not rapidly contained. The
combination of extensive flooding in Kenya and the upsurge of
military operations in the adjacent regions of Somalia in the past
few days is not propitious. Further information from the region is requested.
