The discovery that 2 Indiana pork-plant workers apparently developed
symptoms of the same mystery illness that struck meatpackers in
Austin, Minnesota, may be a significant break in a case that has
baffled disease investigators for a month.

Like the workers in Minnesota, those at the Indiana plant were
stationed near a powerful air-compression system used to blow brains
out of pig heads during processing, said health officials. The
process, which is no longer being used at either plant, exposes
workers to floating particles of blood and brain that investigators
theorize could have made them sick.

The fatigue, numbness, and tingling in arms and legs reported by
workers at both plants are hallmarks of inflammatory neurological
conditions. "It makes the possibility of exposure to the swine brain
tissue more compelling," said Ruth Lynfield, Minnesota state epidemiologist.

The Austin and Indiana plants are 2 of only 3 in the USA known to
have used the high-compression air system to remove brains. The 3rd,
in Fremont, Nebraska, is owned by Hormel Foods and is also part of
the investigation. But so far no cases have been discovered there,
Lynfield said. All 3 stopped using the compressed-air process after
the illnesses came to light.

Investigators will be able to compare all three plants "and then find
out what the differences are," she said. "It is significant."

Dr Jennifer McQuiston, an investigator for the CDC (US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention), cautioned that it's too early to be
sure the cases in Minnesota and Indiana are connected. "They're in
the process of tracking down this information," she said. "We're
trying to learn all we can."

The Indiana workers were identified after investigators began
inspecting packing plants across the country after the Minnesota
cases came to light. The CDC has looked into slaughtering practices
in 25 large pork-processing plants in 13 states. Officials from
United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), the union that represents
workers at Quality Pork Processors (QPP) in Austin, said they polled
local packing house unions across the country about processing practices.

Dr James Howell, who is heading the investigation for the Indiana
State Department of Health, said the 2 cases there were first
identified by a doctor in early January 2008. More may be identified
as the investigation moves forward, officials said. Howell said the
Indiana plant has been using the air-compression system for about 10
years. The Austin plant began using it in late 2006.

So far 12 workers at the QPP plant in Austin have been identified as
having the same collection of symptoms. Initially, health officials
said the symptoms fit an extremely rare disease called CIDP (chronic
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy). But after further testing
they backed off of that diagnosis, and now say the illness is a new syndrome.

Elizabeth Hart, a spokeswoman for the Indiana health department,
declined to release any details of the investigation, including the
condition of the patients or the name of the processing plant.

But UFCW officials said Thu 17 Jan 2008 that they know of only one
plant in Indiana that uses the air-compression system: Indiana
Packers Corp. in Delphi. The union represents workers at a nearby
Tyson pork plant, but not at Indiana Packers, said Jackie Nowell,
health and safety director for the union. Officials of Indiana
Packers, which is owned by the Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi,
didn't return phone calls. However, the Indianapolis Star has
reported that a company official said the Delphi plant was not involved.

"We know that Indiana Packers was using the same (processing)
method," Nowell said. "In our opinion, logically, the plant is
Indiana Packers."

Two employees of an unidentified pig slaughterhouse in Indiana are
being treated medically for symptoms similar to a suspected
neurological illness that sickened 12 workers at a Minnesota pork
plant. The CDC notified the Indiana Department of Health in
mid-December 2007 of a potential link, and state officials said today
[17 Jan 2008] they are still trying to determine if there are any
other workers at the plant who used a specific processing technique
and might have exposed.

The illnesses here are not life threatening, said Elizabeth Hart, a
spokeswoman for the Indiana State Department of Health. The employees
are seeking medical attention with their personal physicians. She
said it was unclear when those employees got sick, and that health
officials in Indianapolis only became aware of the 2 illnesses during
the 1st week in January 2008. The Indiana workers' symptoms included
changes in sensation and weakness in their limbs.

Gary Jacobson, president of Indiana Packers Corp. in Delphi, said
today [17 Jan 2008] his company is not the plant involved, but has
been in contact with CDC and is trying to stay informed on the issue
to update employees.

Any facility that processes meat is going to encounter hazards, which
is why safety gear is a must. "People look like they are suit of
armor when they go to work here," Jacobson said. The company has
discontinued the practice of harvesting brains until "somebody has
some kind of idea" what happened, he said. Harvesting brains is a
small part of the practice.

In the Minnesota case, health officials initially suspect the workers
were exposed to something in the brain tissue that triggered the
illness. Officials are continuing to investigate, but so far they
haven't identified any viruses or bacteria that could be causing the
disease. They've also ruled out chemical toxins.

Of the 12 workers afflicted 5 were initially diagnosed with chronic
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, or CIDP, a rare immune
disorder that attacks the nerves and produces tingling, numbness and
weakness in the arms and legs, sometimes causing lasting damage. But
Minnesota officials later backed away from that diagnosis, saying
additional tests showed none of the workers fit the precise diagnosis.

[No objective clinical information regarding the affected individuals
is stated in these or previous postings. It is unclear at this point,
why CIDP is no longer thought to be the diagnosis. Whether personal
protective equipment was utilized in the plants affected is not
entirely clear, especially what sort of respiratory protection, if at
all, was utilized. At this point, the most reasonable hypothesis
remains that the individuals were exposed by contact or aerosol to
myelin antigens from the porcine central nervous tissue, which caused
an immunological reaction culminating in the neurologic symptoms.
However, a known or hitherto unknown biologic agent or toxin remains
possible. - Mod.LL

Since the CDC identified these other processing plants, when did they
stop using the compressed air technique? In 1996 it was demonstrated
that use of the compressed air technique might have contributed to
prions being spread to meat, providing a pathway of infection to
people consuming the meat. It would logically stand to reason that
the same situation occurs in pig slaughter plants that use compressed
air. Therefore, we have to ask, why are these plants still using the
compressed air method?

Consumption of brains tends to be a passionate pastime for those who
enjoy the taste of this organ. - Mod.TG
