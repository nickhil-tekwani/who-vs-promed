Human adenovirus (HAdV-65) is now making its presence felt in the form of diarrhoea, gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infections. The virus has already been detected in Bangladesh, and with the influx of immigrants from that country to Hyderabad, medical experts say that the ailment can be expected to surface among local citizens too.

Dr N. Nageshwar Reddy, senior gastroenterologist at the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology said: "This DNA virus spreads through feco-oral respiratory tract infection and diarrhoea. It mainly affects children and pregnant women."

Dr Manisha Bangar, head of the department of gastroenterology at Care Hospital added that sometimes diarrhoea turns into cholera [cholitis?], and dehydration and kidney failure are also possible.

"A viral serology test may not be necessary; after ruling out other viral and bacterial diseases, symptomatic treatment is given for the viral syndrome. Sometimes a course of antibiotics is required if the diarrhoea becomes protracted, because in such cases, the intestinal lining gets weaker, and the patient may be exposed to bacterial infection," said Dr Bangar. Vaccination against this virus is only available for military personnel [This needs to be verified. - Mod.CP].

[The following are extracts from a recent Dispatch in Emerging Infectious Disease (Volume 18, Number 5, May 2012) by Yuki Matsushima et al. describing the properties of adenovirus 65, a novel pathogenic adenovirus; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/ahead-of-print/article/18/5/11-1584_article.htm:

Abstract: We report a novel human adenovirus D (HAdV-65) isolated from feces of 4 children in Bangladesh who had acute gastroenteritis. Corresponding genes of HAdV-65 were related to a hexon gene of HAdV-10, penton base genes of HAdV-37 and HAdV-58, and a fiber gene of HAdV-9. This novel virus may be a serious threat to public health.

Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are common pathogens that cause several diseases, such as pneumonia, acute gastroenteritis, and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (1). HAdV infection is also associated with a serious adenovirus syndrome in immunocompromised patients after stem cell transplantation (2). Acute gastroenteritis causes illness and death in humans worldwide. Illness is associated with infection of enteric viruses, including rotavirus, astrovirus, norovirus, sapovirus, and adenovirus.

HAdVs are divided into 7 species (HAdV-A-G) on the basis of DNA genome homology. Most acute gastroenteritis related to HAdVs is caused by HAdV-F species (HAdV-40 and HAdV-41 (3,4). Recently, we detected HAdV-D in feces of children with diarrhea in Bangladesh (5). Other HAdV-D strains have also been associated with diarrhea in Kenya and Brazil (6,7).

We report a novel HAdV-D (HAdV-65) strain detected in feces of 4 children with acute gastroenteritis during October 2004-March 2005 in Bangladesh (5) and results of hexon, penton base, and fiber gene sequence analyses. We also report the full genome sequence of this virus, whose corresponding genes are closely related to the hexon gene of HAdV-10, penton base genes of HAdV-37 and HAdV-58, and the fiber gene of HAdV-9.

Conclusions: We report the complete genome of HAdV-65, a novel human adenovirus isolated from children with gastroenteritis. Recombination is an essential feature for viral evolution and immune escape. Recombination can be facilitated by antiviral immune pressure and co-infection with different HAdV strains of the same species (9). Recently, newly identified HAdVs appeared to originate by recombination among over 2 viruses. HAdV-53 was reported as a novel recombinant HAdV with a close genetic relationship to loop 1 and loop 2 of HAdV-22, the penton base gene of HAdV-37, and the fiber gene of HAdV-8. HAdV-56 had a loop 1 and loop 2 highly similar to those of HAdV-15 (10,11). All other regions of the genome were genetically related to HAdV-9.

HAdV-58 was recently characterized as a novel HAdV with unique hexon and fiber genes of HAdV-25 and HAdV-29 (12). In the present study, we demonstrated that hexon and fiber coding regions of HAdV-65 were formed by recombination in regions around these genes but not by potential recombination within these genes. The potential recombination site within the penton base gene is located at the central position between hypervariable loop 1 and the RGD loop.

These findings suggest that the most conserved sequences around the hexon and fiber genes and in the penton base gene may play a major role in recombination. In addition, this recombination mechanism may be more efficient in enabling new processes of infection and immune escape for maintaining HAdVs than individual small mutations, such as insertions, substitutions, and deletions.

Most recombinant HAdVs have been found in AIDS patients (9,13). The RGD loop of the penton base protein can be digested by trypsin secreted in the intestines, which results in inhibition of proliferation of HAdV except for HAdV-F types in the intestines (14). In this study, HAdV-65 was isolated from infants who had lower immunocompetence and secretion rates of digestive enzymes than adults. These results indicate that emergence of HAdV-65 might have been caused by long coexistence of multiple HAdV-D types and depending on a decrease in immunity, as observed in AIDS patients, and decreased digestive capacity in the intestines.

We detected this type of recombination not only in HAdV-65, but also in 3 other HAdV strains that had a genome sequence identical with that of HAdV-65 from children in Bangladesh during 2004-2005. This finding indicates that this virus might be a newly emerging HAdV, which might be a serious threat to public health."
