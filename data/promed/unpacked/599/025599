In 1997 Cuba experienced an outbreak of dengue fever (DF)/dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in the Santiago de Cuba Municipality. This
outbreak produced 3,012 confirmed cases of dengue. Among them 205 were
classified as DHF according to PAHO/WHO criteria. Twelve fatal cases were
documented.
This epidemic was controlled in week 42, last October, although some
sporadic cases (epidemic tail) were recorded until November 13, when the
last case was reported. Since that date no new cases have appeared.
An intensive campaign for the control/eradication of _Aedes aegypti_, was
launched from the very beginning, although the human and material resources
were limited at the beginning.
In the American region, Cuba is the only country in which dengue was
eradicated in the 1980s. Unfortunately it was reintroduced 16 years later
[at the time when dengue [was present in most of the countries in the
region.
Our strategy for the control of the disease was based in the principles
established by PAHO in the "Guidelines for the Control of Dengue and DHF in
the Americas", as follows:
Political Will, Intersectorial Coordination, Community Participation and
Reinforcement of Sanitary Legislation.
We consider these four factors equally important. In Latin American and
Caribbean countries it is impossible to control the disease based mainly on
the community participation. Although it is of major importance that the
householders take responsibility in eliminating breeding places within and
around their houses it is necessary to understand that the social,
educational, and even cultural and idiomatic factors influence directly
upon vector control efficacy. For this reason our strategy included the
education to the community and the organization of civilian brigades,
depending of the ministry of health, to look for and destroy actual and
potential mosquitoes breeding places and to apply the law. In Cuba 12,000
individuals now are organized to control _Aedes aegypti_. At present only
39 municipalities among the 169 Cuban municipalities are reporting foci of
the vector, which means that 130 municipalities are free [from _Aedes
aegypti_. The premise index in the positive municipalities are below 1
and the objective of eradication is maintained, although the presence of
the vector in practically all the countries in the region makes more
difficult the sustainability of our program.
A more realistic approach should be established in our region to control
_Aedes aegypti_. Cuba maintains its policy of eradication and strongly
recommends an exerted effort in the American region to prevent a recurrence
of dengue similar to the one in South East Asia where DHF/DSS is the
leading cause of hospitalization and death among children.

[Thanks to Dr. Kouri for this update and discussion. >3,000 is not a small
number of cases, relative to previous Cuban experiences and it is clear the
authorities there have made efforts to control this epidemic. It appears
that the "bottom up" approach has not been entirely successful and that a
combination of "bottom up" and "top down" is being considered. It is clear
that political will ("top down") is required everywhere that dengue appears.
Many questions remain unanswered, as is always the case after an epidemic:
What was the source and where was the point of introduction? What is the
age distribution of patients with DHF? As the correlation of dengue
eradication and _Aedes aegypti_ eradication seems not to be high (dengue
eradicated in the 1980's, the vector not eradicated), what is the
probability of periodic reintroduction of virus to a country, an island, in
which competent vectors occur in nearly 25% of its municipalities?
By the way, the Cuban physician who was jailed for, among other reasons,
having spoken out regarding the handling of this epidemic, still is in jail
in Cuba [see Dengue/DHF - Cuba: doctor sentenced 971125175143. Given
that the official numbers do not correlate with his unofficial tally,
perhaps it is time to reconsider his severe penalty and allow a free, top
to bottom and vice versa, exchange of ideas to control this disease and its
vector in Cuba? - Mod.CHC
