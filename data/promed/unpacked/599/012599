About 10 000 fish died in February [2014] in the western part of Reunion island as a result of infections by the bacteria _Streptococcus iniae_.

Thousands of fish are dead, and 83 species are affected. The deaths [are occurring] in the coastal waters of St. Paul, and this has been continuing since 26 Feb [2014]. Analyses of water and fish tissues by the ARSIEB (Environment Planning and Housing Directorate) finally produced results on Friday [28 Mar 2014].

The results of [testing of] the quality of marine waters has been gradually known since early April [2013?], but necropsies performed in the laboratory have identified the presence of a bacterium, _Streptococcus iniae_.

Similar pathologies are regularly reported in temperate and tropical parts of the world, the prefecture said in a statement.

A phenomenon of mass mortality had already occurred on the west coast of the island in 2000 and 2002. About 70 fish species were affected in 2 months. [At that time], the same bacterium was identified.

According to experts, these bacteria cause septicemic infections in fish and disperse upon contact with the skin. Infected fish become lethargic, with a dark color and bleeding at the base of the fins, then they may die within a few days.

One possible cause are "non-optimal" environmental conditions that could contribute to the emergence of these diseases, including lower water oxygen levels, high concentration of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), and high temperatures.

[_Streptococcus iniae_ was 1st reported in 1976 causing subcutaneous abscesses in Amazon freshwater dolphins (_Inia geoffrensis_, hence its name). Since the early 1980s, epizootic meningoencephalitis caused by streptococci has been recognized as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cultured fishponds.

Infections with this pathogen in humans are rare, but when they occur, they may cause cellulitis, endocarditis, meningitis, and arthritis.
