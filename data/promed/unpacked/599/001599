_Xanthomonas albilineans_, a gram-negative bacterium that causes
sugarcane leaf scald disease, has in recent times spread to regions
that have not reported the disease previously and re-occurred in
countries in which the disease is endemic, Dorsamy (Gansen) Pillay,
Director, Research Management and Development, Durban University of
Technology, Durban, South Africa, said on Monday [24 Mar 2008] at the
Tamil Nadu Agricultural University [TNAU].

"The disease occurs in every major sugar-producing region across the
world. Severe losses were reported in the early years of the [20th]
century. However, the disease has subsequently been effectively
controlled by cultivation of sufficiently resistant varieties. But,
seeing from the continued spread, the disease still poses a threat to
the sugarcane industry," Mr. Pillay said. He said that his laboratory
had been engaged in characterisation of the bacterium at the
morphological, bio-chemical, immunological and molecular levels to
understand it in order to aid in its early detection.

Registrar of TNAU, P. Santhana Krishnan, said: "The bacterium was
found in certain varieties of sugarcane in Tamil Nadu and affected
the yield and quality. Eradication is almost impractical because of
alternative hosts. By understanding key pathogenic factors, it may be
possible to develop new control strategies, including novel
resistance genes to rescue susceptible varieties."

[2] Sugarcane diseases - need for resistant varieties

Varietal identification with resistance to major pests and disease
was imminent, since none of the sugarcane varieties in cultivation
possessed resistance to pests, Dr P Santhanakrishnan, Registrar,
Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), said today [25 Mar 2008].
Since very high yield and recovery loss was caused by pest and
disease incidence, the need of the hour was in identifying varieties
which happened to be high in sucrose content and resistance to pests
and diseases, Santhanakrishnan said.

Taking stock of the need by sugar mills for high sucrose content
varieties and of cane growers for high tonnage, TNAU has reoriented
its varietal development approach to immediately supply them with
sugarcane varieties combining high tonnage, high sucrose content and
pest and disease resistance, he said.

[Leaf scald (LS) of sugarcane is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas
albilineans_. The disease was 1st reported in 1911 in Australia and
has since been found in at least 55 countries, many of which are in
the most productive sugarcane areas of the world. It has the
potential to seriously limit cultivation of susceptible cultivars and
may often be latent for years before expression of acute and chronic
phases. The bacterium is limited to xylem tissues and includes
several serological strains. Besides sugarcane, it can infect many
other grasses, which may act as pathogen reservoirs.

The initial characteristic LS symptom is a white leaf streak
("pencil-line") following the main veins. Severely infected leaves
appear "scalded," roll inwards, and develop wilting, chlorosis, and
necrosis. Yield loss occurs through the death of infected cane
stalks. Symptoms may be seen after ratooning and may disappear again,
although plants remain infected. Alternatively, plants may be
infected without showing any symptoms, until mature stalks suddenly
wilt and die. Symptoms may be confused with effects of environmental,
genetic or nutritional factors, chemicals or pests.

LS can be spread by wind-blown rain, plant material, and by
mechanical means including contaminated cutting equipment. There is
also evidence for soil and water transmission. Extremes of moisture
and temperature conditions favor disease transmission. Disease
management involves exclusion by quarantine and sanitary measures,
the use of clean planting material, and use of resistant varieties.
Hot water treatment before planting may be used to reduce the risk of
spreading the pathogen.

It is not clear from the reports above whether the recent spread of
LS is considered to be due to new strains of the pathogen affecting
previously resistant cane varieties or whether high-yielding but
LS-susceptible varieties have been planted to increase sugar
production, and the pathogen is now affecting these. Ongoing programs
to develop varieties with improved yield as well as resistance to
diseases and pests are vital for any agricultural crop.
