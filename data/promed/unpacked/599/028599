We have received information from sources in Mali that the illness appears to be due to nutritional deficiencies, and not infectious. Symptoms started 3-4 months ago. Patients are improving with nutrition. A total of 224 cases were reported by the community including 35 deaths.

There is a mission report (in French, full PDF available to download), which includes images of the condition (https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/assessments/rapport_dinvestigation_mondoro-fv_07-08-2018.pdf). In summary: "Clinical investigations have revealed an edematous syndrome: painful, clinical signs of malnutrition, oral signs of gingivostomatitis, cutaneous syndrome of malnutrition and signs of irritation in children without any infectious syndrome."

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Irene Lai for this useful information. Indeed the pictures in the report points to protein malnutrition, kwashiorkor, which are followed by oedema especially on the legs. The report specifically notes that there are no signs of infection, even though 2 children tested positive for malaria. However, malaria is endemic in the area and a positive test does not link the symptoms to malaria. It is not clear why an epidemic of malnutrition should occur in central Mali. - Mod.EP
