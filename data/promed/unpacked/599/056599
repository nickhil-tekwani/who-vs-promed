Health authorities on Thursday [13 Sep 2007] placed Peru's 240 blood
banks under close scrutiny after 4 patients in less than 6 months
were infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) after receiving
blood transfusions at public hospitals.
"All the blood banks in Peru will undergo a more exhaustive
evaluation than the one we have been carrying out since the start of
the year [2007], which allowed us to close 30 centers," said Health
Minister Carlos Vallejos.
Health authorities came in for a firestorm of criticism after media
reported that [a 44-year-old woman], was given a bureaucratic
run-around for months after she received a transfusion of HIV-tainted blood.
Once her case became public, health authorities announced that there
were at least 3 other HIV-infected patients, one of them an
11-month-old infant.
The scare unleashed widespread panic. Vallejos had to issue a special
appeal to the public to trust the country's public health services.
Adding to the health scare, officials recently announced that 30
patients who went to a social security dialysis center were infected
with hepatitis C.
The HIV and hepatitis C scare are black marks on Peru's public health
services, already overwhelmed by the powerful 15 Aug 2007 earthquake
that killed 519 and left some 200 000 people homeless.

[Safe screening of blood products for infectious agents such as HIV
and hepatitis C virus is achievable but requires rigorous technique
and constant vigilance. It is not clear from this press report
whether the cases of HIV infection and hepatitis C in Peru originated
from a single blood transfusion unit or whether there is a systematic
deficiency in control. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
