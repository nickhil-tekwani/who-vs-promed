H5N1 avian influenza - migratory birds
--------------------------------------
I have long been skeptical of claims relating to the spread of H5N1 viruses
by wild birds in Asia, especially in countries with endemic infection, with
large populations of free-ranging domestic waterfowl, and where the sale of
susceptible poultry occurs through poorly regulated live bird markets (see
Sims, et al. Vet Rec 2005; 157: 159-64, referred to previously in
ProMED-mail posting 20050824.2492).
However, there are some outbreaks in Asia where spread via trade in
domestic poultry/poultry products, or through movement of contaminated
items used in the poultry industry, appears to be extremely unlikely. The
recent outbreak in wild birds in Mongolia is by far the least convincing.
Mongolia has a tiny commercial poultry industry concentrated largely around
Ulaanbaatar and has very few "village-level" poultry, which removes the
"background noise" associated with the presence of domestic poultry that
complicates analysis elsewhere.
In the Mongolian case, there are few plausible explanations for the
outbreak other than through introduction by a wild bird. However, if this
were the case, it raises questions as to how this occurred, especially
given that the timing of the outbreak does not match the movement of
migratory birds (as has been argued by others, see, for example,
20050906.2637), and, so far, clinically healthy wild birds have tested
negative for H5N1 viruses.
To explain this outbreak, the possibility of silent amplification in some
species for a period of time following introduction needs to be considered.
Not all H5N1 viruses are uniformly fatal in ducks, even though they are
still highly pathogenic for other poultry (and perhaps other wild birds).
Alternatively, low level mortalities in some sites could go unnoticed for
some time, and in less densely populated lakes, spread would not
necessarily be explosive.
The density of birds at some breeding sites provides an ideal environment
for spread and amplification of an H5N1 avian influenza virus. All it would
take for a virus to establish in such a population is the entry of one
infected bird excreting virus. We know that experimentally-infected
mallards can excrete Asian H5N1 viruses for up to 17 days, and, therefore,
introduction of an H5N1 virus by an asymptomatic short-term "carrier" duck
is a possibility.
Why have tests on healthy wild birds been negative? Perhaps short term
"carrier" birds are rare, and given our limited capacity to collect and
test samples, negative results do not rule out this possibility. Also, if
these samples are collected from places where virus was introduced some
time previously, the original "carrier(s)" may no longer be excreting virus.
The Mongolian case provides the best evidence to date for wild birds in the
trans-boundary spread of H5N1 avian influenza, and there is no reason to
believe that this was an isolated occurrence.

Avian influenza and migratory birds
-----------------------------------
I refer to part 2 of the posting "Avian influenza - Asia (21): migratory
birds" [20050906.2637], in which George Arzey of the NSW DPI suggested that
the absence or relative absence of AI in Australasia was somewhat
enigmatic, in view of the large numbers of migratory water birds visiting
Australia and New Zealand.
The most obvious explanation for the infrequent occurrence of HPAI in
Australia and its absence from New Zealand is that birds of the order
_Anseriformes_ (ducks & geese) do not migrate across the equator, a point
that is made somewhat in passing in the above-mentioned posting. This
important fact means that Australasian ducks and geese do not mix with the
northern hemisphere populations of these species that are currently the
focus of so much speculation concerning their role in the spread of avian
influenza viruses.
In the case of New Zealand, apart from seabirds in the order
_Procellariiformes_ (albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters etc), the majority
of migratory birds are shorebirds in the order _Charadriiformes_,
particularly sandpipers and their allies in the family _Scolopacidae_. Of
the 14 species of ducks and geese in New Zealand, 8 are endemic/native, and
6 were introduced (mainly from Great Britain) in the 19th century. However,
none of these _Anseriforms_ are migratory, not even within the southern
hemisphere.
Although there has never been an outbreak of HPAI in New Zealand, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has long been aware of the theoretical
risk of introduction of avian influenza viruses by migratory birds, and
Biosecurity New Zealand has been monitoring this over a number of years,
primarily through surveys of migratory birds soon after their arrival in
this country. The number of samples collected each season has varied, but
in 2004 and 2005, for example, about 300 cloacal swabs were collected from
godwits and knots and a further 580 samples were collected from wrybills, a
non-migratory species of wader that is in very close contact with the
migrants from the time of their arrival in New Zealand. In addition, 900
swabs were taken from fresh feces of knots & wrybills off the ground. No
avian influenza viruses were isolated from any of these samples or from the
less intensive sampling that was conducted in previous years.
A number of surveys of New Zealand's resident duck population have been
carried out over many years. A number of avian influenza viruses have been
isolated, including one H5 in 1997 and one H7 in 2005, but no HPAI viruses
have ever been found.
While it is recognized that it is theoretically possible for any H5 or H7
virus to mutate to pathogenicity if introduced into poultry flocks,
limiting the interface between wild birds (whether migratory or not) and
poultry flocks through good biosecurity practices is key to minimizing the
likelihood of this happening. In practice, this primarily means that water
and feed supplies for poultry flocks must be managed so that they do not
become contaminated with feces of wild birds.

EU sees tufted ducks, gulls as high bird flu risk
-------------------------------------------------
EU animal health experts have issued guidelines for testing wild birds to
guard against bird flu and identified 15 species that may pose a higher
risk of transmitting the virus, the European Commission said on Tuesday [6
Sep 2005].
The guidelines focus on surveillance and sampling along the birds' major
migration paths and in areas where there is a risk of wild birds mixing
with domestic poultry, such as in ponds. Both living and dead birds are
included, especially where there are cases of abnormal death or significant
disease outbreaks, it said in a statement issued after a meeting of
national EU veterinary, virology and ornithology experts.
The wild birds deemed to present a higher risk of bird flu included common
species such as the teal and mallard, as well as the tufted duck, northern
lapwing, and some goose and gull types.
So far, EU experts and the Commission say that bird flu has only a remote
or low chance of striking the European Union in the immediate future and
that there is no need for governments to ban farmers from keeping poultry
outdoors, as the Dutch have done.
EU animal health experts will meet again in Brussels on 14 Sep 2005 to
evaluate national bird flu surveillance programs drafted by each of the
EU's 25 member states. In August 2005, Russian authorities confirmed a
virulent strain of the disease, potentially lethal to humans, in 6 regions
in Siberia and the Urals, causing the deaths of some 14 000 wild and
domestic fowl. The virus also spread into Kazakhstan.
Some experts fear migratory birds could spread the virus to the EU as they
move to warmer areas for winter after nesting in Siberia, although the
Commission has said this seems unlikely.
