indication of current reactions to the recent news:]

linked to BSE. (Reuters, 3/25)

BSE SMUGGLING RING FOR MEAT FROM THE UK
** English meat from herds with BSE, sold as Irish meat in Europe. A senior
Irish ministry vet has been filmed by the police while trading over 1,000
blank certificates and eartags for a cheque from a cattle trader. Irish
half-loaded lorries arriving to the U.K. on its way to France. English
calves added to the loades while they were at lairages. An investigation

"nip in in the bud". From the start, the Irish government ordered the
slaughter of entire herds where outbreak occured. With 124 confirmed BSE
cases - 16,485 cattle have been killed as a precaution. Irish farmers were
paid full compensation based on the market value of the cattle - compared
with 50 per cent paid initially by the U.K. government.(The Daily

of 151 cattle in which one case of BSE had been found, and ordering another
of 120 destroyed. (Reuters, 3/25)

number is 161,663.(The Daily Telegraph, 3/26)
