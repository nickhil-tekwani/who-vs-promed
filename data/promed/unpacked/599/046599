Eleven cases [of measles] have been identified among children of various
ages between 0 and 5 years. A medical team left Lodja [the capital of
Sankuru province] on Tuesday [8 Jun 2007], for Lubefu. ["Radiookapi.net"
reported that, according to the chief doctor of the region, all measures
have been taken to avoid spread of the illness.]
No deaths have been reported, according to the regional medical chief. A
team composed of doctors, epidemiologists, and the doctor in charge of the
program for expanding vaccination are en route for Lubefu. Their objective
is to contain the epidemic and prevent its spread.
There are vaccines available to counter this epidemic, declared the
provincial medical inspector, Audrey Mulumba. More than 3000 children [will
be targeted] by this vaccination effort in the surrounding area, she
declared. The majority of the children targeted had escaped the vaccination
campaign following population movements and as a consequence of the
inaccessibility of some parts of the region, added the same source. A
program of routine vaccination will be reinforced in this part of the
country in order to avoid the return of the epidemic.
