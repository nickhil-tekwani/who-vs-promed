[This report follows hard on the heels of a case reported on ProMED in
September 2003 - see refs. below. Since the first case in Japan in 1984,
scrapie has now been reported in 33 farms with 62 positive cases. Previous
cases of scrapie in Japan, posted on ProMED, are OIE reports of a sheep dying
on an experimental farm in 2001, and of a case in 1999, whose parents were
suspected to have been introduced from a farm where scrapie occurred in
1984. Scrapie does not affect humans; it has been occurring in sheep in
Scotland for 200 years, but no human cases have ever been identified, and a
possible connection between scrapie & BSE has not been established.  Mod.JW]
