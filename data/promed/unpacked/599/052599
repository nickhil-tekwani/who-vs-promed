[1] _Grapevine red blotch virus_ - USA: germplasm collection, California

_Grapevine red blotch virus_ (GRBV) has been found in the Russell Ranch [Foundation] Vineyard (RRV). Five of 4132 vines tested positive for GRBV [and] have been removed and destroyed. One vine tested positive in the Classic Foundation [vineyard and] was removed. Every grapevine in RRV has been tested. _Vitis_ spp. in proximity to RRV have been tested; positive vines have been removed.

All vines related to GRBV positives tested negative, indicating that this is a field transmission of GRBV. Sprays targeting the vector have been applied. RRV has been tested for GRBV since 2013 and this is the 1st time it has been detected. Preliminary sequence analysis showed 99 per cent identity to GRBV isolates from 2 different groups, which indicates separate infection events.

Material from the plants was distributed prior to the last negative test date, indicating that [it] was likely GRBV-free at distribution. The one customer who received material from the vines has been contacted. All vines in RRV will be tested for GRBV annually by composite testing. Classic Foundation [vineyard] will be subject to regular testing as well as prior to distribution.

[2] _Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ - Pakistan: 1st report
Date: November 2017

[Ref: S Rasool et al (2017): First Report of _Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ Infecting Grapevine in Pakistan. Plant Disease 101, 1958; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-04-17-0476-PDN]
---------------------------------------------
_Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (GPGV) is a new member of the genus _Trichovirus_. A total of 249 grapevine samples were collected from different regions in Pakistan and tested by RT-qPCR for 17 viruses known to infect grapevine, including GPGV. Five self-rooted asymptomatic vines from the same vineyard in Punjab tested positive for GPGV. Multiple infections with leafroll viruses and vitiviruses were also identified in these samples. Two samples were also positive for _Grapevine fanleaf virus_.

GPGV-positive samples were run by RT-PCR and [amplicon sequences] found to be 96 per cent identical with GPGV sequences from GenBank. Three of the 5 isolates were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) [and] yielded 2 near full genomes of 7223 and 7156 nt and one partial genome of 1971 nt of GPGV [which] showed 97 per cent homology with the French isolate and 99 to 100 per cent identity between one another. HTS analysis also found other viruses as confirmed by RT-qPCR.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the 1st report of GPGV in Pakistan. Given the lack of information available on GPGV in this region, a larger scale survey of commercial vineyards is needed to determine the prevalence of GPGV. Further studies are needed to determine its genetic diversity and overall effect on table grape yield and quality in Pakistani vineyards.

[Grapevine red blotch (GRB) has been identified recently as a syndrome that affects fruit ripening. It has been reported in a wide range of grape cultivars, including wine, table, raisin and rootstock varieties. GRB does not appear to be a new disease but is likely to have escaped detection because its symptoms resemble leafroll disease (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). The new geminivirus _Grapevine red blotch virus_ (GRBV, only species in the new genus _Grablovirus_) has now been shown to be associated with GRB.

Symptoms of GRB appear in autumn when leaves normally would turn shades of yellow. They may include irregular red(ish) blotches on leaf blades, pink or red veins, occasional reddening of leaf blades, as well as slow accumulation of sugars or failure to mature in fruits. It is not known whether there are any effects on fruit yield or plant longevity. Symptoms differ from leafroll disease mainly in that the leaf margins do not roll downwards. GRBV has been detected in the host before appearance of symptoms and also in dormant canes.

_Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (GPGV; genus _Trichovirus_) is a newly described virus of grapevine which was identified in Italy on cv. Pinot gris vines with symptoms of chlorotic mottling and leaf deformations. GPGV has since also been found in other parts of the world. It was detected by new large scale sequencing methods ("deep sequencing") in co-infection with several other viruses and viroids. Therefore, it was initially not possible to clearly associate the virus with specific symptoms. Several strains have been identified and symptomatology may depend on the combination of virus strain and host cultivar. GPGV appears closely related to _Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus_ (GINV) of the same genus.

Both GRBV and GPGV are transmitted by grafting and with infected budwood and rootstocks. Arthropod vectors have also been identified: a treehopper for GRBV, eriophyid mites for GPGV (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). Given the vegetative propagation methods used for grapevines, longevity of the host and historic international exchange of germplasm, both viruses may be widely distributed in some or many commercial cultivars. Presence of GRBV, or any virus, in a germplasm collection which supplies materials to growers, as reported in item 1 above, is most worrying. GRBV is considered an emerging threat to grape industries.

The other viruses mentioned above are _Grapevine fanleaf virus_ (GFLV, genus _Nepovirus_); leafroll viruses which include at least 9 different species belonging to different genera within the family Closteroviridae; and species in the genus _Vitivirus_. Disease management of grapevine viruses and viroids may include phytosanitation (removal of infected plants, disinfection of vineyard tools), removal of reservoir hosts and vector control. Use of certified clean planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks and scions for grafting) is essential.
