The Japanese Ministry of the Environment reported a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus in a raccoon dog, or tanuki in Sapporo, Hokkaido.

Hokkaido University collected the debilitated individual raccoon dog, which died on [1 Apr 2022]. On [7 Apr 2022], Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1 subtype) was detected as a result of conducting a genetic test in an original test conducted by Hokkaido University.

Officials note this as the 1st case of bird flu being detected in a mammal in the country.

The tanuki was found in an area where a number of bird-flu positive dead crows were detected. It has been suggested that it may have been transmitted by predation of birds infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza.

[In a recent ProMED post ( archive 20220406.8702440) we reported a fox infected by HPAI H5 in Sapporo. As the locality is the same, the date of finding is very similar, there is also mention of dead infected crows, and in that report, it was also mentioned that it was the 1st report in a mammal in Japan, I suspect that this might be the same case, and the host species was mistaken previously or here. We request information to confirm whether this case is a different one from the red fox posted recently. If it is the same case, it would be important to know which is the species involved, red fox or raccoon dog.

Raccoon dogs (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_) are canids, like foxes, wolves, and dogs. For a picture go to https://www.collinsdictionary.com/images/full/raccoondog_87452444.jpg.

Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are not common, but foxes have shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1 and H5N8, and there have been recent reports of cases in wild red foxes in Europe. Virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMB
