The Interdepartmental Working Group on Enterovirus Infection met today (27
May) to review measures for the prevention and control of enterovirus
infections. Members of the working group comprised representatives of the
Health and Welfare Bureau, the Department of Health, the Hospital
Authority, the Education Department, the Social Welfare Department, the two
municipal services departments and the Information Services Department.
The meeting noted that the existing mechanism of surveillance and liaison
among departments had been able to co-ordinate actions and various measures
to prevent and control outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease which is the
common manifestation of enterovirus infection. It was agreed that health
education on the prevention of enterovirus infection should be stepped up
during the summer months.
Since children under five are more vulnerable to the disease, it was
decided that publicity and education should focus more on kindergartens and
child care centres. While the Department of Health would continue to
inspect these institutes, the Education Department and the Social Welfare
Department would assist in issuing circulars, disseminating information
materials and organising seminars for principals, teachers, and child care
centre staff to increase their alertness on the disease.
On the part of the municipal services department, efforts would be made to
ensure water in public and private swimming pools had been properly treated
to meet the disinfection standard for the prevention of communicable
diseases. At the same time, staff of the two municipal services department
would remind operators of places of public entertainment and places of
amusement with ball pools / kiddy rides etc, to clean the balls,
entertainment machines and various play gear frequently. Inspections on
these premises would be stepped up.
Regarding surveillance on the trend of enterovirus infection, in particular
EV-71, the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority would be in
close contact to monitor the situation. The public would be kept informed
of the latest situation. A spokesman for the working group stressed that
enterovirus infections are not uncommon worldwide. Severe forms of
enterovirus infection affecting the brain and the heart can occur but are
rare. He stressed that vigilance must be maintained to prevent the
disease, especially in the summer months, and that the best prevention is
good personal hygiene.
Some of the simple rules to be observed are:
* Wash hands after going to toilet
* Wash hands after changing diapers
* Cover mouth when you cough or sneeze
* Clean and wash shared toys properly
