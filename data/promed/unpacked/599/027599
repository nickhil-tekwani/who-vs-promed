[Plague is endemic in the Arua-Nebbi region on the western border
of Uganda with the Congo DR. There are no implications for
international travel (other than for local border-crossing residents,
militia or humanitarian relief staff).
This report is being posted in support of WHO, because plague is
one of the diseases under the International Health Regulations which
has to be reported within 24 hours to WHO Geneva. - Mod.JW]
