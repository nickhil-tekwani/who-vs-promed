Moroccan Sausage May Have Botulism
------------------------------------------
Moroccan health authorities have seized 120 tons of mortadella sausage they
think may be responsible for a wave of deaths in Morocco since early
September 1999, health authorities said in a statement Saturday.
At least 10 people have died after eating contaminated food, officials said.
Authorities suspect the mortadella may have been contaminated with botulism
bacteria.
Of the 52 mortadella factories in Morocco, only 11 were approved by the
sanitation department, according to a government health commission statement
released Saturday.
The results of an analysis of the sausage, which has been collected from
more than 3000 stores and restaurants, will not be released for 10 days.
Officials suspect that other food products, including ice cream, may also be
infected with the bacteria.
Botulism, caused by bacteria that produce a deadly toxin, usually occurs in
food that has been preserved in some way.
Symptoms include headache, vertigo, double vision, weakness, difficulty
swallowing and speaking and progressive respiratory paralysis.
