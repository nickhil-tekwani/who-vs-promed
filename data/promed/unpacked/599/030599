State health officials are warning people who bought or came in
contact with birds from a Wayne County [New York] pet store that they
may have been exposed to psittacosis, a rare bacterial infection that
can be transmitted to humans. State and county officials are
investigating whether cockatiels purchased at the Animal Odyssey Pet
Store in Newark may have infected 3 members of a Seneca County family.
Psittacosis is a common disease among such pet birds as cockatiels,
macaws, parrots and parakeets. In humans, the disease can cause
fever, chills, muscle aches and even pneumonia, but is rarely fatal.
If not properly treated, psittacosis can cause more severe illness in
pregnant women. Transmission can occur while cleaning the bird
droppings and inhaling the air.
The disease is not connected to the avian flu H5N1 strain currently
circulating in other parts of the world, according to a statement
from the NS State Health Department.
So far in 2006, only 5 incidents of psittacosis transmission have
been reported in the entire country, according to recent statistics
from the CDC.
Traci and Gordon Bogart, who co-own the pet shop at 100 S. Main St.,
said they pledged to cooperate with authorities but have yet to see
evidence that confirmed the birds came from their store. The shop
stocks a few exotic and domestic birds in addition to other pets.
"We're working with them 100 percent, have taken the birds out of the
store, tested and treated them and I'm 100 percent sure the tests
will come back negative," she said, adding that the birds are being
treated as a precaution.
According to the state Health Department, a cockatiel purchased by
the family died and another tested positive for psittacosis. Bogart
said she is confident that the birds, which she gets from a private
breeder, were not infected.

Barbara Shipley, a superintendent of public health for the Wayne
County Health Department, said the family reportedly visited the
store over a period of several weeks before buying the bird that
died. The store then replaced that bird with one that tested positive
for the disease, she said.
Shipley said that anyone who thinks they are experiencing symptoms
due to possible exposure should see their doctor. Treatment is with
an antibiotic, such as tetracycline.
In birds, symptoms of psittacosis include poor appetite, ruffled
appearance, eye or nose discharge and diarrhea. Antibiotics can be
used to treat infected birds.

[Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human
disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically
associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and
cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks,
pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by
inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large
amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds.
The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be
fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct
exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through
the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such
as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective
equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by
free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is
likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing (1).
People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet
store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians.
Newark is a village in Wayne County, New York, USA, 30 miles (48 km)
east by south of Rochester. A map showing the location of the
county, whose northern border is Lake Ontario, can be found (along
