At least 23 people have died from eating contaminated sweets in central Pakistan, police say. The deaths began last week [week of 18 to 24 Apr 2016] after a man in Punjab province bought the treats to celebrate the birth of his son. He and 11 other relatives are among the dead -- in all 77 people were affected and 5 remain in a serious condition.

Police have arrested 2 owners of a local sweetshop and 1 of their employees while the source of the contamination is investigated. Officials suspect [that] pesticide from a store next to the shop may accidentally have found its way into the laddoos - ball-shaped sweets popular at special occasions.

The victims were taken for treatment in the city of Multan. Laboratory tests are being carried out after police reportedly found sachets of pesticide inside the sweet shop. Food safety officials have taken samples for testing.

On 20 Apr 2016, the new father bought 4.5 kg [about 10 pounds] of laddoos to celebrate. Five people died immediately. By the weekend many more lives had been claimed. The new father, one of his sisters, all of his 7 brothers, 2 of his nieces and a nephew are among the dead. Only 5 people now remain seriously ill in Nishtar hospital in Multan -- most of the others who were being treated have recovered.

Police have charged the sweet shop owners under food control and poisonous substances laws. "There was a pesticide shop close by which was being renovated, and the owner had left his pesticides at the bakery for safe keeping," senior police official Rameez Bukhari told the [AFP Agence France-Presse] news agency.

The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says [that] there have been a number of fatal incidents involving contaminated alcohol and cough medicine in recent years. In neighbouring India, in 2013, more than 20 children died after consuming contaminated free school meals in Bihar state.

[Laddu or laddoo are ball-shaped sweets popular in the Indian Subcontinent. Laddus are made of flour, minced dough and sugar with other ingredients that vary by recipe. They are often served at festive or religious occasions.

There are no other clinical signs reported other than sudden death. As the dose always makes the poison, a large dose of a several pesticides could be responsible and it is pointless to make guess. This is a very sad and unfortunate event. - Mod.TG
