[There is a decline in incidence that one hopes will continue. Perhaps there has been a decrease in the populations of the Lassa fever virus reservoir host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp), with a decrease in numbers of virus carriers. This could result in less contamination of the environment with virus-containing excreta from these rodents.

Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection.

Lassa virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans.

The deadly Lassa fever has claimed about 149 lives in Nigeria in the last 9 months, the World Health Organisation, WHO, has revealed.

A recent report released by the organisation on the situation of Lassa Fever in Nigeria showed that between August 2015 and 17 May 2016, the deadly fever killed 149 people.

During this period, WHO said it was notified of 273 cases of Lassa fever, including 149 deaths in Nigeria. "Of these, 165 cases and 89 deaths have been confirmed through laboratory testing (CFR: 53.9 percent). The cases were reported from 23 states in Nigeria. Since August 2015, 10 healthcare workers have been infected with the Lassa fever virus, of which 2 have died. Of these 10 cases, 4 were nosocomial infections."

"As of 17 May 2016, 8 states are currently reporting Lassa fever cases (suspected, probable, and confirmed), deaths and/or following of contacts for the maximum 21-day incubation period. Currently, 248 contacts are being followed up in the country. The other 15 previously affected states have completed the 42-day period following last known possible transmission," the report said.

Currently, the body said 2 national laboratories were supporting the laboratory confirmation of Lassa fever cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. It explained that all the samples were also tested for Ebola, dengue, and yellow fever and that so far all had tested negative.

The WHO, however, said overall, the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria showed a declining trend. "Considering the seasonal peaks in previous years, improvements in community and healthcare worker awareness, preparedness and general response activities, the risk of a larger-scale outbreak is low. Nevertheless, close monitoring, active case search, contact tracing, laboratory support and disease awareness (both in community in general and specific training for health care workers) should continue," the body said.

The WHO added that considering the seasonal flare-ups of cases during this time of the year, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems.
