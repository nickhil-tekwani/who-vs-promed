Several minks have tested positive for the coronavirus on a mink farm in Solvesborg in Blekinge. People on the farm have also been found infected.

The Swedish Veterinary Institute (SVA) is now investigating how the virus spreads among the animals. This is the 1st time that the new coronavirus has been found on a Swedish mink farm.

"We tested a number of animals today [23 Oct 2020], and all were positive", says Karl Stahl, acting state epizootiologist at the SVA.

People working on the farm have also been found infected. There is no established route of transmission yet. "But one can assume that the infection has been passed from person to animal," says Karl Stahl.

The fact that the virus has spread to over 70 mink farms in the Netherlands and over 140 in Denmark [as of 29 Oct 2020, 175. - Mod.AS] shows that minks are particularly susceptible to the coronavirus.

"The minks have the potential to become infected because they have receptors in their airways that are suitable for the virus. When breeding for fur production, the minks are kept in cages close to each other, which is believed to be the reason why the infection spreads easily on the farms. Minkers do not keep their distance. It is like with nightclubs, if you have many people in a small area, you risk that there will be a lot of virus and then the infection spreads quickly."

The Swedish Board of Agriculture states that there is still no reason to kill the animals on the affected farm in Solvesborg, but that it is subject to restrictions to prevent the spread of infection.

In the Netherlands, where hundreds of thousands of minks have been killed, there are reports that minks have passed the infection on to people who work with the animals. Cats staying at mink farms have also been found infected.

"Cats get a transient disease and they can in experimental studies spread the infection further. But in reality, felines do not pose a risk of infection, they do not live close together."

The Swedish Board of Agriculture and SVA monitor the spread of infection and work together with the mink farming industry in Sweden to prevent the virus from entering more facilities. The mink breeders have been asked to send dead minks to SVA for sampling and analysis. "We will also study the routes of infection."

In the Netherlands, several studies have been done at outbreaks, where researchers looked at the development of immunity and the spread of the virus in the air. Similar studies may also be relevant in Sweden, according to Stahl. "We can learn a lot about how the virus develops when it spreads from individual to individual."

[The above information has come to ProMED's attention by visiting the Dutch website "Animal Rights," dated Thu 29 Oct 2020 (https://www.animalrights.nl/ook-corona-bij-nertsen-zweden), which cited other media sources.

Earlier, initial information about the detection, allegedly as early as in August 2020, of 2 infected minks in Italy was received from an animal rights group. A request for information is pending (20201028.7897986).

Such epidemiological information deserves, preferably, to become public firsthand, as close as possible to its lab confirmation by official channels. It should also be notified to the OIE as an emerging (non-listed) disease.

Notifications addressing COVID-19 in farmed minks have reached the OIE so far from 4 countries: Netherlands, Spain, Denmark and USA. - Mod.AS
