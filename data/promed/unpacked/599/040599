Confronted with an epidemic of post operative wound infections caused by
_Aspergillus flavus_ in our department for cardiac surgery, we are urgently
looking for official standards for air quality in operating theaters.
Epidemiologic investigation demonstrated that several patients developed
sternal infection with _Aspergillus flavus_ as a complication of cardiac
surgery in the months of March and April 1998. Air sampling and surface
cultures revealed the massive presence of _A.flavus_ in and outside
cardiosurgical operating rooms. The operating ward was temporarily closed
and a massive decontamination operation was set up.
In order to evaluate the safety after the corrective action, we will
perform quantitative cultures of air and surfaces in and around the
operating rooms. We screened the Internet for national and/or international
regulations regarding hygiene in operating rooms and standards for
microbial contamination of air, but could not find any.
