[The previous reported Chinese FMD outbreak occurred in the XINJIANG
province, where it started on 23 Feb 2008 and was reportedly resolved
on 27 Mar 2008 (see summary and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6902>).
Similarly to the current outbreak, it was caused by FMDV serotype
Asia 1, affecting cattle while susceptible sheep remaining clinically
unaffected. And, similarly to the current outbreak, stamping-out
policy was applied: all the domestic animals on the premises, of any
FMD-susceptible species, are culled -- involving the infected and
exposed animals of the clinically-affected species (cattle) as well
as the other, in-contact animals (sheep, and in the current outbreak
also pigs). In addition, vaccination is carried out "in response to
the outbreak(s)." It will be helpful to note which vaccines are used
(valency) and how the locations and numbers of animals to be
vaccinated are selected. Are preventive vaccinations performed as
well -- and if affirmative, in which regions? - Mod.AS]

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Angela Huang and Rapporteur Dan
Silver for submitting a translation of a Chinese newswire announcing
this outbreak. - Mod. MPP]
