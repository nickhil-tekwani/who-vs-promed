Ongoing measles outbreak in Elche, Spain, 29 January to 9 March 2012.
------------------------------------------------------------
[Extracted from a Rapid communication by A Delgado de los Reyes et al.]

Introduction
-----------
On 29 January 2012, the first case of measles in Elche, Spain, since 2001 was notified through the epidemiological surveillance system of the Valencian Community. As of 9 Mar 2012 109 cases have been notified. The outbreak started in a neighbourhood where the vaccination coverage of the population is inadequate. This report highlights the need to vaccinate the susceptible population and also points to the importance of developing coordinated measures between public health centres and hospital preventive services.

Outbreak description
------------------
On 29 January 2012, a 13-year-old child was diagnosed with suspected measles at the emergency service of the Hospital General Universitario of Elche (HGUE), Spain. The infection was confirmed by serology (IgM positive) at the hospital. By 9 March, 109 cases in Elche have been confirmed through serology or an epidemiological link to confirmed cases. Of the 109 cases, 44 were notified from the same neighbourhood, Los Palmerales, where the index case lived. The mean age of the cases was 15 years (range: 25 days to 50 years). A total of 42 cases were adults aged from 20 to 50 years; 37 of the cases were children aged from 25 days to four years. Eight cases were aged under one year. Among the young adult cases, three were pregnant.

Of the 109 cases, 80 were diagnosed in the emergency services of the HGUE (66 cases) and the Hospital of Vinalopo in Elche, far from the HGUE, on the other side of the city (14 cases). Eleven of the 80 cases examined in the emergency services were admitted to inpatient care because of the following: impaired general condition (n=6), pneumonia (n=2), bronchitis (n=2) or otitis (n=1). Their ages ranged from 25 days to 17 years; the mean duration of hospitalisation was four days (range: two to seven days). Cases not diagnosed at hospital (n=29) were diagnosed at primary healthcare centres.

Of the 109 cases, 66 had not been vaccinated with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. A total of 28 cases had received the first dose of MMR vaccine; 2 cases had received both doses.

4 of the cases were healthcare workers in the HGUE: 2 were working in the emergency service; they were not vaccinated against measles, The MMR vaccination status of the other 2 was unknown: these cases had no direct link with the measles patients treated in the hospital.

Background
----------
Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can be prevented by a safe and effective vaccine, such as the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine [1]. It is recommended that the MMR vaccine be given in two doses. The vaccine was introduced into the vaccination schedule in Spain in 1981. In the Valencian Community – one of the autonomous communities of Spain -- the first dose is given at 15 months of age and the second at the age of five years [2]. As this infectious disease is preventable, a plan of action for measles elimination was implemented in Spain in 2001 [3]; the objective was expected to be achieved by 2005. In spite of the efforts made, however, there have been some measles outbreaks among the autonomous communities of Spain. The deadline for the elimination goal has therefore been postponed, in line with the plan of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe to eliminate measles and rubella by 2015 [4].

In 2010, 4 cases of measles were notified in the Valencian Community: 3 of them were laboratory confirmed, imported from France. The 4th case was confirmed by epidemiological link to the laboratory-confirmed cases [6]. In 2011, the number of notified cases increased to 236. Most were notified in the Valencia health department (120 cases); 30 cases were notified in Alicante.

The city of Elche, with a population of 230 354, is located 25 km from Alicante. Until the outbreak described here, the last case of measles in Elche was notified in 2001. In 2011, The MMR vaccination coverage was 96.4% for the first dose (measured between 12 and 24 months of age) and 90.4% for the second dose (measured between the ages of three and seven years) [7].

There are a number of groups with low vaccination coverage in Elche. These include people living in Los Palmerales, a neighbourhood near the HGUE. In this neighbourhood, people of Roma ethnicity [gypsies] are the main ethnic group, many of whom refuse vaccination due to cultural objections [8,9]. Other groups are also at risk: children younger than 15 months who have not received the first dose of MMR vaccine, because vaccination is not indicated; some children who have received only one dose and who have not developed a full immune response; and adults aged between 20 and 45 years who did not receive the MMR vaccine, because it was not included in the vaccination schedule when they were young, and who have not been infected by measles. Non-immunised young healthcare professionals in the hospitals are also a susceptible group [10].

Control measures
---------------
As there were reports of 8 measles outbreaks, with a total of 236 cases, elsewhere in the Valencian Community in 2011 [11], preventive measures have been taken in Elche since 11 Jan 2012. [For a detailed account refer to the original text via the source URL].

Discussion
-------------
Elche is experiencing an ongoing measles outbreak. Even though the MMR vaccination coverage is high in the city, measles has been easily spread in pockets of unvaccinated people. The virus has been transmitted to children under 15 months of age and to people with incomplete vaccination.

The high number of patients diagnosed with measles at the emergency service of the HGUE has been due to the proximity of the most affected areas, including Los Palmerales, to the hospital.

The high number of doses MMR vaccine given in Los Palmerales in mid-February, in addition to other actions taken in the city -- lowering the ages of the 1st and 2nd doses of MMR vaccine administration, as well as vaccinating children older than 5 years of age and young adults who had not received both doses – may have a positive effect in controlling the outbreak.

Coordinated work among the hospital and public health services has been an important factor in ensuring that the appropriate measures have been undertaken and that the status of the outbreak is reported, giving accurate and timely information.

Trust confirms measles case
------------------------
Central and Eastern Cheshire Primary Care Trust -- which covers Congleton, Crewe and Sandbach -- said it had seen one confirmed and 6 suspected cases of this potentially deadly virus [disease] in the past 2 weeks. Most of the infections are in children under 5 who had not been vaccinated at the optimum age of 13 months and babies who are too young to have the jab.

The North West Health Protection Agency has advised people with measles to avoid contact with others, particularly pregnant women, and to stay away from schools, nurseries and workplaces until at least 4 days after the onset of the rash.

The risk of measles for visitors to Ukraine, particularly during the UEFA European Football Championship, EURO 2012, and the potential spread of infection within the EU (Source: ECDC internal decision, 6 March 2012).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main conclusions and recommendations:

There is an ongoing measles outbreak in the Ukraine, currently concentrated in the western part of the country bordering on Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. In 2012 to date, over 5000 cases have been reported and this might be an underestimate of the true numbers. The epidemic is expected to accelerate and spread geographically during the peak transmission season for measles from February to June [2012].

Unvaccinated or non-immune persons visiting the Ukraine are at high risk of contracting measles. The increased concentration and movement of people during mass gathering events such as EURO 2012 will further increase this risk of transmission.

It is important that all EU citizens who have not already been fully vaccinated or have not previously had measles are vaccinated if they intend to visit the Ukraine. The vaccine should be administered according to their national recommendations prior to travel to the Ukraine.

Due to the overall low vaccine coverage in Ukraine, the risk of outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases, including rubella, mumps and diphtheria, and their subsequent spread to the EU is also considered elevated. Travellers should review their vaccination status accordingly. WHO Europe’s health travel recommendation for EURO 2012 is to seek medical advice 4-6 weeks prior to travelling.

The risk of contracting measles or other vaccine-preventable diseases is low for those who are fully vaccinated or immune due to past infection.

Viral disease: 5 measles cases reported
-----------------------------------
5 cases of measles were reported from Basti Sharaf Shah near Kahirpur Tamewali in Bahawalpur district during the last week. The affected children, all residents of Chak 24, were 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 years of age.

According to Mohammad Younis, a Health Department vaccinator, a report has been sent to the Health Department. He said so far only 5 cases were reported. He said that all the children in the area had been vaccinated at the proper time. He said the minimum age for measles vaccination was 9 months. He said 3 of the children had been in Cholistan area with their parents for some time, before which, he claimed, the children had been vaccinated.

District Health Officer Dr Saeed Asghar told The Express Tribune that a Health Department team had found out that the children had been treated by a quack, Mohammad Ashraf, in the recent past. He said they had found that Ashraf, who owned a medical store, had been illegally treating people. He said police were looking for the man.

Measles posing outbreak threat in parts of Khyber PakhtunKhwa
-------------------------------------------------------------
Deficiency [lack] of measles vaccine in Chitral and Malakand is posing a threat to control of the disease. The health department has declared the 2 areas as sensitive.

Deputy Director of Anti-Polio campaign Health department Dr Jan Baz Afridi said here on Monday [12 Mar 2012] that there are possibilities of outbreaks of measles in other parts of the province as well. However, children in Malakand and Chitral are the more vulnerable. He said that the health department is vaccinating children against the disease but deficiency [lack] of vaccine is creating problems. He urged the provincial government to take emergency measures and provide the vaccines so that the outbreak of the measles could be averted.

Outbreak of measles, the ‘mysterious disease’
--------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles in a remote village in Swat [District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province] has created panic among locals, who are adamant their children have become victims of a ‘mysterious disease’, despite assurances by doctors.

The outbreak was reported in Sar Sardarey village of Mangalwar Union Council (UC), from where dozens of children were brought to Saidu Teaching Hospital in neighbouring Mingora. A villager whose 5 children are being treated for the disease at the teaching hospital, claimed that his children’s condition was critical. “They keep vomiting and haven’t slept for days. God knows what this disease is and what will become of my children,” he said. The children’s symptoms include vomiting, high fever, fatigue and red spots and rashes, all of which are symptoms of measles, said a doctor at the Saidu Teaching Hospital.

Rejecting the rumours, he said: “The outbreak is of measles and not some mysterious disease”. In a majority of cases, the children were infected by measles because immunisation campaigns could not be carried out in the area due to militancy, the doctor said. The lack of awareness among parents is also [allowing] the disease to spread.

There is no hospital for the entire union council [an administrative division], which has a population of 22 000, the majority of whom live below the poverty line. Villagers complained that due to the lack of medical facilities, they had to walk for over 4 hours to reach the teaching hospital in Mingora, some 20 kilometres from the union council. “There is no road and we had to walk for hours in 4-5 feet of snow to reach the hospital,” said a villager, who had brought his nephew in for treatment.

Executive District Officer Health for Swat rejected the claim that medical facilities were not available in the villages. He said after cases of measles were reported, a number of medical teams equipped with medicines had been sent. A team of doctors from the World Health Organisation based in Islamabad is going to Swat to collect samples from the infected children to determine the nature of the disease.

500 Purdue students lack proof of measles vaccination
----------------------------------------------
Nearly 500 Purdue University students have provided no proof that they’ve been immunized against measles, a lapse school officials said could prevent them from enrolling for classes next semester.

Monday was Purdue’s deadline for new students enrolled on the West Lafayette campus to show proof of immunization against the highly contagious disease. As of Monday morning, 484 students had shown no proof, the Journal & Courier reported. The students who haven’t shown proof of immunization are considered non-compliant with the university’s immunization requirement and are not able to register for classes next semester, said Jim Westman, director of Purdue’s Student Health Center.

Although Indiana law requires students in state-funded institutions to be vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus and diphtheria, Westman said the requirement has attracted increased attention because of Indiana’s recent measles outbreak. “This is normal practice for us,” he said. “Certainly the importance has been underscored by the recent (measles) cases reported in the region.”

There have been 17 confirmed cases of measles in Indiana since early February [2012]. Cases of the disease, which causes flu-like symptoms plus a body rash, have occurred in Adams, Hamilton and Boone counties, the Indiana State Department of Health said.

Although students who haven’t shown proof of their immunization for measles can avoid Purdue’s penalty by bringing documentation to the center or by getting immunized now, waiting past the deadline could be risky. Students return next week from spring break.

Westman said that if a measles outbreak were to occur, students who have not met the immunization requirements will not be able to attend classes or participate in campus activities for at least a week. He said there is also a 30-day window before these students would be considered compliant in light of an outbreak. And Westman said it’s difficult to predict how many students will not meet their immunization requirements. “We are encouraging everybody to be compliant for their own health and safety,” he said.

Proper immunization documentation consists of any dated record from a school, physician’s office or parental “baby book.” New international students need to show proof of their immunization record as well as proof of being tested for tuberculosis prior to arriving to the United States, Westman said.

Possible measles exposure at Skamania Lodge
-------------------------------------------
Health officials are warning people who visited Skamania Lodge last week [25 Feb - 3 Mar 2012] that they may have been exposed to measles. Skamania County health officials learned Tuesday [3 Mar 2012] that someone who had visited the lodge recently was later diagnosed with the highly contagiou disease.

The person, who was traveling internationally, attended the Open Source Technology Summit at the lodge from 6 Mar to 9 mar 2012. The person began exhibiting symptoms of measles after returning home and was diagnosed positive for measles on 11 Mar 2012.

Measles is transmitted through small particles in the air so anyone who was at the lodge or attended the summit may have been exposed, health officials said. Those who have been vaccinated against measles, have had measles in the past or were born before 1 Jan 1957 are protected against measles.

People who were exposed can receive protective antibody treatment that can decrease the risk of serious illness if given by 15 Mar 2012.
