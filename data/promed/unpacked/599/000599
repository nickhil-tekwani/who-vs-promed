The 2008 West Nile Virus season is off to a very early start in
Arizona. Today [26 Mar 2008], the Maricopa County Department of
Public Health and Arizona Department of Health Services confirmed
that a Southeast Valley man in his 60's is Maricopa County's 1st
human case of West Nile Virus (WNV) this season. The man has been
released from a local Valley hospital and is currently recovering
from the virus [infection].

"We recognize that people's 1st question will be 'Why Maricopa
County?' The quick answer is that West Nile virus is now endemic in
environments across the nation including Arizona. Because we have a
warmer winter and earlier mosquito season than most, it makes sense
that we see cases earlier," said Dr Bob England, director of the
Maricopa County Department of Public Health.

"Our 1st confirmed case so early in the season could mean a busier
season than in past years," said John Power, director of Maricopa
County Department of Environmental Services. "This case also serves
as a reminder that it's that time again to take a look around your
homes and make sure there is no standing water where mosquitoes can breed."

"It's crucial that people help us prevent the spread of the virus by
reporting to our department any mosquito problems, green pools, or
standing water, and by working with their neighbors to get rid of
mosquito breeding areas on their property," added Power.

WNV is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito.
Approximately 20 percent of people infected with the virus will feel
flu-like symptoms occurring 3-15 days after the mosquito bite.

Symptoms may include fever, headache, body aches, nausea, vomiting,
swollen lymph glands, and skin rash on the chest, stomach, and back.
A small percentage of people who are infected with WNV will
experience severe symptoms, such as meningitis, encephalitis,
paralysis, and even death. People over the age of 50 are generally at
a higher risk for severe symptoms. If a person thinks he or she has
WNV symptoms, he or she should consult their health care provider.

Health officials say Valley residents should be aware that although
the majority of people who become infected with the virus will show
no symptoms at all, for a small percentage of people it can be
serious or even fatal.

Residents are encouraged to mosquito-proof their homes by taking the
following precautions:
- eliminate mosquito-breeding sites around your property. Drain
standing water in potted plants, tires, and other containers;
- install or repair window and door screens to keep mosquitoes out of the home;
- keep fountains, animal troughs, and swimming pools properly
operating and free from debris;

Eliminating stagnant water around your property will stop mosquitoes
from breeding. However, it is very important to avoid all mosquito
bites. Apply insect repellent as directed by the product's
directions, wear long clothing, and avoid outdoor activity after dusk
and before dawn when mosquitoes are most active.

In 2007, Maricopa County reported 68 confirmed West Nile virus cases,
and 4 deaths.

Maricopa County and the Arizona Department of Health Services
continue to have an enhanced surveillance program, which includes
sampling and testing of mosquitoes and dead birds, and evaluation of
equine neurological illnesses and human cases of meningitis and encephalitis.

[This is the 1st reported human case of WN virus infection in the USA
in 2008. WN virus transmission has recently been detected in southern
California (wild birds) and, now, Arizona. It would be prudent for
horse owners throughout the lower 48 states to have their animals
vaccinated as soon as possible, as the WN virus transmission season
is clearly getting underway.
