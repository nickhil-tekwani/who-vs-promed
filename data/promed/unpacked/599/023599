[These figures represent an increase of 9 birds confirmed positive
since Wed 19 Oct 2001; 1 in Halton Region, 5 in Peel Region, 1 in
Toronto Region, 1 in Windsor-Essex Region and 1 in York Region. The
dates of collection of the dead birds are not given, therefore the
state of progression of the outbreak remains unclear. It must be
assumed that the West Nile virus season is drawing to a close; some
authorities further south (e.g., the Connecticut Department of Health)
have already terminated bird surveillance. - Mod.CP
