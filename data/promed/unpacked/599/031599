MAD PIG DISEASE?

Mad pig disease?
The story below just came over the wire. I have it, and others relating to
pigs, posted at www.mad-cow.org/pigs_people.html. Tomorrow I should be
finished OCR-ing a 7 page fax that provides FOIA information from USDA
obtained by the groups holding the press conference that apparently
represents the original veterinary observations.
I also ran and posted molecular sequence alignments on pig prion compared
to human, sheep and cow: they are of course all very similar, except in
transitional loop domains.
Also I posted a long work-in-progress review of the species "barrier," a
loaded term that should be replaced by the scientifically neutral term
"species transmission coeficient," at www.mad-cow.org/species_barrier.html.
Basically there is no known motivation at this time for assuming that
intra-species transmission is favored over inter-species transmission. I
predict that for some combinations, the inter-species situation will
unfortunately be worse.

Veterinarians and consumer organizations urged the US Agriculture Department
to determine quickly if American pork products might be tainted by a
"mad-pig disease". A leader of the coalition (Devine) said Thursday [however
that] there is no evidence to support a conclusion that U.S. hogs are
contaminated with anything similar to the mad-cow disease that has affected
British cattle.
However, Thomas J. Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection
Service, said that while the agency is ready to continue and expand its work
on cattle to prevent an outbreak of mad-cow disease in the United States, it
has no evidence pigs might also be capable of being infected. Billy noted
that while some 250,000 cows were affected in England they have not had a
single case in pigs. And he said that when pigs were exposed to infected
animal tissue they did not develop the disease. [Those cogniscant of BSE
will remember that British pig feed containing bovine MBM has caused
outbreaks of BSE when left-over and excess feed was fed to cattle. The same
feed caused no problems in pigs. MHJ]
The coalition's concern arose from a 1979 Agriculture Department study of
hogs in a New York slaughterhouse that showed symptoms of disorders of the
central nervous system. Because the animals came from several sources and
the plant did not routinely deal with diseased animals, the FSIS
veterinarian believed the condition might affect
animals being slaughtered nationwide.[??!!] There was no follow-up. Some of
those involved with the study reviewed the evidence and sent photographs of
the brains of animals to experts who saw similarities to mad-cow disease but
reached no concrete conclusions. None of the veterinarians involved in the
1979 study were present at the news conference. Nor did any sign the letter
to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
"We are seeking answers to very serious public health questions," Devine
said. "The credibility of the present food safety (inspection system) is at
stake." The coalition said USDA should upgrade the inspection of animals
before they are slaughtered to pinpoint any that may have diseases of the
central nervous system.
[However a porcine TSE has yet to be identified and the sky is not falling.
As ever, many thanks to Tom for passing this story to us and providing
backup information sources. MHJ]
