Since the last update on 8 Jun 2018, 88 more ill people have been reported. The most recent illness began on 21 Jun 2018.

- CDC and multiple states are investigating several multistate outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections linked to contact with live poultry in backyard flocks.

- People can get sick with _Salmonella_ infections from touching live poultry or their environment. These birds can be carrying _Salmonella_ bacteria but appear healthy and clean and show no signs of illness.

- Several different types of _Salmonella_ bacteria have made people sick in this outbreak: _Salmonella_ Seftenberg, _Salmonella_ Montevideo, _Salmonella_ Infantis, _Salmonella_ Enteritidis, _Salmonella_ Indiana, and _Salmonella_ Litchfield.

- As of 13 Jul 2018, 212 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 44 states.

- Illnesses started from 15 Feb 2018 to 21 Jun 2018.

- 34 ill people have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

- 26% of ill people are children younger than 5 years.

- Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory findings link these outbreaks to contact with live poultry, such as chicks and ducklings, which come from multiple hatcheries.

- In interviews, 100 (72%) of 138 ill people with information available reported contact with chicks or ducklings in the week before their illness started.

- People reported obtaining chicks and ducklings from several sources, including feed supply stores, websites, hatcheries, and from relatives.

- WGS analysis to identify antimicrobial resistance was performed for 118 isolates from ill people in this outbreak. 22 isolates from ill people contained genes expected to cause resistance or decreased susceptibility to all or some of the following antimicrobials: ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, and fosfomycin. 96 isolates did not identify predicted resistance. Testing of 5 outbreak isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results. Some infections may be difficult to treat with commonly recommended antibiotics and may require another kind of antimicrobial.

- This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.
