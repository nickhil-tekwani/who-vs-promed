If the bird flu virus arrives in the United States on the wings of
migrating wildfowl, pet owners may need to take special precautions
to protect their household members -- both human and animal.
No case has been reported anywhere in the world of a human being
infected by a cat or dog, but researchers are calling for heightened
study of the question before a potentially deadly avian flu virus
extends its global reach.
Health authorities are looking at pets because they often live a dual
life -- roaming outdoors, chasing birds and then returning home to
nuzzle and play with people. Cats have caught the H5N1 virus by
eating infected birds, though the reported cases are rare. So far,
most experts think the risk is very low that pets could pass the
disease to humans. But they can't say for sure.
"Cats can serve as an intermediary to move the virus from essentially
a wild bird environment into people's houses,'' said Walter Boyce at
the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. [I think "might" would be
more accurate at our present state of knowledge on this virus and its
epidemiology. - Mod.MHJ]
In countries where the virus has arrived, no human infections have
been linked to the cats that sickened or died of the disease. At this
point, U.S. and world health authorities say it's unlikely that cats
will infect people. "We don't believe that cats pose a risk to humans
at this time,'' said Ben Sun, a public health veterinarian with the
California Department of Health Services. "But we have so little
information that we can't make a confident recommendation that they
do not pose any risk.''

[This is a very long article and if anyone is interested, I suggest
that they go to the full report on this hypothetical risk. It is
clear that the UC Davis faculty found a ready listener in Ms Tansey
and it is now summertime. If this risk were real, we would have had
reports (plural) from Europe of infected domestic cats. Serious
hunting cats prefer to live outdoors -- we had one such and could
barely entice her in for her evening feed. Amateur hunters will play
with the fluttering sick at which time there will have been positive
local diagnostic reports and common-sense confinement of felines to
indoor quarters would be in effect. I suspect that at that time
merely collecting up dead birds around one's house and bagging them
would present a more serious risk. - Mod.MHJ]
