New bird flu outbreaks in Pakistan
-----------------------------------
After finding the H5N1 bird flu virus in small flocks of chickens and
peacocks, Pakistan reports its 1st 2 cases in almost a year, said officials.
Food, Agriculture and Livestock Ministry spokesman, Mohammad Afzal,
said all the chickens in a flock of 40 birds had died after the
deadly virus was detected in Rawalpindi, near Islamabad. "The virus
was found in domestic poultry in Rawalpindi, where 18 birds died and
tests confirmed they were infected with H5N1 virus; the rest of the
birds were then slaughtered," he told AFP. [See [3] below. - Mod.MHJ]
Several major chicken farms are located in the area, however, it is
believed to be an isolated case.
Afzal said the virus had also been detected in a flock of peacocks in
Mansehra in North-West Frontier Province. A total of 18 birds died
and the rest were slaughtered. [See [2] below. - Mod.MHJ]. Afzal
added: "There is no case of human infection."
The virus has not yet been found in commercial poultry following the
latest outbreak and the government had provided farmers with enough
vaccine to protect their birds. Pakistan produces 4.5 million
chickens annually, while peacocks are often kept for decorative
purposes and as a good luck charm to bring their owners wealth.

Bird Flu in pet birds confirmed in Pindi, Mansera
---------------------------------------------------
The presence of bird flu in pet birds has been confirmed in a few
areas of Rawalpindi and Mansera .
According to details, 18 pet birds have been killed in the area of
Saddar, Rawalpindi, and some in Mansera due to the presence of the
H5N1 strain. It has been said that a man in the area of Rawalpindi
Saddar, has kept several birds at his house, and that 18 died due to
the avian [flu] virus. On the other hand, the Ministry of Food,
Agriculture and Livestock [Minfal] has confirmed the cases of bird
flu in pet birds underlining that no such cases have occurred from
any poultry farms where there are hundreds of hens .
Meanwhile, since the occurrence of bird flu in February 2006 in
Pakistan, Minfal in collaboration with provincial livestock
departments and the Pakistan Poultry Association, has continued
surveillance for the disease throughout the country. The surveillance
included 64 000 samples of blood, tracheal swabs, and tissues from
the dead and morbid birds.
In commercial poultry, vaccination against H5N1 is being carried out
at large scale, which has given good results. Since the 3 Jul 2006
[outbreak, no further outbreaks or cases of avian influenza (H5N1)
have been reported.]

H5N1 Bird Flu strain found in Pakistan
---------------------------------------
Pakistani scientists have found the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in
a small flock of chickens near Islamabad, almost a year after the
virus was found in 2 poultry flocks.
Mohammad Afzal, Livestock Commissioner at the Ministry of
Agriculture, said all the chickens in the flock of about 40 birds at
a house in Rawalpindi, a city adjoining Islamabad, had died or been
culled. "They tested positive for the H5N1 strain," Afzal told media.
"It has been contained and there is no danger of the spread of this
virus because there are no poultry farms near this house."

PMA concerned over bird flu reports
-------------------------------------------
Showing grave concern over the reported presence of bird flu in a
cottage poultry farm in Rawalpindi, the Pakistan Medical Association
(PMA) Karachi Chapter on Tuesday [6 Feb 2007] expressed its fear that
the lack of hygiene standards in [the country's] poultry sector might
spread the deadly disease in the country. PMA Karachi General
Secretary Dr. Qaiser Sajjad told PPI [Pakistan Press International]
that according to Livestock Commissioner at the Ministry of
Agriculture, Muhammad Afzal, all the chickens in the flock of about
40 birds at a house in Rawalpindi had died or been culled as a result
of H5N1. He said that Pakistan's 1st reported cases of H5N1 bird flu
were found in chickens in February last year [2006] in the NWFP
[North-West Frontier Province], where about 40 000 chickens were culled.
He regretted that almost the whole poultry framing sector, as well as
shops selling chicken, were being run on unhygienic lines and there
was no check and balance to impose proper hygienic and precautionary
measures to ensure safety of poultry farm and chicken shop workers
and consumers, especially housewives who directly touch raw chicken
and eggs during cooking.
Dr. Sajjad said that former City Nazim of Karachi Niamatullah Khan
during his tenure had formed an inquiry committee comprising medical
experts, poultry associations, chicken sellers bodies and other
stakeholders to visit poultry farms as well as chicken selling
outlets in the city to prepare a report about precautionary and
hygienic methods being adopted by this sector. He said that the
committee members extensively visited poultry farms, poultry markets,
and chicken shops in various parts of the city and submitted a report
to Niamatullah Khan in which they expressed grave concern over the
lack of precautionary measures and hygienic standards in the poultry sector.
Dr. Sajjad said workers in poultry farms were unaware of the dangers
of bird flu and they lacked proper training to handle sick and dead
birds, adding that in poultry farms there were no arrangements to
keep healthy birds away from the sick ones. He said that vehicles
transporting eggs and poultry from poultry farms to markets and shops
were highly contaminated with bird saliva and excrements, and that
these vehicles were rarely washed. In addition, transportation of
birds and eggs in these dirty vehicles was a grave threat of
spreading poultry diseases, including bird flu.
