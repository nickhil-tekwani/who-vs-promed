Texas Man Mysteriously Gets Rare Illness
-------------------------------------------
State health officials are looking into how a Panhandle [the
northernmost part of Texas] man contracted a rare bacterial disease
that typically is tied to the livestock industry. The Moore County
man does not work around livestock or in a laboratory or
slaughterhouse and is not a veterinarian, circumstances normally
associated with getting Q fever, said Dr. James Alexander, a vet with
the Department of State Health Services in Canyon. It's possible the
man might have caught the disease, which can spread from animals to
humans, from contaminated soil, Alexander said.

The patient told officials he has a friend with livestock but that he
had no contact with the animals, Alexander said.

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary carriers of the bacteria
[that cause Q fever], known as _Coxiella burnetii_, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. It's extremely
rare for the disease to spread from human to human, said Dr. Steven
Berk, regional dean for Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center
School of Medicine and an expert on infectious diseases. Common
symptoms resemble a serious case of the flu. A high fever comes on
suddenly, and those who get infected experience chills and sweating,
a general feeling of sickness and loss of appetite. Blood tests are
used to test for Q fever, and it responds to antibiotics. Patients
usually recover promptly when treatment is started without delay.

NOTE: The Texas Department of Health (TDH) has merged with other
agencies and is now part of the new Department of State Health
Services (DSHS), resulting in the following e-mail address format

A person was diagnosed with Q-fever in mid-May 2005. His physician
first thought he had brucellosis, due to the patient having night
sweats. However, the initial serology indicated Q-fever. His MD
obtained a 2nd sample and the Texas Department of State Health
Services laboratory also obtained high Phase II IgM antibody levels.
The person has responded well to doxycycline and appears to have
recovered. His source of exposure remains unknown at present. The
only animal contact reported is a pet dog. The person had recently
applied a commercial compost product to his garden. The origin of
the compost has not yet been determined. The individual reported that
he came out from his work place (non-agricultural) one evening and
the area was full of dust, presumably from one or more cattle
feedlots in the area.

The investigation is ongoing and may involve the submission of
compost material for analysis to determine if _Coxiella_ DNA is
present. Distances from feedlots will also be determined.

[Jim's investigation of this case is ongoing, and we are promised
information as he receives it and can share it. Stay tuned! And
thanks to Jim for being willing to share his information with us.
Presumably the public knowledge of this case will trigger the sharing
of information of other recent cases, human and livestock, in Texas
and adjoining states, including Mexico. - Mod.MHJ]
