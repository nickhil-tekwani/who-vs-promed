PAHO regional update
--------------------
The information contained within this update is obtained from data
provided by Ministries of Health of Member States and National
Influenza Centers through reports sent to Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) or updates on their web pages.

Weekly summary
--------------
- In the Southern Cone, RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] was the
predominant virus circulating; however, influenza B and influenza
A/H3 virus have also been detected.

- In the Andean sub-region, Peru reported an increasing trend in
acute respiratory disease. Bolivia reported an increase of pandemic
influenza A H1N1 cases in EW 28-32. [11 Jul - 14 Aug 2010]

- Circulation of respiratory viruses was variable in Central America.
Influenza A/H3 virus was predominant in Honduras and Panama.
Influenza B was predominant in Guatemala and Nicaragua.

- The Caribbean reported low influenza activity, but increased
circulation of influenza A/H3 virus in some countries (CAREC
[Caribbean Epidemiology Centre], Dominican Republic).

- In North America, influenza activity remained low; a mix of
influenza B and influenza A/H3 virus (United States) was reported.

I - Influenza surveillance
--------------------------
South America - Southern Cone
-----------------------------
In Chile, in epidemiological week (EW) 32 [8-14 Aug 2010],
nationally, influenza-like illness (ILI) activity increased, reaching
the alert zone of the endemic channel. At the regional level, the
highest rates of ILI activity were in the regions of Los Lagos and
Tarapaca. The proportion of emergency services consultations for
respiratory illness, out of the total number of consultations,
increased in EW 32 [8-14 Aug 2010], with the most marked increase in children.

Viral circulation: the predominant respiratory virus in Argentina and
Chile is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In EW 32 [8-14 Aug
2010] in Chile, 64 percent of positive specimens were RSV, which is
decreasing compared to the previous week (73 percent) and 7.7 percent
were pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus. In Chile, influenza B, and
seasonal influenza A/H3 were also identified.

South America - Andean
----------------------
Viral circulation: Bolivia reported an increase in the number of
pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 cases during last 3 EW; circulation of
influenza B during the year 2010 has also been reported. Colombia
continues to report a predominance of pandemic influenza and some
seasonal influenza A/H3 activity.

Central America
---------------
Viral circulation: in Guatemala, in the last 6 weeks, influenza type
B has been the predominant influenza virus, and overall levels of
respiratory virus activity have been low. In Honduras, in EWs 26-29
[27 Jun-24 Jul 2010], influenza A/H3 was the predominant virus
circulating. In Nicaragua, in the last 6 weeks, influenza type B has
been the predominant virus circulating, and overall levels of
respiratory virus activity have decreased since EW 21 [23-29 May
2010]. In Panama, influenza A/H3 has been the predominant virus
circulating since EW 23.

Caribbean
---------
CAREC [CAREC reporting countries include Barbados, Dominica, Jamaica,
St Vincent's and the Grenadines, St Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago],
since EW 23 [6-12 Jun 2010], has reported an overall decreasing trend
in the proportion of admissions for SARI [severe acute respiratory
illness] out of the total hospitalizations.

Viral circulation: CAREC reported, in EW 19-29 [9 May-24 Jul 2010],
the predominant circulation of influenza type B. In EW 32 [8-14 Aug
2010], however, a large number of pandemic influenza A cases were
reported. In the Dominican Republic, since EW 27 [4-10 Jul 2010], in
addition to parainfluenza, adenovirus, influenza A/H3 has been
detected in increasing numbers. In Jamaica, sporadic detection of
adenovirus and influenza type B has been reported since EW 15 [11-17
Apr 2010]. [CAREC reporting countries include Barbados, Dominica,
Jamaica, St Vincent's and the Grenadines, St Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago]

North America
-------------
In Canada, overall influenza activity has remained low since the
beginning of 2010. In EW 31 [1-7 Aug 2010] and 32 [8-14 Aug 2010], no
influenza outbreaks were reported and the ILI consultation rate
remained low and within what is expected for this time of year. In
the United States in EW 32 [8-14 Aug 2010], the proportion of
outpatient consultations for ILI continued to remain below the
national baseline. All the sub-national surveillance regions reported
the proportion of ILI to be below their region-specific baselines.
The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza was
below the epidemic threshold. No influenza-associated pediatric
deaths were reported this week.

Viral circulation: in Canada, detection of influenza has been low
since the beginning of 2010. Detection of adenovirus has remained
higher than the other viruses. In the United States, overall
detection of influenza has been very low since EW 18 [2-8 May 2010],
and a mix of influenza type B, influenza A/H3, and influenza
A/pandemic have been reported.
