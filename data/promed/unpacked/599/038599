Democratic Republic of Congo: "classic" Ebola in a country experiencing its 7th outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ebola at 6 months
-----------------
Immediately after the 1st case of Ebola virus disease in Guinea was announced, on [23 Mar 2014], WHO activated its network of specialized biosafety level 4 laboratories that are equipped and staffed to safely work with the world's most hazardous pathogens. The Ebola virus is among them. Those labs would play a key role in characterizing and differentiating the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC.

On [24 Aug 2014], WHO was notified of the country's 1st confirmed case and subsequent outbreak initially located in the extremely remote Jeera County in the country's Equateur Province. That county is located some 1200 kilometres [746 mi] from the capital city, Kinshasa. No paved roads connect the 2 areas. The outbreak is currently concentrated in the Boende district of the Province.

Traditional beginning
---------------------
The outbreak, which began in the traditional way, with handling of infected bushmeat, was initially small: 24 suspected cases, with 13 deaths, largely among health workers who attended the index case. This was a young pregnant woman, married to a hunter, who is thought to have fallen ill on [26 Jul 2014], when symptoms of fever, diarrhoea, and bleeding developed. She died of Ebola virus disease on [11 Aug 2014].

The announcement of those 1st cases immediately ignited worries that the virus might have spread from west to central Africa. WHO could put those worries to rest on [2 Sep 2014], when its collaborating laboratory in Gabon, the Centre International de Recherches Medicales, released full sequencing data.

This was indeed Ebola Zaire, as in West Africa, but as the lab report noted, "the virus from Boende district is definitely not derived from the variant currently circulating in West Africa." The DRC virus showed 99 percent homology with a virus from the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, DRC.

DRC's 7th Ebola outbreak
------------------------
The current outbreak is the country's 7th since the Ebola Zaire virus emerged there in 1976, in an area bordered by the Ebola River. A nearly simultaneous outbreak that same year emerged in South Sudan (then Sudan), but involved a different Ebola virus species -- the Sudan species.

By [16 Sep 2014], the outbreak had grown to more than 70 cases, with 40 deaths. One of the biggest challenges in investigating and containing the outbreak is the remoteness of the affected area. One of the greatest assets is the high level of commitment and dedication shown by the government, from its President to its Minister of Health, Dr Felix Kabange Numbi.

At the start of the outbreak, the Minister of Health travelled the difficult route from Kinshasa to the remote Boende district to conduct a 1st-hand investigation in a situation where the only communication is by satellite phones, roads are rare, and transportation for case detection and contact tracing relies on canoes, motorcycles provided by WHO, bicycles, and some 4-wheel drive vehicles.

Rising to logistical challenges
-------------------------------
Investigation and response efforts need to be understood in the context of some difficult challenges that go beyond the area's remote location. Cases are occurring in densely forested communities that are home to around 54 000 people. The weather is extremely hot and humid, punctuated by frequent rains. Reaching safe water supplies requires a 12-kilometre [7.5 mi] journey through forests with no roads. "Lodging facilities" for technical staff means camping on the ground.

For the initial investigation and containments efforts, the Ministry of Health was supported by a WHO team that included the head of WHO's DRC office, Dr Joseph Cabore, and Dr Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, an experienced outbreak responder who helped DRC contain its 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit. Apart from these staff, the response team included 10 epidemiologists, 2 logisticians, several clinicians from Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and -- especially important -- 4 psychologists.

A dedicated helicopter was provided by the United Nations, but the densely forested area first had to be cleared to create landing space. The World Food Programme is on the ground, rapidly improving the water and food situation. WHO deployed an IT specialist; communications have improved. Even a WHO videographer, in the area to record images, ended up helping in the construction of the area's 1st 12-bed treatment facility. A fully functional mobile laboratory has been installed.

The number of cases and deaths is growing at a rate similar to that seen during other recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in this country. No predictions about its evolution or eventual control can be made at this point.

[2] UN-OCHA update

Update on Ebola virus disease in DRC, no 12, 21 Sep 2014
--------------------------------------------------------
[Several tables and maps accompany this report and are available through the source URL above. A total of 68 cases are reported as of 21 Sep 2014 at 6 PM. - Mod.LM]

Coordination/key developments
-----------------------------
- *4 suspected cases were negative after laboratory tests on 2 different samples and therefore discharged and declared "non-case", bringing down to 68 the total number of cases on [18 Sep 2014] (see table [at source URL] for details) of which 41 deaths; an overall lethality rate of slightly over 60 percent.

- **8 health personnel have died of Ebola virus disease (EVD) since the outbreak of the epidemic.

- The centrifuge of the mobile laboratory in Lokolia has broken down, making it impossible to carry out on-site laboratory tests in Lokolia. A centrifuge parts is expected from the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa.

- INRB is facing the shortage of reagents and inputs for both its laboratory in Kinshasa and the mobile laboratory in Lokolia. A request for reagents and laboratory inputs has been made to the DRC Ministry of Health for an urgent solution.

- The death rate of animals and poultry continues to be very high in the area affected by the EVD, requiring thorough veterinary investigations.

- According to the National Coordination Committee (NCC), the overall analysis of the epidemiological situation suggests that Ebola outbreak declared on [24 Aug 2014] in the area of Djera is under control.

- The Food Security Cluster and the Ministry of Social Affairs, Humanitarian Action and National Solidarity will distribute over 1000 tons of food, including 4.9 tons to members of the response team, the indoor patients, and to the family members of people affected by the EVD. This distribution is facing important logistical constraints related to poor road conditions in the area of Djera.

- 2 hotline numbers have been set up to allow the population to get information on the disease and ongoing efforts: 081 08 000 20 and 099 99 710 05. An additional hotline for information on the prevention of the EVD is available using Tigo: 119.

[These reports appear to represent stabilization of the situation in the remote Boende district of DRC, with approximately 70 confirmed cases, though clearly not a full incubation period has passed since the most recent cases.

The reports also demonstrate the high degree of logistical difficulties in managing outbreaks in areas where infrastructure is lacking.

While indications that this outbreak is behaving in ways similar to prior Ebola virus disease outbreaks in DRC, the WHO report concludes, wisely, that "no predictions about its evolution or eventual control can be made at this point."
