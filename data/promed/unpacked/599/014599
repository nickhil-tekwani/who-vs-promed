An outbreak of trichinellosis was detected in Huesca [Autonomous
Community of Aragon], affecting 5 men and one woman, all residents of
Huesca and aged between 52 and 58 years, who ate sausages from the
meat of a wild boar that one of them had hunted and which was not
subjected to the required veterinary control.

The 6 people began feeling ill on 5 Feb 2011. They consulted the San
Jorge de Huesca hospital and were not admitted at first, but their
condition deteriorated, and they were readmitted days later. One of
them, a 54-year-old man, died yesterday [1 Mar 2011].

According to Aragon public health officials, the brother of the
deceased remains in serious but stable condition in the intensive care
unit; the 3 other men are in stable condition, and the woman has been
released.

Public health officials have indicated that the source of the
outbreak was the wild boar meat. The rest of the meat was identified
and taken for testing and to prevent further cases of the disease.

The main reservoirs of the trichinellosis parasite are domestic
animals such as pigs or wild animals such as wild boars or foxes.
Transmission of the disease occurs through consumption of raw or
insufficiently cooked meat or meat products infected with the larvae
of the _Trichinella_ worm.

[This outbreak underlines that trichinellae are found in wild animals
also in western Europe. As is the case here, acute trichinellosis may
be life-threatening.

Sausage is a particularly common source of human infection because
the meat is often not heated to a high enough temperature to kill the
parasite when smoked. - Mod.EP]
