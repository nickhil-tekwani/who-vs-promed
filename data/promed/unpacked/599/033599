The wild duck found to be infected with bird flu in Russia's Altai Republic
in Siberia is the only case found in the republic, a local official said.
The bird flu virus was identified by an inter-regional veterinary
laboratory in the city of Novosibirsk in Siberia while it was examining a
wild duck shot near the village of Verkh-Karaguzh (Upper Karaguzh) in the
Altai republic.
The republic is now the 8th Russian region in which the virus has been
identified.
Experts think the virus was brought into the country by migratory birds. It
has affected domestic poultry at small private farms in 7 eastern regions,
including the Altai Territory, Omsk, Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Kurgan and
Chelyabinsk, as well as in Kalmykia, northwest of the Caspian Sea.
A local committee on emergency situations decided Wednesday [24 Aug 2005]
to establish an emergency staff to coordinate measures to prevent the virus
from spreading.

[Further details on the virus, reportedly detected in a wild (healthy?)
duck, will be useful. The Altai Republic is situated at the very centre of
Asia at the junction of the Siberian taiga, steppes of Kazakhstan, and
semi-deserts of Mongolia, bordering Mongolia (SE), China (S), Kazakhstan
(S/SW), and Russian Siberia (Kemerovo, Khakassia, and Tuva) on the north.
Area 92 600 sq.km (35 800 sq mi); population (2002) 202 947].

The bird flu epidemic in Russia has been contained, Agriculture Minister
Alexei Gordeyev told a Moscow press conference Wednesday [24 Aug 2005].
Gordeyev said the bird flu virus, H5N1, had been brought into the country
by migratory birds and that the outbreak had affected domestic poultry at
small private farms in 6 eastern regions bordering Kazakhstan (Altai, Omsk,
Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Kurgan, and Chelyabinsk), as well as in Kalmykia,
northwest of the Caspian Sea.
The main challenge now is to prevent the virus from spreading to commercial
poultry farms, Gordeyev said. He called on the global community to join
hands against the pathogenic virus.

[The data from Kalmykia, a province in SE European Russia on the Caspian
Sea, are ambiguous. In earlier reports it was stated that the presence of
HPAI there was not confirmed; however, according to the current statement
of the Russian minister of agriculture and the press release cited by
EpiNorth, Kalmykia was affected. This issue is expected to be clarified in
an official update by the Russian veterinary services. - Mod.AS].
