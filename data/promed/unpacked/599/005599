About 20 farms in northern Indiana are reporting signs of a virus in their chickens called egg drop syndrome. "It's highly unusual and there's still a lot not known about it," says Denise Derrer Spears with the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. She says it's not harmful to humans and it's not fatal to the chickens. But, it does cause hens to lay eggs with extremely thin shells or no shell at all. "Obviously when the egg does not have a stable shell, it doesn't have any value as a table egg, so you have problems with shipping product...from the flocks that have this issue," according to Spears.

So far, this virus has been seen only on farms in the northern part of the state. "This typically is a bigger problem for birds laying brown eggs, so those darker-colored birds, but it's been pretty isolated so far." Spears adds this virus has nothing to do with avian influenza, which has affected 6 turkey farms in southern Indiana.

What causes the egg drop syndrome virus in chickens isn't clear. "There is still a lot to be learned about it. [It's an] uncommon disease and there's not a lot known about it," according to Spears. "There's not been a lot of research done on it because it's just not common. There are some wild birds that can carry it in other species, so we haven't really identified the exact source of where this came from."

Spears says she wants chicken farmers and those with smaller flocks to be aware of the virus so it does not spread any further. She suggests not wearing everyday street clothes and shoes when tending to chickens, wearing special shoes or use boot covers, washing your hands after handling chickens, cleaning equipment often and not visiting other farms where there are other birds.

Indiana is the 2nd-largest producer of eggs in the United States with over 9 billion eggs produced a year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Egg drop syndrome (EDS) virus is caused by duck adenovirus A and was first described in laying hens in 1976. The adenovirus is a member of the genus _Atadenovirus_ and family _Adenoviridae_.

Epidemiology
------------
"Egg drop syndrome affects chickens and quail. Ducks and geese seem to be natural hosts of the virus. The virus is transmitted vertically by eggs. Droppings also contain the virus that can be horizontally transmitted by the oral route. Infected wild birds can be a contamination source for poultry (Adair and Smyth, 2008).

Clinical signs in layers: egg production and quality
------------------------------------------------
"The disease is characterized by drops in egg production and increased incidence of abnormal eggs. Birds remain generally healthy. Egg production is usually reduced by from 10% to 40%. The fall in production can be rapid, and the drop in egg production usually lasts from 4 to 10 weeks (McFerran and Smyth, 2000). The first sign is loss of shell pigments. This loss of color is followed by thin, soft, rough and granular shell and shell-less eggs. Higashihara and coworkers observed few clinical signs except production of abnormal eggs in hens infected orally with EDS virus (Higashihara et al, 1987). Egg production was about 20% lower and aberrant eggs were shell-less, soft-shelled, thin shelled and pale colored. In this study, internal quality was not altered. In EDS 76 field cases reported by Van Eck, watery and thin albumen was reported (Van Eck et al, 1976)."

"The main route of transmission is through contaminated eggs. Droppings also contain virus, and contaminated fomites such as crates or trucks can spread virus. The virus is also transmitted by needles used for vaccinations. At one time this virus was spread by the contamination of Marek's disease vaccine, which was produced in duck embryo fibroblasts. Breeding flocks were infected and the virus was spread widely through fertile eggs. Because infection usually remained latent until birds reached sexual maturity and because the virus is transmitted vertically in eggs, the detection of this source of contagion was very difficult. Sporadic outbreaks have also been traced to contact of chickens with domestic ducks or geese, and to water contaminated with wildfowl droppings.

"This disease has been eradicated from primary breeder flocks in most countries. Its entry into layer flocks is further managed by: (1) preventing contact with other birds, especially waterfowl; (2) disinfecting all equipment regularly; (3) chlorination of water. Inactivated vaccines are available for use in chickens before they begin laying eggs, but they only reduce, rather than eliminate, virus transmission." - Mod.TG
