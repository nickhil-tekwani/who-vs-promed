A Thai woman has tested positive for avian influenza, senior health
officials said on Mon 31 Oct 2005, making her the 20th person to have
caught the deadly disease since it hit the country 2 years ago.
"A 50-year-old woman is confirmed to have [contracted avian
influenza] after all 3 lab tests showed positive results," Paijit
Warachit, Head of the Department of Medical Sciences, told Reuters.
"Her condition is improving and I believe she will be well soon," Paijit said.
13 Thais have died of bird flu since the H5N1 virus struck in late
2003, and the 50-year-old woman was the 3rd person to have
[contracted avian influenza] in Thailand this year. She was admitted
to a Bangkok hospital on Saturday [29 Oct 2005] after telling her
doctor she had been helping her husband clean up a farm where chicken
were culled after laboratory tests showed they had the virus, another
official said.
"We believe she would have caught it from fresh chicken droppings
while she was sweeping," Disease Control Department chief Thawat
Suntrajarn said. The farm was in Nonthaburi, on the outskirts of
Bangkok and one of 6 provinces hit by a fresh rash of bird flu
outbreaks this year, officials said. Her husband, still looking
healthy, was being quarantined while awaiting test results, Thawat said.
Earlier in October 2005, a Thai man died of the disease after he
slaughtered an infected chicken and ate it. His son also caught the
disease but is now healthy after spending a few days in hospital.

Thailand: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 37
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed an additional
case of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. The patient, a
50-year-old woman from Bangkok, developed symptoms on 26 Oct 2005 and
was hospitalized on 29 Oct. She remains hospitalized in satisfactory condition.
On 23 Oct, the patient visited her husband in Nonthaburi Province,
north of Bangkok, where backyard chickens had begun to die a few days
earlier. Field investigations have not found any indications of
respiratory illness in close contacts of the patient.
The woman is the 3rd confirmed case reported in Thailand in the past
month. These cases coincide with a recurrence of confirmed H5
outbreaks in poultry in 6 provinces, most of which are in the central
part of the country, and point to the need to remain on high alert
for the occurrence of human cases in all countries experiencing
outbreaks in poultry.
Since the start of the outbreaks in Asia, Thailand has confirmed 20
cases, of which 13 have been fatal.
