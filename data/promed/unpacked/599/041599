State Coordinator of Leprosy Control Unit, Alhaji Ibrahim Abubakar, has said 254 leprosy cases have been found in Kebbi State in this year's [2012] 1st quarter.

He made this known during a one-day sensitization workshop organized by Kebbi State Office of The Leprosy Mission In Nigeria on how the media can reduce leprosy stigma and discrimination to people affected with leprosy in Birnin-Kebbi.

The coordinator said from 2005 to 2011 a total of 1882 people were found to have contracted the disease with Kalgo local government area having the highest cases totaling to 35 and promised to ensure reduction of the disease by 35 percent by 2015.

[Before 1998, Nigeria was one of the most leprosy endemic countries in the world, with prevalence rates ranging from 16 to 390 per 10 000 (http://www.leprahealthinaction.org/lr/Mar05/Lep065_076.pdf). Following introduction of multidrug therapy for leprosy in 1985, Nigeria attained the WHO elimination target of less than 1 case per 10 000 population at the national level by end of 1998 (http://www.leprahealthinaction.org/lr/Mar05/Lep065_076.pdf). The registered prevalence of leprosy at the end of the 1st quarter of 2011 was 4531 cases, or a prevalence rate of 0.27 per 10 000 (http://www.who.int/wer/2011/wer8636.pdf).

Drugs used to treat leprosy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine) are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995 (see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml). Patients are no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment regimen. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months.

Although the number of new cases of leprosy detected in Nigeria annually decreased from 5276 in 2004 to 3913 in 2010, Nigeria remains one of 17 countries reporting 1000 or more new cases of leprosy during 2010; these 17 countries account for 95 percent of the new cases detected worldwide during 2010 (http://www.who.int/wer/2011/wer8636.pdf).

Birnin Kebbi, a city located in northwestern Nigeria is the capital city of Kebbi State with an estimated population of 115 547 in 2007 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birnin_Kebbi). Nigeria, with an estimated population of 170 123 740 in 2012, is the most populous country in Africa and the 7th most populous country in the world (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria#Population_of_major_cities). It is located in West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean with the Republic of Benin to the west, Chad and Cameroon to the east, and Niger to the north.
