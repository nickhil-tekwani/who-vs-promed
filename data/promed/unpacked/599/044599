Situation summary
Latest available situation summary, 3 Dec 2014
---------------------------------------
HIGHLIGHTS
There have been 17 145 reported cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), with 6070 reported deaths.
- Case incidence is slightly increasing in Guinea, stable or declining in Liberia, and may still be increasing in Sierra Leone.
- The outbreak in Spain has been declared over.
- The UNMEER [UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response] targets of isolating and treating 70 percent of EVD cases and burying 70 percent of EVD-related deaths safely have likely been met in most districts of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. All 3 countries now have sufficient capacity at a national level to meet both targets, though local variations mean capacity is still insufficient to stop transmission in some areas.

SUMMARY
A total of 17 145 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 5 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and the United States of America) and 3 previously affected countries (Nigeria, Senegal and Spain) up to the end of 30 November. There have been 6070 reported deaths.

Reported case incidence is slightly increasing in Guinea (77 confirmed cases reported in the week to 30 Nov 2014), stable or declining in Liberia (43 new confirmed cases in the 5 days to 28 Nov 2014), and is still rising in Sierra Leone (537 new confirmed cases in the week to 30 Nov 2014). The case fatality rate across the 3 most affected countries in all cases with a recorded definitive outcome is 72 percent; in hospitalized patients the case fatality rate is 60 percent.

Response activities in the 3 intense-transmission countries continue to intensify in line with the UNMEER aim to isolate and treat 70 percent of EVD cases and safely bury 70 percent of EVD-related deaths by 1 Dec 2014, with the ultimate goal of reaching 100 percent by 1 Jan 2015.

Beds
------
At a national level, there is now sufficient bed capacity in EVD treatment facilities to treat and isolate all reported EVD cases in each of the 3 countries, although the uneven distribution of beds and cases means there are serious shortfalls in some areas.

Burials
---------
Similarly, each country now has sufficient and widespread capacity to bury all reported EVD-related deaths; however, because not all EVD-related deaths are reported, and many reported burials are of non-EVD-related deaths, it is possible that the 70 percent target has not been met in some areas.

Laboratory confirmation
---------------------
Every EVD-affected district in the 3 intense-transmission countries has access to a laboratory for confirmation within 24 hours of sample collection.

Contacts
------
All 3 countries report that more than 85 percent of registered contacts associated with known cases of EVD are being traced, although contact tracing is still a challenge in areas of intense transmission. Increasing capacity for contact tracing in areas with low levels of transmission will be necessary to end local chains of transmission.

[2] Mali: imam's itinerary

The article mentions he was already showing symptoms of Ebola on 17 Oct 2014, a few days before his family decided to take him to Bamako (Mali). Before taking him there, he was in a private clinic in Siguiri (Guinea), near Bamako, and then another clinic. He received a travel pass from a local chief but nevertheless took back roads into Mali to avoid control posts. There had been information campaigns about Ebola in Mali for weeks before his arrival, so it is not understood by the Malian authorities why the top hospital in the country did not suspect Ebola. - Mod.JW

[3] MSF: call for improved response
Date: Tue 2 Dec 2014

The world's response to Ebola has been slow and uneven, and has leaned on local people, national governments, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to do most of the hands-on work, Doctors without Borders (MSF) said today [2 Dec 2014], while also urging the world to adapt to evolving developments.

The MSF's assessment of the Ebola epidemic comes alongside assessments from top officials at the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations yesterday [1 Dec 2014], 2 months into the global surge response. They said that though safe burial goals have been met in all 3 hard-hit countries, intense disease activity is still occurring in western Sierra Leone, one of the stumbling blocks to reaching the isolation and treatment goal.

The affected countries have received assistance from the international community, MSF said. However, foreign governments have mainly focused on financing or building Ebola treatment units, leaving staffing of the facilities to national and local authorities and NGOs, which may lack the needed expertise. Training people to safely operate Ebola units can take weeks, and though MSF and other groups have been doing training, a bottleneck has led to significant delays, the group said...

Joanne Lieu, MD, MSF's international president, said it's disappointing that countries that have biological-disaster response capacities aren't using them. "How is it that the international community has left the response to Ebola -- now a transnational threat -- to doctors, nurses, and charity workers?" ... - more

[4] World Bank update shows worsening economic impact

The World Bank Group today [2 Dec 2014] released new estimates of the financial impact of the Ebola outbreak on Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, showing further dips in gross domestic product (GDP) for this year [2014] and projections for negative growth in 2015 for Guinea and Sierra Leone.

The Tue 2 Dec 2014 report updates the World Bank's 8 Oct 2014 analysis and comes as World Bank President Jim Young Kim starts a 2-day visit to West Africa to gauge the financial fallout from the epidemic and talk to governments and aid groups about response needs. The group has mobilized USD 1 billion for the 3 countries.

Though all 3 countries had been growing rapidly in recent years, including the 1st half of 2014 in the outbreak's early months, the World Bank sharply revised the GDP growth estimates downward in October 2014 and predicted further drops in its new report. For 2015, the group projects negative growth of -0.2 percent for Guinea and -2.0 percent for Sierra Leone. For Liberia, where signs of progress against the outbreak have been seen, along with some increasing economic activity, the World Bank projects a 3 percent increase, up from its 1 percent projection in October [2014] but less than half of the pre-crisis estimate of 6.8 percent.

The group put the income loss for 2014 and 2015 for all 3 countries at more than USD 2 billion. Kim said in the statement: "This report reinforces why zero Ebola cases must be our goal. While there are signs of progress, as long as the epidemic continues, the human and economic impact will only grow more devastating."... - more
