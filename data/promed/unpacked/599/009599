Multistate (2006) Outbreak of Norovirus Gastroenteritis Among
Attendees at a Family Reunion --- Grant County, West Virginia, October 2006
-----------------------------------------------
On 17 Oct 2006, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human
Resources (WVDHHR) was notified of an outbreak of acute
gastroenteritis, characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, among
attendees at a family reunion. The outbreak initially was reported by
a group of attendees to their local health department in Garrett
County, Maryland. The same day, the information was relayed to the
Grant County Health Department in West Virginia and subsequently to
WVDHHR. The reunion was held on 14 Oct 2006 at a private residence in
Grant County, West Virginia, and the 53 identified attendees included
residents from Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
and West Virginia. This report describes a collaborative,
multijurisdictional epidemiologic investigation using a cohort study
and laboratory analyses to determine the source of infection and
appropriate control measures. The results indicated that a
combination of person-to-person and foodborne transmission of 2
strains of norovirus, likely introduced by persons from 2 different
states and subsequently at least 2 food items, was the probable cause
of these illnesses, highlighting the challenge of investigating and
controlling norovirus outbreaks. During periods of peak norovirus
activity, public health officials should emphasize the importance of
appropriate handwashing and the exclusion of ill persons from social
gatherings.
Epidemiologic Investigation
---------------------------
In collaboration with state and local health departments, interviews
were conducted with 11 reunion attendees to help generate hypotheses
and develop a list of attendees and foods served. A questionnaire was
then developed to conduct a cohort study involving all reunion
attendees. Questions addressed illness onset, symptoms, attendance at
prereunion gatherings, consumption of specific food items, contact
with ill persons, and onset of symptoms among nonattendees.
Questionnaires were administered by telephone and in person by state
and local health department staff members from West Virginia and
Maryland in coordination with health departments from the other
attendee jurisdictions in Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.
An attendee case was defined as 2 or more episodes of nonbloody
diarrhea (i.e., 2 or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) or
vomiting within a single 24-hour period on or after 7 Oct 2006, in a
person who attended the reunion. A nonattendee case was defined as
acute illness characterized by vomiting or diarrhea with onset after
12 a.m. on 18 Oct 2006 in persons who did not attend the reunion but
who had direct contact (i.e., within 3 feet) with attendees after the reunion.
The list of reunion attendees included 53 persons, of whom 48 (91
percent) were interviewed. Of those interviewed, 28 (58 percent) had
illness that met the attendee case definition. In addition, 4 cases
were identified among nonattendees, all of whom were household
contacts of attendees. Symptoms reported by the 28 ill attendees
included diarrhea (96 percent), vomiting (75 percent), abdominal
cramps (71 percent), nausea (61 percent), headache (54 percent),
chills (36 percent), body aches (32 percent), fever (not specified)
(21 percent), and fatigue or malaise (18 percent). 19 (68 percent) of
the 28 ill attendees were female, and 6 (21 percent) were aged <10
years. Six (21 percent) of the patients sought medical care. For the
25 patients who reported both date of illness onset and date of
recovery, the median duration of illness was 54 hours (range: 6 to
135 hours). 21 of the 28 attendee cases occurred during the period 14
to 16 Oct 2006. [Data presented as a figure in the original text].
The one-day reunion began at 11 a.m. on 14 Oct 2006. Persons with
illness onset after 8 p.m. on 14 Oct through 12 a.m. on 18 Oct 2006
were included in the cohort study, as were persons who attended but
did not become ill . Persons with illness onset either before the
reunion or after 12 a.m. on 18 Oct 2006 were excluded. Incubation
periods were calculated by subtracting the date and time of the 1st
possible exposure from the date and time of illness onset. The 1st
possible exposure was defined as either the time the person arrived
at the reunion or the time the person arrived at a pre-reunion
gathering where previously ill persons were present. Nine of the 48
interviewed attendees were excluded from the cohort study because
they did not meet the defined illness-onset criteria. Three had
illness onset greater than 72 hours after the reunion. Six attendees
had illness onset either before the reunion or within 6 hours after
the reunion began and might have introduced the illness into the
reunion; 4 of these 6 were immediate family members from New York who
had traveled to the reunion together, including a child who was ill
with vomiting and diarrhea during the reunion, and the other 2 were
West Virginia residents who had no contact with each other or the
family from New York immediately before the reunion.
Of the 39 attendees included in the cohort study, 19 met the case
definition and illness-onset criteria, and 20 did not become ill. The
median incubation period for the 19 cases was 36 hours (range: 20 to
61 hours). Of 31 food items served at the reunion [tabulated in the
original text], 2 items were identified as significant risk factors
for developing illness (p less than 0.05, by 2-tailed Mantel-Haenszel
chi-square test) and were eaten by the majority of ill persons:
scalloped potatoes (relative risk [RR] = 2.8, 95 percent confidence
interval [CI] = 1.1 to 6.9) and chicken (RR = 2.2, CI = 1.0 to 4.8).
Both food items were eaten at the reunion by persons who were ill
before the reunion, which might have provided an opportunity for
these persons to contaminate the food at the event. The chicken was
purchased at a store by the family from New York, whose 4 members had
been ill before the reunion, which provided another opportunity for
the food to be contaminated. The scalloped potatoes were brought by
persons from West Virginia who were not ill before the reunion.
Consumption of the chocolate cheese ball also was statistically
associated with illness (p = 0.04), but the item was only eaten by 7
persons. In addition, 6 of the 7 attendees who ate the chocolate
cheese ball also ate both the chicken and scalloped potatoes; all 7
ate the chicken. Self-reported direct contact with ill persons at the
reunion, including with the symptomatic child, also was a significant
risk factor for developing illness (RR = 2.3, CI = 1.0 to 5.1).
Attendance at prereunion gatherings at either home A or home B was
not associated with illness. Reunion attendees were provided
information on appropriate hand hygiene and the potential for viral
shedding and secondary transmission up to 2 weeks after symptoms resolved.
Laboratory Investigation
------------------------
In coordination with state and local health departments, reunion
attendees were encouraged to submit stool or vomitus samples to their
respective local health departments. Stool specimens were submitted
by 13 ill reunion attendees from Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York,
and West Virginia, and the specimens were then submitted to the
respective state laboratories for analysis.* No vomitus samples were
analyzed. Norovirus reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction
(RT/PCR), genotype sequencing analyses, and enteric bacterial
cultures were performed by the Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania
state laboratories. Initial genogroup assignment was made by
differential probe binding. Results were compiled and compared to
identify specific etiologic agents involved in the outbreak. No
environmental samples were collected.
Of the 13 stool specimens submitted (6 from Pennsylvania residents, 3
from Maryland, 3 from New York, one from West Virginia, and none from
Florida or Virginia), 12 (92.3 percent) tested positive for norovirus
genogroup II by RT/PCR. Using genetic sequencing of the RT/PCR
products from norovirus region B and comparison with GenBank, the
closest match for the strain detected was identified by each state
laboratory. The same strain (Hu/GII-4/Chester/2006/UK) was identified
in the 2 sequenced norovirus-positive specimens from Maryland, the 2
positive specimens from New York, and the one positive specimen from
West Virginia. A 2nd strain (Hu/NLV/Oxford/B6S6/2003/UK) was
identified in all 6 positive specimens from Pennsylvania. No
differences in exposures between persons infected with the 2
different strains could be identified. No other etiologies (e.g.,
bacterial) were identified.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
Noroviruses are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the
United States, with an estimated 23 million cases occurring annually
(1, 2, 3). The average incubation period for norovirus is 24 to 48
hours, and clinical disease is characterized by acute onset of
vomiting, nonbloody diarrhea, or both, lasting 12 to 60 hours (4). In
clinical studies, approximately 2/3rds of persons infected with
norovirus experienced symptoms of disease (5). The primary route of
transmission for noroviruses is fecal-oral, including consumption of
fecally contaminated food or water, direct person-to-person contact,
and contaminated objects or environments (4,5). Airborne transmission
via vomitus droplets also can occur (4,5). During outbreaks, primary
cases often result from exposure to a fecally contaminated food item,
object, or environment, whereas secondary cases result from
person-to-person transmission (6). Noroviruses and norovirus
infections have numerous characteristics that facilitate their spread
during outbreaks, including the low dose required for infection;
prolonged, asymptomatic shedding that can occur in infected persons;
environmental stability of the virus; and lack of lasting immunity in
persons who have been infected previously (4). Molecular
epidemiologic techniques have identified substantial strain
diversity, and epidemic strains of norovirus might be more virulent
or more environmentally persistent than nonepidemic strains (7).
This outbreak highlights the challenges of investigating and
controlling norovirus outbreaks, including multiple modes of
transmission. The findings of this investigation, including the
detection of 2 different norovirus strains in patients, suggest that
illness was independently introduced into the reunion by several
sources (i.e., persons from New York and from West Virginia). Food
items might have been contaminated by persons who were ill when they
attended the reunion. Infection likely was propagated through a
combination of person-to person contact and foodborne transmission;
transmission through contaminated fomites cannot be ruled out.
Laboratory evidence confirmed that at least 2 different norovirus
strains were circulating among attendees. The convergence of 2 virus
strains in a single outbreak coincided with a period of high
norovirus activity in the region. During October to December 2006, a
total of 20 other outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis in West Virginia
were reported to WVDHHR, representing a 7-fold increase in the number
reported during the same period in 2005.
Prevention and control of norovirus outbreaks, especially during
periods of increased norovirus circulation, should emphasize standard
infection-control practices, including the exclusion of ill
caregivers and food handlers from work settings and exercising
adequate hand hygiene (8). Persons who have had gastroenteritis
recently should pay attention to washing their hands after toileting
and should not prepare food. Food items that might have been
contaminated by persons with gastroenteritis should be discarded. As
demonstrated by this outbreak, collaboration among multiple state and
local health departments often is required for prompt public health
investigations of norovirus outbreaks, which can be complicated by
multiple sources, viral strains, and routes of this highly
transmissible infection.
