A comment on Measles - Canada: (Toronto) 20080411.1327
-----------------------------------------------
The Toronto Globe and Mail report stated that: "Health Canada
generally considers adults born before 1970 to be naturally immune."
Yet one of the current cases occurred in a 42-year-old man. His
immune status would not have been assumed in the US by the CDC, which
considers persons born in or before 1956 to be naturally immune. In
1991, when the US experienced a surge in measles cases, waning
immunity in persons given the killed vaccine from 1963 to 1967 was a
significant contributing factor.

Indeed, 1970 is the birth year listed on the Health Canada website,
so it is not an error in reporting. Considering that the measles
vaccine was introduced in 1963, which would have interrupted the rate
of children acquiring natural measles, and considering that persons
given killed measles vaccine with no subsequent boosters may have
waning immunity, using 1970 as a cutoff date for assuming naturally
acquired immunity does not seem reasonable.
