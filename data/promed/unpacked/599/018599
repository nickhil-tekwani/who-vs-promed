First report of _Exserohilum pedicellatum_ on _Zea mays_ in Australia
R.L. Gilbert <ross.gilbert@agric.nsw.gov.au>, NSW Agriculture, Orange
Agricultural Institute, Forest Road, Orange, NSW 2800, Australia. Accepted
for publication 22 Aug 2002.
During routine investigation of a cob-rot outbreak in the central west of
New South Wales, diseased roots of mature sweet corn (_Zea mays_ L.) cv.
'Golden Millennium' were sampled. Symptomatic adventitious roots exhibited
a dark brown root rot extending from the tip.
_Exserohilum pedicellatum (Henry) [Ep] Leonard & Suggs, the anamorph of
_Setosphaeria pedicellata_ (Nelson) Leonard & Suggs was isolated from
diseased material (DAR75790). Morphology agreed with the description of
Sivanesan (1987) and conidia measured 56-95 micrometers (av. 72.5
micrometers) long by 21-32 micrometers (av. 27 micrometers) wide with a
length:breadth (L/B) ratio of 2.76.
'Golden Millennium' seedlings were inoculated at the 3-leaf stage with a
conidial suspension of DAR75790. After incubation, Ep was recovered from
brown lesions on seminal and adventitious roots of inoculated plants. No
above-ground symptoms were evident and root symptoms were mild. Only
isolates of _Fusarium moniliforme_ Sheldon were recovered from lesions on
the mesocotyl.
Hosts of Ep are listed in Sivanesan (1987) as _Echinochloa_, _Oryza_,
_Paspalum_, _Setaria_, _Sorghum_ and _Triticum_, where it is associated
with dark brown root lesions, and _Zea_, where it causes a root rot.
Sivanesan (1987) listed the distribution of Ep as Egypt, India, Pakistan,
South Africa and the USA.
No later published records exist for Australia. A review of current
unpublished Australian checklists and herbarium databases list records on
_Oryza_, _Sorghum_, _Triticum_ and soil collected over a period from 1976
to 1985 but apparently without formal publication. No unpublished
Australian records on _Zea_ were revealed.
Australian isolates from _Triticum_ (DAR27966c) collected in 1976 and
_Sorghum_ (DAR29011a) collected in 1977, were examined by the author and
confirmed as Ep. Conidial dimensions of the _Sorghum_ isolate were similar
to DAR 75790 however the _Triticum_ isolate had an average length of 91
micrometers and a L/B ratio of 3.38.
Ep has not been detected previously on _Zea_, although it has probably
existed as a minor pathogen in this country for many years. This is the
first published record of Ep on _Zea mays_ in Australia and on any host in
this country.

[This post is primarily a note of record of the presence of Ep in
Australia. Ep is a soilborne fungus. In Hawaii it causes a leaf spot
disease in maize. Other species are _E. rostratum_ which infects sorghum
(_Sorghum bicolor_), and _S. caudatum_, and _E. turcicum_, which infects
maize and sorghum.
According to plant pathologists at the University of California, Ep causes
brown lesions on primary roots and later on secondary roots of the first
and second whorls. Affected roots become black and necrotic. Above-ground
symptoms include wilting, stunting, and yellowing of leaves, but these
symptoms are not always apparent. Fertility imbalance, overcrowding, and
wet soils may favor disease development. Management of the disease involves
cultural control and good cultural practices. Apparently there is no
recommended chemical control for this disease. - Mod.DH]
