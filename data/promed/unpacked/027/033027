L'Agence nationale de securite sanitaire (The National Health
Security Agency) recently confirmed a diagnosis of rabies in a dead
bat found near a home in Secheval [Champagne-Ardenne, adjacent to the
Belgian border].

Public health measures were immediately implemented: the
investigation was conducted by doctors at the ARS Champagne-Ardenne
and by veterinarians of the DDCSPP. It appears that there has been no
animal or human contact.

Over the last 20 years, 50 cases of bat rabies have been recorded in
France [for distribution map, see commentary]. This rabies is
distinct from rabies in terrestrial mammals (dogs, foxes). Rabies,
transmitted to humans from rabid animals by bites or scratches, is
fatal if treatment [post-exposure immunization] is not quickly
undertaken . The post-exposure rabies treatments are particularly
effective. No (locally acquired) rabies cases in humans have been
recorded within the territory of metropolitan France since 1924.

Upon discovery of a dead bat or of an affected weakened bat with
flying difficulty, such animals should not be touched or picked up
but immediately reported to a veterinarian or to the specialised
officials who will collect the affected bat (for testing).

When accidentally bitten or scratched by a bat, the wound should be
cleaned with soap and rinsed thoroughly before applying a
disinfectant. Any person who had contact with a bat should promptly
seek advice from an anti-rabies center or consult a doctor who may,
if necessary, involve the center.

Bats are useful mammals, but they are fragile and not very prolific.
Hence, all bat species are protected in France and Europe by law. It
is strictly forbidden to kill, capture, manipulate, or transport them
for sale, whether alive or dead.

Finally, attention is drawn to the owners of domestic carnivores
(dogs, cats), reminding them that if such animals present behavioral
changes or suffer an unexplained death, a veterinarian should be
immediately consulted.
