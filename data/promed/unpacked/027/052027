Regarding the recent outbreak of non-O157 VTEC _E. coli_ infection
from lettuce, the following data on outbreaks of _E. coli_ non-O157
infection are abstracted from Gideon [primary references available on
request]:
1975 - An outbreak (2200 or more cases) of _E. coli_ O6:K15:H16
infection at Crater Lake National Park was attributed to contaminated
drinking water.
1983 - Outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness associated with eating
imported French Brie cheese occurred in the District of Columbia,
with subsequent cases in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, and Wisconsin.
The responsible organism in this case was a strain of _E. coli_
serotype O27:H20 which produced a heat-stable toxin.
1998 - An outbreak (3300 estimated cases) of _E. coli_ O6:H16
infection was caused by delicatessen foods supplied by a caterer.
1999 - An outbreak (11 cases, 3 HUS) of _E. coli_ O121 infection was
associated with a lake in Connecticut.
1999 - An outbreak (58 cases; 2 HUS) of _E. coli_ O111:H8 infection
at a cheerleading camp in Texas was ascribed to contaminated ice and
salads. This is the first reported community outbreak attributable
to this strain for the USA.
2004 - An outbreak (111 cases) of ETEC infection caused by 3
serotypes of _E. coli_ was reported among employees of a company in
Illinois.
2006 (publication year) - An outbreak (36 cases) of E. coli O169:H41
infection among employees of a company was ascribed to contaminated
cole slaw.

I would like to draw your attention to the table I have put together,
which lists the sources of nearly 4000 reported non-O157 VTEC from
around the world including 10 of O121:H19, which were reported from
USA, Canada, Hong Kong, Denmark, Germany and Japan:
