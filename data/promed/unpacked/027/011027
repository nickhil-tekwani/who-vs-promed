The number of recorded cases of leptospirosis in 2022 doubled in the period of heavy rains in Recife's winter. Between 23 May 2022] and 7 Jul 2022, there were 36 cases in the capital of Pernambuco. In the same period last year [2021], there were 18 confirmations.

The head of the division of communicable diseases in Recife, Adriana Luna, also stated that the profile of patients is young adult men, who "work and have to leave the house" in the rains. "The main form of transmission of leptospirosis is through unprotected contact with rainwater and mud contaminated with rodent urine", recalled the specialist.

The disease is caused by the _Leptospira_ bacteria present in the urine of rats and other animals, and increases after rainy periods, especially in people who live in more vulnerable areas, where there is a lot of accumulated garbage and rat proliferation.

"Another concern is gastroenteritis, infectious diseases that cause diarrhea and other symptoms. Contamination can happen if the reservoir that stores water used for consumption at home is contaminated", explained infectious disease specialist Vera Magalh√£es, professor of infectious diseases at the Federal University. of Pernambuco (UFPE).

_Leptospira_ enters the body through the skin and mucous membranes (nose and eyes), especially if there is a scratch or wound. High fever, severe muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, dry cough, and headache are the main symptoms of the mild form of the disease. "The symptoms are similar to a virus. What is important is that, if the person has had contact with this water and has these symptoms, look for a health service and report the contact to the professional who is attending", stated Adriana moon.

What is leptospirosis?
The disease is caused by a bacterium present in mouse urine that normally spreads through dirty water from floods and sewers.

Leptospirosis: how does contamination occur?
People can get sick when they come into contact with water or mud contaminated by the urine of rodents (rats, roof rats, and mice). The bacteria enter the skin, with or without injuries, when in contact with contaminated water.

Is it possible to prevent leptospirosis?
Check out some precautions:
- Avoid contact in areas with water or mud from floods or sewers. Do not let children swim or play in these places, which may be contaminated by rat urine
- After the waters subside, it will be necessary to remove the mud and disinfect the place, always with protection
- People cleaning mud, debris and sewage should wear rubber boots and gloves to avoid skin contact with contaminated water and mud. If this is not possible, use double plastic bags tied around the hands and feet
- After the waters subside, it will be necessary to remove the mud and disinfect the place, always with protection
- Floors, walls, and countertops should be washed, disinfecting with bleach, in the proportion of two cups of tea (400 ml) of this product to a 20-liter bucket of water, leaving it to act for 15 minutes.
- Be careful with foods that have come in contact with floodwater. Some must be thrown away
- It is important to clean and disinfect the water tank

What are the symptoms of leptospirosis?
The disease is characterized by fever, headache, and muscle pain (mainly in the legs, in the calf area: calf). Symptoms can appear up to 30 days after contact with water or mud. Vomiting, diarrhea, and coughing may also occur. In severe forms, jaundice (skin, yellow eyes), bleeding, and urinary changes may appear. In the presence of fever, headache, and body aches up to 40 days after coming into contact with floodwater or sewage, it is necessary to seek a health unit. It is important to report to your doctor about contact with rainwater.

Cases in Pernambuco
To date, 797 cases of leptospirosis have been reported in Pernambuco, of which 108 are confirmed, 99 are discarded, and 590 remain under investigation. In 2022, 8 deaths were reported, 2 of which were confirmed by the disease and 6 that remain under investigation.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is widely distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in the urine of chronically infected animals may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Mice, as well as rats, can carry _Leptospira_ in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401/).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against _Leptospira_ infection is predominantly serovar-specific. Different leptospiral serovars may be prevalent in particular geographical regions.

Human activities that place people at increased risk of leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, swimming in rivers and other water sports, gardening, or farming, and working in piggeries (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease, such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic those of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805) for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this. However, a Cochrane review of clinical research testing whether taking doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis found that data from trials, which "targeted different kinds of people -- travelers and people who live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students -- did not support the practice in all cases, though short-term travelers with a potential for high-risk exposure may be helped." (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007342.pub2)

Although vaccines are available for immunizing non-human animals against some serovars of _Leptospira_ and are available in some countries for humans, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans in the US.

Recife is the 4th-largest urban area in Brazil with 4 million residents, the largest urban area of the North/Northeast Regions, and the capital and largest city of the state of Pernambuco in the northeast corner of South America (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife).
