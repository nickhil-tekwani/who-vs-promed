A worm from Southeast Asia has found its way into France and is threatening the country's supply of escargot [a dish of cooked land snails, usually served as an appetizer in France and in French restaurants].

The New Guinea flatworm [invasive flatworm, _Platydemus manokwari_] is one of the most dangerous invasive species in the world. The worms were spotted at the botanical gardens in Normandy, setting off alarm bells around the country.

"All snails in Europe could be wiped out," Jean-Lou Justine, a professor of parasitology from the National Museum of Natural History in France, told Discovery News. "It may seem ironic, but it's worth pointing out the effect that this will have on French cooking."

Imagine not being able to order a coveted plate of escargot, drenched in garlic butter at your favorite French restaurant!

The worms like to wipe out an area's population of snails before moving on to consuming earthworms.

In an article Justine published in a peer reviewed journal, he called for an early warning of the existence of the worms to State and European Union authorities, and suggested the eradication of the worm to prevent it from spreading.

Justine J, Winsor L, Gey D, et al: The invasive New Guinea flatworm _Platydemus manokwari_ in France, the first record for Europe: time for action is now. PeerJ 2:e297 and can be accessed at http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.297.

Non-indigenous terrestrial flatworms (Platyhelminthes) have been recorded in 13 European countries. These species may move to an invasive stage when optimum environmental and other conditions occur, and the flatworms then have the potential to cause economic or environmental harm.

_Platydemus manokwari_, also known as the New Guinea flatworm, is a species of large predatory land flatworm. It is an invasive species. A picture of the worm can be accessed at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Platydemus_manokwari.jpg.

_Platydemus manokwari_ may be of public health significance, as it is a paratenic host for the nematode _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_, also known as the rat lungworm. - Mod.PMB
