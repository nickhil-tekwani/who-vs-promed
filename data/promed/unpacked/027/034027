Isolation and characterization of highly pathogenic avian influenza
virus subtype H5N1 from donkeys - Provisional abstract
----------------------------
Highly pathogenic H5N1 is a major avian pathogen that crosses species
barriers and seriously affects humans as well as some mammals. It
mutates in an intensified manner and is considered a potential
candidate for the possible next pandemic with all the catastrophic
consequences.

Methods
------------
Nasal swabs were collected from donkeys suffering from respiratory
distress. The virus was isolated from the pooled nasal swabs in
specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs (SPF-ECE). Reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing of
both haemagglutingin and neuraminidase were performed. H5
seroconversion was screened using haemagglutination inhibition (HI)
assay on 105 donkey serum samples.

Results
----------
We demonstrated that H5N1 jumped from poultry to another mammalian
host, donkeys. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus clustered
within the lineage of H5N1 from Egypt closely related to 2009
isolates. It harboured few genetic changes compared to the closely
related viruses from avian and humans. The neuraminidase lacks
oseltamivir resistant mutations. Interestingly, HI screening for
antibodies to H5 haemagglutinins in donkeys revealed a high exposure
rate.

Conclusions
------------
These findings extend the host range of the H5N1 influenza virus,
possess implications for influenza virus epidemiology, and highlight
the need for the systematic surveillance of H5N1 in animals in the
vicinity of backyard poultry units, especially in endemic areas.

[The donkey has already been added to the other 16 animals of the
class Mammalia included in the USGS List of Species affected by H5N1
