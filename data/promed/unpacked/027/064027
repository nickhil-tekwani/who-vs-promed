Influenza activity continues to increase in most of the countries in the WHO European Region.

- This issue is based on data for week 7/2012 reported by 47 Member States in the WHO European Region.

- Influenza activity is increasing in 27 countries. In general, the situation in the region is rather diverse, with about half the countries experiencing low influenza activity and half medium activity. 13 countries did not detect any influenza viruses in specimens from sentinel outpatient surveillance this week.

- This season [2011-2012] is starting somewhat later than previous seasons.

- The number of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) continues to be relatively stable, with 12 percent of sentinel SARI specimens testing positive for influenza.

- Circulation of influenza A(H3N2) virus is still prevalent, with few A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B detections reported.

- To date, circulating virus strains are similar to those that were recommended for inclusion in the current northern hemisphere vaccine for 2011-2012.

Outpatient surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI):
------------------
42 countries reported on trends in clinical activity: 11 stable, 27 increasing, and 4 decreasing trends. As in several previous weeks, consultation rates were highest in young children. Of the 18 countries that reported a threshold for the 2011-2012 season, the consultation rates were below the threshold in 7: the Czech Republic; the United Kingdom (England); Estonia; Latvia; the Netherlands; the Republic of Moldova; and Ukraine. Israel and Ireland just reached their threshold in week 7/2012. Of the 42 countries reporting on the geographical spread of influenza, 4 reported no activity, 13 sporadic activity, 4 local activity, 7 regional activity, and 14 widespread activity. Low intensity was reported by 22 countries, medium by 18, and high by 2.

Sentinel outpatient clinics collected 2240 respiratory specimens during week 7/2012, of which 1024 (46 percent) tested positive for influenza viruses, slightly more than in week 6/2012. Of these, 930 (91 percent) were influenza type A and 94 (9 percent) were influenza B. In the 26 countries testing 20 or more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 0-77 percent, with a median of 47 percent (mean: 41 percent).

Virological overview
----------------
During week 7/2012, 45 countries reported a dominant virus type and/or subtype; 25 reported influenza A as the dominant virus, and 2 reported co-dominance of influenza B with A(H3)/A(H3N2). The remaining 18 reported no dominant virus.

During week 7/2012, 2232 specimens from non-sentinel sources were reported positive for influenza: 2135 (96 percent) type A and 97 (4 percent) type B. Of the influenza A viruses, 671 were subtyped: 663 (99 percent) as A(H3N2) and 8 (one percent) as A(H1N1)pdm09.

Since week 40/2011, 13 117 specimens of influenza viruses from sentinel and non-sentinel sources have been typed and subtyped: 12 421 (95 percent) were influenza A, and 696 (5 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 7616 were subtyped: 7347 (96 percent) as A (H3N2) and 269 (4 percent) as A(H1N1)pdm09.

The principal conclusions are that (1) the winter epidemic is starting later than usual and not at all in some countries, (2) that consultation rates were highest in young children, and (3) that circulating virus strains are similar to those that were recommended for inclusion in the current northern hemisphere vaccine for 2011/2012. - Mod.CP]
