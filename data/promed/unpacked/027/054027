Re: Bud rot, oil palm & lethal yellowing, coconut palm - Colombia
[recent ProMED-mail post 20091127.4067]:

The sentence [in the posted CIMMYT news item] "Maize also offers a
profitable alternative for farmers in marginal zones who grow coconut
palms and have lately been threatened with total crop loss from the
lethal yellowing diseases," may have caused a misunderstanding. I
would like to clarify that:

1. Bud rot disease is a problem for oil palm in Colombia.

2. We have not heard of reports of LY [lethal yellowing] in coconut
palm in Colombia. LY was mentioned in the article because we are
looking to see whether maize intercropping would make a suitable cash
crop as intercrop for coconut palm in LY-affected countries, just as
we have found that it is a good intercrop for young oil palm in
Colombia.

Sorry about this.
