The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 3 Mar 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 897, of which 832* confirmed and 65 probable. In total, there were 563 deaths (498 confirmed and 65 probable) and 304 people healed.
* A confirmed non-classified case has been added to Butembo
- 171 suspected cases under investigation;
- 2 new confirmed cases in Butembo;
- 2 new deaths of confirmed cases from Butembo: 1 community death in Butembo; 1 death of in the Katwa TC [transit center];
- 2 new recoveries released from Butembo ETC [Ebola treatment center].

News of the response
Evolution of the epidemiological situation
------------------------------------------
- Considerable progress has been made in recent weeks. To date, 19 health zones have reported at least one case of Ebola during the epidemic. Of these 19 areas, 11 did not register new confirmed cases for more than 21 days. They are Biena [North Kivu], Kayna [North Kivu], Komanda [Ituri], Mabalako [North Kivu], Manguredjipa [North Kivu], Masereka [North Kivu], Musienene [North Kivu], Mutwanga [North Kivu], Nyakunde [Ituri], Oicha [North Kivu], and Tchomia [Ituri]. In addition, 6 other health zones reported only 1 to 4 new cases, namely Beni [North Kivu], Kalunguta [North Kivu], Kyondo [North Kivu], Mandima [Ituri], Rwampara [Ituri], Vuhovi [North Kivu].
- These data demonstrate that the epidemic is relatively controlled in the majority of affected health areas. The 2 health zones that continue to fuel this epidemic remain Butembo and Katwa, which reported more than 86% of new confirmed cases in the last 21 days. In the last 21 days, 80 new cases have been reported, including 48 in Katwa (60%) and 21 in Butembo (26.25%).

Community engagement in Butembo
-------------------------------
- Following targeted attacks on Ebola treatment centers in Katwa and Butembo last week, the Ebola response team in Butembo and surrounding areas launched an action plan to end community incidents that disrupted its activities to defeat this epidemic. During his last visit, the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, asked the coordinator of the on-site response to launch a community dialogue to better understand the expectations of the population.
- This plan was elaborated by Butembo's communication subcommittee on 27 Feb 2019. After its validation by Dr Jean-Christophe Shako, coordinator of the response in this city, this action plan is being implemented by the leaders of the sub-committee. Commission communication is supported by UNICEF and WHO since 1 Mar 2019. On the one hand, they hold consultation sessions with community leaders in Butembo to discuss the issue of resistance and violence against the work of the response. On the other hand, the communication sub-committee would like, through these consultation sessions, to obtain the contribution of the Butembo and Katwa forces in order to define ways and means to put an end to the community incidents. It should be noted that religious leaders, politicians, women's associations, and cell leaders from the Butembo and Katwa health areas, where more resistance has been recorded, have already been heard. They provided potential solutions to this community crisis, which is due to the fact that most members of the community tend to associate Ebola with death, the political problems of insecurity, and the postponement of elections in the region.
- When the response teams arrived in Butembo in September 2018, they had already met with political and administrative authorities, economic operators, religious and political leaders, opinion leaders, lobbyists, and social groups. civil. However, despite the involvement of several influential groups in society, part of the population did not feel that their concerns were sufficiently taken into account. Thus, all these sessions of community consultations scheduled for 10 days will lead to the establishment of a permanent consultation framework between the response team and the community in order to establish a climate of trust between the community and the teams to achieve true community involvement in the fight against Ebola.

Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 85 375 people have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo, and Haut-Uele provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

News of the response
Reopening of Butembo Ebola treatment center
-------------------------------------------
- The Butembo Ebola treatment center, which was attacked by armed men on Wed 27 Feb 2019, reopened Sat 2 Mar 2019. To date, 12 confirmed patients, temporarily hospitalized at the Katwa transit center, have already been transferred to the Butembo ETC.
- The logistics teams have rehabilitated in a few days the main parts of the ETC to allow the proper and dignified care of confirmed patients. The Butembo ETC is now managed by the Ministry of Health, in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF. All the caregivers and support staff who were already working at the ETC went back to work with a smile. This Mon 4 Mar 2019, reconstruction work of the Katwa ETC set on fire on the night of 24-25 Feb 2019 will be launched.

Ebola hackathon in Kinshasa
---------------------------
- This weekend [2-3 Mar 2019], the Ministry of Health, in partnership with Kinshasa Digital, PATH, and Internews, organized an Ebola hackathon for students in Kinshasa. The theme for the hackathon was: "How can Ebola response agents better utilize new technologies to achieve their communication goals locally, nationally, and internationally?" The objective of the event was to raise awareness of the problem of Ebola among young people in Kinshasa, living several thousand kilometers from the epicenter of the epidemic.
- For 24 hours, about 50 students worked as a team to develop innovative solutions that can help the response teams in their work. The thematic touching several areas, the students had been instructed to form multidisciplinary teams mixing students in computer science, communication / journalism and medicine.
- The Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, as well as Ministry of Health partners spent the hackathon in the afternoon of [Sat 2 Mar 2019]. They met with students who briefed them on the projects they were working on. All guests were particularly impressed by the quality and relevance of some projects designed by students who have never worked in an Ebola response.
- This Sun 3 Mar 2019, the 10 teams presented their project to a jury composed of representatives of the Ministry of Health, PATH, Kinshasa Digital, Internews, Congolia, TMB, Viamo, and BlueSquare. The competition was tight and several projects stood out. Creativity and innovation were at the rendezvous. We were able to discover the idea of a mobile app to help healthcare providers identify suspect patients or a connected bracelet that monitors the temperature of contacts during the follow-up period.
- The winning team will be announced at Kinshasa Digital Week, 12-13 Apr 2019. The team will receive 3 months of coaching at Congolia Incubator as well as a financial contribution from a bank. In addition, during the competition, the Ministry of Health identified some talents who could work part-time in the Ebola response, particularly at the level of the new information management system. A 2nd Ebola hackathon will be organized by Internews in Goma in April [2019].

Vaccination
-----------
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 85 226 people have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo, and Haut-Uele provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

[2] Outbreak summary
Date: Mon 4 Mar 2019

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/ebola-treatment-center-reopens-after-arson-cases-near-900

Ebola treatment center reopens after arson as cases near 900
------------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Butembo reopened 2 Mar 2019 , just days after rebel forces set fire to the building, the ministry of health from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) said in a statement yesterday.

So far 12 patients confirmed to have Ebola have been admitted. Without Doctors Without Borders [MSF], who staffed the ETC before the attack, the center is being run by workers from the ministry of health, the World Health Organization (WHO), and UNICEF.

The ministry of health also said construction is set to begin today [4 Mar 2019] on a new ETC in Katwa. The former ETC was also targeted by arsons last week [night of 24-25 Feb 2019].

The DRC also noted today [4 Mar 2019] that it has implemented an action plan to end community disruptions to officials' outbreak response efforts.

The developments have occurred against a backdrop of 8 new cases and almost 900 since the outbreak began in August 2018.

Shift of violence
-----------------
In the latest bulletin from the WHO's African regional office, the WHO said the arson attacks are a major setback and represent a shift of violence in the region.

"In Butembo, where security incidents occurred on 27 Feb 2019, the proportion of contact follow-up decreased to 66% against an average of 76% in the previous 7 days. In Vuhovi, the proportion of contacts followed on 2 Mar 2019 was 29% as a result of security conditions that prevented response activities and contact follow-up," the WHO said.

The virus still has a stronghold over Katwa and Butembo. Over the weekend [2-3 Mar 2019], the DRC recorded 6 more Ebola cases: 3 in Katwa, 2 in Mandima, and 1 in Butembo. There were also 4 deaths, 3 of which occurred in Katwa.

Today the DRC's update noted 2 new cases and 2 deaths, all in Butembo. One of the new deaths happened in the community, which raises the risk of further disease spread.

The developments bring the outbreak total to 897 cases and 563 deaths, representing a case-fatality rate of 63%.

"Katwa health zone remains the main hot spot, reporting 62% (48/78) of the new confirmed cases in the past 21 days," the WHO said. "As of 2 Mar 2019, 14 of the 18 health areas in Katwa health zone reported confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Katwa, Butembo, Kaluguta, and Mandima health zones have reported new confirmed cases in the past 3 days and remain points of attention."

The DRC added today [4 Mar 2019], "The 2 health zones that continue to fuel this epidemic remain Butembo and Katwa, which reported more than 86% of new confirmed cases in the last 21 days. In the last 21 days, 80 new cases have been reported, including 48 in Katwa (60%) and 21 in Butembo (26.25%)."

In an encouraging trend, no new confirmed Ebola cases have been reported for 21 day in 11 of the 19 affected health zones (Biena, Kayna, Komanda, Mabalako, Manguredjipa, Masereka, Musienene, Mutwanga, Nyakunde, Oicha, and Tchomia). Another 6 health zones had one to 4 cases (Beni, Kalunguta, Kyondo, Mandima. Rwampara, and Vuhovi), the DRC said today.

Study estimates HCW vaccination impact
--------------------------------------
A new study published in Epidemics used data collected from 12 previous Ebola outbreaks to simulate the impact of healthcare worker vaccination on outbreak size and disease transmission. The study found that at 30% vaccine coverage, health worker vaccination had an impact on disease transmission in 2 types of simulated outbreaks.

+3 health workers have been infected with #Ebola, increasing the HCW total in this outbreak to 72; 24 of them have died. These are probable cases; they died in the community & were not tested before burial. Don't know for sure but suspect they may not have been vaccinated.]

The study in Epidemics clearly demonstrates the importance of vaccinating all healthcare workers. This should be a primary focus of the control effort. - Mod.LK]

[3] Response
- Sun 3 Mar 2019: Butembo - women's organizations to get involved in the response
[Radio Moto Butembo-Beni, in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5498

Women's organizations are called to [respond] to the [Ebola] virus disease. The representatives of these associations have been in talks with the response team this [Sat 2 Mar 2019] at Auberge. The women immediately complained that they had been dismissed for a while from the Ebola awareness team.

The women indicate that they had committed themselves to stop the chain of transmission of Ebola before the worst happens. The chairman of the communication commission has said that they are in the midst of critical self-evaluation activities of the response. More than ever, the response team is determined to listen to members of the community to stop Ebola.

[Byline: Auguy Mudiayi]

Dr. Joanne Lui, the international president of the NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), expressed this [Sat 2 Mar 2019], her concern about the continuation of the operation to respond to the 10th Ebola outbreak after a series of attacks by armed men against the centers for the treatment of the disease in the city of Butembo.

"There are still worrying signs regarding the evolution of the epidemic. About 40% of deaths occur in the community and they are people who did not come to treatment centers before the attacks. We also know that 40% of confirmed cases do not belong to the chain of transmission. So these 2 elements are extremely alarming. We need to build community trust in the response to the Ebola outbreak", she said.

"MSF will not support an approach that advocates the use of force to stem the epidemic. You cannot force people to be tested or treated against their will. Ebola is the common enemy. We must not blame the communities for our difficulties in stemming the epidemic at the moment", added the MSF President.

[All Africa, a Voice of America report, abridged, edited]

[Byline: Marissa Melton]

WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told reporters that experts must now track possible paths of infection. "It is highly important to find those people, that last patient, and then, of course, immediately start the contact tracing and monitor the contacts these patients might have been in touch with," Lindmeier said.

DRC health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga told VOA French to Africa that the problem with the Ebola situation lies in Katwa and Butembo, where "communities are not fully engaged." He also said armed groups and unidentified gunmen are common in the area.

A spokeswoman for DRC's health ministry, Jessica Ilunga, said the government will examine options over the next few days to protect health agents and stop any spread of the disease resulting from the attacks.

Michel Yao, incident manager for the WHO, said of the attackers: "It looks like an organized group that wants to target treatment centers." He said the loss is great because the centers that were damaged had been testing experimental treatments with some success.

- Mon 4 Mar 2019. Ebola treatment center in Congo reopens after attack, but without Doctors Without Borders
[CNN, abridged, edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/health/ebola-update-congo-africa-intl/index.html
[Byline: Susan Scutti]

Congo's Ministry of Health reported that the Butembo Ebola Treatment Center reopened on [Sat 2 Mar 2019] and is now managed by the ministry in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF, while reconstruction work will soon be launched in Katwa.

Despite suspending its activities in Butembo and Katwa, in North Kivu province, Doctors Without Borders said on [Thu 28 Feb 2019] that it will continue Ebola-related activities in the towns of Goma, Kayna and Luberu, also in North Kivu, and in Bwanasura and Bunia in neighboring Ituri province. The 2 provinces are among the most populous in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan.

Not only is North Kivu experiencing a deadly Ebola outbreak, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO. The UN public health agency estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola.

Other complicating factors include a surge in malaria cases in the affected region, political unrest related to a controversial December [2018] presidential election and media allegations of sexual misconduct at some of treatment centers.

In late January [2019], Dr. Stacey Mearns, Ebola Response Program director for the International Rescue Committee, described the outbreak as "incredibly complex" due to conflict in the region. Mearns believes that people in the affected areas of Congo are experiencing "justifiable frustration" at the "chronic emergency" of insecurity in the region "for the last 20 years".

"A lot of attention and resources have come in for Ebola, but there's been little focus on the underlying insecurity and displacement that the population is seeing as well."

Renewed calls for an international response
-------------------------------------------
"Every time they have a concussive violent attack, there is a huge spike in cases," Gostin said, adding that there is a "very, very high risk that it could spread to Uganda and even to South Sudan, which would really simply devastate things."

For this and other reasons, he and his co-authors are asking WHO "to reconvene the emergency committee".

"And we suggest a number of concrete actions that the UN and WHO should take, such as martialing diplomatic peacekeeping resources as well as a surge of funding and a surge of personnel to the region," he said. "Without it, we've basically got a silent epidemic where we don't know the extent that is occurring and basically the international community has been asleep at the wheel, including and maybe even particularly the US."

In October [2018], shortly after WHO's announcement that the outbreak did not constitute a public health emergency of international concern, the US State Department pulled US government personnel from the region.

[Dr. Redfield, Director of CDC, is considering returning to the outbreak zone to allow CDC to contribute directly to the control efforts in areas of active transmission (see below). Although there has been improvement in the situation with decrease in case numbers in some locations, it will take extraordinary effort to completely squelch transmission in the DRC because of all the problems that have been listed - insecurity in the region, population movement, lack of trust, and more. An international response should be reconsidered. - Mod.LK]

- Fri 1 Mar 2019. CDC director planning to travel to DRC as country battles Ebola outbreak
[STAT News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/01/cdc-director-planning-to-travel-to-drc-as-country-battles-ebola-outbreak/
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is expected to travel next week to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a rare trip to the country by a U.S. official as it battles what is now the 2nd largest Ebola outbreak on record. Redfield will make the trip with the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, according to a WHO statement.

The CDC was forced to withdraw workers from the outbreak zone last year [2018] amid security concerns in the region, the scene of intense local conflicts. Those concerns have persisted.

Redfield did visit North Kivu, the province in northeastern DRC where the outbreak began, back in August [2018]. Later that month U.S. government employees in the region, including a small team from the CDC, were pulled back after an attack on security forces. They were not allowed to return.

In an interview in October [2018], Redfeld said that in discussions with other Trump administration officials, he argued that American experts should stay in the outbreak zone, despite security risks, but was overruled.

The CDC director said he would like to see "a small footprint of CDC employees" back in the area. He added: "I'd be happy to be one of them."

Since this outbreak began, 168 CDC employees have been deployed to DRC, neighboring countries or to WHO headquarters, Grusich [spokeswoman] said. And other U.S.-based personnel have been working with the Congolese health ministry, providing guidance on matters such as case investigation, contact tracing, and community engagement.

More staff may be heading to DRC soon. In early February [2019], Redfield issued a call to agency staff for volunteers for "extended deployments" to DRC, surrounding countries, and to WHO headquarters in Geneva. "We are in need of CDC staff with experience working in Africa, knowledge about Ebola, and ideally advanced French language skills," he wrote.

Excerpts
--------
Abstract: The structural features that govern broad-spectrum activity of broadly neutralizing anti-ebolavirus antibodies (Abs) outside of the internal fusion loop epitope are currently unknown. Here we describe the structure of a broadly neutralizing human monoclonal Ab (mAb), ADI-15946, which was identified in a human survivor of the 2013-2016 outbreak.

Discussion: The crystal structure of ADI-15946 Fab in complex with EBOV GPCL and accompanying biochemistry and virology presented here illuminated antigenic features of GP [ebolavirus surface glycoprotein] that dictate access to a broadly conserved but previously unappreciated epitope shared by ebolaviruses.

Author summary
--------------
Development of an effective vaccine against filovirus outbreaks is an important public health aim. Here, we demonstrate the principle that cellular responses can not only protect 2 strains of mice against a high lethal virus challenge of 1000 LD50 in the absence of glycoprotein antibodies, but a single epigraph T-cell vaccine can do so against distant members of the filovirus family, EBOV and MARV. This suggests a possibility that this candidate vaccine also protects against other known as well as yet unencountered viruses of the filovirus family; it is a pan-filovirus vaccine.
