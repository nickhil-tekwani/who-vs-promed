Los Angeles County health officials identified 4 cases of suspected wound botulism associated with heroin injection in February 2021.

Two of the cases possibly used the same heroin batch but the other 2 cases have no known connection to other cases. The sources of the heroin remain unknown and additional cases may occur. All 4 cases required intensive care treatment and had respiratory failure requiring intubation. Symptoms of the 4 cases included diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, slurred speech, facial paralysis, difficulty breathing, and muscle weakness.

In 2020 in LA County there were a total of 9 reported cases (4 confirmed and 5 probable) of wound botulism, more than twice the annual average.

Botulism is a rare, potentially fatal paralytic illness caused by the neurotoxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Wound botulism occurs when a wound is contaminated by _C. botulinum_ spores that germinate and produce toxin inside the wound. Wound botulism in drug users occurs in dermal abscesses from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection (skin or muscle "popping").

[The need for respiratory support for all 4 cases suggest that the serotype of toxin here was type A, which tends to be the most severe. Most drug-related cases of wound botulism are related to black tar heroin, which is injected subcutaneously instead of intravenously.

Black tar heroin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin) is heroin acetate. "Other forms of heroin require additional steps of purification post acetylation. With black tar, the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency, however, is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in "homebake heroin" in Australia and New Zealand, the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture of morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid.

"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose.

"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than those who inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible. Researchers at University of California at San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of 'black tar' between injections if new sterilized ones are not available.

"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di-acetyl morphine, potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine. At least one study has drawn attention to lower rates of HIV infection among drug injectors in which black tar heroin is the major form of street-available heroin, suggesting that this may be due to the need to heat black tar heroin to dissolve it (which also inactivates any HIV present in the solution).

"However, black tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of 'skin-popping,' or subcutaneous injection, predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from _Clostridium perfringens_, while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis. Tar heroin injection can also be associated with _C. botulinum_ infection." - Mod.LL
