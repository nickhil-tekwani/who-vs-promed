From: Jack Woodall <promed@usa.healthnet.org>

In the wake of the death from yellow fever of the German film-maker who
contracted the disease in West Africa (see refs. above), we are seriously
concerned about inaccurate statements in the press that he had been
vaccinated against yellow fever, and that vaccine failures have been known
to occur.
We have the statement from the head of the German yellow fever vaccine
production lab in Berlin, Dr LÂ´Age-Stehr (see ref. above) that his
vaccination certificate did not show that he had received the vaccine, in
spite of his alleged statement to his doctors that he had been vaccinated.
A search of the biomedical literature on MEDLINE (thanks to Dr Marjorie
Pollack) shows that the only instances of YF vaccine failure have been in
severely malnourished African children -- clearly not the case here. In
this age of AIDS, we might also expect to see vaccine failures in
HIV-positive people.
The vaccine is not rated effective for the first 10 days after it is given
(to allow time for immunity to develop), but is then officially good for 10
years, and in fact studies have shown that it is still effective in many
people for 35 years, and probably for life.
But the fact is, there is no evidence that this patient was ever
vaccinated, and no evidence of any vaccine failure.
It would be a public service if travel agents making arrangements for
travel to countries in the yellow fever endemic zones of Africa and South
America would inform prospective passengers of the risk, & recommend
vaccination, and if those same countries would be strict about requiring
evidence of valid vaccination from travellers.
