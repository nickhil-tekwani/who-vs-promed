Scientists say unknown disease striking N.S. moose population
------------------------------
A mysterious disease is killing Nova Scotia moose, and scientific testing
has been unable to identify it, says Tony Nette, manager of wildlife
resources at the Natural Resources Department, which is responsible for
moose, deer, and bear in the province.
A total of 6 moose - 3 in the Tobiatic region, 1 near Truro, 1 in the
Advocate area, and 1 in Cape Breton (not in the Highlands) - have been
found suffering from an unknown, fatal condition.
"An otherwise apparently healthy-looking adult animal, in the prime years,
down - paralyzed in the back end - and unable to get up. They are alert and
continue to feed on anything within [their] reach," says Mr. Nette.
An unknown number have been affected, as the department has probably not
found all of the affected animals.
The condition does not appear to be so-called "moose sickness," which is
caused by a common worm found in deer. Moose afflicted by that parasite
become disoriented, unaware of what's happening around them, says Mr.
Nette, but these moose are fully alert.
According to veterinarians, complete necropsy and a battery of histology
and other tests have been run.
