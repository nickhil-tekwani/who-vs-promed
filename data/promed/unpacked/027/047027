In the new era of syphilis reemergence, it is pivotal for care providers to be cognizant of the myriad manifestations of syphilis, the great imitator.

In October 2014, a 58-year-old MSM [man who has sex with men] presented with a 2-week history of sore throat and left otalgia [earache]. On examination he had left tonsillitis.

All lab investigations were negative, except for syphilis serology (positive TP-PA [_Treponema pallidum_ particle agglutination assay] and a VDRL [venereal disease research laboratory] titre of 16) and a tonsillar swab for syphilis PCR using 3 specific targets.

He had no other signs and symptoms indicative of secondary syphilis and denied anal sex but admitted to perform oral sex 5 weeks prior to onset his sore throat/otalgia. This case report has recently been accepted for publication in Journal of Clinical Microbiology.

This case highlights not only the unusual manifestations of the great imitator but also emphasizes the availability of other diagnostic modalities, PCR being amongst the most important ones during primary syphilis, as an adjunct to serology.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Kamran Kadkhoda for his submission of this case.

The _Treponema pallidum_ particle agglutination assay (also called TPPA test) is an agglutination assay used to detect antibodies directed against the causative agent of syphilis, _Treponema pallidum_. Nontreponemal tests, such as venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and rapid-plasma-reagin (RPR), are simple, inexpensive, and are often used for screening, but, because the antibodies they detect are not specific for syphilis, they can produce false-positive results. VDRL and RPR have their antibody titer reported quantitatively.

Syphilis may result in 3 classic stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary syphilis. Oropharyngeal lesions can occur in all stages of syphilis. In primary syphilis a painless indurated ulcer, the chancre, appears at the site of exposure, such as, in the oropharynx, 14 to 21 days after that exposure. If untreated, the lesion heals on its own in 3 to 8 weeks. In primary syphilis, the TPPA should be positive, but the VDRL or RPR may be initially nonreactive, because treponemal antibodies appear earlier than nontreponemal antibodies (and usually remain detectable for life, even after successful treatment.) By 3-4 weeks after appearance of a chancre, the VDRL and RPR should be positive in all patients with primary syphilis in a titer of at least 1:4.

Secondary syphilis occurs 4 to 10 weeks after appearance of the chancre. There may classically a disseminated, symmetric, papular rash that involves the trunk, palms, and soles, with generalized lymphadenopathy, often accompanied by mild symptoms of headache, malaise, and fever. Patients may also develop hepatitis, arthritis, and gastrointestinal, kidney, eye, hearing and central nervous system involvement. Oropharyngeal lesions of secondary syphilis include mucous patches. In secondary or early latent syphilis, the VDRL and/or RPR tests are positive, usually with a titer of 1:32 or higher. The chancre and the oropharyngeal lesions in secondary syphilis contain numerous spirochetes and are highly contagious.

Tertiary syphilis may also produce lesions, such as, destructive granulomas (gummata), in the oropharynx.

The cause of the patient's otalgia (ear pain) is not discussed in the case report above. We are not told if there were accompanying hearing or vestibular problems or if there was evidence of meningeal involvement. Otalgia can be a manifestation of neurosyphilis with cranial nerve involvement (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11055060). Also, we are not told of the patient's HIV status or response to therapy. (The presence of ulcerative lesions of syphilis increases the risk of acquiring HIV 2- to 5-fold.) - Mod.ML
