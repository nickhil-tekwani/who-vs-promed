Routine surveying in the Tararua district has picked up a strain of bovine
tuberculosis in a pig which had not been found before in the North Island.
The survey, carried out to confirm whether the East coast region was free
of the disease, looked at the wild animal population in the Akitio and
Herbertville areas.

Animal Health Board regional coordinator Terry Hynes says DNA testing has
shown that the strain of tuberculosis (TB) the boar was infected with is
similar to that found on the South Island's West Coast. Mr Hynes says as
that particular type had not been seen in the North Island before it's
likely the animal was brought in from elsewhere and illegally released in
the area.

He is urging hunters not to move wild pigs between regions, which he says
is common practice in some areas, but can carry fines of up to NZD 5000
[USD 3600].

Mr Hynes says the annual bovine TB testing requirements may still be scaled
back, but further surveys may be needed before that can happen.

[Swine can contract bovine tuberculosis (_Mycobacterium bovis_) from direct
contact with infected cattle. Like cattle, swine may also contract the
avian form of TB -- _M. avium_ serotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 -- the serotypes
responsible for about 85 per cent of the swine tuberculosis in the US, and
probably New Zealand. Surveillance is usually through slaughter. - Mod.TG
