A foodborne illness outbreak that sickened 300 people at a popular North Carolina church barbecue was caused by a bacterium that commonly develops when foods are prepared in large quantities and kept warm for a long time before serving. The bacterium -- _Clostridium perfringens_ -- was found in the Brunswick stew that was served at the 1 Nov 2018 Poplar Tent Presbyterian Church BBQ in Kannapolis, the Charlotte Observer reported.

The paper reported that Cabarrus county health officials also tested the barbecue pork, cole slaw, and barbecue sauce that was served at the event, but only the Brunswick stew cultures revealed the presence of the sickening bacteria. "People infected with _C. perfringens_ develop diarrhea and abdominal cramps within 6 to 24 hours (typically 8 to 12 hours)," the Cabarrus Health Alliance said in a statement on Fri 17 Nov 2018. "The illness usually begins suddenly and lasts for less than 24 hours."

In a 5 Nov 2018 statement, the county agency said it had received "over 200 emails reporting for 468 people," according to the Observer. "Of those, 62 per cent reported being ill and 38 per cent reported no symptoms." That percentage of reported illnesses totals 290 people.

The church has hosted the late-fall event for more than 70 years. Anyone who brought home leftovers was urged to throw those items in the garbage.

[Unlike staphylococcal foodborne illness, in which the preformed toxin is ingested, in _C. perfringens_ disease the enterotoxin is formed _in situ_ in the gastrointestinal tract. The following discussion was obtained from a previous version of the FDA Bad Bug Book (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf):

"1. Name of the organism
_Clostridium perfringens_ is an anaerobic, Gram positive, spore-forming rod. It is widely distributed in the environment and frequently occurs in the intestines of humans and many domestic and feral animals. Spores of the organism persist in soil, sediments, and areas subject to human or animal fecal pollution.

"2. Nature of acute disease
Perfringens food poisoning is the term used to describe the common foodborne illness caused by _C. perfringens_. A more serious but rare illness is also caused by ingesting food contaminated with type C strains. The latter illness is known as enteritis necroticans or pig-bel disease.

"3. Nature of disease
The common form of _C. perfringens_ poisoning is characterized by intense abdominal cramps and diarrhea, which begin 8-22 hours after consumption of foods containing large numbers of those _C. perfringens_ bacteria capable of producing the food poisoning toxin. The illness is usually over within 24 hours, but less severe symptoms may persist in some individuals for 1-2 weeks. A few deaths have been reported as a result of dehydration and other complications.

Necrotic enteritis (pig-bel) caused by _C. perfringens_ is often fatal. This disease also begins as a result of ingesting large numbers of the causative bacteria in contaminated foods. Deaths from necrotic enteritis are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very rare in the USA.

Infective dose: The symptoms are caused by ingestion of large numbers (greater than 1 000 000) vegetative cells. Toxin production in the digestive tract (or in test tubes) is associated with sporulation. This disease is a food infection; only one episode has ever implied the possibility of intoxication (that is, disease from preformed toxin).

"4. Diagnosis of human illness
Perfringens poisoning is diagnosed by its symptoms and the typical delayed onset of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the toxin in the feces of patients. Bacteriological confirmation can also be done by finding exceptionally large numbers of the causative bacteria in implicated foods or in the feces of patients.

"5. Associated foods
In most instances, the actual cause of poisoning by _C. perfringens_ is temperature abuse of prepared foods. Small numbers of the organisms are often present after cooking and multiply to food poisoning levels during cool down and storage of prepared foods. Meats, meat products, and gravy are the foods most frequently implicated.

"6. Relative frequency of disease
Perfringens poisoning is one of the most commonly reported foodborne illnesses in the USA. There were 1162 cases in 1981, in 28 separate outbreaks. At least 10-20 outbreaks have been reported annually in the USA for the past 2 decades. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of persons are affected. It is probable that many outbreaks go unreported because the implicated foods or patient feces are not tested routinely for _C. perfringens_ or its toxin. CDC estimates that about 10 000 actual cases occur annually in the USA.

"7. Course of disease and complications
The disease generally lasts 24 hours. In the elderly or infirm, symptoms may last 1-2 weeks. Complications and/or death only very rarely occur.

"8. Target populations
Institutional feeding (such as school cafeterias, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, etc.) where large quantities of food are prepared several hours before serving is the most common circumstance in which perfringens poisoning occurs. The young and elderly are the most frequent victims of perfringens poisoning. Except in the case of pig-bel syndrome, complications are few in persons under 30 years of age. Elderly persons are more likely to experience prolonged or severe symptoms.

"9. Food analysis
Standard bacteriological culturing procedures are used to detect the organism in implicated foods and in feces of patients. Serological assays are used for detecting enterotoxin in the feces of patients and for testing the ability of strains to produce toxin. The procedures take 1-3 days."

The FDA discussion notes that deaths from necrotic enteritis (pig-bel syndrome) are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very rare in the USA. The following is a paper regarding a case of pig-bel:

Gui L, Subramony C, Fratkin J, Hughson MD. Fatal enteritis necroticans (pigbel) in a diabetic adult. Mod Pathol. 2002; 15(1): 66-70; http://www.nature.com/modpathol/journal/v15/n1/full/3880491a.html:

"Abstract
---------
Enteritis necroticans is a segmental necrotizing infection of the jejunum and ileum caused by _Clostridium perfringens_, type C. The disease occurs sporadically in parts of Asia, Africa, and the South Pacific, where it primarily affects children with severe protein malnutrition. The disease is extremely rare in developed countries, where it has been seen primarily in diabetics. 2 cases have previously been reported in the United States, one in a child with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. A 66 year old woman with a 12 year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus developed severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea after eating a meal of turkey sausage. She died unattended at home. An autopsy showed peritonitis and segmental necrosis of the jejunum and ileum. Microscopic examination showed Gram-positive club-shaped bacilli consistent with clostridia coating a necrotic mucosa. Products of _cpa_ and _cpb_ genes of _C. perfringens_, type C were identified in the necrotic jejunum by polymerase chain reaction amplification."
