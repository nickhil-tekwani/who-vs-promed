2 cases of dead animals in the village of Elenovo [in the municipality of Popovo] are not from anthrax infection, according to laboratory results. District Governor of Targovishte Svetlin Bonev announced the information, speaking for FOCUS News Agency. "The animals suffered from a certain disease, which is not anthrax, but has not been identified yet," Mr Bonev explained.

He added that there were no other cases of dead animals after the above-mentioned 2.

"All necessary preventive measures have been taken. There is a 14-day quarantine period underway," the District Governor commented further.

[The original report (20150917.3652696) stated that samples had been taken from "a calf with worsened health condition" but did not state that it had died. Apparently 2 animals were sick on the original farm visit but the condition has not spread. I did wonder about the 1st report, as it described a sick calf and in my experience calves are rarely reported with anthrax; if anything they might die of starvation when their mother has died. And as a "calf" might in reality have been a yearling, I let it pass, as it is better to get a report out and if necessary correct later than to pass on it and miss reporting what was a positive case.

What happened here, I suspect, is that the original diagnosis was made on the basis of a stained blood smear but the laboratory failed to confirm it. This happens. In my experience stained blood smears carry a risk of 20 percent false positives. The good news is that 329 cattle and 533 sheep in the village were vaccinated.
