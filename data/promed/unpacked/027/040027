At a USDA public meeting last week, Dr. Fred Angulo of CDC presented new data
about consumer preferences for degrees of doneness in burgers and the
connection to recent outbreaks in ground beef.
1996 data showed 68% of cases and 65% of controls ate ground beef in the 5
days surrounding [?] an E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. (Odds ratio = 1)
16% of cases and 3% of controls reported eating pink [not thoroughly cooked]
ground beef (odds ratio = 3.2).
He also reported _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreaks in the past years [were related]
more frequently to restaurants, but are now more frequently [related] to
homes.
In a 1994 study, 80% of cases ate hamburgers at home and those becoming ill
were more likely to have handled raw product.
The 1996 FOODNET data showed 27% of 8,500 surveyed said they preferred pink
burgers, and 11% of those eating burgers, ate them pink.
