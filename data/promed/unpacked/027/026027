The nerve agent used to poison Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was detected on an empty water bottle from his hotel room in the Siberian city of Tomsk, suggesting he was poisoned there and not at the airport as first thought, his team said on Thursday [17 Sep 2020]. Navalny fell violently ill on a domestic flight in Russia last month [August 2020]and was subsequently airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Laboratories in Germany, France, and Sweden have established he was poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent, though Russia denies this and says it has seen no evidence.

A video posted on Navalny's Instagram account showed members of his team searching the room he had just left in the Xander Hotel in Tomsk on 20 Aug 2020, an hour after they learned he had fallen sick in suspicious circumstances.

"It was decided to gather up everything which could even hypothetically be useful and hand it to the doctors in Germany. The fact the case would not be investigated in Russia was quite obvious," the post said.

It showed his team bagging several empty bottles of "Holy Spring" mineral water, among other items while wearing protective gloves.

"Two weeks later, a German laboratory found traces of Novichok precisely on the bottle of water from the Tomsk hotel room," the post said.

"And then more laboratories having taken the analyses from Alexei confirmed the suspect bottle was what poisoned Navalny. Now we understand: it was done before he left his hotel room to go to the airport."

Navalny is the most prominent political opponent of President Vladimir Putin.

The global chemical weapons agency, the OPCW [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons], said on Thursday [17 Sep 2020] Germany had asked for its assistance in investigating.

Russia has carried out pre-investigation checks but said it needs to see more medical analysis before it can open a formal criminal investigation.

[Novichok is a very potent nerve agent capable of being absorbed through intact skin. Hopefully, if the substance was in the bottle, the victim would have noticed the broken seal on the bottle before drinking the product.

I wonder what other hotel items, or personal items, they will find with this chemical on them? - Mod.TG]
