Indonesia: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 29
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 16-year-old female from West
Java Province developed symptoms on 30 Dec 2007, was hospitalized on
4 Jan 2008 and is currently in the hospital. Investigations found a
history of deaths in chickens in the case's neighborhood in the 2
weeks preceding her onset of symptoms.
Of the 117 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 94 have been fatal.

[This is the official WHO confirmation of the 117th human case of
avian influenza in Indonesia; the number of fatalities remains at 94.
In the previous post in this thread I erroneously suggested that the
suspected case in West Java would become the 95th death. Donna
Eberwine-Villagran has alerted me to the incorrectness of this
statement as the patient remains alive. - Mod.CP]
