Officials from the California Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections are investigating the presence of deadly Legionnaires' disease bacteria at a Central Valley prison. Last month [March 2019], one inmate at the California Health Care Facility in Stockton (CHCF) died of the disease -- considered a severe form of pneumonia -- and a 2nd inmate tested positive for the bacteria but is now in stable condition.

Corrections officials had thought the bacteria were isolated to one housing unit where the 2 inmates lived, but new testing this week found traces of it in the water supply at the site in addition to 2 neighboring youth correctional facilities.

In response to the preliminary test results, CDCR is discontinuing the use of potable water at the facilities, providing bottled water to staff and inmates, installing self-filtering showerheads and increasing education efforts on the bacteria, according to a press release from the department.

Corrections officials also revealed in their release that nearly 30 inmates at the Stockton prison have pneumonia. As of Thursday [18 Apr 2019], 26 out of those 29 patients tested negative for Legionnaires' disease.

Legionnaires' disease does not spread from person to person; it is contracted from the spread of _Legionella_ bacteria through water vapor. The bacteria can grow in both potable and non-potable water systems. The disease is considered particularly dangerous for older people and those with underlying health issues, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

CHCF houses some 2600 inmates needing medical or mental care, many of whom are elderly and especially vulnerable to the disease. "We're talking about hundreds of people who are housed in what are rightly considered medical inpatient units, where the necessity for sanitation is of obvious importance," said Steven Fama, an attorney with the nonprofit Prison Law Office.

In many cases, the medical care that inmates receive at CHCF is a matter of life and death, according to Fama who stressed that it will be incumbent upon corrections officials to make sure that care continues to be provided as they work to mitigate the bacteria's presence at the facility.

In 2015, nearly 80 inmates were sickened during a Legionnaires' outbreak at San Quentin State Prison. Fama -- who inspected the conditions within San Quentin at the time -- said CHCF is an entirely different situation. "Whereas at San Quentin the medical staff could appropriately shift almost all its attention to surveillance and treatment, at Stockton the focus has to be broader because there are many people with complex medical situations who need ongoing care," he said. Fama said he visited CHCF on Friday [19 Apr 2019] to "see and hear firsthand" how corrections officials are responding to the situation.

According to CDCR, visitors will still be allowed to enter the Stockton facility as officials continue to investigate the bacteria's presence. Notices will be posted at entrances and information provided to visitors about the disease, officials said. California Correctional Health Care Services, California Department of Public Health and San Joaquin County Public Health are all assisting CDCR in their investigation at CHCF and the neighboring youth facilities.

[_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C [77-104 F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described [Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJMc1505356. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume sterile water only until _Legionella_ becomes undetectable by culture of the hospital water.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 2 cases of legionnaires' disease at the California Health Care Facility in Stockton, California will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

The California Health Care Facility, Stockton (CHCF) "provides medical care and mental health treatment to inmates who have the most severe and long-term needs. The 54-building complex provides housing and treatment for 2951 inmate-patients provided by a professional health care staff of 2500" (https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Facilities_Locator/CHCF.html). - Mod.ML
