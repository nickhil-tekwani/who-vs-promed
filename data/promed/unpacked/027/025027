As of this afternoon [14 Sep 2020], there have been 506 confirmed cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport illness in Canada linked to a _Salmonella_ outbreak associated with onions. Officials in the U.S. have not posted an outbreak update since 1 Sep [2020]. The total in Canada has increased by 49 people since the most recent update from the Public Health Agency of Canada on 31 Aug [2020]. The 506 confirmed patients are spread across several Canadian provinces: British Columbia has 116; Alberta 292; Saskatchewan 34; Manitoba 25; Ontario 14; Quebec 24; and Prince Edward Island 1.

On the USA side of the border, according to a 1 Sep [2020] update, there are at least 1012 sick people across 47 states with _Salmonella_ infections linked to onions.

Thomson International, Inc., of Bakersfield, CA, shipped the implicated onions and has initiated recalls in both countries. Other companies that use Thomson as a supplier have also recalled onions and related products.

Investigations by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the USA Food and Drug Administration initially showed a link between the illnesses and red onions, but because of the way onions are grown, harvested, and packed, other onion types, such as white, yellow, or sweet yellow, are also likely to be contaminated.

Public health officials in the U.S. report that 34 illness clusters have been identified in 13 states of the implicated states. Information was collected on 23 of the 34 clusters at restaurants and grocery stores. Information from these clusters shows that many ill people ate red onions and other types of onions.

Investigations conducted by USA state and federal officials determined that all 23 restaurants and grocery stores specifically identified as having served or sold red, yellow, or white onions: 17 of the 23 (74%) served red onions, 13 (57%) served yellow onions, and 10 (43%) served white onions.

Of those patients interviewed so far in the U.S., 90% report they specifically remember eating onions or foods containing onions during the days before they developed symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection.

Thomson International, Inc., of Bakersfield, California, [is] a likely source of red onions.
