Rural outbreak of anthrax
-------------------------
An outbreak of anthrax occurred on 20 Aug 2009, in the partido
(district) of Carlos Tejedor (Paraje (village): Curary) in the
province of Buenos Aires killing 6 adult cattle -- British breed of
cattle n.o.s., 4-5 years old. The affected herd has 1300 head.

Suspecting a clostridial cause the veterinarian had carried out a
careful necropsy. However the animals had died suddenly with a bloody
extravasation from their natural openings (mouths, nose, anus,
vagina). Following standard Argentine procedure he submitted
metacarpal bones and _Bacillus anthracis_ was recovered from the
medullae. The herd had not been vaccinated and had no prior history
of this disease. However this part of Buenos Aires province has had
an ongoing drought problem for over a year.

All the carcasses were quickly burnt. There were no human cases involved.

[For those interested, a 'partido' is an administrative subdivision
of the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. They are formally
considered to be a single municipality, but usually contain one or
more population centers (that is, towns and cities). These are
distinct from all other provinces of Argentina, which call their
1st-level subdivisions 'departamento' (see Departments of Argentina),
and are further subdivided into distinct municipalities. See
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partido>.
