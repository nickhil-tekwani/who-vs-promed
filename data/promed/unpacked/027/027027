Cases mount in shigellosis outbreak
-----------------------------------
Hundreds of families are dealing with an ongoing outbreak of shigellosis, a
diarrhea-causing illness most often found among toddlers.
Cincinnati and Hamilton County health officials had issued public warnings
about shigellosis last month to day-care centers, swimming pool operators
and the public because 130 cases of the illness were reported in May. Since
then, 341 more cases were reported in June and another 64 have been
confirmed as of Tuesday [10 Jul 2001.
That totals 574 cases so far this year, more than 30 times more than last
year's total and more than twice as many as any local previous outbreak in
the past 14 years, according to the Cincinnati Health Department, which is
leading the local effort to stop the illness.
The outbreak could last another few months, said Dr. Judith Daniels,
medical director for the department.
The vast majority of cases have been concentrated in Hamilton County,
including Springdale, Norwood, Sharonville and nearly every Cincinnati
neighborhood. None has been reported in Northern Kentucky and only a few
have been spotted in Butler and Warren counties, said Dr. Daniels.
Most cases have involved diaper-wearing toddlers who are spreading the
illness in day-care settings and among their families. So far, few if any
cases have been linked to eating contaminated food or swimming in
contaminated water, Dr. Daniels said.
According to state law, children with shigellosis cannot return to day-care
centers until after they've completed a 5-day course of antibiotics, waited
2 days, and then provided 2 stool sample tests showing no signs of the
bacterium.
While the number of cases in Cincinnati is fairly high, isolated
shigellosis outbreaks have occurred regularly in Ohio.
Last year, officials reported 125 cases in Erie County in northeast Ohio,
according to the state health department. In 1999, 149 cases popped up in
Lorain County. And in 1998, 200 cases were reported in Cuyahoga County. In
all 3 years, most Ohio counties saw fewer than 10 cases a year, and many
saw none at all.
