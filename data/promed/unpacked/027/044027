Two serious tick-borne diseases have surfaced in Minnesota, and one
[Rocky Mountain spotted fever] claimed the life of a child in Dakota
County this month [July 2009], state health officials said Wednesday
[29 Jul 2009]. The diseases -- Rocky Mountain spotted fever and
Powassan encephalitis -- are rare in Minnesota but pose grave risks
to patients who contract them.

One type of encephalitis, also known as Powassa (POW) disease, struck
a child in Cass County last year [2008] and an adult in the same
county this year [2009], the department said. Both patients were
hospitalized with severe neurological symptoms and require ongoing
care, the department said.

Since this encephalitis virus was first identified in 1958 in
Powassan, Ontario, about 50 cases have been reported in the United
States and Canada. The patients in Minnesota represent the
western-most human cases identified in North America, state health
officials said. Signs and symptoms of Powassa disease appear within 2
weeks of an infectious tick bite. Many patients never see the tick
that bit them.

People with POW encephalitis or meningitis may have fever, headache,
vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, speech
difficulties, and memory loss. Long-term problems are common, and
about 10 percent of reported cases result in death.

"Although we believe that the overall risk of POW diseases is low in
our state," said Dr Ruth Lynfield, Minnesota's state epidemiologist,
"it is important to take measures to prevent tick bites and to seek
prompt medical care if you develop illness soon after spending time
in tick habitat." To prevent tick-borne diseases, people are
encouraged to use tick repellents containing DEET (up to 30 percent
concentration) or permethrin.

[Powassan virus is a flavivirus and a member of the tick-borne
encephalitis (TBE) antigenic complex. Powassan virus causes severe
encephalitis in humans with a high incidence of neurologic sequelae
and up to 60 percent case-fatality rate.

Powassan virus infection appears to be one of the least common causes
of arbovirus encephalitis reported in cases from the United States
and Canada, ranking behind LaCrosse, St Louis, and eastern and
western equine encephalitis. However, Powassan virus and eastern
equine encephalitis have the dubious distinction of having the
highest case-fatality rates and are associated with a very high
incidence of neurologic sequelae.

Humans are accidental victims when they enter into areas where the
virus, the arthropod vector (an ixodid tick) and the vertebrate
natural hosts coexist. Among the most commonly implicated natural
hosts are the woodchuck and snowshoe hare. However, other animals
that humans come into contact with including coyotes, foxes,
raccoons, and skunks have shown serological evidence of infection.
Serologic studies have been positive in up to 3 percent of the
population in certain northern Ontario communities, suggesting that
infection without encephalitis can occur in humans (Ralph, 1999).

Patients with Powassan encephalitis -- often children -- present in
May through December after outdoor exposure and an incubation period
thought to be approximately one week. Powassan encephalitis is
severe, and sequelae are common. Powassan virus can be transmitted in
less than 15 minutes of tick attachment.
