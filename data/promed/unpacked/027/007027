Ebola haemorrhagic fever in South Sudan - WHO update 8
------------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 6 Jul 2004, the health authorities in Yambio County and the team
assisting them in the outbreak have reassessed the number of cases of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever (EHF), in view of additional laboratory results from the
WHO Collaborating Centre at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), United States. As a result of the reclassification, 17 cases and 7
deaths of EHF have now been reported. 13 of the cases are
laboratory-confirmed and 4 are epidemiologically linked.
The most recent death reported occurred on Sat 26 Jun 2004 in the Yambio
hospital isolation ward, and no further cases have been reported since
then. Contact follow-up in Yambio county is no longer being carried out as
the last case was reported and isolated on Mon 14 Jun 2004.
Surveillance and social mobilization activities are continuing.

[On 10 Jun 2004 WHO reported 30 cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever, a figure
that was revised down to 18 cases on 20 Jun 2004, 12 cases having been
re-diagnosed as measles. The case number has been further reduced to 17.
There has been one further death since 20 Jun 2004; however, no further
cases are being followed up, and the outbreak appears to have been
contained successfully. - Mod.CP]
