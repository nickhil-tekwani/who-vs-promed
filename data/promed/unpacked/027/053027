Across the Irish Sea, a strategy aimed at controlling bovine
tuberculosis (bTB) spread in cattle and badgers appears to be
working. Yet this did not stop the UK's bTB advisers from concluding
that badger culling cannot "meaningfully contribute to the future
control" of the disease in Britain.
A decade ago, the UK and the Republic of Ireland both had tough
decisions to make about how to deal with rising incidences of bovine
TB in cattle and the potential role played by badgers in spreading
it. The UK set up the Randomised Badger Culling Trials (RBCT) in 1998
to gauge the impact of badger culling on bTB incidence. During the 10
years it was taking to find no solutions to the problem, a ban was
imposed on badger controls outside the trial areas. Meanwhile, bTB
incidence was trebling from just over 700 confirmed herd outbreaks in
1998 to around 2000 in 2005 and 2006.
Ireland took a different approach. Shorter and more straightforward
trials between 1997 and 2002 convinced the Government that the only
way it was going to get on top of the bTB problem was to tackle both
sources of infection. An interim badger culling strategy was put in
place, while resources were pumped into establishing a longer-term
vaccination policy. Since 1998, the number of cattle bTB reactors in
Ireland has fallen by 46 per cent. While acknowledging that the
badger culling is only one of a number of contributing factors, Irish
Agriculture Minister Mary Coughlan said recently she was "satisfied
that the badger removal policy had made a significant contribution to
the improvement of the situation. A pragmatic response, based on
sound science, to a complex problem," was how she described the
approach, in response to attacks from badger welfare groups.
Surely this must all be of interest to Hilary Benn and his new team
at Defra as they become the latest Ministers to grapple with the bTB
conundrum? After all, his predecessor David Miliband had showed a
keen interest in the Irish work and promised to look at "all the
available evidence" in making a decision on badger culling.
Not so, says the Independent Scientific Group on bovine TB, which has
gone out of its way to stress that the Irish experience is not
relevant to the UK. Presenting his report at an open meeting in
London, ISG chairman John Bourne played down the success of badger
culling in Ireland, suggesting it was not having the impact the
figures coming out of there suggested. More importantly, differences
in badger populations, environmental conditions, farming practices,
trial design, capture methods and social attitudes add up to make the
Irish trial and policy irrelevant to the UK, he said. Plus, he said,
the current Irish badger culling policy "seeks to eliminate badgers
from 30 per cent of the land mass," a situation that would be
"politically unacceptable" in the UK.
Contacted by Farmers Guardian, Ireland's deputy chief veterinary
officer Michael Sheridan agreed that the Irish experience could not
be used as the basis for a specific culling policy in the UK, echoing
some of the reasons outlined by the ISG. But what became clear as he
outlined how Ireland has set about tackling the problem is that the
UK has an awful lot to learn from its attitudes and broad approach.
Mr Sheridan explained how the approaches differed from the start.
"While the RBCT was comparing policy options, we had a very simple
experiment to assess whether the disease in badgers was a constraint
to making progress on the bovine side. In the Four Area trials
(1997-2002), we took badgers out of an area as far as possible, and
it showed clearly that if you do, that you make significant progress
on the bovine side. Existing measures begin to work and you go well
beyond where you are." While the RBCT showed only marginal benefits
from culling, in the Irish Four Areas trial, it was associated with a
60 per cent drop in bTB in cattle herds under restriction.
Mr Sheridan said this was hardly surprising, given the way the trials
were set up. The four areas chosen in Ireland were much larger than
the 100sq km RBCT areas and, unlike the RBCT, were specifically
designed to prevent the so-called "edge effect." Culling took place
within defined boundaries: where possible, natural barriers like the
sea, mountains and rivers, or otherwise artificial boundaries in the
form of culled "buffer zones." Snaring, used to capture badgers
during the trial, was more efficient than the trapping system used in
the RBCT, Mr Sheridan added. All of this, combined, crucially, with
the lower badger densities in Ireland, meant that perturbation, the
dispersal of infection by badger groups disturbed by culling, was
much less of a problem in Ireland. Hence the different results.
"We did it efficiently and effectively. Subject to the constraints
they (ISG) had, the type of study that it was, the level of
efficiency they achieved and also badger densities, they had a very
difficult job," Mr Sheridan said. "When you look at all those issues,
you cannot extrapolate one from the other."
Having established that the presence of bTB in badgers was a major
constraint to eradicating from cattle, the Irish Government was then
able to set about solving the problem. "The trials showed if you
succeed in taking badgers out of the equation, you make progress with
eradicating the disease. The next logical step was to invest in the
only long-term solution that is allowable and feasible: vaccination,
so we have put our efforts into that," Mr Sheridan said. "But that is
still a few years away, so in the meantime we have introduced an
interim culling policy." This approach enabled the Government to gain
the support of farmers and the acceptance, at least, of the public
and Irish animal welfare groups, who, he said, appreciate that
culling is a "necessary" medium-term measure while a more
"environmentally acceptable" one is developed.
Mr Sheridan refuted Prof Bourne's claims, also spelled out in the ISG
report, about the scale of the culling policy. "It's wrong to say we
are doing it over 30 per cent of the country; that is an upper limit,
and it is not a target. Currently, 11 per cent of the land mass is
subject to culling controls," he said. "It is also not eradication.
It is a reactive cull that takes place where there is clear
epidemiological evidence badgers have caused major breakdowns. We do
not see it as a long-term solution, but it is necessary until we get
a vaccination policy in place. "John Bourne may have misinterpreted
what he was told, but I am not saying he has said anything wrong. He
can say whatever he wants."
Field trials looking at the benefits of using the BCG vaccine in
badgers are due to begin early next year [2008], and the intention is
that the culling policy will be replaced by a vaccination policy
within the next 5 years. "We have done 7 to 8 years work on the BCG
vaccine, and we are pretty happy that it works," Mr Sheridan said.
Again, the contrast with the UK is stark. The doubts over the likely
efficacy, practicality and cost-effectiveness of vaccination appear
greater, the appetite for funding development in the field is less
and progress, therefore, is slower. The ISG warns of "many obstacles"
to the development of a wildlife vaccine and is not seen as anything
but a possible long-term solution in the UK.
What the Irish experience cannot tell us is whether this culling
policy or that vaccination policy would work in the UK. What it
demonstrates, however, is that where there is a will there is a way.
The Irish approach has been geared to finding solutions, backed by
common sense, science and political consensus, from the way the
trials were set up, to the decision-making process and the
development of practical policies. While the UK has waited and waited
for a trial that cynics say appears designed only to prolong the wait
further and still cannot find the political will to move forward,
Ireland has been acting. And bTB incidence is falling.
Mr Sheridan said Ireland now had a "road map." The reactive culling
policy was moving it "in the right direction" until a more
sustainable long-term solution is found. He was adamant, too, that
the Irish approach was cost-effective when placed against the "to do
nothing" approach that would see disease incidence continue to rise
in cattle. "Our policy all along has been to deal with diseases in
both species," he said. "Addressing the disease in cattle on its own
won't work; you have to deal with the badger issue in parallel. You
can't remove a herd of cattle and leave a sett of diseased badgers
behind. You have to act realistically and deal with both sides of the
problem. It is worth putting proper effort and resource into having a
healthy badger population and a healthy cattle population."
The Irish approach
. Four Area trials (1997 -2002) over large areas, using physical
boundaries and snares to capture badgers.
. Culling in trials associated with 60 per cent drop in herds under
bTB restriction.
. Badger disruption - 'perturbation' - not a major problem. 'Interim'
reactive culling policy put in place, able to cover upper limit of 30
per cent of land (currently covering 1 per cent).
. Field trials on badger vaccine to begin in February 2008, with a
view to vaccination replacing culling in 5 years.
. Number of TB rectors down from 45 000 in 1998 to 24 200 in 2006, a
46 per cent drop.
The British approach
. Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) (1998-2007) over 10
'triplet' areas made of 100 sq.km zones, not set within physical
boundaries and using cages to trap badgers.
. Reactive culling in trials associated with increased disease
incidence in cattle, proactive culling produced only very marginal benefits.
. Perturbation a major problem. Higher badger density said to partly
explain difference.
. No badger culling allowed outside trial areas since trials began.
. Badger vaccine research program but no firm plans for field trials
or wildlife vaccination policy.
. Number of confirmed breakdowns trebled from 700 in 1998 to around
2000 in 2005 and 2006.
