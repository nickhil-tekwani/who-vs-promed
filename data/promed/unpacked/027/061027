[The report deals with 2 outbreaks: the 1st one in April 2007, in the
Bazega province (central Burkina Faso); the 2nd in June 2007, in the
south-eastern province Koulpelogo, on the border with Togo. Samples
seem to have been sent to 2 OIE ref laboratories, in Spain and in
South Africa, both confirming the clinical diagnosis on similar
dates. No culling attempted; one wonders if the disease may exist in
additional locations and if a similar situation prevails in bordering
countries.
