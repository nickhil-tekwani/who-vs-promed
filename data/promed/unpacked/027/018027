Until 4 pm on [15 Sep 2008], 40 people were reported having had
dengue fever in 3 communes and towns in Dien Chau district, Nghe An province.

The province's Health Service has given guidance to the local centres
for preventive medicine to further disseminate information about the
disease [in order] to improve local awareness of prevention and
control of the disease and, at the same time, mobilize the residents
to kill mosquito larvae and clean up the environment so as to prevent
the disease from spreading.

[A dengue fever outbreak has occurred, and 40 cases have been
detected in Dien Chau district of Nghe An province in the Central
region of the country. More than 7290 cases of dengue fever have been
reported in Ho Chi Minh City and 3500 cases and 3 fatalities from
Tien Giang province during 2008. A new type of mosquito, _Aedes
albopictus_, has been detected in the inner area of the capital city
of Hanoi as well (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (13):
HCMC, Tien Giang, Hanoi, RFI 20080913.2871).

The Ministry of Health is bracing for more cases of dengue, with 815
people reported to have been affected so far since last month [August
2008], says Director of Curative Health Services Dr Ami Chandra.

Dr. Chandra said the ministry had no time frame on how long it
expects it will take to control the mosquito-born disease.

He confirmed to Fijilive that Fiji has category [dengue virus
serotype] 4 dengue, similar to the recent situation in other South
Pacific countries like Samoa, New Caledonia and Kiribati.

Dr. Tharid Ali, the Divisional Medical Officer in the Western
Division, where the disease is more prevalent, has called on members
of the public to help the ministry control the outbreak by clearing
their homes and surroundings of all mosquito breeding places.

[The dengue outbreak in Rio has continued for a long time. With
increasing temperatures and rainfall in the next coming months, one
wonders whether vector mosquito populations and dengue virus
transmission will increase.
