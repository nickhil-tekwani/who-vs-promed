From: Michael V Slayter <slaytem@doacs.state.fl.us>

The office of the Florida State Veterinarian has received many phone calls
regarding the international Paso Fino show and the Breeders Cup, both of
which are in November (Tampa and Miami, respectively), and whether the
issue of West Nile virus will restrict movement of horses into Florida. We
are NOT placing any additional restrictions on horses coming into Florida
from other states because of West Nile virus. We recommend all horse
owners continue to use good judgement, be aware of the vectors or possible
vectors of disease, and provide the best available protection to their
animals to prevent exposure at any location. We also recommend that horse
owners in areas where West Nile virus is a problem have a serum sample
collected and stored frozen by their veterinarian to serve as a baseline
for comparison if any encephalitic syndrome is suspected in the near future.
We would appreciate your help in letting equine owners and organizations in
your respective communities know the contents of this message.
