According to the Bantul Health Office, 19 people have been killed by
leptospirosis since the disease was initially found in Sedayu district
in 2009, when 10 cases and one death were reported. Leptospirosis
surged by more than 1000 percent in 2010, when 110 cases were
reported. More than 15 cases, including 4 deaths were recorded in
January 2011.

The Bantul administration says it will pay residents a bounty of Rp
500 (about 5 US cents) for every rat killed as part of a campaign to
[halt] the spread of leptospirosis in the regency.

A main thrust of the campaign, which was officially launched on
Monday [7 Feb 2011], would be to fill rat nests with water and kill
rats as they emerged, according to the administration. Thousands of
people, including civil servants, students, police officers and
Indonesian Military members, joined the drive at a number of sites.
The administration declared an emergency and launched the
extermination campaign after leptospirosis killed more than a dozen
people in the regency. "We are carrying out the mass rat extermination
to curb the leptospirosis outbreak in Bantul since the disease is
transmitted by rats," said Bantul Vice Regent Sumarno.

The administration would also spray areas where the disease was
likely to linger. "Based on its transmission history, leptospirosis
bacteria are found in livestock pens and rice warehouses.
Theoretically, we could kill the bacteria with disinfectants," Bantul
Health Office surveillance division head Bintarto said.

The surveillance division would also provide free rat poison to
residents, he added.

Bintarto said that the most effective method to curb the disease was
for people to lead healthy lifestyles, especially farmers, who were
more frequently exposed to rat urine, which carries leptospirosis.
"Residents, especially farmers, must lead a clean and healthy
lifestyle. This is the most effective method to prevent the disease,"
Bintarto said. The administration has instructed residents in areas
where leptospirosis is prevalent on how to eradicate and prevent the
disease.

Tangerang General Hospital confirmed Monday [7 Feb 2011?] it is
treating 2 flood victims for leptospirosis, a bacterial disease
carried by rats. They were likely exposed to floodwaters contaminated
with rat urine.

The results of laboratory tests on blood samples from the 2 patients
-- a [29-year-old] resident of Curug district and a [30-year-old]
resident of Rawajati district -- came back positive for leptospirosis,
an official with the city-run hospital, Sri Wahyuni, said. She said
the initial symptoms of the disease were a headache followed by
vomiting and a fever. "The [bacteria], which is also spread through
the urine of infected pigs, dogs, cats and water buffaloes, can easily
pass to humans," she said.

Earlier last week, a Jakarta hospital also treated 2 flood victims
from Krukut, West Jakarta and Karet Tengsin, Central Jakarta, for
leptospirosis.

An outbreak of leptospirosis occurred in Jakarta in March 2004,
during which 3 people died. The actual number of cases is believed to
have been higher because the disease had been overshadowed by cyclical
dengue fever.

The father [of the 29-year-old patient] said his son had complained
Saturday [5 Feb 2011?] of feeling dizzy and weak.

Merritt Clifton, who submitted the 1st news release above, correctly
comments that "my understanding of leptospirosis is that flooding rat
middens to flush out rats would be about the fastest and most
efficient means of spreading the disease that one could imagine.
Leptospirosis typically spreads in flood zones. This would amount to
manufacturing the flood."

Bantul is a town in the Bantul Regency (a political subdivision of a
province) in Yogyakarta Province, in the south-central portion of the
island of Java, Indonesia (for an administrative map of Indonesia, see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Indonesia_provinces_location_map-en.svg>.
For an interactive map of Indonesia, see
<http://www.travelpost.com/AS/Indonesia/Yogyakarta/Bantul/map/6658721>).

The regency's population is approximately 800 000
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantul_Regency>).

Tangerang, a city in the Province of Banten, Indonesia, is located
about 20 km west of Jakarta
(<http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Tangerang&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8>),
which is the capital and largest city of Indonesia, located on the
northwest coast of Java, with a 2010 population of 9 580 000
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta>). Jakarta is divided into 5
municipalities: Central, West, South, East, and North Jakarta, each
with subdivisions
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta#Administration>). Java has a
lengthy wet season that runs from October until June, which makes it
prone to flooding from swollen rivers in the wet season. Other
contributing factors to flooding in Jakarta include clogged sewage
pipes and waterways that service an increasing population (see
<http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/city/jakarta-will-never-be-free-of-flooding-expert-warns/359533>).

I certainly hope that people will be instructed to keep their free
rat poison out of the reach of children and dogs. Dogs will eat rats
that have died from poison and die themselves. - Mod.JW]
