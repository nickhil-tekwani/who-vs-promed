The number of people affected by chikungunya [virus infections] in Samoa has increased from 51 to 269 in the last 2 weeks.

The Ministry of Health Director General, Leausa Tole'afoa Dr Take Naseri, says an ongoing clean up and spraying of mosquito breeding sites is continuing with aircraft and ships being sprayed.

He says laboratory tests have shown 2 deaths thought to be caused by chikungunya [virus] were not [due to infection with that virus].

3000 people from around the world are expected in Apia from later this week for a major UN conference, and the Ministry has said it hopes to have the outbreak under control by then.

[This identical story was published in Solomon Star News today (25 Aug 2014, http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/regional/3707-samoa-records-269-chikungunya-cases), appearing in HealthMap Alerts.

The chikungunya outbreak continues to grow, now with 269 cases reported. One hopes that a prompt and aggressive clean up of breeding sites will reduce the vector mosquito population enough to halt, or at least reduce, transmission. That effort is urgent, given the beginning of a UN conference later in this week. Not only is there risk of the outbreak adversely affecting the conference, there is subsequent risk of Samoa serving as a focus of infection, with conference delegates becoming infected and taking the virus back to their home countries and initiating transmission there, if vector mosquitoes are present. - Mod.TY
