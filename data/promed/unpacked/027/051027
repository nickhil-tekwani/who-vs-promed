County closes dog park after dog contracts "flesh eating mold"
--------------------------------------------------------------
Leon County has closed Bradfordville Dog Park after a dog that having visited got sick from a "flesh eating mold."

"The County received a report of a dog believed to have contracted a naturally occurring contaminant found near ponds and wetlands," Leon County spokesperson Matt Cavell said in a statement to WCTV.

"The dog had recently visited Bradfordville Dog Park. Therefore, in an abundance of caution and to keep pets safe, the County has closed the park while analysis is underway," Cavell said.

On Twitter, County Commissioner Brian Welch said the contaminant was a possible "flesh eating mold."

Late Friday afternoon [19 Aug 2022], County Commissioner Brian Welch announced the county was planning to install fencing around the water in the park, and dogs would no longer be able to access it. Permanent signage is also being installed warning about risk of illness for dogs who enter the water. The process would be done "ASAP."

A local veterinarian told WCTV the incident is no reason for pet owners to panic. She says the mold is commonly found in stagnant water, and recommends pet owners keep their animals out of those bodies of water to prevent them from getting sick.

Veterinary information online says pythiosis is caused by an organism called _Pythium insidiosum_. The organism can affect the gastrointestinal tract or the skin. The most effective treatment is surgical removal of all infected tissues, including amputation if a limb is involved.

[GP] owns several dogs and occasionally takes them to Bradfordville Dog Park.

"It's a really good area for dogs running around and getting all that energy out," she said. She said learning about the dog's illness was concerning. "It's a pet parent's worst nightmare. You're just taking your dog to the park or out in your backyard doing anything and you see this lesion and it turns into this insane flesh-eating mold," she said.

Despite the concern, [GP] said she wasn't going to panic, and won't change any of her habits.

"The best thing you can do to protect your pups is educate yourself online through reputable sources or through your vets," she said.

A local animal clinic, Novey Animal Hospital, took to Facebook Friday [19 Aug 2022] to clarify the situation.

["_Pythium insidiosum_ is an oomycete pathogenic in mammals. The infection occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in horses, dogs and humans. Infection is acquired through small wounds via contact with water containing motile zoospores or other propagules (zoospores or hyphae). The disease, though described as emerging has in fact already been described since 1884. Depending on the site of entry, infection can lead to different forms of pythiosis i.e. a cutaneous, vascular, ocular, gastrointestinal and a systemic form, which is rarely seen. The infection is not contagious; no animal-animal or animal-human transmission has been reported so far. Therapy includes radical surgery, antifungal drugs, immunotherapy or a combination of these therapies. The prevention to contract the disease in endemic areas is difficult. Avoiding stagnant waters could be of help, although the presence of _P. insidiosum_ on grass and soil in enzootic areas renders this practice useless." (Extracted from https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20800978/)

There are other stories of dogs being affected by this agent. Two dogs were affected in Wisconsin in 2014. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24372864/)

A situation such as this is heartbreaking for the owner, and likely for the pet. However, animals (and people) can learn to manage without a limb. And certainly, it may be better than death, but it can be as hard on the owner as it is on the pet, to learn to do with 3 limbs.

Recently, there were Blue-green toxic algae cases reported in some dogs. This is another water case.

Please remember, however refreshing the lake, or pond or other body of water looks for your pets to play in, they may not be a healthy situation. Give your pets a small pool in the yard, with water changed daily. Take a portable water dish and bottled water for your pets when you are out hiking or camping. Do not assume a lake, pond, or stream is safe for you or your pet to drink from. - Mod.TG
