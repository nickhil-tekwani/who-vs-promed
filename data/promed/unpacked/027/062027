[Yellow fever (YF) virus transmission remains active and geographically widespread in Nigeria so far this year (2022). In September 2022, there were 153 suspected YF cases of which none died and one case was confirmed. For the current year (2022), cumulatively there were 1601 suspected cases with 15 deaths, 15 presumptive cases and 7 cases were confirmed. The YF vaccination coverage in Nigeria is 63%, less than the 80% needed for adequate prevention (see Yellow fever - Africa (11): WHO, east, west and central Africa 20220903.8705390). One hopes that the vaccination planned in the next steps will increase coverage significantly. Inclusion of YF in routine childhood vaccination programs in areas where YF is endemic should effectively provide immunity for the population for the long term. - Mod.TY
