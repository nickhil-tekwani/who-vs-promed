On 8 Jul 2010, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH)
notified CDC [Centers for Disease for Disease Control Prevention] of
a case of laboratory-confirmed measles in an unvaccinated airline
passenger aged 23 months (1). The child had arrived hours earlier on
a flight from Switzerland and was contagious during the flight. After
obtaining the flight manifest, CDC shared locating information with
relevant state health departments; of 31 passengers considered
exposed (i.e., seated within 2 rows and any infant seated anywhere on
the airplane), 29 (94 percent) were notified.

On 28 Jul 2010, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH)
notified CDC and MDPH that one of the airline contacts had developed
laboratory-confirmed measles. The ill traveler came to the United
States as a chaperone for students from Europe and Asia attending an
educational program. During 20-23 Jul 2010 (while contagious and
before being isolated), he exposed 270 students and counselors in
Massachusetts and New York. Members of this group were scheduled to
return to their home countries from 30 Jul through 16 Aug 2010.

Because exposed, susceptible persons who are incubating measles might
be infectious 5 to 21 days after initial exposure, the surveillance
period was determined to be until 14 Aug 2010 (2,3). CDC Quarantine
Stations in Boston and New York worked with NYSDOH and MDPH to assess
the immune status of contacts before permitting them to fly.
Presumptive evidence of immunity to measles was defined as 1)
documentation of at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine or
2) serologic evidence of immunity.

Of the 270 persons considered exposed, 268 (99 percent) were cleared
to fly as scheduled: 242 provided documentation of vaccination, and
26 had serologic evidence of immunity. Two persons lacked evidence of
immunity and voluntarily postponed their departures until the end of
the surveillance period. CDC requested that the airlines waive any
fees for changing flights. No febrile rash illnesses have been
reported among exposed persons.

To prevent the spread of measles, international travelers are
encouraged to have evidence of measles immunity. Persons with measles
or those who might be incubating measles should avoid travel aboard
commercial airlines until they are no longer infectious.
Organizations hosting international students should consider asking
participants to provide documentation of adequate vaccination.
