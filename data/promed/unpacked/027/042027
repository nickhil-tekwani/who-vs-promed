African Swine fever in Europe (Eastern Europe & Belgium)
-------------------------------------------
Situation assessment:
Eastern Europe is continuing to report outbreaks of ASF [African swine fever] in domestic pigs, although this appears to be restricted to the southeast countries in the region, namely Ukraine and Romania, with a small number of outbreaks reported in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Russia. However, while control efforts may be reducing incidence in domestic pigs (with the exception of Romania and Bulgaria), the wild boar population represents a significant reservoir in Eastern Europe that may hinder eradication and serve as a source for further geographic jumps, along with the potential for arthropod vectors of disease to contribute.

Conclusion:
There has been an increase in the number of outbreaks reported in domestic pigs in Eastern Europe in June [2019] compared to recent months, indicating that the disease is still present across much of the region, with large numbers of cases in wild boar continuing. Given the ongoing situation in Eastern Europe, continued reports of ASF in wild boar in Belgium, as well as the ongoing disease situation in southeast Asia, the risk therefore remains at medium for the entry of contaminated or infected products into the UK.

The risk of exposure to the pig population in the UK is still highly dependent on the level of biosecurity on individual pig premises, but is still considered to be low, although the situation is being kept under review. We will continue to monitor the situation.

We would like to highlight to all pig keepers and the public the importance of ensuring pigs are not fed catering waste, kitchen scraps, or pork products, thereby observing the swill feeding ban. All pig keepers should be aware that visitors to their premises should not have had recent contact with pigs and pig premises in the affected regions. Anybody returning from any ASF-affected area should avoid contact with domestic pigs, whether commercial holdings or smallholdings, areas with feral pigs or wild boar, until they are confident they have no contaminated clothing, footwear, or equipment. Pig keepers and veterinarians should remind themselves of the clinical signs for ASF.

We would like to remind the public that any feeding of meat products, including the feeding of swill, kitchen scraps, and catering waste, to wild boar or feral pigs is also illegal. A poster reminding pig keepers of this is available at http://apha.defra.gov.uk/documents/surveillance/diseases/african-swine-fever-poster.pdf.

[For subscribers' convenience, selected parts of the document, including information hitherto not published by ProMED-mail, are presented (references omitted).

1. Belgium and bordering countries:
-----------------------------------
"Since the 1st reported outbreak of ASF in Belgium, there have been 825 cases reported in wild boar, while domestic pigs, including the commercial sector, remain free of the disease. The original source and route of virus incursion into Belgium has not been confirmed, and investigations are continuing. As of 4 Jul 2019, the surveillance and eradication programme in Belgium has led to the sampling of 3261 wild boar, of which 825 were confirmed positive. The majority of animals sampled were within surveillance zones and close to the French border. Belgium aims to cull out the wild boar population by 31 Dec 2019 within the annexed areas.

The European Commission has confirmed that interim protective measures under 2002/60/EC Article 15 are in place, delineated by the border with Luxembourg and France. Following the presentation of their ASF-eradication plan to PAFF, Belgium has recently banned feeding and hunting of wild boar in Part II of the annexed area and limited access to the forest in the area. They have also completed a fence network on the northern, western, and southern sides of the buffer zone, with other fences to be built, to prevent the movement of potentially infected wild boar. Further control measures have been implemented to ensure domestic pigs remain ASF-free, such as preventing visitors to pig farms unless needed; raising awareness in farmers, hunters, and vets; increasing biosecurity and increased surveillance; [and] 5781 pigs tested on 1234 farms. On 28 Jun 2019, Walloon's agriculture minister extended the ASF surveillance area in the southeast of the country, closer to the border with Luxembourg, following the discovery of ASF-positive wild boar carcasses.

The number of outbreaks in wild boar continues to decrease, which could be reflecting a successful eradication programme. We will continue to monitor the situation.

France has also undertaken surveillance sampling of wild boar carcasses across the country, with the highest numbers of samples collected from wild boar carcasses along the border with Belgium, with all 337 samples negative to 4 Jul 2019."

2. Luxembourg:
----------
"Active surveillance and prevention measures have been implemented, including testing wild boar carcasses and fencing built between Luxembourg and Belgium along the Zone Blanche (white surveillance zone), which reaches into France. Hunting is carried out in about 85% of the country, and wild boar hunting is allowed throughout the year without quotas. From September 2018 to the end of April 2019, 173 carcasses collected from across the country were tested for ASF, all with negative results. On 4 and 5 Jul 2019, a wild boar hunt was organised in the surveillance ("white") zone along the Belgium-Luxembourg border in an attempt to prevent the spread of the ASF virus in to Luxembourg. During the hunt, 7 wild boar were shot, and 2 carcasses were found; though one carcass could not be tested, all other results were negative for ASF."

3. Bulgaria:
---------
"In July 2019, Bulgaria reported ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs for the 1st time since August 2018. To date, 15 outbreaks have been reported in backyard pigs, the majority of which are in close proximity to the Romanian border, and where there has been a recent increase in the number of reported outbreaks on both sides of the border. Control measures have been applied, including the culling of all domestic pigs within 3 km [1.9 mi] of outbreaks, cleansing and disinfection, clinical examinations, sampling within 10 km [6.2 mi] of outbreaks, and movement restrictions. Though epidemiological investigations are still ongoing, the most likely source of infection has been hypothesised as reintroduction of the disease via mechanical routes, e.g., contaminated vehicles. Within wild boar, the number of reported cases remains low, though this may increase with enhanced surveillance; we will continue to monitor the situation."

4. Romania:
--------
"There has been a significant increase in the number of outbreaks in domestic pigs reported by Romania, with 281 reported between June and July [2019] to date. The majority of these outbreaks have been reported in backyard small holdings, though there have been a few cases in small commercial premises (defined as having more than 60 animals). The Romanian Authorities perform controls on holdings that pose a high risk for ASF, focussing on holdings with more than 5 animals, selling without legal documents, and not notifying the National Database of pig movement. The official control campaign is underway, but results to date June 2019 demonstrated that almost 22% of holdings were non-compliant in the Part III area (European Commission, July 2019), including the feeding of pigs with household waste.

Following these results, legislative changes are being drafted on minimum biosecurity conditions, animal movements, and to establish sanctions for contraventions.

Though the identification of these non-compliant, high-risk holdings may explain in part the epidemiological situation regarding ASF in Romania, this cannot alone explain the sudden, significant increase in the number of outbreaks. EFSA has hypothesised that the existence of possible risk factors such as haematophagic insects and favourable weather conditions could have accentuated the rapid dissemination of the virus over the summer.

Elsewhere, colleagues in Denmark have demonstrated ASF infection can occur in domestic pigs following the ingestion of infected stable flies, albeit under laboratory conditions, and may explain the large number of outbreaks in the summer months."

According to a Polish media report dated 18 Jul 2019, ASF has spread further west-northwards; reportedly, a boar, confirmed as infected, was shot in Ciechanow, in the Masovian Voivodeship (north-central Poland). See map at https://tinyurl.com/y6mvxp7u. The information (in Polish; thanks to Sabine Zentis for its submission) at </https://www.farmer.pl/produkcja-zwierzeca/trzoda-chlewna/pierwszy-przypadek-asf-na-polnocnym-mazowszu-zagrozone-duze-skupisko-produkcji-trzody-aktualizacja,87325.html>, included the following comment: "This is another big leap of the virus in recent weeks. The virus has moved about 40 km [about 25 mi] to the north. Until now, the area where the mentioned case was confirmed was in the so-called yellow zone (protection zone); soon this area will be included in the restricted area (red zone)."

The report further indicated that the new focus is just 25 km [15.5 mi] from the borders of the Zuromin poviat, with the highest concentration of pig production in the country, around 600 000 kept on its territory." - Mod.AS
