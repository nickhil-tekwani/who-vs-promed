A leading meat processing firm in Bulawayo says most animals from communal farmers are being condemned and destroyed at slaughter point as they are infected with measles [bovine cysticercosis] due to poor hygiene, and farmers are losing a lot of money.

A healthy environment remains critical in livestock farming, and farmers have been reminded of the importance of a hygienic environment to prevent diseases such as measles in animals that has cost farmers thousands of dollars, as more than 10 per cent of animals that are sold as direct slaughter have been found to be infected with measles.

According to ZBC News Online, an official of the leading meat processor in the city, Rodger Tavares said it is sad that they have to destroy some carcasses due to measles, a disease that is caused by poor disposal of human waste which is later consumed by animals.

The strictness in meat inspection equally calls upon farmers to exercise total hygiene to avoid loss of revenue through destruction of the animals.

Further investigations show that the most affected farming areas are those where there is a high prevalence of small scale miners and in worm-harvesting areas, which do not have ablution facilities.

As the ranching sector goes commercial, the knowledge and structure of the market remain critical to farmers, who continue to worry about poor prices offered by buyers.

[Bovine cysticercosis, previously also coined cattle measles, is a parasitic infection of cattle caused by the larval stage (cysticercus) of the cestode _Taenia saginata_. Humans are the definitive host and harbour the adult form of the parasite in their intestines. Terminal segments containing eggs are detached from the adult parasite, and millions of eggs may be released daily to the environment. Cattle acquire the infection through the ingestion of eggs. The parasite migrates to metabolically active muscles where it develops into cysticerci, and humans get infected by consuming raw or undercooked meat containing infective cysticerci.

In cattle, natural infections are normally asymptomatic, but they cause financial losses to the cattle industry due to downgrading, condemnation, extra handling, refrigeration and transport of the infected carcasses. According to Reference 1, from which parts the above information has been extracted, the main intervention to control bovine cysticercosis in Europe is meat inspection, followed by condemnation or freezing treatment when necessary, as prescribed by European legislation. However, other measures, such as thorough cooking of meat and the compliance with the regulations on the treatment and use of wastewater and sludge, are determinant to prevent parasite transmission.
