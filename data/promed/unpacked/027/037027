State health officials are investigating an apparent _E. coli_ outbreak that has sickened 13 Minnesotans and sent 4 to the hospital. 7 of the patients reported eating at Applebee's restaurants in Woodbury [Washington County], Roseville [Ramsey County], Blaine [Anoka County], Monticello [Wright County] and Duluth [Saint Louis County] between 24-27 Jun 2014, the Minnesota Department of Health said Monday, 14 Jul 2014. But there are also several cases with no apparent connection to the restaurant chain, indicating the illnesses may have resulted from a widely distributed food product.

The 4 hospitalized patients, all of whom reported eating at Applebee's, were treated mostly for dehydration and have now been discharged, according to Stephanie Meyer, a Health Department epidemiologist. All 13 patients, ranging from ages 16 to 84, have recovered or are recovering.

According to health officials, this form of _E. coli_ 0111 is in the same family as the more well-known _E. coli_ 0157:H7. About 10 outbreaks of these strains _E. coli_ are reported in Minnesota every year, Meyer said, and the state usually sees about 20 to 30 cases of _E. coli_ 0111 total each year. "To see 13 all at once is unusual," Meyer said. "We don't know what that means yet."

Several of the patients reported eating Applebee's Oriental chicken salad, which contains cabbage, shredded carrots, crispy noodles, almonds and fried chicken. Applebee's is cooperating with the investigation, Meyer said, and has voluntarily pulled the dish from its menu and removed cabbage and shredded carrots from other items.

None of the ingredients were exclusive to Applebee's, the restaurant said in a statement Monday, 14 Jul 2014. There are no indications of _E. coli_ risk at Applebee's restaurants outside Minnesota, and all locations outside the state will continue with unmodified menu items.

"The fact that we have multiple Applebee's locations indicates that it was food that could have gone to restaurants and elsewhere," Meyer said. The state Department of Agriculture and other regulatory partners are tracing invoices to produce suppliers in an attempt to find any commonalities.

Cross-referencing produce shipments with other customers and other _E. coli_ reports can help investigators pinpoint the source of the bacteria, Meyer said. "There could be a large network involved." The investigation could take as little as a week up to a few months, depending on how complex the supply chain is, said Carrie Rigdon, supervisor of the Department of Agriculture Rapid Response Team.

There is often a delay between the time a patient notices symptoms and the time the infection is diagnosed and reported to the Health Department, Meyer said, so many more cases could still emerge.

The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) is investigating 13 cases of foodborne illness associated with a type of bacteria known as _E. coli_ O111. This form of _E. coli_ is in the same family as the more well-known _E. coli_ O157:H7. All of the illnesses were caused by the same genetic strain of _E. coli_ O111, and the ill people do not all share any obvious commonalities; these facts indicate the illnesses resulted from a widely distributed food item.

While 7 of the people with _E. coli_ O111 infections reported eating at Applebee's restaurants in Minnesota between 24 and 27 Jun 2014, there are multiple cases with no apparent connection to the restaurant. Applebee's is cooperating fully with the investigation, and as a precaution volunteered to remove the Oriental chicken salad from menus at all its Minnesota restaurants while the investigation continues. The restaurant is also removing specific ingredients of its Oriental chicken salad from other items on its menu out of an abundance of caution. Health officials are still working with Applebee's, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, and other regulatory partners to determine the cause of the outbreak.

Symptoms of illness caused by _E. coli_ O111 typically include stomach cramps and diarrhea, often with bloody stools, but only a low-grade or no fever. People usually become ill 2 to 5 days after exposure, but this time period can range from one to at least 8 days. Most people recover in 5 to 10 days. Complications from infection are more common among those with weaker immune systems, including young children and the elderly. MDH investigators note that this genetic strain of _E. coli_ O111 has not been seen in the USA previously.

4 of the 13 people who became ill were hospitalized, and all have recovered or are recovering. Diarrhea associated with _E. coli_ O111 infection should NOT be treated with antibiotics, as this practice might promote further complications. More information on _E. coli_ infection can be found at http://www.health.state.mn.us. MDH will share more information with the public as the investigation continues.

[It seems clear that the source of the EHEC is outside the restaurant chain per se, although at this point more than half of the cases are related to the chain.

As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6).

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.
