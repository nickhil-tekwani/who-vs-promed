Nearly 450 inmates required medical attention in an episode of foodborne illness at a maximum security prison in western Mexico, Jalisco state authorities said. "None of the (affected inmates) is in serious condition, nor did any require medical transfer," the state public safety office said.

Officials did not mention the name of the prison, but media accounts identified the facility as Puente Grande. Doctors and paramedics from the Jalisco health department and the municipal fire rescue services in Guadalajara and Tlaquepaque assisted the prison medical staff in treating the inmates for vomiting and diarrhea.

[There is not enough information to be able to speculate on the etiology or etiologies of this rather large event. Important information would include the incubation period from the alleged meal, the length of the illness, and whether fever was present. - Mod.LL
