Since the summer of 2005, experts have warned that deficiencies in local
sewage systems, together with the bad quality of drinking water, could
result in an outbreak of waterborne diseases. "We've observed a 30 per cent
increase in cases of waterborne diseases, especially cholera," said Dr
Muhammad Khalid, a pediatrician at the Children's Teaching Hospital in
Baghdad.
Khalid added that, since last Dec 2005, at least one child a day in the
capital had contracted some form of waterborne disease, noting that some 90
per cent of these cases were registered in the city's outskirts, where
sanitation facilities are relatively poor. "Urgent improvement to sanitation
facilities and regular rubbish collection are desperately needed in these
areas," Khalid said.
According to Dr Abdul Jalil, director of the Infectious Diseases Control
Center, the last cholera outbreak -- in Aug 2003, when 187 cases were
reported in the southern city of Basra -- was due to poor sewage and bad
water treatment. "We warned the government about this in 2005," said Jalil.
"But there have been no changes, which has caused concern among health
workers that a cholera outbreak could happen anytime."

With cholera cases reportedly on the rise in India's capital New Delhi and
503 reported so far, the Delhi government held a high-level meeting of
officials from various civic agencies and railways to review the situation.
As many as 34 cases of cholera were reported in the week up to 23 Jun 2006,
taking the total number of cases of the disease up to 503 this year, a PTI
report said here quoting Health Minister Yoganand Shastri, who chaired the
meeting.

Massakory is the chief-place of Hadjer-Lamis, a town of 630 000 inhabitants.
It is situated between Kanem (the region whose capital is Mao) and
N'Djamena, the capital of Chad. Massakory is traditionally known as the
[source] of cholera in Chad for its position at a crossroad near Lake Chad.
Cholera often occurs in Chad during the rainy season as the Massakory
populations are known to drink unsafe water directly from ponds.
The first case of cholera-like diarrhea in 2006 was reported on 7 Jun 2006,
and the government officially confirmed the outbreak of the cholera epidemic
on 13 Jun 2006. The disease spread rapidly and on 15 Jun 2006, 31 cases and
11 deaths were registered, translating into a case fatality rate of 35 per
cent.
This figure does not take into account other cases and suspicious deaths
that have not been referred to the health centers of Hadjer-Lamis.
