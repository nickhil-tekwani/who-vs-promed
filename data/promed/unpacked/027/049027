3 Exposed to Rabies After Wild Bobcat Terrorizes Town
-----------------------------------------------------
A total of 3 people in the central Arizona community of Cottonwood
were exposed to rabies after being attacked by a wild bobcat. It all
began when the animal attacked and scratched a woman who had gotten
out of her car after thinking she had hit it.

A short time later, Cottonwood police got a report of a bobcat acting
aggressively toward a woman outside a Pizza Hut. Then, about an hour
later, the bobcat wandered into the Chapparal Bar on Main Street
forcing patrons up on their barstools; 2 men were bitten before
police shot and killed the animal in the parking lot. Tests later
confirmed it was rabid.

[Most of the other rabies exposures in Arizona have been from skunks
and foxes, according to Arizona Department of Health,
<http://www.azdhs.gov/phs/oids/vector/rabies/pdf/rabies2009.pdf>
which has only confirmed 35 cases, versus the 62 reported earlier.
