Second Person in Maryland Tests West Nile Virus-positive
--------------------------------------------------------
BALTIMORE: A second Maryland person has tested positive for the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus, which has killed 9 people since it
initially appeared in the United States in 1999, state health officials
said on Fri 7 Sep 2001.
Officials identified the person only as a 63-year-old woman from Eastpoint
in Baltimore County. She was admitted to a hospital in late August and was
in stable condition, they said. The announcement came less than 24 hours
after officials said a 72-year-old Baltimore man had tested positive for
the infection, which initially appeared in New York and has now been
identified in 21 states, the District of Columbia and in southern Ontario,
Canada.
Authorities, who did not identify the man, said he suffered from other
"chronic debilitating diseases", and was in a light coma and on a
ventilator. The 2 cases are the first documented cases of West Nile virus
in humans in Maryland since the virus first began appearing in dead birds
in the region nearly 2 years ago.
