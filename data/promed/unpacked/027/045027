Kyrgyz officials say another 70 children are infected with HIV/AIDS virus
-------------------------------------------------------------
Kyrgyzstan has been testing thousands of children in the south of the country for HIV/AIDS after it emerged that dozens had been infected in hospitals in the past decade because of poor hygiene, infected blood transfusions and the re-use of needles and other medical equipment.

The Associated Press news agency quoted the Kyrgyz Ministry of Health saying last week that it has so far tested 110 000 children in the area around the cities of Osh and Jalalabad, and that it had found another 70 HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] positive children to add to the 200 cases already discovered. Several thousand more children need to be tested in the south of this rural, mountainous country.

Six health officials are already in prison serving 3 years for the infections and another 8 are waiting to stand trial . But UNICEF, the United Nation's children's organisation, has said that the infections are a failure of the national health system rather than the fault of individual doctors or nurses. In December [2011] it warned Kyrgyz officials against conducting a witch hunt against individual health workers. "It may not be a failure of a particular doctor or nurse, but rather a failure of the healthcare system as a whole to provide hospitals with the essential equipment required to prevent transmission of HIV," UNICEF said in a statement. "Placing all the responsibility on individual health care workers can only add to the ongoing tragedy and would further erode the trust between the patients and the health care system."

Kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest countries in Central Asia. In its latest data, the World Bank estimated that Kyrgyzstan spent USD 57 per person in 2009 on healthcare. Neighbouring Kazakhstan spent 6 times more per person and the United Kingdom spent an estimated UDS 3285 per person.

[Whereas Kazakhstan, the former Soviet Republic and northerly neighbour of Kyrgyzstan, has made considerable progress in improving its healthcare infrastructure, it is distressingly obvious that Kyrgyzstan has not so far made comparable progress.
