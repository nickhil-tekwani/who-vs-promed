The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) to investigate an outbreak of listeriosis cases in 5 adult Kansas residents linked to ice cream consumed from Blue Bell Creameries. Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_.

In this outbreak 5 people in Kansas have become ill and 3 deaths have been reported. Patients became ill with listeriosis after hospitalizations for unrelated causes at the same hospital. They became ill between January 2014 and January 2015 after a majority were known to have consumed Blue Bell Creameries ice cream at the hospital. The hospital was not aware of the listeriosis contamination. The outbreak was recently discovered after 2 patients were identified with the same strain of listeriosis. Further investigation identified 3 other patients with listeriosis who had been hospitalized for unrelated causes before the onset of listeriosis.

Today, the FDA warned consumers about the potential contamination in Blue Bell Creameries' products. Kansas health officials are warning consumers who have purchased the following Blue Bell Creameries novelty items and have not consumed the items to discard them: Chocolate Chip Country Cookie; Great Divide Bar; Sour Pop Green Apple Bar; Cotton Candy Bar; Scoops; Vanilla Stick Slices; Almond Bar; and No Sugar Added Mooo Bar (regular Mooo Bars are not included).

Potentially contaminated items have been pulled from retail locations by Blue Bell Creameries and are no longer available for purchase. At this time, no other products from Blue Bell Creameries have been linked to this outbreak. The FDA issued a consumer advisory about certain Blue Bell ice cream products made in Texas. The March 13 [2015] notice was issued after several confirmed cases of listeriosis in Kansas were linked to products made on a single production line at the Blue Bell Creameries plant in Brenham [Brenham is a city in east-central Texas; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenham,_Texas].

The disease primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune systems. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms begin from 3 to 70 days after consuming the bacteria. In 2014, 5 cases of listeriosis were reported in Kansas.

Anyone who believes they may have become ill with listeriosis should contact their health care provider.

In Kansas 3 people have died after eating contaminated Blue Bell Creameries brand ice cream products. A total of 5 people were infected, and the ice cream has been recalled. But how does ice cream get tainted in the first place?

The bacteria that contaminated the ice cream is called _Listeria monocytogenes_, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1600 Americans get sick from listeriosis every year. It's the 3rd leading cause of death from food poisoning. It's the same bacteria that contaminated caramel apples from California in January 2015, causing 35 people in 12 states to get sick, and killing 7.

The bacterium grows very well at refrigerator temperatures, even as low as 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that the longer ready-to-eat refrigerated foods are stored in the fridge, the more opportunity the bacterium has to grow.

"It's why it's a problem for cooler foods like ice cream and cheese," says Bill Marler, a food safety lawyer in Washington state.

The FDA was able to confirm that 3 strains of the bacteria came from a single Blue Bell production line at 1 facility in Brenham, Texas, though the agency has not disclosed a precise point of contact. Blue Bell says one of its machines produced the problem.

"Likely what happened is the piece of machinery was contaminated. The liquid form of the ice cream goes through the machine when it's not yet frozen, but around 40 degrees, and it's a great place for [_Listeria_] to grow," says Marler.

It's not the 1st time contaminated ice cream has sickened Americans. In December 2014, Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream, Inc. issued a voluntary recall of several of its ice cream, gelato, custard and sorbet products when they tested positive for _Listeria_ and sickened 2 people. In 1994, 200 000 people became ill from eating Schwan's ice cream that had been transported by a distribution truck that had previously transported non-pasteurized liquid eggs contaminated with _Salmonella_.

Other recent dairy outbreaks include a 2014 outbreak of listeriosis in cheese and dairy products produced by Oasis Brands, Inc., when 5 people became ill and 1 died. A year earlier, 6 people were infected with _Listeria_ in Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company cheese products -- one person died.

[Listeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by the bacterium, _Listeria monocytogenes_, a gram-positive bacillus that is transmitted to humans, other than newborn infants, by ingestion of contaminated food. (Neonatal listeriosis is acquired transplacentally or during or after delivery.) _Listeria_ can be found in a variety of raw foods as well as in processed foods and foods made from unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization or cooking at temperatures higher than 150 F (65 C) should kill _L. monocytogenes_. However, contamination can occur after pasteurization or cooking, and unlike many other foodborne bacteria, _Listeria_ multiply at refrigerator temperatures (between 35-38 F (2-3 C) and is reported to survive freezer temperatures (http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11102004-072203/unrestricted/Beverly_dis.pdf).

Infection with this organism results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.

Listeriosis was added to the list of nationally notifiable diseases in 2001. Almost all reported cases of listeriosis have invasive infection in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (e.g., amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html). - Mod.ML
