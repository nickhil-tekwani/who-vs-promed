[It appears vaccination has now resumed and one hopes contact tracing as well is back up. However, Crof's blog states on 2 Jan 2019: "Almost 7000 contacts have been identified, but 1000 of them are not being traced. I presume it's because some contacts are unreachable in parts of the region under Mai-Mai or ADF control, or have simply disappeared in the current turmoil. Worse yet, we have little or no idea who might be contacts of community deaths whose chain of infection is simply unknown.

The response has done an amazing job since last summer, but if contacts can't be found and monitored, the outbreak is likely to persist and spread--eventually to other parts of the DR Congo, and to neighbours like Rwanda and Uganda. That is a very alarming prospect. "(https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/01/a-worrying-aspect-of-the-ebola-response.html). - Mod.LK]

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Wed 2 Jan 2019. DRC Ebola total tops 600; vaccination team attacked
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy; abridged, edited)]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/01/drc-ebola-total-tops-600-vaccination-team-attacked
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

With 10 new Ebola infections reported on New Year's Day and today [2 Jan 2019], the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak passed the 600-case mark, as a fresh round of violence -- this time in Komanda -- injured a member of a health ministry vaccination team.

In other developments, Samaritan's Purse, a group that was instrumental in treating Ebola patients in West Africa's outbreak, announced plans to open an Ebola treatment center in the outbreak region, and Oxfam announced a suspension in activities due to continuing unrest.

Wounded vaccination worker airlifted
------------------------------------
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, was in the outbreak region yesterday [1 Jan 2019] to spend time with Ebola responders. In an update today [2 Jan 2019], Tedros said the wounded vaccination worker was airlifted out of the area for advanced care and that a missing worker has been retrieved. "My enormous respect for heroic responders who continue to save lives despite the difficult situation," he added.

Wellcome Trust Director Jeremy Farrar, MD, PhD, was on the evacuation flight and is with Tedros today [2 Jan 2019] to assess the outbreak and what extra support he can offer. Tedros also praised the work of Mike Ryan, MD, WHO assistant director-general for emergency preparedness and response, for leading teams at headquarters and on the ground, and the United Nations MONUSCO for its evacuation efforts.

New cases in 4 hot spots
------------------------
Of the 10 new confirmed cases, 3 are in Oicha, 3 in Beni, 2 in Butembo, and 2 in Katwa, the health ministry said in updates yesterday [1 Jan 2019] and today [2 Jan 2019]. The new illnesses boost the outbreak total to 608 cases, which includes 560 confirmed and 48 probable cases.

In addition, 29 suspected cases are still under investigation, a number that dropped from 54 the day before as response efforts have been hindered by violence in outbreak zones.

Officials also said that 5 more people have died from their illnesses, 3 in Beni, plus 1 each in Butembo and Oicha; 2 of the deaths occurred in the community, a factor known to increase the risk of virus spread, given that family caregivers don't have personal protective gear and because virus levels are at their highest during the severe phase of illness and at death.

The fatality count is now at 368

Regarding vaccination activities, the ministry said yesterday that protests related to a national election voting delay in some Ebola-hit areas interrupted immunization in 6 locations: Goma, Beni, Butembo, Katwa, Komanda, and Mabalako.

Samaritan's Purse to open treatment center
------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, Samaritan's Purse said yesterday [1 Jan 2019] that it will open a 20-bed treatment center, which will be housed in an emergency field hospital that was flown to Africa in November. If needed, the unit can be expanded to 60 beds. Samaritan's Purse is a nondenominational Christian international relief organization based in Boone [NC].

On the day after Christmas a 21-member disaster assistance response team left for the DRC, and since then, other staff have arrived in the country. The group said it has had a country office in the DRC for 8 years and had already been working on community awareness campaigns in the current outbreak. It has also installed 5 isolation centers and provided infection prevention and control training for 15 local health centers.

- Thu 3 Jan 2019. WHO DG concludes New Year visit to Ebola-affected areas in the DRC
[WHO, edited]
https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/03-01-2019-who-director-general-concludes-new-year-visit-to-ebola-affected-areas-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled over the New Year to Ebola-affected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to review the response at this critical phase. Efforts to end the outbreak are continuing after recent disruptions, but further interruptions could have serious consequences, he warned.

Civil unrest resulted in vandalism to an Ebola transit centre in Beni and several other health facilities last week. The insecurity slowed down vaccinations and epidemiological surveillance and follow-up for several days.

"I'm concerned about the impact of the recent disruptions at this critical moment. This outbreak is occurring in the most difficult context imaginable. To end it the response needs to be supported and expanded, not further complicated. Ebola is unforgiving, and disruptions give the virus the advantage," said Dr. Tedros.

On the 3-day mission (31 Dec 2018 to 2 Jan 2019) to Beni, Butembo and Komanda, Dr Tedros took stock of the outbreak, spent time with affected communities, and personally thanked responders for their dedication. WHO has 380 response staff in North Kivu and Ituri working together with hundreds more from the Ministry of Health and partners.

"The Ebola responders are sacrificing a lot," said Dr. Tedros. "They've worked flat-out for months, away from their families, to combat one of the world's deadliest viruses in a risky environment. I'm proud of them, and I wanted to tell them that personally over the New Year holiday."

Director of the Wellcome Trust and Chair of WHO's Research and Development Blueprint Dr. Jeremy Farrar joined the mission to see the outbreak 1st-hand. "I came away humbled by the dedication of the Ebola responders, but worried by the immense challenges they face in such a complex environment. This outbreak is in a critical phase. It is vital the international community recognizes this and ensures the DRC and WHO have the support needed to ensure this outbreak does not spiral out of control," Dr Farrar said.

Almost every new patient receives one of 4 investigational treatments, something which was never previously possible during an Ebola outbreak.

The main challenges are the security environment, pockets of mistrust among affected populations, and poor infection prevention and control in many public and private health facilities. Under the government's leadership and working collaboratively with UN and NGO partners, WHO is committed to addressing these challenges and ending the outbreak.

A Red Cross official says hundreds of refugees have crossed into Uganda from Congo [DRC] in the aftermath of that country's presidential election, heightening concerns about the possible cross-border spread of Ebola.

Irene Nakasiita, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Uganda, said [Wed 2 Jan 2019] that the influx started the day after Sun's vote and since then dozens have been arriving at a time. She said some Congolese trying to cross the border were forced back after resisting the efforts of Ugandan health officials screening people for Ebola.

[Movement of infected people is the greatest concern, especially at a time when contract tracing has been curtailed. The border controls should be helping prevent spread of Ebola virus into Uganda, but the border is porous to some extent. CBS news reports the head of the World Health Organization has asked Merck to produce more vaccine, likely out of concern the virus may spread. - Mod.LK]
