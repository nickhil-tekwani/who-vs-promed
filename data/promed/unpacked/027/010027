Massachusetts officials announced yesterday [4 Aug 2008] that they
were investigating 6 _E. coli_ O157:H7 illnesses that are linked to a
multistate outbreak, while Virginia officials report that _E. coli_
has sickened as many as 73 Boy Scouts at a camp.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) said in a press
release that it has not yet identified the source of the patients'
infections but suspects contaminated ground beef. The cases were
linked to a multistate outbreak through PulseNet, an electronic
network for sharing molecular fingerprinting (pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis) data. "These cases may be linked to 20 other cases
in several states and Quebec that were caused by the same strain of
E. coli," the release states.

But it was not clear if the statement referred to a recent 7-state
outbreak that has been tied to ground beef sold at Kroger retail
stores. That outbreak involved 49 cases in 7 states (Georgia,
Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Utah), according to
the CDC's [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] last update
on 18 JUL [2008]. The outbreak also prompted a 30 Jun 2008 recall of
531 000 pounds [approx. 240 tons] of ground-beef components by
Omaha-based Nebraska Beef Ltd. Three days later the company expanded
the recall to 5.3 million pounds [about 2404 tons].

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is working with state
officials to determine the cause of the Massachusetts cases, and
authorities collected several ground beef samples from stores and
will conduct tests this week, according to the MDPH. The MDPH said
patients range in age from 3 to 60 years old and are from 3 counties.
They reported becoming ill between 10-16 Jul 2008 and at least 5
patients were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Meanwhile, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) reported on 31 Jul
2008 that it was investigating an _E. coli_ outbreak in one of the
nation's largest Boy Scout camps, located in Goshen near the Blue
Ridge Mountains. In an update on 5 Aug 2008, the VDH said that 73
Scouts have reported illness since attending the camp, and _E. coli_
O157:H7 infections have been confirmed in 21; 8 Scouts have been hospitalized.

Dr Karen Remley, Virginia's health commissioner, said in the
statement that the majority of the sick boys are from northern
Virginia, but Scouts attending the camp came from other areas in the
state as well as Maryland, the District of Columbia, and possibly other states.

Diane Woolard, an epidemiologist with the VDH, told CIDRAP News that
laboratory studies haven't yielded any evidence that the strain
responsible for the cluster of Virginia illnesses matches the 7-state
outbreak. The VDH said samples of raw ground beef from the camp have
tested positive for an _E. coli_ O157:H7 strain that matches some of
the sick patients, the Associated Press reported on 5 Aug 2008.
However, Woolard said officials are looking at all possible exposures
and are awaiting the results of full epidemiologic and laboratory studies.

[Whether these cases are related to the recent ground beef recall
remains to be determined. - Mod.LL]

[In the earlier ProMED-mail posting on the outbreak involving the
Scouts Camp in Virginia, there were reports of "over 50" cases with 8
hospitalized cases. At that time there was confirmation of _E. coli_
O157:H7 infection in 15 cases, as compared with 21 confirmations
mentioned in the above report. - Mod.MPP]
