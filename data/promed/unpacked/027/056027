Chilli (_Capsicum annuum_; family _Solanaceae_) is an important spice crop,
being cultivated over large areas in Asia, Africa, South and Central
America, parts of USA and Southern Europe. India is the largest chilli
producer in the world, producing 1.2 million tonnes of dry chilli, from an
area of about 880 000 hectares. During the winter of 2004, a severe
phytoplasma-like disease of chilli was noticed in the Bahraich district of
Uttar Pradesh with a low incidence (ca. 5 percent of plots showed some
infection). The symptom of the disease consisted of shortening of leaves,
petioles & internodes and crowding of leaves and stunting of whole plant
(Fig. 1).

For molecular detection of the causal pathogen, the total DNA of plant
samples with or without symptoms was isolated using the protocol of Ahrens
& Seemï¿½ller, 1992. Direct PCR was carried out using the universal 16S
rDNA-specific primers P1/P6 (Deng & Hiruki, 1991), which resulted in the
production of a approx. 1.5-kb product from diseased samples but not
symptomless ones. Nested-PCR was further performed with primers
R16F2n/R16R2 (Gundersen & Lee, 1996) which gave an amplicon of the expected
size approx. 1.2 kb DNA. This product was cloned, sequenced and the data
deposited in Genbank (Accession DQ343288). A blast search revealed the
highest level of sequence identities (98 percent) with 16SrI Aster yellows
group members, such as Barley deformation phytoplasma (AY734453), Aster
yellows phytoplasma (AY665676), Valeriana yellows phytoplasma (AY102274),
Onion yellows phytoplasma (AP006628) and Silene virescence phytoplasma
(AY744070).
Previously a phytoplasma associated with chilli little leaf disease has
been detected in India by graft transmission and electron microscopy (Singh
& Singh 2000), but the causal pathogen was not characterised at the
molecular level. To our knowledge, this is the first report of molecular
detection of an isolate of Aster yellows phytoplasma (_Candidatus
Phytoplasma asteri_) infecting chilli in India.

Pigeon pea (_Cajanus cajan_; family Fabaceae) is a protein-rich pulse crop,
cultivated for its nutritive value. India contributes over 80 percent of
world production and 77.5 percent of the global hectarage (Ahlawat et al.,
2005). Pigeon pea plants growing in an experimental field at NBRI, Lucknow
in 2005 were found with typical phytoplasma symptoms that included little
leaves, shortening of internodes and petioles giving a bunchy appearance
and whole plant stunting.

DNA was extracted from infected leaves (0.5 g) and used in a simple PCR
with phytoplasma 16S rDNA primers P1/P6 (Deng & Hiruki, 1991). This
resulted in the production of a band of approximately 1.5 kb, from all 3
samples with symptoms but not from an apparently healthy sample. The PCR
products were used as templates in a nested PCR using primers R16F2n/R16R2
(Gundersen & Lee, 1996) giving a product of around 1.2 kb. This amplicon
was cloned, sequenced, with the sequence deposited in Genbank (Accession
No. DQ343287). Blast analysis showed the highest (99 percent) similarities
with Ash witches'-broom (AY566302), Hydrangea phyllody (AY265219), Maize
bushy stunt (AY265208), Epilobium phyllody (AY101386) and Onion yellows
(AP006628); all members of the 16SrI Candidatus phytoplasma asteris group
(IRPCM Phytoplasma/Spiroplasma Working Team-Phytoplasma taxonomy group,
2004). The isolate did not share any similarity with members of the
phytoplasma 16SrIX (Pigeon pea witches'-broom) gro!
up. This is the first record of pigeon pea little leaf disease in India and
the first report of an isolate of '_Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris_'
infection of pigeon pea.

[The crop plants pigeon pea (_Cajanus cajan_) and chili pepper (_Capsicum
annuum_) in Uttar Pradesh, India are shown here to be afflicted with
symptoms attributed to Phytoplasma diseases of plants. Symptoms in both
hosts included shortening of internodes and petioles giving a bunchy or
crowded appearance and whole plant stunting. The pathogen in India causing
these 2 infections has been shown for the 1st time to be the aster yellows
Phytoplasma (_Candidatus Phytoplasma asteri_). The 2 hosts examined by
this laboratory are not frequently mentioned in articles on aster yellows
Phytoplasma, making these noteworthy reports. There are over 70 posts in
ProMED-mail archives for the search term Phytoplasma, and the ones listed
in "see also:" contain reference to the aster yellows Phytoplasma.
Phytoplasmas are a group of prokaryotic, microscopic plant pathogens that
cause over 700 diseases of food, fiber and ornamental plants. They are
found mainly in the phloem sieve tubes of their plant hosts and in certain
sucking insects, which can act as vectors. These included leafhoppers
(aster yellows Phytoplasma vector), planthoppers and psyllids. They can
also be spread by grafting, by parasitic plants or by seed transmission.
Detection of phytoplasmas is by grafting to susceptible host plants,
microscopy, serology (ELISA), nucleic acid hybridization or DNA
amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Symptoms displayed
by plants infected with phytoplasmas include foliage yellowing, petal
greening, shoot proliferation, stunting, little leaf formation, necrosis
and a decline of vigor leading to death.
