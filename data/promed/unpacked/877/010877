From: David Morens <DMORENS@niaid.nih.gov>

The following is a comment from Dr. David Morens in response to previous
remarks by the Mod.CP with reference to Hand, Foot & Mouth disease [Hand,
foot & mouth disease - Japan 2000.2960; Hand, foot & mouth disease. -
Canada (Alberta & Ontario) 2000.2973, which questioned the apparent
periodicity of 3-4 year European and 5 year Japanese cycles.
****
"In the mid-1970s' I reviewed all of the U.S. national data on laboratory
isolates of all of the non-polio-enteroviruses for the period 1961-1975
(spanning the pre-EV71 era). At that time, there was little evidence for
national or regional cyclicity of non-polio enteroviruses, excepting
Coxsackie A9 and Coxsackie B5 (International Journal of Epidemiology 1979;
8:49-54, and CDC Enterovirus Surveillance Report, 1971-1975 [issued January
1977). Specifically, there was no evidence for cyclicity in the U.S. of
Coxsackievirus A16, the major cause of hand,foot and mouth disease. If
cyclicity is truly occurring in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere, we need
better epidemiologic data.
As many readers of ProMED-mail know well, regular cyclicity of epidemics of
many
viral diseases (e.g., in the pre-vaccine era, 2-3 years for measles and 6-7
years for rubella) is a predictable reflection of transmissibility and
population immunity, as well as other variables. The ProMED discussion
points out how little is known about the non-polio enteroviruses, a huge
gap in knowledge that science would do well to close.
Incidentally, when I was seeing patients with Coxsackie A16-associated
hand, foot & mouth disease during pediatric ID training, we used to call it
"hand-foot-mouth-and-butt disease" because of the frequency with which the
rash also appears on the buttocks."
