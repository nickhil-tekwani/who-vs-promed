Belgian Agriculture Ministry spokeswoman Sigrid Gevaerts said on Friday a
mysterious illness which had caused the death of 10 cows at 2 farms had
affected a third farm, killing 8 cows. She added the farm was supplied with
sugar beet pulp feed by a firm that had also supplied the other 2 affected
farms.
Gevaerts was quoted as saying, "Yesterday (inspectors) went to a farm and
they discovered 8 cows had died there in the last couple of weeks. One more
cow there was very sick and 2 were just a bit sick." In a related story,
Belgium said on Friday it had reopened 1 of 2 dairy farms which had been
closed after the deaths of 18 cows at 3 farms. Agriculture Minister Jaak
Gabriels was quoted as saying, "There is no
reason to suspect the deaths of several animals at this (reopened) farm
were caused by anything other than known animal illnesses. Extensive
research has showed there is no risk to public health."
A ministry spokesman said some of the 18 cow deaths at 2 of the affected
farms were found to have resulted from the flu.

[Cow flu? Considering the clinical signs posted previously, this mysterious
illness does not sound like flu. Perhaps, regarding disease at the
*reopened farm* the minister is referring to respiratory diseases such as
Bovine Pulmonary Adenomatosis, or Pneumonia, or maybe Bovine Respiratory
Syncytial Virus. With regard to the mysterious disease, I would wonder if
there may be some mycotoxins in the beet pulp? I do not know that testing
for mycotoxins has been performed. Mod. TG
