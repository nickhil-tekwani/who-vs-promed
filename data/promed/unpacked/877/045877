Viet Nam has temporarily suspended the use of its 1st homegrown African swine fever [ASF] vaccine after dozens of pigs inoculated with the shots died this month [August 2022], reported Reuters, citing Viet Nam's state media on Wednesday [24 Aug 2022] (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-suspends-african-swine-fever-vaccine-after-pig-deaths-2022-08-24/).

The pigs were among around 600 pigs at several farms in the central province of Phu Yen having been injected with the NAVET-ASFVAC vaccine developed by Navetco, a company owned by the agriculture ministry, reported Nhan Dan newspaper.

"We have set up a working group to travel to the province to investigate the deaths of the pigs," said an agriculture ministry official, who declined to be named, as he's not authorised to speak to media. Navetco didn't immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

African swine fever is harmless to humans but often fatal to pigs. It originated in Africa before spreading to Europe and Asia and has killed hundreds of millions of pigs.

It was first detected in Viet Nam in 2019 and forced the country to cull around 20% of its hog herd the following year [2020]. The outbreak has so far this year [2022] spread to 753 areas in 47 provinces in Viet Nam, leading to the culling of 36 500 pigs, according to the agriculture ministry.

Viet Nam in June [2022] announced that it had successfully developed a vaccine to administer to pigs to fight ASF, with the aim of becoming the 1st country to commercially produce and export it. The agriculture ministry had earmarked 600 000 doses of the vaccine for domestic use from July this year [2022].

[For some detail on the new ASF vaccine, applied in Viet Nam's pilot field trials, subscribers are referred to the commentary in ProMED post 20220807.8704921, post 20210510.8354736, and https://www.pigprogress.net/health-nutrition/vietnam-develops-an-asf-vaccine-what-is-the-context/.

The vaccine strain is the outcome of research at USDA/ARS Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). In December 2019, after years of development, the research team announced they had found a vaccine that could create sterile immunity against ASFv, based on a field isolate that was obtained from the country of Georgia. In that virus, the gene I177L was deleted (Borca MV, Rai A, Ramirez-Medina E, et al. A cell culture-adapted vaccine virus against the current African swine fever virus pandemic strain. J Virol. 2021; 95: e00123-21; https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00123-21).

Further research and trials were conducted in collaboration with the Vietnamese Department of Animal Health (DAH) and the Navetco National Veterinary Joint Stock Company. Eventually, a large-scale field trial on production pigs was undertaken in Viet Nam. In phase 1, Navetco produced 600 000 pilot vaccine doses to monitor their quality and coordinated with locales to select herds of varying sizes for pilot vaccination. The subjects selected for pilot vaccination, ranging from 8 to 12 weeks old, were kept in 24 locales in units of 4 sizes: herds with fewer than 500 pigs, 500 to 1000 pigs, 1000 to 5000 pigs, and over 5000 pigs. Contracts are made to supervise the sampling and monitor the effectiveness of the vaccine after vaccination.

According to the Vietnamese digital newspaper Nongnghiep, dated 2 Aug 2022, vaccinated pigs have exhibited a "good response." The collected information was, at that time, due to be submitted to the authorities to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine (https://vietnamagriculture.nongnghiep.vn/piloting-the-navet-asfvac-vaccine-against-african-swine-fever-d328826.html; in Vietnamese; thanks to Rapp. Mahmoud Orabi for the link).

From the current media report it is not clear if the apparent reservations are related to the vaccine's efficacy, safety, or both. According to local media (https://congthuong.vn/tam-dung-trien-khai-su-dung-vac-xin-dich-ta-heo-chau-phi-218144.html, in Vietnamese; thanks to Rapp. Mahmoud Orabi for the link), units under DAH "continue to review and re-evaluate the quality of vaccine batches used in localities; conduct in-depth testing and analysis (sick pig samples, post-vaccination pigs, vaccine samples, etc.) to have a basis for concluding the exact cause of the cases." All localities where the vaccine has been used were required to submit their reports on the situation to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development before 27 Aug 2022.

Official results of the vaccination field trials and the current investigation will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
