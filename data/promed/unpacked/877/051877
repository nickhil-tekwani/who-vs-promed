An outbreak of _E. coli_ affecting more than 100 UK people could be linked to eating contaminated mixed salad leaves. To date, 109 people are known to have caught the bug -- 102 in England, 6 in Wales, and 1 in Scotland. South-west England has been worst hit.

_E. coli_ O157 infection can cause a range of symptoms, from mild diarrhea to bloody diarrhea with severe abdominal pain. Public Health England says it has triggered heightened surveillance and is carefully monitoring the situation across the UK. Although the cause of the infection is not absolutely certain, preliminary investigations show many of the people affected ate salad, including rocket leaves [generally called arugula in the USA. - Mod.LL], prior to getting sick.

Dr Isabel Oliver, director of PHE's field epidemiology service, said: "At this stage, we are not ruling out other food items as a potential source." PHE was first alerted to the outbreak at the end of June 2016.

Dr Oliver said people could help protect themselves from possible infection by washing their hands before eating and handling food and by thoroughly washing vegetables and salads that they were preparing to eat.

_E. coli_ O157 is found in the gut and faeces of many animals, particularly cattle, and can contaminate food and water.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the source and scope of this outbreak.

Although washing produce that is to be consumed with out cooking such as salad components is advisable, it is not necessarily the case that contaminating human enteric pathogens are all removed. As demonstrated in this publication, _E. coli_ O157 can be internalized into the plant per se. How often this occurs in natural settings is unclear.

Abstract
--------
Numerous field studies have revealed that irrigation water can contaminate the surface of plants; however, the occurrence of pathogen internalization is unclear. This study was conducted to determine the sites of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 contamination and its survival when the bacteria were applied through spray irrigation water to either field-grown spinach or lettuce. To differentiate internalized and surface populations, leaves were treated with a surface disinfectant wash before the tissue was ground for analysis of _E. coli_ O157:H7 by direct plate count or enrichment culture. Irrigation water containing _E. coli_ O157:H7 at 10(2), 10(4), or 10(6) CFU/ml was applied to spinach 48 and 69 days after transplantation of seedlings into fields. _E. coli_ O157:H7 was initially detected after application on the surface of plants dosed at 10(4) CFU/ml (4 of 20 samples) and both on the surface (17 of 20 samples) and internally (5 of 20 samples) of plants dosed at 10(6) CFU/ml. 7 days postspraying, all spinach leaves tested negative for surface or internal contamination. In a subsequent study, irrigation water containing _E. coli_ O157:H7 at 10(8) CFU/ml was sprayed onto either the abaxial (lower) or adaxial (upper) side of leaves of field-grown lettuce under sunny or shaded conditions. E. coli O157:H7 was detectable on the leaf surface 27 days postspraying, but survival was higher on leaves sprayed on the abaxial side than on leaves sprayed on the adaxial side. Internalization of _E. coli_ O157:H7 into lettuce leaves also occurred with greater persistence in leaves sprayed on the abaxial side (up to 14 days) than in leaves sprayed on the adaxial side (2 days).
