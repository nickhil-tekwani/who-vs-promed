An initial probe into a private clinic in central China has found no
evidence that the clinic's needles were contaminated with hepatitis C
[virus], local officials said Monday [12 Dec 2011].

The Health Authorities in Henan province will continue to investigate
the clinic, located in the suburbs of the city of Yongcheng, where 103
people have become infected with hepatitis C [virus] after allegedly
receiving intravenous injections at the clinic.

The outbreak was 1st reported in late October (2011) in the
neighboring province of Anhui. A new source of infection has been
traced to [another source in] Yongcheng, where scores of new cases
were found after the local government launched a screening program in
the city's suburbs.

Hepatitis C is viral [infection] mainly transmitted through contact
with contaminated blood, although it can also spread through sexual
contact and from mother to child during delivery. Infections can lead
to liver cancer.

The World Hepatitis Alliance estimates that about 170 million people
have hepatitis C, while another 350 million live with hepatitis B
[virus infection] in the world.

[The report is ambiguous but appears to exonerate the 60-year-old
doctor at a privately-run village clinic in Maqiao village (Henan
province) who was suspected of causing this outbreak of hepatitis C
virus infection by reusing unsterilised needles, notwithstanding the
fact that he had practised for 4 decades in the clinic without
incident. Responsibility for the outbreak has now shifted to another
source in the same locality (Yongcheng city). The mechanism of
transmission of infection has not been revealed. Clarification of the
situation is awaited. The number of cases now appears to be in excess
of 103.

Yongcheng City is located at the easternmost part of Henan province
and at the junction of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces.
