Veterinarians who work with birds are at increased risk of infection with
avian influenza virus and should be among those with priority access to
pandemic influenza vaccines and antivirals, according to a study conducted
by researchers in the University of Iowa (UI) College of Public Health.
The investigators, led by Kendall Myers, a doctoral student in occupational
and environmental health, and Gregory Gray, MD, UI professor of
epidemiology, examined blood samples from a group of US veterinarians for
evidence of previous avian influenza virus infection. The veterinarians all
had occupational exposure to live chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese or quail.
The study showed that, compared with the control group, the veterinarians
who worked with birds had significantly higher levels of antibodies in
their blood against the H5, H6 and H7 avian virus strains, indicating
previous infections with these viruses. The infections were likely due to
the mild forms of avian influenza virus that have occasionally circulated
among wild and domestic birds in the United States, according to the
researchers. The greatest risk factor for infection reported by
veterinarians was examining birds known to be sick with influenza.
"Veterinarians and others with frequent and close contact to infected birds
may be among the 1st to be infected with a pandemic strain of influenza,
Myers said. "They have the potential to spread the illness to their
families and communities. Because of this, we suggest that veterinarians
should be considered for inclusion on priority access lists for pandemic
influenza vaccines and antivirals."
Birds are the source of all influenza viruses in all other species, the
authors noted in their study, and a better understanding of inter-species
transmission of avian influenza is a crucial component in efforts to
minimize the effects of the next pandemic. Health authorities worldwide are
closely monitoring the H5N1 virus strain that emerged in Asia as a possible
source of a pandemic.
"While these avian influenza virus infections in veterinarians were likely
mild or subclinical, the story might be very different should aggressive
avian influenza strains enter the United States like the H5N1 strains
infecting domestic birds in Asia," Gray said. "As federal officials
continue to plan for a pandemic event, it is increasingly important to
identify the best ways to protect veterinarians and other agricultural
workers most at risk for zoonotic diseases." (The study is being published
in the July 2007 issue of the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.)

[The contrary case could be made that since poultry veterinarians appear to
have developed antibody responses to a range of antigenic types of avian
influenza virus, they may be less at risk of transmitting avian influenza
than the general population and consequently less deserving of priority for
vaccination and antiviral therapy.
It should be remembered, however, that when the Netherlands was hit by an
H7N7 avian influenza outbreak in 2003, which led to the culling of some 30
million birds, active case finding was implemented among poultry workers,
poultry farmers, and their families following an increase in anecdotal
reports of health complaints from people involved in the control of the
animal epidemic. Health complaints were reported among 453 people, with
conjunctivitis the most commonly reported symptom (349 cases). Influenza A
(H7N7) was detected in 89 (19.6 percent) cases. In that outbreak, the
single human fatality was a 57 year old veterinarian who had visited
several farms with infected poultry flocks during the course of the
outbreak. - Mod.CP]
