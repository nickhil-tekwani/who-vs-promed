The newly discovered virus that led to the death of a farmer in Kansas last summer [2014] has been named the Bourbon virus, for the county where the patient lived, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment said in a statement released on Monday [22 Dec 2014]. The virus was identified by scientists at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. Dr J Erin Staples, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado, said the virus was a type of thogotovirus, part of a larger family known as orthomyxoviruses.

The illness was fast-moving and severe, causing lung and kidney failure, and shock. The man, previously healthy, died after about only 10 days in the hospital, according to Dr Dana Hawkinson, an infectious disease specialist who treated the patient at the University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City.

Researchers do not yet know whether there have been other cases in the United States. They hope to test stored blood samples from people who had similar illnesses in the past that could not be identified.

There is no treatment for the disease. The best defense is to avoid insect bites by wearing pants and long sleeves outdoors and applying bug spray that contains the repellent DEET.

The medical mystery began late last spring [2014], when the patient was admitted to the hospital with a high fever, muscle aches and loss of appetite. He worked outdoors and often had tick bites. That history and his symptoms, combined with abnormal results on blood tests -- his liver enzymes were too high, his platelets and white cells too low -- made doctors suspect tickborne diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever or ehrlichiosis. But tests for those illnesses came back negative, as did tests for another recently discovered tickborne illness caused by the Heartland virus.

But the researchers are not certain whether ticks or mosquitoes transmit the virus, or whether other animals might carry it. "We will be working with state and local health departments come springtime to do extensive field investigations," Dr Staples said.

For now, the risk to the public is low because ticks and mosquitoes are not active in cold weather. But ticks rebound earlier in the year than mosquitoes do, she said, once the temperature starts consistently reaching 55 degrees Fahrenheit [14 deg Celsius].

[We look forward to learning more about this newly discovered orthomyxovirus. Although it has not yet been definitively shown to be tickborne, a number of other tickborne viruses have emerged recently including Heartland virus and severe fever with thrombocytopenia virus (Bunyaviridae: Phlebovirus) in the US and China, respectively. In addition, other tickborne viruses such as deer tick virus/Powassan virus (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) appear to be increasing in incidence in regions of the US. - Mod.LK
