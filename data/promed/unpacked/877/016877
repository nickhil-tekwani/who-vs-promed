Throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America we are frequently faced with a
situation in which someone has been bitten by a macaque, often in a tourist
setting. Issues normally addressed by medical personnel include wound
cleansing, assessing tissue damage and preventing infections caused by
bacteria and rabies virus. _Herpesvirus simiae_, or B-virus, is now an
additional pathogen for the clinician to be concerned about. Seroprevalence
for B-virus has been reported to be 70-100% in adult macaque populations,
both wild and captive. In monkeys, latent infection with intermittent viral
shedding occurs, not unlike [herpes simplex virus (HSV) in humans. Some
have advised, however, all macaques be presumed to be shedding B-virus.
Despite the thousands of monkey-inflicted bites and scratches that occur
every year, symptomatic human infection, fortunately, is rare, with fewer
than 40 cases reported, 8 of these occurring between 1987 and 1994. Most of
these exposures are presumably occupational. When infection occurs in
humans, however, it is usually severe with a case-fatality rate exceeding
70%.
The most common human presentation is rapidly ascending encephalomyelitis
after a nonspecific prodrome, with or without typical herpetic lesions or
peripheral nerve problems. Because diagnostic evaluation of clinical cases
of aseptic meningitis do not routinely include B-virus testing, we have
some concerns that B-virus encephalomyelitis could be under-reported,
particularly in the developing world.
Most of the attention given to human B-virus infection has been directed at
occupational exposure, though the risks of nonoccupational exposure are
increasingly recognized (1). Rapid diagnosis and initiation of therapy may
be crucial in preventing severe outcomes. Antiviral drugs significantly
impact the course of human B-virus infection.
CDC-approved guidelines have been published (2) to assist medical personnel
in responding appropriately to the B-virus threat. Unfortunately, in many
overseas settings, implementing these recommendations is difficult to
impossible. Difficulties include:
a) Proper Immediate Wound Cleaning. The most critical period for preventing
B-virus infection is noted to occur in the first few minutes after
exposure. Patients are likely to report for medical care long after this
interval has past. At least 15 minutes of soaking and scrubbing is
recommended. This may exceed normal wound cleaning times at most health
care facilities.
b) Collecting adequate specimens in a timely manner, particularly from the
primate offender (2).
c) Shipping frozen specimens (minus 20C is recommended for serum and minus
80C for wound viral swabs) to an approved laboratory. Only 3 facilities in
the world are currently equipped to test for B-virus.
We recently treated a woman who was attacked by a street vendor's pet
macaque in a back alley in Jakarta, Indonesia. In this case we were able to
obtain specimens from both the human victim and the macaque (serum from
both, wound swab from the human wound; eye, mouth and rectal swabs from the
macaque). In order to ship these specimens at the required temperatures to
Atlanta, Georgia (USA)14 kg of dry ice were required along with a special
courier. The shipping costs exceeded USD 1200. The cost of running the
tests usually run in the neighborhood of USD 500.
d) Properly assessing which risk group to assign the bite victim and
initiating antiviral therapy in a timely manner. One problem with antiviral
therapy, if given inappropriately, is the potential of suppressing
serconversion and thus further complicating management.
e) In tandem with d) is the issue of deciding when to discontinue antiviral
therapy once it has been initiated.
f) Roughly half the human population posses HSV-neutralizing antibodies
that cross-react with B-virus, making the interpretation challenging in
those with negative wound viral cultures. Acute and convalescent phase sera
may attempt to address this, but false-positive reactions remain an issue.
g) Difficulty in adequately managing bites that occur in more remote
sites.For the clinician in the field, the issue of B-virus and how best to
manage macaque bites, given current recommendations and knowledge appears
to be somewhat of a Pandora's Box, the closure of which is problematic.
Risk of contracting human B-virus infection after an encounter with an
aggressive macaque may be extremely low, but the severe consequences,
should infection occur, give one pause. We welcome any enlightenment on
this issue.
