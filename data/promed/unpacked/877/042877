Summary
-------
One new confirmed case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was reported from Guinea in the week to 1 Nov [2015]. The case is the newborn child of a 25 year old woman who was confirmed as a case in the prefecture of Forecariah during the previous week. The child was delivered in an Ebola treatment centre (ETC) in Conakry and is currently undergoing treatment. The mother died after giving birth. Her other 2 young children were also confirmed as cases during the previous week and are receiving treatment. The 3 confirmed cases reported the previous week generated a large number of high-risk contacts in Forecariah who are now entering the 2nd week of their 21-day post-exposure follow-up period. On 1 Nov [2015], there were 382 contacts under follow-up in Guinea (compared with 364 the previous week), 141 of who are high-risk. Therefore, there remains a near-term risk of further cases among both registered and untraced contacts. Sierra Leone reported zero cases for a 7th consecutive week and will be declared free of EVD transmission on 7 Nov [2015] if no further cases are reported.

Case incidence has remained at 5 confirmed cases or fewer per week for 14 consecutive weeks. Over the same period, transmission of the virus has been geographically confined to several small areas in western Guinea and Sierra Leone, marking a transition to a distinct, 3rd phase of the epidemic. The phase-3 response coordinated by the Interagency Collaboration on Ebola builds on existing measures to drive case incidence to zero and ensure a sustained end to EVD transmission. Enhanced capacity to rapidly identify a reintroduction (either from an area of active transmission or from an animal reservoir), or re-emergence of virus from a survivor, and capacity for testing and counselling as part of a comprehensive package to safeguard the welfare of survivors are central to the phase-3 response framework.

The single new confirmed case reported from Guinea in the week to 1 Nov [2015] is the 10th case in the Forecariah branch of the Ratoma transmission chain, and the 4th confirmed case from the same family and household from the village of Kondeyah, in the subprefecture of Kaliah, Forecariah. Of 382 contacts under follow-up in Guinea on 1 Nov [2015], 43 were located in Conakry with 339 located in Forecariah. Of a total 141 high-risk contacts, 7 are located in Conakry with 134 located in Forecariah. In the past 42 days, 1 contact from Forecariah has been lost to follow-up.

In Sierra Leone, all contacts linked to the country's 2 most recently active chains of transmission, Bombali and Kambia, have completed 21-day follow-up. The last case to receive treatment was confirmed free of EVD after a 2nd consecutive negative test on 25 Sep [2015]. The country will be declared free of EVD transmission on 7 Nov [2015] if no further cases are reported.

Robust surveillance measures are essential to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in currently unaffected areas. Nine operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 615 new and repeat samples in the week to 1 Nov [2015]. In Liberia, 1162 new and repeat samples were tested over the same period in the country's 4 operational laboratories. 1437 new samples were collected in Sierra Leone and tested by 9 operational laboratories.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the outbreak, there have been a total of 28 571 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 1 Nov [2015], with 11 299 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). One new case was reported from Guinea in the week to 1 Nov [2015].

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 years of age are about 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone. Adults aged 45 years and above are about 5 times more likely to be affected in Guinea, and about 4 times more likely in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 1 Nov [2015]. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 513 reported deaths (table 5).

2 Nov 2015 Liberia: Analysis suggests Liberia Ebola cases higher than thought
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/11/analysis-suggests-liberia-ebola-cases-higher-thought
[According to an international group of researchers, Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in one of Liberia's hot zones last summer were likely 3 times that reported by official sources.]

3 Nov 2015 Nigeria: Metallic poisoning, not Ebola, killed UNICAL student-FG
http://punchng.com/2015/11/3397
[According to Nigeria's permanent secretary in the Federal Ministry of Health, Mr Linus Awute, the Nigerian federal government has announced that the 21 year old student, suspected and ruled-out for hemorrhagic disease as a cause of death, actually died of metallic poisoning.

The student was initially said to be suspected of having hemorrhagic fever on 7 Oct 2015. However, initial blood testing was said to be negative for Ebola virus and Lassa virus. This finding triggered the search for potentially fatal conditions outside the infectious disease category. Subsequent testing established that metallic poisoning was the cause of death.]

[Thousands of new and expectant mothers will receive free lessons as part of a new nationwide initiative led by government and development partners.]

2 Nov 2015 Sierra Leone: Health Ministry, WHO and DFID concludes assessment tour on post-Ebola preparedness in 6 districts
http://allafrica.com/stories/201511041436.html
[Senior officials from Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health and Sanitation, officials from WHO (World Health Organization), DFID (Department for International Development) and the Commonwealth have concluded a 4-day assessment tour in 6 districts to get firsthand knowledge on the level of preparedness of district health management teams (DHMTs) before the National Ebola Response Center (NERC)/MOHS transition phase starts.

The visit is, in addition to getting to 0 patient numbers, to prepare them for any future outbreak of any infectious diseases. Representatives from the 3 organizations urged Sierra Leoneans to develop clinical guidance on diagnosis and management of Ebola virus disease, and to also identify gaps tied to a budget proposal.]

3 Nov 2015 USA/Nigeria: Nigerian Ebola survivor delivered of healthy baby
http://theeagleonline.com.ng/nigerian-ebola-survivor-delivered-of-healthy-baby/
[A healthy baby girl was born to the only female doctor to survive Nigeria's Ebola outbreak. The baby was born in the United States (USA) at the Greater El-Monte Community Hospital in California. Following delivery, the baby was certified as Ebola-free.]

4 Nov 2015 USA: New study finds how African immigrants stigmatized during recent Ebola crisis
http://www.news-medical.net/news/20151104/New-study-finds-how-African-immigrants-stigmatized-during-recent-Ebola-crisis.aspx
[Researchers found in America there was stigmatization of African immigrants similar to that experienced in communities stigmatized by the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s.]

Research

3 Nov 2015: Delay in hospital admittance increases risk of death for Ebola patients during epidemics
http://www.news-medical.net/news/20151103/Delay-in-hospital-admittance-increases-risk-of-death-for-Ebola-patients-during-epidemics.aspx
[A retrospective study of Ebola epidemics in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) suggests each day of delay in being admitted to a hospital was associated with an 11 per cent increased risk of death for Ebola patients during epidemics. The data suggest rapidly-progressing outbreaks -- where a person with Ebola virus disease (EVD), on average, is likely to transfer EVD to at least 3 other people -- are swiftly brought under control. However, during the slower-paced epidemics, the national and international responses were slower, and outbreaks were longer. In addition, nearly all the epidemics in the analysis were in decline before a national or international response (that is, Ebola treatment units) were in place. In addition, the study also showed all children under the age of 2 years who contracted EVD died.]

Vaccines
--------
2 Nov 2015 Cameroon: Ebola Cameroon - Ebola virus clinical trials under way
http://allafrica.com/stories/201511021424.html
[According to the minister of public health, Andre Mama Fouda, who spoke to the press on Fri 30 Oct 2015 in Cameroon, 2 clinical trials for the possible development of a vaccine against (ChAD3) the Ebola virus have started in Cameroon. The Center Pasteur, Yaounde and the Bamenda Regional Hospital are hosting the trials, which will continue from October 2015 to October 2016. The Phase II trial calls for 3000 volunteers from countries sharing borders with the countries involved in the West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014-2015: Cameroon, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal. The vaccine was obtained from type-3 chimpanzee, and does not contain any virus able to reproduce in the human body.]

2 Nov 2015: Plymouth experts say natural animal vaccines could cure Ebola and AIDS
http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Plymouth-experts-say-natural-animal-vaccines-cure/story-28095176-detail/story.html#ixzz3qNBaib4K
[An expert review by Plymouth University scientist Dr Michael Jarvis identifies the state-of-the-art vaccines as a new and potentially powerful strategy to stop such diseases at the animal source before becoming the next human pandemic. According to Dr Jarvis: "In this review, we have explored self-disseminating vaccines as an innovative means to prevent EID transmission from animals to humans. From HIV to Ebola and SARS, highly virulent pathogens are continually emerging from animals into the human population. We suggest that state-of-the-art disseminating vaccines may have a role to play as a new and potentially powerful strategy to circumvent EID at the animal source before their establishment as the next human pandemic."]

Funding
-------
4 Nov 2015: IMF supports Liberia with post-Ebola PFM reform
http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/news/2015/11/imf-supports-liberia-post-ebola-pfm-reform
[The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has advised Liberia in measures to strengthen its economy as the economic impact of the Ebola outbreak persists. The World Bank has estimated that around USD 540 million in gross domestic product was inevitable. If approved by the IMF, Liberia should receive approximately USD 11 million from the ECF. In addition, Liberia received a USD 46 million disbursement from the IMF's rapid credit facility, USD 36.5 million from its trust for disaster recovery, and a share of USD 130 million for the worst hit countries to help it cope with the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic.]
