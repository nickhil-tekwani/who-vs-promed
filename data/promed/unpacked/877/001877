Please find below information on SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in a tiger and 2 lions at a Zoo in Sweden.

On [13 Jan 2021], The National Veterinary Institute (SVA) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in a tiger held in a Zoo in Sweden. Samples from the same animal were simultaneously sent to IDEXX laboratories, Germany, where SARS-CoV-2 also was confirmed [14 Jan 2021].

Whole-genome sequencing at the SVA showed that the virus belongs to the global lineage B1.177.21.

Necropsy was performed at the SVA on [16 Jan 2021]. Macroscopical lesions of the respiratory tract were mild and unspecific. Convincing signs of pneumonia were not seen. Some blood-tinged mucus was present in the lower part of the trachea and bronchi. Findings in other organs were preliminary considered to be age related and thus probably not related to SARS-CoV-2. Results from histological examinations are pending.

The tiger was a 17-year-old female, which was euthanised [11 Jan 2021] for animal welfare reasons due to severe respiratory and neurological symptoms, high age, and low possibilities for recovery. The symptoms started with loss of appetite [9 Jan 2021], but rapidly worsened [11 Jan 2021] in the morning and the animal was euthanised and sampled the same morning. A male tiger kept in the same enclosure as the female has shown moderate respiratory symptoms, but no neurological symptoms.

A group of lions, consisting of 2 adults and 2 subadults, kept in the same house, have also shown mild respiratory symptoms but no neurological symptoms and are otherwise clinically unaffected with normal appetite. Fecal samples from the lions, received at a later date, were also confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Staff taking care of these groups of animals also had symptoms: one of the sick persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19, while 3 more are awaiting their results.

The Zoo is closed for the season, and further internal biosafety measures have been taken by the responsible veterinarian on site.

[Infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed so far in carnivores (Order Carnivora) of 3 families, canids (dogs and raccoon dogs), felids (cats, tigers, lions, puma/cougar, and snow leopard), and mustelids (ferrets and minks). Lions and tigers experienced respiratory disease due to COVID-19 in USA at the Bronx Zoo (New York) in April 2020 and tigers with mild respiratory sings tested positive at Zoo Knoxville (Tennessee) in October 2020. Lions were infected at the Barcelona Zoo (Spain) in December 2020. All infections detected in carnivores were from animals held captive, except for the recent record of a wild mink captured and sampled in Utah (USA). The susceptibility of carnivores warrants surveillance and research in wild populations, as introduction and possible establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in those populations might result in conservation problems and/or compartments in which the virus might evolve and remain with potential for future human exposures. - Mod.PMB
