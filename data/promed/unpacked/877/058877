A disease affecting dogs -- canine circovirus -- has been pinpointed for the 1st time in the state by University of Connecticut [UConn] researchers.

Investigators at the Connecticut Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, or CVMDL, at University of Connecticut recently reported a new canine disease, identified for the 1st time in New England. The researchers represent the same group and laboratory recently reporting eastern equine encephalomyelitis in horses and birds and earlier recognized epizootic hemorrhagic disease in deer (September 2017) and West Nile encephalitis in crows (2001).

The published case report in the September 2019 edition of the Journal of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation [1] documents the death of a 5-month-old dog "originating" in Mississippi, was shelter-housed in Texas for a time, and then was "delivered" for adoption in Connecticut.

According to the researchers, the disease was characterized by severe bloody gastroenteritis and rapid progression to death. A necropsy was followed by electron microscopy and exam using molecular techniques "demonstrating a circovirus as the cause of disease and death."

"First recognized in California in 2013, the appearance of canine circovirus disease in New England, in dogs shuttled among shelters, raises concerns for dog owners and veterinarians," researchers said.

They concluded, "At this time, it is hard to know if this disease will spread, like parvovirus disease in the 1980s, or remain sporadic."

A UConn spokeswoman added, "We'll have to see if it spreads at all, that will determine how serious it becomes."

The CVMDL is part of the Department of Pathobiology in UConn's College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources.

["Circovirus may be present as a primary or co-infection with other enteric pathogens, but there is still much to learn about its significance as an enteric pathogen. Li et al (2013) documented co-infection with circovirus and canine enteric coronavirus, _Cryptosporidium_ spp, _C. perfringens_ alpha toxin, _Giardia_ spp, _Salmonella_ spp, _Campylobacter jejuni_, or _Campylobacter coli_ in 19 circovirus-infected dogs with diarrhea. Circovirus was detected in the feces of 19/168 dogs with diarrhea and 14 of 204 healthy dogs. 68 percent of dogs positive for circovirus were co-infected with at least one additional enteric pathogen.

"Circovirus infection was rumored to be the cause of dog illnesses and several dog deaths in Ohio in late August/early September 2013, but the Ohio Department of Agriculture is no longer considering it a primary cause as of 3 Oct 2013.

"In late September/early October 2013, similar illnesses were reported in dogs in Michigan. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is investigating the illnesses.

"Please note, this information is based on a very limited number of cases and may change as more is learned about this new circovirus.

"Case presentation: Dogs infected with circovirus may present with progressive vomiting, diarrhea (possibly hemorrhagic) and hematochezia. Ascites, pleural effusion, hypovolemic shock, bicavitary hemorrhage, and disseminated intravascular coagulation may also be present. According to Li et al, circovirus "should be considered in cases of unexplained vasculitis in dogs."

"If you suspect circovirus infection, please contact your state animal health authorities regarding sample submission.

"According to the report published by Li et al, examination of tissues from all infected animals revealed fibrinonecrotizing vasculitis. The location and severity of affected vessels varied among the cases, with most cases demonstrating abnormalities in the intestine and kidneys. Affected organs included the intestine, urinary bladder, spleen, liver, lungs, kidneys, heart, pancreas, adrenal glands and meninges (in a dog with tetraparesis). Lymph node necrosis was also observed in several cases and all dogs had histiocytic or granulomatous lymphadenitis in Peyer's patches. One dog hemorrhaged into the thoracic and abdominal cavities.

"Treatment: At this time, there is no indication to treat these cases any differently than other enteric infections. Because of the virus' association with fibrinonecrotic vasculitis, careful monitoring of coagulation and cardiovascular status may be necessary."
