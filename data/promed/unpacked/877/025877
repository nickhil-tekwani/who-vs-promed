A yellow fever outbreak has killed nearly 100 people over the last 7 weeks in Sudan's Darfur, the World Health Organization said, a region where fighting has undermined access to healthcare.

The mosquito-borne disease has spread throughout the remote western territory, but the reported cases have been concentrated in central Darfur, the WHO and Sudan's health ministry said in a joint statement. The statement said 329 suspected [now confirmed -- see [2] below] yellow fever cases and 97 deaths had been reported since the last week of September [2012]. The outbreak had hit the regional capitals of El Geneina and Nyala.

There is no effective treatment for the hemorrhagic fever, but there is a vaccine. Some 3.6 million people would be vaccinated in the affected areas, the statement said. It did not say how long the program would take. Nearly half the yellow fever cases were in people between the ages of 15 and 30, it said, and about a quarter were children aged 5 to 15.

Darfur has been plagued by conflict since rebels took up arms in 2003, complaining that the government had neglected the region and locked its non-Arab minorities out of power. Healthcare is provided almost entirely by aid agencies in some parts of Darfur. Hundreds of thousands of people may have died in Darfur's conflict, the United Nations and human rights groups have estimated. The government has put the death toll at 10 000.

Yellow fever in Sudan
---------------------
The Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) in Sudan has notified WHO of a yellow fever outbreak affecting 23 localities in Greater Darfur. As of 11 November 2012, a total of 329 suspected cases including 97 deaths were reported from this outbreak. Central and South Darfur have reported most of the suspected cases.

Laboratory confirmation was conducted by the WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever, the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, on 2 samples, which tested positive for yellow fever by IgM ELISA test and RT-PCR. Differential diagnosis for other flaviviruses was negative.

WHO is supporting the FMOH and other partners in the epidemiological investigation and response to the outbreak. Ongoing activities include strengthening of epidemiological surveillance, conducting entomological assessment and standardizing clinical case management. Community leaders are also being mobilized to support with raising awareness on yellow fever in the affected localities.

The government of Sudan has requested the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) to provide support for a reactive mass vaccination campaign. The YF-ICG has approved 2.4 million doses of vaccine, which are expected to arrive in the country shortly. Sudan, with support from WHO is expected to start the emergency mass vaccination campaign in the affected areas in order to protect the at risk populations and stop the spread of the disease.

The YF-ICG consists of representatives from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and WHO, which also serves as its Secretariat.

[There is now official laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis. It is to be hoped that mass vaccination will be able to begin before the end of the month. There is no news about any more cases in Khartoum. - Mod.JW
