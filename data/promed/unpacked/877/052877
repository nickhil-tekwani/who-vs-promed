Officials at the Agency Headquarters Hospital in Landikotal said on Sunday [2 Feb 2014] that they had diagnosed over 254 patients with leishmaniasis.

However, they claimed to have initiated an awareness campaign against the disease in the entire Khyber Agency. Agency Surgeon Dr Abdur Rehman told The News that health officials had detected 254 patients in Landikotal tehsil [a tehsil is an administrative division] in January 2014, which comprised mostly women and children.

The health official said that the disease is caused by the bite of sand flies, which have invaded most parts of Fata [Federally Administered Tribal Areas]. "Though we have registered and diagnosed hundreds of leishmaniasis cases in Landikotal in the past few months, the disease is rampant in most parts of Fata, as tribesmen are not fully aware about the gravity of this disease and the free treatment provided by the Directorate of Health Fata," Dr Rehman said.

He said it was unfortunate that most of such cases were laying hidden inside houses in most tribal areas due to lack of awareness among the masses. He said the disease could easily be communicated to members of a family when a sand fly bites one person in a house. Dr Rehman Afridi said the case reporting has registered a sharp rise in recent days as an effective anti-leishmaniasis campaign has been launched in all the 3 tehsils of Khyber Agency.

Regarding the root of the sand fly, he said it had come from bordering areas of Afghanistan. He said a study conducted by the department showed that most affected patients belong to border areas. Some patients at the AHQ hospital in Landikotal, however, complained that they were facing difficulties in getting free and timely treatment. They said they had repeatedly approached the medical superintendent of the hospital but to no avail.

Most of the patients belong to poor families who are unable to afford the costly treatment on their own. Local elders also demanded that the health authorities ensure timely distribution of mosquito nets. They alleged that nets were given to undeserving and comparatively well-off people instead of underprivileged people. They said that, hopefully, timely and judicious distribution would help stop leishmaniasis.

[Landikotal is located close to the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan on the Peshawar-Kabul highway.

Leishmaniasis, mainly cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL], is rampant in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Control measures completely ceased under the Taliban regime, and control measures are still grossly inadequate in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In Pakistan, CL is a major and fast increasing public health problem, both among the local Pakistani population and the Afghan refugees in camps. Its extensive spreading has been associated with mass migration, from endemic to non-endemic areas and vice versa, and with Afghan refugees from areas where CL is highly endemic. Outbreaks are frequent -- for example, in early 2011 in Mianwali, Punjab province, which is a bordering district with Kyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and probably cases have come from Afghan refugees residing in the area.

In Afghanistan, CL is well known under the name "saldana" ("that which lasts one year"). Leishmaniasis in Afghanistan was almost eradicated in the 1960s and 70s, when an extensive DDT spraying campaign greatly reduced the sandfly population. However, CL by _L. tropica_ has now returned as a major public health problem.

CL is underreported. Surveys consistently show higher case numbers than the officially reported ones. Reporting systems are weak, and many patients resort to the informal private sector because of the lack of drugs in government clinics.
