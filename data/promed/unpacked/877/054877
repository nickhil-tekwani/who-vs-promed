Canadian scientists have found evidence showing farm-raised Atlantic salmon
are passing a deadly viral disease to wild salmon in a New Brunswick river.
The Canadian research provides the first documented evidence infectious
salmon anemia (ISA)threat is real.
The discovery of ISA among fish in the waters of the Magaguadavic River,
about 10 miles east of the Maine border, could lead to restrictions on
Maine's aquaculture industry.
Federal biologists listed the threat of disease transmission from fish
farms as a major reason for their decision last week to propose Endangered
Species Act protection for wild salmon in 8 Maine rivers. A National Marine
Fisheries Service (NMFS)biologist said the Canadian findings highlight the
need for federal protection of wild salmon in Maine.
Atlantic Salmon Federation biologists spotted the disease in Magaguadavic
fish last summer. The disease was found in wild salmon and in farm-raised
salmon that had escaped into the river.
Canadian government biologists have confirmed the federation's initial
finding. Mary Colligan, the NMFS's endangered species officer for New
England said U.S. biologists have contacted officials in New Brunswick.
"Up until this time, this disease has never been found in wild salmon, so
this is new information," she said.
Fred Whoriskey Jr., the top biologist at the salmon federation, said wild
Atlantic salmon might have carried the deadly virus even before fish pens
were put up on the coasts of Maine and Canada.
But the stress of packing thousands of fish in a contained pen seems to be
what causes outbreaks, creating a risk of disease movement into wild
populations.
To contain the disease, the provincial government in New Brunswick ordered
fish farmers to destroy two million salmon and paid them $16 million in
compensation for their losses after the 1996 outbreak in Canada.
But the disease continues to spread, most recently to Deer Island in
Cobscook Bay, less than 5 miles from Maine farms.
Ed Baum, senior biologist at the Maine Atlantic Salmon Authority, said it's
only a matter of time before ISA is found in Maine. He said the disease
could be particularly devastating if it got into the federal hatchery in
Orland, where wild adult salmon are held to provide eggs for stocking in
the rivers.
Infectious salmon anemia is the second disease threat to emerge this year
for wild salmon. Biologists previously discovered an unrelated disease
called salmon sarcoma virus in fish at a federal hatchery in Massachusetts.
The fish had been taken from the Pleasant River in Washington County.
The Pleasant, 1 of 8 Maine rivers where wild salmon would be listed as
endangered under a proposal announced last week by the NMFS and U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service. The other rivers are the Narraguagus, East Machias,
Machias and Dennys in Washington County; the Sheepscot and Ducktrap in
midcoast Maine; and Cove Brook, a tributary of the Penobscot below Bangor.
The two agencies said they proposed the listing partly because of new
threats from aquaculture, including disease transmission and genetic
interbreeding between wild salmon and escaped farm fish.
