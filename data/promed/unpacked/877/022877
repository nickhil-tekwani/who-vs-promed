A Norfolk manufacturer is recalling bottles of olive oil because they
could contain potentially lethal bacteria. Seymours of Norfolk has
discovered a technical fault that may have led to some products
containing a small amount of water, which could lead to the growth of
dangerous bacteria causing botulism.

There have only been 33 recorded cases of food-borne botulism in
England and Wales during the last 25 years, with 26 of these cases
being linked to a single outbreak caused by contaminated hazelnut yoghurt.

Seymours, which is based in Bakers Road, Norwich, supplies farm shops
and delicatessens in Norfolk, Suffolk, Lincolnshire, London,
Sheffield, and Stratford-upon-Avon and has recalled 7 varieties of
infused olive oil products. The affected varieties are rosemary,
thyme, basil, garlic, lime, lemon, and chilli in 250 mL glass bottles
and from the cask.

The bottles being recalled have a 'best before date' prior to and
including March 2009. Other Seymours of Norfolk products are not
affected. Anyone who has bought any of the products listed is asked
to return it to the shop where they purchased it to receive a refund
or a bottle of olive oil and vinegar.

[The following discussion is taken from a previous ProMED-mail
posting (Botulism, bottled garlic - Denmark (03): discussion 20030209.0342):

Infused oils have previously been implicated in botulism outbreaks in
the USA and worldwide (1-4). An acidification step in the preparation
of infused oil may be necessary to prevent the potential production
of botulism toxins.

As a result of previous outbreaks in Vancouver, BC (Canada) and in
the state of New York (USA), the Food and Drug Administration Food
Code now requires 2 barriers in the destruction of spores and in the
prevention of toxin production in a commercial product of this type
(reduced oxygen packaging): 1) destruction of the spores by heat
(thermal processing) 2) inhibition of toxin production by altering
the food through acidification, controlling aw (water activity), the
use of salt and preservatives or refrigeration. Also, it is because
some single barriers can result in a product unacceptable to
consumers that multiple barriers are used. The common 2nd barrier in
infused oil of this kind is acidification via phosphoric or citric
acid, for example. The pH of the final product should be 4.6 or less.
