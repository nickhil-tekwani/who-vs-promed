[It appears there is a growing cluster of cases reported from Al Khafji city, Ash Sharqiyah (Eastern) region. Since the primary case was reported on 29 Mar 2019, there have been an additional 5 cases, 3 identified definitively as secondary cases, 2 still pending investigation. As mentioned previously, with the recent change in reporting information available on the MOH website, information is not available on type of secondary exposure, so interpretation of type of clustering is not possible (household contacts vs healthcare contacts vs community contacts of previously confirmed cases).

With these 2 additional cases, one of whom is reported as a fatal case, it brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2019 to 121, including 24 deaths (reported case fatality rate, 19.8%).
