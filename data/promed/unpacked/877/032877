Re: Rabies (EBLV-2), bat - Norway: mainland, susp. RFI
------------------------------------------------------
The Norwegian Veterinary Institute has detected European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2) in brain tissues from a Daubenton's bat (_Myotis daubentonii_). The diagnosis is based on repeated RT-PCR and partial sequencing of the gene for the nucleoprotein. This is the 1st detection of EBLV-2 in Norway.

The bat was found by a private person in the county Oppland in the southern part of Norway on 3 Oct 2015 and brought to a care center for bats that is managed by the Norwegian Zoological Society with economical support from the Norwegian Environment Agency. The bat was weak, but it drank and ate initially. Subsequently it displayed problems with moving and swallowing and eventually died 2 days after arrival at the care center. Rabies was suspected, and the bat was submitted to the Norwegian Veterinary Institute in Oslo. The autopsy revealed that the bat was in poor condition with no specific gross findings.

The official reference laboratory for rabies in the European Union, Nancy laboratory for rabies and wildlife in France, has kindly confirmed the diagnosis by detection of rabies virus and viral RNA by rabies tissue culture infection test (RTCIT) and RT-PCR respectively. Material has also been submitted to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) in Weybridge, UK for full genome sequencing as a part of an ongoing project to characterize EBLV-2 isolates from several European countries.

[The above detailed, 1sthand information, for which we are very grateful to Torfinn Moldal and the Norwegian Veterinary Institute, confirms the suspicion published in posting 20151014.3716306.

In the above posting we included the following information published by The Local ("Norway's News in English") on 19 Jul 2013: "The Norwegian health authorities fear a patient at Oslo University Hospital has died from rabies. ... The patient originally comes from Asia, but has lived in Norway for several years. A blood test one month ago [June 2013] showed rabies antibodies, which could tell of infection or of having been vaccinated against rabies in the past. The woman's family and any health care staff who came in contact with her have been vaccinated as a precaution" (see at http://www.thelocal.no/20130719/first-suspected-rabies-case-in-years). Our request for the said information is pending.
