The Parana Secretariat of Health (SESA) this Thursday (27 [Aug 2015]) confirmed a new case of Zika virus infection [laboratory confirmed? symptoms began and case notified when? - Mod.RNA].

The patient lives in Sao Miguel city, in the western part of the state, the same place where the 1st patient lives who had a confirmed [Zika virus] infection in July of this year [2015]. The disease causes a type of fever in infected individuals.

According to SESA, another 2 patients in Parana also were diagnosed with a disease. One lives in Curitiba and the other in Telemaco Borba, in the central region. However, the Secretariat stated that the 2 acquired their infection outside of Parana [Where? In which state? When? - Mod.RNA], and arrived in the state presenting with the symptoms.

[Confirmation of the 2nd case characterized the outbreak, which possibly may have much larger numbers of cases that were not detected and/or investigated. - Mod.RNA]

[Laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infections is critical because the symptoms are sufficiently similar to those of dengue and chikungunya virus infections that making a differential diagnosis is difficult on clinical grounds alone.
