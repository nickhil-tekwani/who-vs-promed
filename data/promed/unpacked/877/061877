Human case of Hendra virus infection confirmed
----------------------------------------------
Queensland Health has confirmed that a person working at veterinary clinic
on Brisbane's bayside has contracted infection with the potentially deadly
Hendra virus. The person was among a number tested for the virus after
several horses contracted the disease at a Redlands veterinary hospital. So
far all other people who had been in close contact with the sick horses
remain well.

Queensland Health's Dr Brad McCall says the worker was admitted to a
Brisbane hospital yesterday [14 Jul 2008] for observation and was allowed
to return home this afternoon. "A veterinary worker has returned home from
hospital with diagnosed Hendra virus infection and the worker remains
well," he said. "We continue to work with the staff and other people who
have been involved with this at the Redlands Veterinary clinic to monitor
their health and to assist them with any questions they have."

Queensland health minister Stephen Robertson says the department will
closely monitor the case in Brisbane, and the discovery of the virus in a
north Queensland horse. "We would be relying on the expert advice of DPI &
F [Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, Queensland] as to what
this represents in terms of incidences amongst horses, our primary concern
of course is in relation to the potential for horse to human contact and
that's where we pay most of our attention," he said.

[No clinical details of the patient are provided in this report. The
release of the patient from hospital suggests that his condition is not a
cause for concern. More precise information would be appreciated.

Previously in Queensland in 1994, a fatal infection in horses and humans
was attributed to a previously unknown paramyxovirus, now named Hendra
virus after the district of Brisbane where the outbreak occurred. Hendra
virus, together with Nipah virus, now constitutes the _Henipavirus_ genus
of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. A 2nd case of Hendra virus infection in
horses in Queensland was described in 2007 (see ProMED-mail references below).

The natural reservoir of these viruses is the fruit bat (genus _Pteropus_),
which is abundant in regions extending from the western Pacific to the
eastern coast of Africa. Serological studies have established that as many
as half the fruit bats in colonies throughout these regions may have
antibodies against this virus genus. Outbreaks of Hendra virus disease in
horses and humans, however, have been limited to the Brisbane area of
Queensland.

Hendra virus was first isolated from specimens collected during the
outbreak of respiratory and neurological disease in horses and humans in
Hendra in 1994. In that outbreak the 1st human cases of Hendra virus
disease were recognized. Of the 3 individuals known to be infected, 2 had a
respiratory illness with severe flu-like signs and symptoms. One of the 3
Hendra virus infections was marked by a delayed onset of progressive
encephalitis. Two of the 3 human patients infected with Hendra virus died.
