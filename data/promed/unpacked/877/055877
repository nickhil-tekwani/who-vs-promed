The Directorate of Health in Homs confirmed the spread of hepatitis A in the northern Homs countryside. The directorate indicated that the occurrence of many cases of the disease had been noted, which has become the talk of people in Homs countryside. Talal Mardoud, the Director of Health of Homs, said in a statement to Horrya Press that "hepatitis A started spreading 3 months ago [September 2017] and after monitoring some cases, the disease has been confirmed as it has spread in several villages and regions, including the villages of Ezzedine, Al-Saan, Al-Zaafaranah, and Houla region."

Regarding the causes of the spread of the disease, Mardoud explained that "the disease is mostly caused by contaminated drinking water and irrigating crops with contaminated water in addition to lack of awareness programs." He pointed out that the distance of the medical centers of the displaced communities has the largest role in the existence of these cases. Mardoud added that "the spread of the disease is increasing in some areas more than others, as it increased 5 times in Houla village while it increased 10 times in Al-Zaafaranah village." He explained that the treatment is symptomatic while the dangerous cases must remain in the hospital for monitoring for fear of the development of complications.

Mardoud stressed that some of the cases were treated, but 10 deaths were recorded in Al-Zaafaranah hospital among children under the age of 5 who suffered from acute liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy. Mardoud stressed at the end of his speech that it is necessary to launch awareness programs and open a specialized center for outbreaks to prevent the disease.

For his part, Abu Yousef, a nurse at Ansar Hospital in the western sector of the northern Homs countryside, said that many cases of hepatitis A were detected and were early detected and treated. He explained that the necessary instructions are provided to the parents in the region. The siege imposed on Homs countryside is one of the main reasons for the spread of diseases due to the high cost of medicines and the lack of clean potable water.

[This posting identifies the etiology of this hepatitis outbreak as hepatitis A. In the usual circumstances, hepatitis A in children tends to be mild, often totally without symptoms. In war torn Syria, however, with malnutrition and other stressors, increased morbidity and even mortality can occur.
