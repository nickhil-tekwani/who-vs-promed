The Salvadoran Ministry of Public Health confirmed two more cases of
leptospirosis, or swamp fever, on Friday, raising the number of confirmed
cases to eight. Three more possible cases are under investigation.
Ministry of Health Chief of Epidemiology Dr. Santiago Almeida said the two
confirmed cases were reported in a poor neighborhood of the western city of
Santa Ana, where the first five cases were discovered.
Another case of leptospirosis, which the Ministry of Health believes
entered El Salvador from neighboring countries where it has been epidemic,
was reported in the city of San Martin, east of San Salvador.
Dr. Almedia called on the populace to help stop the spread of the disease
by killing rats, mice, and other rodents. The rodents, along with dogs,
cows, and pigs, are the principal carriers of the disease.
At the moment, no swamp fever deaths have been reported because the cases
that have been reported were detected early enough for the victims to
receive treatment with heavy doses of antibiotics.
Health Minister Jose Lopez Beltran confirmed the first cases Tuesday.
