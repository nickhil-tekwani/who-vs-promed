Re: West Nile Virus - USA (Georgia) 20010818.1955
-------------------------------------------------
I don't want to seem like a curmudgeon (or Charlie Calisher, for that
matter) but the level of diagnostic certainty for West Nile virus
infections in general seems to be quite slippery. It is described as the
first example of a horse infected by West Nile virus and then the 30-year
old mare is said to have died. Is this a horse with West Nile virus
antibodies that was run over by a tractor? Is this a horse with flavivirus
antibodies (and all the ambiguity that implies) that died with terminal
central nervous system abnormalities? Seems to me that with all the public
and media interest and all the energy, newsprint, and electrons being
expended, there should be a clearer level of reporting in ProMED-mail.

[ProMED-mail posts press reports of extensions in the range of West Nile
virus as they become available. These reports are often deficient in
relevant detail, and cannot be immediately clarified. USDA Management
Warning No 7, which follows, supplies some but not all of the missing
information, but it was not available at the time of posting the press
report. A balance has to be struck between immediacy and accuracy. Perhaps
we err too much on the side of immediacy? - Mod.CP

Horses in Georgia and Pennsylvania Confirmed Positive for West Nile Virus
------------------------------------------------
Horses from Thomas County, Georgia, and Bucks County, Pennsylvania, have
been confirmed as positive for West Nile virus (WNV) infection. This is the
first equine case of clinical WNV infection ever detected in Georgia; this
is the first WNV-positive horse in Pennsylvania in 2001, but one equine
case of WNV infection was detected there last year.
The horse in southern Georgia was a 30-year old mare that died of
encephalitis. A definitive date of onset has not been reported, but it was
on or before 26 Jul 2001. Thomas County borders Jefferson County, Florida,
where numerous equine cases of WNV infection have been confirmed this year.
The horse in Pennsylvania is a 3-year-old filly that is recovering from her
illness. A definitive date of onset has not been reported, but it was
sometime in late July or very early August. The horse had a history of
travel from Florida about 3 to 4 weeks before onset of illness; given an
incubation period of 15 days or less for WNV in horses, infection most
probably occurred in Pennsylvania. There have been recent reports of
WNV-positive birds in Bucks County and in neighboring Philadelphia
WNV infection was confirmed in both horses at the National Veterinary
Services Laboratories (NVSL). Each had a WNV-positive IgM-capture
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and plaque-reduction
neutralization test on serum.
