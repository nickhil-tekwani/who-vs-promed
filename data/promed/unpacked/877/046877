There is an outbreak of anthrax in sheep in the Builsa North District of the Upper East Region. Radio Ghana's correspondent says about 30 sheep have been reported dead at Wiaga as a result of the disease. As of now [19 Jul 2013] no person has been reported dead.

Meanwhile, 1449 animals in the district have so far been vaccinated against the disease.

In an interview with the District Director of Agriculture, Dr Stephen Degbor, he noted that there has also been a ban on the slaughter of livestock since the outbreak of the disease. He announced that vaccination of cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs, among other animals, also took effect on the same day as the outbreak.

He added that the vaccination started from the epicenter and covers an 8 km [about 5 mile] radius.

Dr Degbor also noted that the necessary stakeholders, such as the District hospitals, have been alerted to look out for any cases of anthrax in their outfits.

Planning and doing are separate activities, but it is very clear from this report that the government response to this outbreak has been very efficient.
