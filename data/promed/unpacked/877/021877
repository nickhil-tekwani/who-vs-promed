_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _citri_ Dye 1978 (_X. axonopodis_ pv. _citri_
(Hasse 1915) Vauterin, Hoste, Kersters & Swings 1995) is the causal agent
of citrus canker. In South America the disease has been reported from
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
During 1999-2000, lesions were observed on leaves, twigs, and fruits on
cultivated citrus in the Cochabamba and Santa Cruz Departments. Lesions
were yellow/brown, raised and corky; these darkened and developed central
depressions with age. The edges of the lesions remained raised and were
frequently surrounded by a chlorotic halo. Gram negative bacteria producing
yellow-pigmented, mucoid colonies on yeast dextrose agar were consistently
isolated from the leaf lesions.
Pathogenicity testing was conducted on potted _Citrus x _Citrofortunella
mitis_ (calamondin) plants. Water-soaked lesions, 2-3 mm in diameter,
developed at the inoculation sites after 10 days and the bacteria were
consistently re-isolated from the affected tissues. Fatty acid profiles
obtained from isolates were typical of the genus _Xanthomonas_ (Saddler &
Bradbury, 2001). Additional testing with taxon-specific polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) primers (Miyoshi et al., 1998), repetitive sequence PCR
fingerprinting (Rep-PCR), AFLP and carbon source utilisation patterns
(Biolog, Hayward, CA) were conducted alongside known strains of _X.
campestris_ pv. _citri_.
The results obtained from the Bolivian isolates using taxon-specific PCR
and Biolog were consistent with membership of _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_
(Miyoshi et al., 1998; Verniere et al., 1993). These findings were further
corroborated by the fingerprinting studies, which highlighted close
similarities between the isolates and named reference material. Isolates
have been placed in the IMI culture collection, CABI Bioscience, UK (IMI
385155, IMI 185156 & IMI 385157).
Although citrus canker has been suspected in Bolivia for a number of years,
this is the first confirmed report.

[Citrus canker occurs worldwide and the pathogen may be found in southern
Asia, Japan, the Middle East, Africa, and in North and South America. The
pathogen spreads by wind-driven rain, overhead sprinklers and contaminated
equipment. Long-distance spread occurs by movement of infected planting
materials. Eradication of infected trees is the primary means of control
where the disease is not endemic, as in Florida.
In Brazil, where the disease is endemic in some regions, eradication is
difficult to justify as the only control measure. The bacterium was
reported in Sao Paulo state in 1957. Despite eradication and quarantine
measures, the pathogen spread to include the major citrus production areas
of several states in central and southern regions of the country. In those
regions, all citrus groves in which disease incidence exceeds 0.5% are
completely eradicated and in those groves where disease incidence is less
than 0.5%, all trees within 30 m of infected trees are removed and
destroyed. The integrated disease management plan that has been adopted
features rapid identification of the bacterium, planting of resistant
cultivars, application of copper solutions to kill the bacterium, and use
of windbreaks of silk oak (_Grevillea robusta_ [_Proteaceae_) to interfere
with dispersion of inoculum by windblown rain.
