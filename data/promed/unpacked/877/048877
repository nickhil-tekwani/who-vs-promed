[The neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure, can be mimicked by other diseases; a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. Although classically foodborne from ingestion of preformed toxin from inadequate preparation, botulism can also be linked to ingestion of environmental spores, especially in infants, as well as related to unsterile injections in illicit drug users.

"Ararat is a province (marz) of Armenia. Its capital and largest city is the town of Artashat. The province is named after the biblical Mount Ararat. It is bordered by Turkey from the west and Azerbaijan's Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic from the south" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ararat_Province). - Mod.LL
