A village in the Russian region of Tuva has gone into lockdown after a local was found to have contracted anthrax, according to the district's acting head. Anthrax is a serious bacterial infection that is often deadly to humans. The Tuva Republic is almost 4000 kilometers [2485 miles] east of Moscow, and is located in southern Siberia.

Writing on Russian social network VKontakte, Vladislav Khovalyg announced a single positive case of infection in Bizhiktig-Khaya, a settlement near the country's border with Mongolia. "To prevent the spread of the dangerous disease, we are forced to introduce quarantine in the village of Bijiktig-Haya, Barun-Khemchiksky District," he wrote. "A 29 year old local resident is suspected of having contracted anthrax."

According to Khovalyg, the patient is receiving the necessary medical care and has a less aggressive, cutaneous form of the disease. "Doctors are monitoring the condition of those who have had contact with the infected person," he added. The official also revealed that an interdepartmental commission had already begun working in the Tuvan village to discover the causes of the infection. "Samples are being taken that will allow us to give a competent opinion on the situation in the near future," he explained.

Anthrax is a dangerous infectious disease that is often found in rural areas and most commonly affects livestock. Humans catch the infection from animals, typically from infected animal carcasses, as well as from wool, hair, and hides. The illness often begins with flulike symptoms, which can develop into respiratory problems. Direct contact with the disease can be treated with antibiotics, but those who inhale anthrax spores often die from lung damage.

["The Tuvan republic lies at the geographical center of Asia, in southern Siberia. The republic borders the Altai Republic, the Republic of Khakassia, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Irkutsk Oblast, and the Republic of Buryatia in Russia and Mongolia to the south. The region is also claimed by the Taiwanese major political party Kuomintang as part of the Republic of China. In the 2010 Russian census, the territory claimed a population of 307 930. Its capital is the city of Kyzyl.

"From 1921 to 1944, Tuva constituted a sovereign, independent, but partially recognized nation, acknowledged only by its neighbors the Soviet Union and Mongolia. It was known officially as Tannu Tuva until 1926 and thereafter as the Tuvan People's Republic. A majority of the population are ethnic Tuvans who speak Tuvan as their native tongue, while Russian is spoken natively by the Russian minority; both are official and widely understood in the republic. Tuva is governed by the Great Khural, which elects a chairman to 4-year terms" (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuva, which includes a map showing Tuva's location, abutting Mongolia).

Outbreaks in this far eastern part of the Russian steppes are rare. The custom in these steppe communities is for a herdsman to collect the village livestock in the morning and take them out to the area of community grazing. Any animal dying is butchered and the carcass, hide, and head brought back to the owner in the village in the late afternoon and given to the owner. The latter may be a junior member of a family, and to prove that he had not stolen the animal the hide will be stretched and dried, and the head deposited on the house roof to be checked and counted when the actual family owner of this herd visits. If the death is not reported, there is always the opportunity for human cases among those given or buying the meat from this animal. As the young resident of Bizhiktig-Khaya has just a cutaneous lesion, we can surmise that the infection may have been acquired from butchering a dead animal in this case. It has yet to be laboratory confirmed. - Mod.MHJ
