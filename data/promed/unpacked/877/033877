European Bat Lyssavirus type 2 in a bat - Shropshire, October 2008
------------------------------------------------------------------
A Daubenton's bat found dead at a heritage site [historical building
and grounds. - Mod.JW] in Shropshire has tested positive for European
Bat Lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2). This is the 8th confirmed EBLV-2 case
in United Kingdom (UK) bats since 1996, and the 2nd case in Shropshire
[1, 2].

The bat was found dead by a member of staff early
in the morning before the area was opened to the
public. It was placed in a sealed box, using
protective gloves. Risk assessment confirmed that
no members of the public could have come into
contact with the bat as it had not been present
when the area was checked the previous evening.

The routine checking of the site for bats, along
with other recommendations [1], which were fully
implemented by staff after the previous incident,
ensured that the bat was safely handled and
nobody else had contact with it. The carcass was
subsequently examined by a bat worker from the
Shropshire bat group and placed in container for
transfer to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency.

EBLV is a rabies-like virus found in insectivorous bats across
northern Europe. It comes from the same family of viruses as rabies,
but is a different strain from that which causes 'classical' rabies in
dogs and many other domestic and wild animals. Humans are not at risk
from EBLV unless they have been exposed to the saliva or nervous
tissue of an infected bat or have been scratched or bitten.

The HPA, DEFRA, and Department of Health work
closely with the Bat Conservation Trust and
Natural England on bat issues. All those licensed
to handle bats or who regularly handle bats in
Great Britain should ensure that they have up to
date rabies vaccination and should always wear
protective gloves when handling bats. Anybody who
is potentially at risk from EBLV but is given
prompt protective treatment will not develop the infection.

Anyone finding a sick or ailing bat is advised
not to approach or handle it but to seek advice
from a conservation group or the Bat Conservation
Trust Helpline on 0845 1300 228.

[Rabies-related viruses (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) have
been reported in bats from several European
countries. Bats suffering from these viruses show
signs of disorientation, malcoordination, and
occasional aggression. No case of indigenous
human rabies from animals other than bats has
been reported in the UK since 1902.

Rabies-related bat viruses do not appear to readily infect other
mammals. There are about 17 species of bats present in the UK. Under a
passive surveillance scheme in the UK, more than 600 bats of several
species have been tested for rabies since 1987. This was is the 8th
bat to test positive for the virus. All 8 have been Daubenton's bats.

According to DEFRA the known low prevalence of EBLV-2 in Daubenton's
bats in England does not affect the UK's rabies-free animal health
status. The EBLV-2 strain has been found previously in 7 bats in
England since 1996, in Sussex, Lancashire, Surrey, Oxfordshire and
Shropshire. Some of these were posted on ProMED -- see archives below.

The risk of EBLV infection to humans is thought to be low. However, in
2002 a bat handler in Scotland (who had not been vaccinated) died from
rabies caused by EBLV-2, and one more case of EBLV-2 (fatal) was
reported in Finland in 1985.
