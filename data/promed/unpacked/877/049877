David Lokyan, Armenia's Minister of Agriculture, announced on Friday
[28 Dec 2007] that the economic losses due to the ASF [African swine
fever] were substantial. The attempts to prevent the spread of
infection have not been successful and the rural economies carried
losses equal to 774 tons of destroyed pork, he said [in monetary
terms, this means approximately USD 1.5 million. - Mod.AS]
The Prime Minister of Armenia has ordered the design of a mechanism
to mitigate the impact of losses. Lokyan said, that the mechanism is
expected to be in place in the middle of January 2008 and the farmers
will get assistance, depending on the resources available. The
government intends to maintain the assistance so that the farmers can
continue to raise pigs and develop the sector. The Minister added
that the affected farms would get guaranteed compensation, the amount
of which is subject to the government's decision.
The speed of the infection spread decreased and during the last weeks
only single cases have been registered.
The 1st cases of ASF were registered in the Tavush and Lori regions
of Armenia on 7 Aug 2007. Quarantine was implemented in these regions
and biocontrol posts were established on the roads, with
participation of the police and the veterinary service. The
Government allocated around USD 113 000 to bury infected biological
materials and carry out disinfection. Overall, 13 000 swine have died
or been culled.
Under natural conditions, wild and domestic swine are susceptible to
ASF and the transmission occurs via forage, pastures, and
contaminated transport vehicles.

[According to OIE's (World Organisation for Animal Health) ASF map (see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=disease_outbreak_map&disease_id=12>;
zoom in to the Caucasus region),
accessed 31 Dec 2007, the ASF outbreaks in Georgia, Abkhazia,
Chechnya, and Ajaria are "continuing", while some of the 15 outbreaks
reported from Armenia have resolved. The epizootic started in April
2007 in Georgia, but was diagnosed and reported only in June. Later,
it spread to neighbouring countries.
Armenia has submitted to the OIE 4 reports, namely an Immediate
Notification on 29 Aug 2007 and 3 follow-up reports (7 Nov, 5 Dec,
and 12 Dec 2007); all, and a map, are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6051>.
