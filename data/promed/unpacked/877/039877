In August 2013, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency was notified of a fatal case of rat-bite fever (RBF) in a previously healthy male, aged 10 years, who owned pet rats. 2 days before his death, the patient experienced rigors, fevers, vomiting, headaches, and leg pains. His physician noted a fever of 102.6 degrees F (39.2 degrees C), documented a normal examination, diagnosed viral gastroenteritis, and prescribed anti-nausea medication. During the next 24 hours, the patient experienced vomiting and persistent fever. He was confused and weak before collapsing at home. Paramedics reported the patient was unresponsive and had dilated pupils; resuscitation was initiated in the field and was continued for more than 1 hour after arrival at the emergency department but was unsuccessful. A complete blood count performed during resuscitation revealed anemia (hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL [normal = 13.5-18.0 g/dL], thrombocytopenia (platelets 40 000/microL [normal = 140 000-440 000/microL]), leukocytosis (white blood cells 17 900 cells/microL [normal = 4000-10 500/microL]) with 16 per cent band neutrophils; the patient also had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. No rash or skin breakdown was noted. Lung, liver, and epiglottis tissue collected postmortem was positive for _Streptobacillus moniliformis_ DNA by polymerase chain reaction.

During the 10 days before his death, the patient had obtained his 2nd pet rat; _S. moniliformis_ was detected by polymerase chain reaction in oropharyngeal tissue from this rat. Oropharyngeal swabs of the 1st pet rat were negative for _S. moniliformis_ by polymerase chain reaction. The autopsy report noted that patient had been scratched by his pet rats.

RBF is a systemic illness of humans caused principally by _S. moniliformis_, a Gram negative bacterium that is commensal among rats (1). The organism can be transmitted to humans through rodent bites or scratches; approximately 1 in 10 bites might cause infection (2). Infection can also occur after handling infected rodents without a bite or scratch, or through ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacteria (1). Symptoms include fever, rash, vomiting, and muscle or joint pain. RBF is treatable with antibiotics (3); about 13 per cent of untreated RBF illnesses are fatal (2).

Nearly all domestic and wild rats carry _S. moniliformis_ (2). An estimated 0.1 per cent of USA households owned 1 or more pet rats during 2011 (Sharon Granskog, American Veterinary Medical Association, personal communication, 25 Apr 2014).

RBF is not a reportable condition in California or nationally. To estimate RBF incidence in San Diego County, hospitals in San Diego County that discharged any patients during 2000-2012 with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 026.0-026.1 (for streptobacillary fever and spirillary fever) were identified based on data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. Medical records were requested, and 16 cases were identified. One additional RBF case was reported to the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency during 2013 as an occurrence of unusual disease.

Among the 17 cases, the median patient age was 10 years (range = 4-67 years); 59 per cent of patients were female, and 65 per cent were healthy before infection. Most infections (94 per cent) were pet-associated; one patient had an occupational exposure (rat breeder). 16 of 17 patients reported exposure to rats. Of these, 44 per cent reported only having handled a rat, 38 per cent reported being bitten, and 13 per cent reported a scratch. All patients had blood drawn for cultures; only 29 per cent tested positive for _S. moniliformis_; the remainder were treated presumptively for RBF on the basis of exposure and clinical presentation. All patients survived except the patient described in this report.

RBF is a rare but potentially fatal illness that should be considered in persons with rash, fever, and joint pain and when a history of rodent exposure is reported. Clinicians suspecting _S. moniliformis_ infection should promptly alert laboratory staff because microbiologic diagnosis is difficult, requiring specific media and incubation conditions. Clinicians should also consider requesting diagnosis assistance from their state public health laboratories. Because rapid laboratory confirmation might not be possible, empiric treatment for RBF in the setting of appropriate exposure history might be considered.

Pet rat owners should wear gloves and wash their hands thoroughly after handling rats or cleaning rat cages, avoid rat secretions, and promptly seek medical care if they have RBF symptoms (4) after contact with rats.

[ProMED-mail posted on this fatal case of streptobacillary rat bite fever earlier in 2014. It is interesting that the epiglottis was cultured and the organism was isolated from the tissue. It would seem that the epiglottis must have been abnormal for it to be cultured. This might suggest that the primary tissue involved in the fatality was the epiglottis, and certainly epiglottitis is a potentially fatal infection which can have a rapid progression, more rapid than the usual case of RBF. It is possible that the child was kissing the colonized rodent which introduced the organism into the oropharynx.

Epiglottitis is generally caused by type b _Haemophilus influenzae_, but zoonotic pathogens such as _Pasteurella multocida_ (a common organism in the feline oropharynx) have been associated rarely with epiglottitis (Harris PJ, Osswald MB. Pasteurella multocida epiglottitis: a review and report of a new case with associated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ear Nose Throat J. 2010 Dec;89(12):E4). - Mod.LL
