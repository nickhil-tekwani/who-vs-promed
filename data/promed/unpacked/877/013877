More than 20 cases of botulism, including 5 fatalities have been
registered in the Rostov region since the beginning of 2006. This
disease is reportedly associated with the consumption of smoked and
dried fish, tinned meat and vegetables of domestic preparation.

[Botulism is reported from the Rostov region rather frequently. Cases
of disease connected with the consumption of dried and smoked fish
are prevalent in the southern areas of the region located in a steppe
zone in the mouth of the river Don and on the coast of the Taganrog
Gulf of the Azov sea. Botulism connected with the consumption of
canned mushrooms more often is registered in northern forest-steppe
areas. The disease linked to the consumption of home-canned vegetable
occurs everywhere.
Botulinum toxin type E, usually associated with marine sources,
prevails in the region. More than 15 cases of botulism, including 2
fatalities, were reported in the Rostov region in 2005. Most
frequently, lethal outcomes were connected with late access to
medical care (2-3 days after onset).
The Rostov-on-Don Region is located in the southern part of the
East-European plateau and partly in the North Caucasian region,
covering a vast territory in the basin of the Don River and coastline
of Taganrog Bay in the Sea of Azov. The distance between Moscow and
Rostov-on-Don is 1226 km. It borders on Stavropol and Krasnodar
territories in the south, Ukraine in the west and northwest, Voronezh
Region in the north, Volgograd Region in the northeast and east, and
the Republic of Kalmykia in the east, southeast, and south. - Mod.NP]
