A total of 8 inmates from a maximum-security prison in Arizona were hospitalized with suspected botulism poisoning after apparently drinking homemade alcohol, authorities said on Monday, 26 Nov 2012.

7 of the inmates, whose names were not released, were being treated in intensive care with a special antitoxin after being admitted to the hospital on Saturday and Sunday, 24-25 Nov 2012, Pinal County spokeswoman Heather Murphy said.

"All of them are unable to breathe on their own right now because of the paralysis caused by the botulism," Murphy said. The condition of the 8th prisoner was not known.

Officials said the inmates, who range from 20 to 35 years old, were apparently poisoned from drinking contraband alcohol made inside the prison from fermented fruit, a brew commonly called pruno. The inmates were assigned to a special management unit at the state prison complex in Florence, Arizona. Prison and county health officials were monitoring other prisoners in the same area for possible additional cases.

This is the 2nd time in nearly 4 months that inmates at the Arizona prison have apparently contracted botulism from prison-made alcohol. In August 2012, 4 prisoners were hospitalized after contracting the illness.

In October 2011, federal health officials said 8 prisoners in Utah were sickened with botulism from drinking prison alcohol, the largest incident of botulism poisoning in the USA since 2007.

[One form of prison-brewed alcohol is pruno. Pruno, or prison wine, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruno) is an alcoholic liquid variously made from apples, oranges, fruit cocktail, ketchup, sugar, and possibly other ingredients, including crumbled bread. Bread provides the yeast for the pruno to ferment. Pruno originated in (and remains largely confined to) prisons and jails, where it can be produced cheaply, easily, and discreetly. The concoction can be made using only a plastic bag, hot running water, and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation. The end result has been colorfully described as a "vomit-flavored wine-cooler," although flavor is often not the primary objective. Depending on the time spent fermenting, the sugar content, and the quality of the ingredients and preparation, pruno's alcohol content by volume can range from as low as 2 percent (equivalent to a very weak beer) to as high as 14 percent (equivalent to a strong wine).

The following is from Vugia DJ, Mase SR, Cole B, et al: Botulism from drinking pruno. Emerg Infect Dis 2009; 15(1): 69-71 and describes 2 outbreaks of this in California prisons, one of which was covered by ProMED-mail in 2004 (Botulism, prison brew - USA (CA) 20040806.2155):

"In our investigations, the potatoes used in the pruno could have been the source of botulinum toxin. _Clostridium botulinum_ is commonly found in the soil, and its spores have been found on raw potatoes. Several outbreaks of botulism caused by eating potatoes have occurred in the United States, and laboratory studies have shown that _C. botulinum_ spores on the surface of raw potatoes can survive baking and lead to production of botulinum toxin. The warm anaerobic fermentation process of making pruno probably predisposes toward production of botulinum toxin, particularly if any ingredient happens to be contaminated with _C. botulinum_ or its spores, such as the potatoes used in these 2 instances.

"Pruno is popular in prisons across the country, and it is somewhat surprising that botulism caused by pruno consumption has not been previously reported. This lack of reporting may be due to the fact that potatoes are not generally used in the making of pruno; recipes for making pruno and references to pruno found on the Internet do not mention potatoes as an ingredient. Occasional crackdowns on making pruno in some prisons could have driven some inmates to look for alternative ingredients, including potatoes. Nonetheless, with more than 2 million inmates in prisons and jails in the United States, this illicit homemade alcoholic drink may put more inmates at risk for botulism. Anecdotally, making pruno has been attempted outside prisons, possibly extending the potential risk for foodborne botulism carried by this novel vehicle beyond the prison walls. Risk for botulism from consuming pruno should be conveyed to inmates, prison staff, the medical community, and the general public. Any inmate with clinical botulism should be examined for an infected wound caused by drug injection and queried about recent drug use and drinking pruno." - Mod.LL]
