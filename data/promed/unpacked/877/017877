A judge is expected to order several retailers to pay millions of
pounds to people who suffered burns and rashes from faulty leather
sofas.

The BBC now has evidence that Argos, Walmsleys and Land of Leather
accept liability, subject to it being proved that injuries were
caused by the sofas.

More than 1600 people claim to have been affected by the problem. Tens
of thousands more people could have burns not yet traced to sofas.
The High Street stores, along with 11 others, may have to pay more
than 10 million pounds [USD 14.3 million] in compensation and legal
costs, the shoppers' lawyers say. They claim that makes it "the
largest group compensation claim ever seen in British Courts."

The sofas, which were manufactured in China, were packed with sachets
of an anti-mould chemical called dimethyl fumarate to stop them from
going moldy during storage in humid conditions.

Commonly known as DMF, the toxic, fine white powder has been used by
some manufacturers to protect leather goods like furniture and shoes
from mold. Even very small amounts can be harmful.

One sofa customer, who is well aware of the health problems caused by
her purchase, is a customer who bought a leather sofa suite from
Argos in April 2007. Almost a year later, she started to notice a
rash developing on her arms and legs. After a few weeks, her skin
started flaking off. She says the irritation was so bad, she was off
work for 2 months. This customer was seen by more than a dozen
doctors, who couldn't work out what was causing the rash.

She said: "It was very, very painful; I couldn't sleep at night; I
couldn't walk about; I couldn't drive; every time I did walk about,
the skin would fall off, and I would leave a trail of it, therefore,
I couldn't go to work."

This customer was one of thousands of people who had bought a leather
sofa from Argos, Land of Leather, or Walmsleys and then suffered a
severe reaction.

For a long time, none of those suffering knew it was their sofa
causing the problem, so they simply kept sitting on the defective
furniture and worsening their condition.

A dermatologist in Liverpool solved the mystery. After hearing of an
increasing number of patients presenting with similar symptoms, the
scientist discovered they had all recently bought new leather
furniture, which had been packed with chemical sachets in China.

The scientist tested the contents of one of the sachets on his skin,
and it quickly reacted. Further testing revealed that the sachets
contained a chemical called dimethyl fumarate, or DMF, placed inside
the sofas to stop them from going moldy during storage in humid
warehouses in Asia.

When the sachets get hot, the chemical evaporates into the air,
penetrating through the leather and victims' clothing and onto their
skin, causing painful blisters and sores.

Many people discovered they might have been affected when they saw an
investigation on the BBC's consumer affairs programme Watchdog.
Meanwhile, several law firms realized there could have been thousands
suffering without knowing the cause of their injuries. They put
advertisements in national newspapers, warning people they may have
been affected.

"We advertised in 8 national newspapers last October [2008], and
purely from those, we got another 3500 people coming forward," said
Richard Langton of Russell, Jones and Walker solicitors.

"I think, potentially, there are tens of thousands more people out
there who might be affected; potentially, people are still suffering
and don't know what the problem is."

Argos, Land of Leather, Walmsleys and 11 other very small shops had
sold the sofas. After being warned of the problems, they offered
exchanges or refunds to people who complained.

After seeing the effects of the chemical, the European Union is now
taking action. It considers DMF to be so harmful to consumers that it
is bringing in a new directive in May 2009 requiring all retailers to
recall from sale any goods which contain the chemical and to stop any
more hitting the shops. It also appears to require retailers to
remove any goods which contain DMF from people's homes.

EU Consumer Affairs Commissioner Meglena Kuneva said: "We are
absolutely certain that the minor quantities of this product DMF in
leather sofas or shoes could cause a terrible allergy and even death.
It is very, very, serious; we will not compromise on safety."

The toxic sofa symptoms are blisters, sores, rashes, and eye irritation.

Until the directive is introduced and tested, it is difficult to
determine how it will affect retailers. Lawyers hope it will compel
Argos and Walmsleys to remove any faulty sofas still in customers'
homes. But Land of Leather is in administration [bankruptcy court], so
its customers are unlikely to receive any exchange or refund.

Anyone with any concerns about a sofa they have bought can check
whether it is affected by looking on the Russell, Jones and Walker
website. They could then contact their retailer, or in the case of
Land of Leather, the administrators in charge.

Walmsleys said it would not comment about the case while it was ongoing.

Argos said: "Over the last 18 months, there have been issues
regarding certain sofas manufactured by a company based in China
which were supplied to Argos and a number of other retailers. This
issue is currently the subject of a group litigation order, so we are
unable to comment on any individual cases. Argos no longer sells the
products."

[The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for dimethyl fumarate states
that it can cause severe skin irritation and severe eye irritation.

Dimethyl fumarate is an ester and an alpha-beta-unsaturated
electrophilic compound, undergoing reactions typical to them. While
there are some medical uses when taken internally, and while other
uses are being examined, it has many problems also associated with it.

Dimethyl fumarate has been found to be an allergic sensitizer at very
low concentrations, producing extensive, pronounced eczema that is
difficult to treat. Concentrations as low as 1 ppm may produce
allergic reactions [5]. There are only a handful of equally potent
sensitizers [6].

The extreme sensitizing risk was brought to public attention by the
"poison chair" incident, where Chinese manufacturer Linkwise produced
2-seater sofas with dimethyl fumarate sachets inside to inhibit mold
while they were in storage or transport [7], [8]. In Finland, where
the chairs were sold from 2006-2007, 60 users were given serious
rashes [6]. The cause was identified as dimethyl fumarate-induced
allergic reaction by Tapio Rantanen, M.D. from Finland, and his
original article became the cover story in the July issue of British
Journal of Dermatology [5].

Given the fact that this allergen has already been documented as
causing problems and those being documented and published, one
wonders why this company wanted to try it.

Realizing that it took a period of time for the discovery of the
malady to be diagnosed, it is possible that this is a far-reaching
situation. However, once known, it seems that a recall may have been
an excellent move: Get the furniture back under their control. Of
course, that may or may not have lessened the liability the company
faces.
