On 22 Apr 2011, the Q fever bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_ was detected
in a goat placenta collected from a farm in Washington, where 14 of 50
(28 percent) pregnant does had aborted since January 2011. A county
health alert advised health-care providers to ask patients with
symptoms compatible with Q fever (e.g., fever, headache, chills, and
myalgia) about exposure to goats, and the owners of the farm informed
purchasers of their goats that _C. burnetii_ had been detected in
their herd. On 25 May 2011, the county health department reported a
symptomatic patient with antibodies to _C. burnetii_ who had purchased
goats from the farm in February 2011. On 27 May 2011, a report from
Montana identified a child seropositive for _C. burnetii_ whose family
had purchased goats from the Washington farm in October 2010; one of
the goats aborted triplets 2 weeks before the child's 12 May 2011,
illness onset. On 31 May 2011, 5 more persons reported onset of
symptoms compatible with Q fever from late March to mid-May 2011,
following exposure at a Montana farm to goats purchased from the
Washington farm at various times during October 2010-January 2011. On
10 June 2011, the Washington State Department of Health and Montana
Department of Public Health and Human Services requested CDC
assistance to characterize the extent of the outbreak, distribute Q
fever information, and identify others at risk for infection.

Goats sold after June 2010 by the Washington farm where _C. burnetii_
initially was detected were traced to 21 farms in Washington (10
counties), Montana (3 counties), and Oregon (1 county). 17 farms
participated in the outbreak investigation. _C. burneti_i infection
was detected in 16 of 17 goat herds, including polymerase chain
reaction confirmation of bacterial shedding in feces, vaginal mucous,
or milk in 161 of 667 (24 percent) goats tested and an overall
seroprevalence of 21 percent (131 of 615) by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. To date, 19 percent (20 of 108; 11 in Washington
and 9 in Montana) of serologically tested persons met the outbreak
case definition of a person epidemiologically linked to at least 1
farm of interest (i.e., as a goat owner, farm visitor, or neighbor)
since January 2011 with a _C. burnetii_ phase II immunoglobulin G
titer =1:128 by immunofluorescence assay (1). No deaths were reported;
4 of the 20 persons were hospitalized, and 5 were asymptomatic.

Both states implemented a herd management plan to promote continued
communication between public health and agricultural authorities and
to advise goat owners to disinfect birthing areas, avoid contact with
birth products, limit visitor access to animal holding areas, maintain
an animal registry, and report animal abortions and positive Q fever
test results to state authorities. All homes within a 1-mile radius of
the Washington farm where _C. burnetii_ was initially detected and a
Montana farm that also had high goat seroprevalence linked to human
illness were visited once by CDC or by county public health officials
and CDC in July or August 2011 to provide Q fever health education and
offer human serologic testing. The states have received no additional
reports of Q fever since July 2011.

Q fever (a category B bioterrorism agent) is a nationally notifiable
disease in humans and is endemic throughout the USA with a national
seroprevalence of 3 percent (2). Washington and Montana typically
report about 3 cases of Q fever annually. Acute Q fever is
characterized by a self-limited febrile illness or, less often, by
pneumonia or hepatitis. Less common still is chronic Q fever, which
affects less than 5 percent of infected persons and presents as
endocarditis in patients with preexisting valvular disease. Pregnant
women, immunosuppressed persons, and patients with a preexisting
heart-valve defect are at greatest risk for chronic Q fever.
Doxycycline is recommended for treatment of acute Q fever. _C.
burnetii_ is highly infectious, persists in the environment, and can
travel for miles once windborne (3). Transmission can occur via
inhalation of contaminated aerosols or dust; human-to-human
transmission is rare. Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary Q fever
reservoirs. Continued community awareness is essential for disease
prevention and control. Additional information is available at

[This outbreak was 1st reported in ProMED in June 2011. (Q fever -
USA: raw cow's milk, ex goat 20110624.1938). The clinical
manifesttions of the infection in man in these cases is not stated.
In humans, the acute symptoms caused by infection with _Coxiella
burnetii_ http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html usually
develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of
humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms.

The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with acute Q fever.
However, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms
varies greatly from person to person:
-high fevers (up to 104-105 degrees F)
-severe headache
-general malaise
-myalgia
-chills and/or sweats
-non-productive cough
-nausea
-vomiting
-diarrhea
-abdominal pain
-chest pain

Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may
experience serious illness with complications that may include
pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis (inflammation of the liver),
myocarditis (inflammation of the heart tissue) and central nervous
system complications. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk
for pre-term delivery or miscarriage. The estimated case fatality rate
(i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their
infection) is low, at less than 2 percent of hospitalized patients.
Treatment with the correct antibiotic may shorten the course of
illness for acute Q fever. - Mod. LL]

[The causative bacterium is fairly ubiquitous. Most animals, including
humans are susceptible to the effects of the bacterium. Cattle, sheep
and goats can harbor the bacterium. Caretakers of the animals are most
often exposed during the birthing process. People are exposed to the
bacterium via dust particles.

_Coxiella burnetii_ is increasingly recognized as an important cause
of caprine abortion, especially in the western USA. Occasional
outbreaks also occur in sheep. Late-term abortions, stillbirths, and
weak lambs are the common presentations. Up to 50 percent of the flock
may be involved. The placenta is covered by gray-brown exudate and the
intercotyledonary areas are thickened. Microscopically, there is a
necrotizing vasculitis in the placenta, and many chorionic epithelial
cells are distended by small, coccobacillary organisms less than 1 mm
in diameter. Infection involves only the placenta; without it, the
diagnosis usually cannot be made. Diagnosis is by identification of
_C.burnetii_ by immunologic staining methods or by isolation. Coxiella
is zoonotic, causing Q fever in humans.

People most at risk may be veterinarians, producers, milkers and those
in the slaughter facilities as the bacteria may be aerosolized at
various times in the course of each individual's work. Animals may be
infected, but with mild signs that may be missed by the caretakers --
or there may not be any clinical signs.

Respiratory protection for these individuals as well as strict code of
hygiene is important in preventing the disease.
