Laboratory tests in Jeddah identified 4 cases of Alkhurma hemorrhagic
fever [AHFV] disease, which re-emerged following the tragic outbreak
in Jeddah [Makkah province]. These are the 1st cases after an absence
of about 10 years. The sources said AHFV was detected yesterday [5
Jan 2010] in 4 people living in neighborhoods north of the city who
were treated immediately in a health center. The Health Secretariat
of Jeddah conducted spraying of pesticides in the vicinity of the
houses of the 4.

In turn, the chairman of the Committee on Health and the Environment
of the Municipal Council of Jeddah, Dr. Hussein, was informed of the
need to intensify spraying, in order to prevent the spread of [the virus].

AHFV enters the human body and leads to internal bleeding. The
mortality rate of the disease is up to 25 percent of the total cases.
AHFV is transmitted by mosquitoes from one person to another [this
has not been demonstrated. See references below. - Mod.TY].

A municipal council member said that the disease was discovered for
the 1st time in Jeddah in 1994, with 4 cases. Cases of the disease,
which has gained the name AHFV, were [originally] believed to be
dengue fever infections. [The Madani 2006 reference below states that
the virus was first isolated in 1995, and that there were 6 cases. - Mod.TY]

[A team of researchers] at the University of King Abdul-Aziz, on
behalf of Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi, is working to diagnose
the virus and to highlight its characteristics and how to eliminate it.

It is noteworthy that the virus disappeared after the mid-1990s and
returned to the area again, according to the adviser to the minister
of health for infectious diseases, Dr Tarek Madani, in the beginning
of the new millennium.

In 2000, health authorities discovered 20 cases of the disease, and
noted that all reported cases of AHFV had ocurred south of Jeddah.

[Alkhurma virus is a flavivirus related to Kysanur Forest disease
virus. From 8 Feb 2001 to 9 Feb 2003, a total of 37 cases of acute
viral hemorrhagic fever were identified in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, and
20 of them were laboratory confirmed. Acute febrile flu-like illness
with hepatitis (100 percent), hemorrhagic manifestations (55
percent), and encephalitis (20 percent) were the main clinical
features. The case fatality rate was 25 percent. The original report
indicated that the virus seemed to be transmitted from sheep or goats
to humans by mosquito bites or direct contact with these animals. The
report above also indicated that the virus is mosquito transmitted,
although a 2007 report implicated soft ticks.
