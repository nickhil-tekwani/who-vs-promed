Pork Producers Urged to Review Biosecurity Procedures
------------------------------------------------------
The National Pork Board is urging producers to be on a heightened
state of alert because of the recent theft from a laboratory of a
bacterium that is known to cause neurologic signs and rapid mortality
in pigs.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service announced Tuesday that it had been notified that
the infectious agent _Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae_ (APP) had been
stolen from a Michigan State University [MSU] research facility late
last week. The stolen materials were part of a project to develop
swine vaccines.
There are no known reports of APP cases related to this theft, but
the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the
National Pork Board are urging producers and veterinarians to pay
specific attention to swine populations and to be alert to any
unusual symptoms in pigs such as convulsions, acute pneumonia, and
sudden death.
"The bacteria are not known to cause a threat to human health," said
Beth Alexander, MSU physician, after consulting with experts in
infectious disease. In addition, MSU already had tested the specific
strains of bacteria used in the vaccine research and found no
indication that the strains posed a threat to human health.
"Humans cannot be harmed by this," said Lonnie King, dean of MSU's
College of Veterinary Medicine, "whether by direct contact with the
bacteria, or by eating meat from an infected animal. This is strictly
a disease that strikes pigs."
"APP can be a cause of a serious respiratory disease in swine," said
Dr. Beth Lautner, vice president of science and technology at the
National Pork Board. "It has been found internationally in swine
herds including the U.S. since the mid to late 1970s. The organism
formerly was called _Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae_ or HPP. To
minimize its impact, it is important to rapidly diagnose the disease
and institute appropriate treatment. Veterinary diagnostic
laboratories have a variety of diagnostic tools to make a rapid,
definitive diagnosis. Typically, the disease can be treated with
injectable antibiotics."
Specifically, the National Pork Board is urging producers to:
1. Review the biosecurity and security plans at their farms. The Pork
Checkoff-funded Biosecurity Guide and Security Guide are available at
.
There is a story and a link on the home page. Producers without
Internet access can call 800-456-PORK for copies.
2. Report any suspicious activity or people around their farms or
community to local law enforcement officials.
3. Contact their veterinarian about any unusual health situation on
your farm. This could include [signs] in pigs such as cough, fever,
reduced appetite, acute pneumonia, encephalitis, and sudden death. In
some cases, frothy and bloodstained nasal discharge can also be seen.
"The Biosecurity Guide for Pork Producers offers a variety of ideas
to keep me thinking about how to improve biosecurity on my farm, as
well as today's best biosecurity practices," said Jim Niewold, a pork
producer from Loda, Ill., and chairman of the Pork Checkoff Swine
Health Committee.

Investigation continues in theft of research materials
------------------------------------------------------
EAST LANSING, Mich. - MSU has joined with federal and state
authorities in investigating the theft last week of swine vaccine
research materials from a campus lab and in ensuring the safety of
livestock.
Sometime between Thursday night and Friday morning, research
materials, including small samples of a bacteria used to develop
swine vaccines, were taken from the Biomedical and Physical Sciences
Building. MSU police chief Jim Dunlap said there is no indication
that the theft was related to political activism.
The stolen material is _Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae_, or APP, a
common [strain of] bacteria in swine that usually causes respiratory
infection in young pigs. "The bacterium is not known to cause a
threat to human health," said Beth Alexander, MSU university
physician, after consulting with experts in infectious disease.
In addition, MSU already had tested the specific strains of bacteria
used in the vaccine research and found no indication that the
strains posed a threat to human health.
"Humans cannot be harmed by this," said Lonnie King, dean of MSU's
College of Veterinary Medicine, "whether by direct contact with the
bacteria, or by eating meat from an infected animal. This is strictly
a disease that strikes pigs.
"MSU has been working to develop vaccines to protect swine in order
to protect the health of the swine industry."
After discovering the theft, MSU immediately notified appropriate
state and federal authorities according to established protocols.
Appropriate advisories were issued to affected Michigan groups,
including veterinarians and pork producers.
MSU Department of Police and Public Safety is investigating the
unauthorized entry and theft from the secured lab. In addition to the
samples, research notebooks and computer disks were taken.
Tuesday, MSU worked with the USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection
Service to notify veterinarians and pork producers.
"It's just a common-sense precaution," King said.

Board of Animal Health: Michigan laboratory theft prompts need for vigilance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) has issued an advisory to animal health
officials in all 50 states, related to a theft that occurred a few
days ago at a research facility in Michigan.
The Indiana State Board of Animal Health is issuing this advisory to
encourage vigilance within the Hoosier swine industry to watch for
usual signs of disease in hogs and to report such occurrences to the
agency for further assessment. Contact the BOAH Swine Division to
report unusual clinical signs, as noted below, by calling (toll-free)
877/747-3038 ext. 310. A BOAH veterinarian will evaluate the
situation by phone and determine if further follow-up needs to be
completed (at no charge to the producer).
The following facts were provided to BOAH by APHIS. More information
will be provided, as it becomes available.
1. USDA APHIS has been notified by Michigan State University [MSU]
that sometime between the night of 12 Sep 2002 and the morning of 13
Sep 2002, research materials, including small samples of a bacteria
used to develop swine vaccines, were taken from the Biomedical and
Physical Sciences Building. Research notebooks and computer disks
were also taken.
2. The stolen material is _Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae_, or APP,
a common strain of bacteria in swine that usually causes respiratory
infection in young pigs.
3. APP is not known to cause a threat to human health. In addition,
MSU already had tested the specific strains of bacteria used in the
vaccine research and found no indication that the strains posed a
threat to human health. APP is known to affect only swine.
4. MSU officials immediately notified appropriate state and federal
authorities upon discovering the theft, including USDA's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service.
5. Working with MSU officials and Michigan animal health officials,
USDA APHIS has sent out a nationwide alert to state animal health
authorities, industry and producer groups and cooperators to make
them aware of this situation.
6. USDA is asking producers and veterinarians to pay specific
attention to swine populations and be alert to any unusual symptoms
in pigs such as encephalitis, acute pneumonia, and sudden death.
7. The endemic strain of APP causes outbreaks of respiratory disease
in grower and finishing pigs. Clinical signs of the endemic strain of
APP are dyspnea, fever, reduced appetite, and rapidly occurring
death. Cough and, in some cases, frothy and blood-stained nasal
discharge can also be seen.
8. Any APP diagnosis that causes unusual clinical conditions,
encephalitis, and sudden death should be reported to the State
Veterinarian and/or Area Veterinarian in Charge.
9. Typically APP can be treated with injectable antibiotics. For some
endemic APP serotypes there are vaccines available as aides in
prevention.
10. Most cases of infection occur by nose-to-nose contact after the
introduction of infected carrier pigs. APP can be found in the
tonsil, necrotic tissue, and nasal cavity of recovered carriers or
sub-clinical cases. Some reports concerning indirect transmission via
contaminated clothing and airborne transmission do exist, but the
major mode of transmission of APP infection is by the introduction of
a carrier pig.
As always, BOAH encourages all livestock producers to report any
cases of specific clinical signs that may indicate a foreign or
emerging animal disease (not just related to APP). The five key
clinical signs include:
1. Sudden, unexplained death loss;
2. Severe illness in a high number of animals within a herd/production system;
3. Blistering or lesions, particularly around the membranes and feet;
4. Unusual ticks, maggots, or other insect pests; and
5. Unexplained signs of a central nervous system disorder, including
staggering, falling, tremors.
