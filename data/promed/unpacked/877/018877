INFECTION CONTROL - CANADA (2)
==============================
Date: Wed, 26 Jun 1996 18:29:41 -0700 (PDT)
From: "Michael A. Noble" <mnoble@unixg.ubc.ca>
I am a medical microbiologist in Vancouver BC who works within a team of 5
microbiologists and 4 nurses addressing the issues of infection control at 4
sites of a multihospital venture.
The issues here are of course the same as in most other places:
- MRSA (now unfortunately a frequent event)
- VRE (none yet, but waiting with patient screening procedures in place)
- sharps related injuries, and
- nosocomial acquisition of TB, especially in the extended care unit (i.e.
geriatric) environment.
We would be more than interested in following along and participating in the
ongoing discussions and information sharing on Infection Control.
