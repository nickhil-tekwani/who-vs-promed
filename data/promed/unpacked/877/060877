Notes from the field: Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in visitors to a national park -- Yosemite Valley, California, 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 16 Aug 2012, the California Department of Public Health announced 2 confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in California residents who had stayed overnight in Yosemite National Park, launching an investigation by the National Park Service, California Department of Public Health, and CDC. On 27 Aug [2012], Yosemite National Park announced 2 additional cases, and by 30 Oct [2012], 10 cases had been confirmed.

For this outbreak, a confirmed case was defined as detection of 1) a febrile illness and hantavirus (Sin Nombre virus) specific antibodies in serum, or 2) virus antigen in postmortem tissue using immunohistochemistry, in a person who had stayed overnight in Yosemite National Park during 1 Jun-28 Aug 2012. CDC notified public health officials and clinical providers in the United States and internationally. The National Park Service notified by e-mail, telephone, or mail all registered overnight Yosemite National Park visitors (approximately 260 000 guests) who had stayed at the park during 1 Jun-17 Sep 2012.

The 10 confirmed patients came from 3 states: California (8), West Virginia (1), and Pennsylvania (1). Ages ranged from 12 years to 56 years; 4 were female. [Of these] 9 patients had typical symptoms of HPS, and one lacked respiratory symptoms; 3 died.

Nine patients stayed in Curry Village "signature" cabins, which have insulation between the canvas exterior and interior hard walls. Rodent infestations were detected in the insulation, and all 91 signature cabins were closed indefinitely on 28 Aug [2012]. In addition, educational interventions were enhanced for staff members and visitors parkwide, and multifaceted rodent control measures, including trapping throughout Curry Village, were implemented.

HPS is a nationally notifiable disease caused in the United States most commonly by Sin Nombre virus. The deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) is the reservoir. Infected mice shed virus in urine, feces, and saliva. Humans become infected through inhalation of aerosolized virus from rodent excreta and via direct contact from rodent bites. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 6 weeks. Early symptoms include fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms for 1-7 days, progressing rapidly to respiratory distress and shock (1). Most patients require hospitalization, supplemental oxygen, and intubation. The case-fatality rate is approximately 36 percent (2). There is no specific treatment for HPS, but early supportive care can reduce mortality (2). Before this outbreak, 58 cases of HPS had been reported among California residents since 1994; 2 had been visitors to Yosemite National Park before 2012 (California Department of Public Health, unpublished data, 2012).

Clinicians are reminded to consider the diagnosis of hantavirus infection in all persons with febrile illness and sudden onset of respiratory symptoms with a history of rodent exposure. Because HPS is a reportable disease in the United States, clinicians suspecting HPS should notify and consult their state health department about confirmatory testing. More information is available from CDC regarding hantavirus clinical assessment, treatment and diagnostics. Park visitors and the public are advised to avoid contact with rodents and their urine, droppings, and nesting materials.

[The report above provides a good overview of this outbreak. It also illustrates how individuals may come down with a disease after having contracted the infection at a distant location, making travel histories important in establishing a diagnosis -- essential when the disease can progress rapidly as HPS does. Evidence of rodent presence may not be conspicuous so risk of exposure may not be obvious in locations where the deer mouse is present. _Peromyscus maniculatus_ is geographically widely distributed in North America. Although human exposure to the virus is rare, the consequences of infection can be very serious, so precautions should be taken to avoid that risk.
