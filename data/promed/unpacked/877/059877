I am the spokesman for the Belgian Agency. Apparently, ProMED
published some articles about the recent dioxin contamination. There
was a question as to why no PCBs were found. As we know now, the
dioxins originated from the very specific HCl production method, in
which no PCB's are produced.

Here follows some more background info on the new mini-dioxin-crisis
in Belgium:
The origin of the dioxins was found in a hydrochloric acid (HCl)
process at Tessenderlo Chemie (Belgium), which uses potassium
chloride (KCl) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) as raw materials. By
heating the ingredients, HCl is formed as gas, and the residue is
potassium sulphate (K2SO4), which is used as fertilizer and animal
feed.
It is a simple process, in which no dioxin formation should be
expected (the heating source is separated from the ingredients). The
HCl formed is absorbed in water and used mainly for phosphate
fertilizer production. A part (or all?) is extra-cleaned over an
active carbon filter for use in gelatin preparation from pig bones.
The fat residue of that process is used to make animal feed.
When a defect was detected in the active coal filter, the HCl was
used as normal, as nobody expected a dioxin contamination. And as
dioxins are highly fat soluble, they were concentrated in the fat
residue of the gelatin process and contaminated the whole further
food chain.
There are several routine controls in the food chain for PCBs -- the
1st (worse) contamination was with PCBs -- and, if dioxin
contamination is introduced by some incineration process, PCBs are
detected as well. In this case, there were no PCBs present (or they
were at very low limits), so the controls didn't detect the
contamination, until recently.
Further investigation did find the source.
How these dioxins are formed from (or were present in) the raw
materials is still being investigated. Anyway, there must be a carbon
source to produce dioxins. Sulphuric acid is made by oxidation of
pure mined sulphur, and KCl is also mined. Of course, KCl was once
precipitated from drying sea beds, which may be contaminated by
(traces of) organic material. Or dioxins might be present from some
biological process, as was the case with several 60-million-year-old
clay layers in Arkansas and Germany, where only dioxins (mainly TCDD)
and no furans or PCBs were found.
The dioxin contamination was restricted, and the Federal Food Agency
in Belgium doesn't expect health problems from any contaminated food
which may have reached the consumers. The feed factories and farms
which were blocked may be released in a few days, pending the results
of dioxin tests. The 1st 25 farms in The Netherlands (of the 275
blocked) were released yesterday [31 Jan 2006?].

Maximum levels set for dioxins and PCBs in feed and food
-----------------------------------------------
The European Commission has today [3 Feb 2006] adopted new
implementing legislation setting maximum levels for the sum of
dioxins and dioxin-like Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) in food and
feed. Maximum levels for dioxins in food of animal origin and all
animal feed have been applicable since July 2002.
However, due to lack of sufficient data and scientific information at
the time, no levels were set for dioxin-like PCBs. Since 2002, new
data on dioxin-like PCBs has become available, and the legislation
adopted today [3 Feb 2006] lays down mandatory limits for the
combined level of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. From November 2006,
any food or feed in which the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs
exceeds these maximum levels will not be allowed to be marketed in
the EU.
The reduction of persistent chemicals such as dioxins and dioxin-like
PCBs in the food chain is an important part of ensuring the health
and safety of EU consumers. Dioxins and PCBs have toxic properties
which can provoke a series of health problems, including cancer,
immune and nervous system disorders, liver damage and sterility. The
maximum levels adopted today contribute to the comprehensive
Commission strategy, launched in 2001, to reduce the level of dioxins
and PCBs in the environment, food and feed.
European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection Markos
Kyprianou said: "In setting these maximum levels, the Commission is
taking another step forward in protecting the EU consumer from the
harmful long term effects of dioxin and dioxin-like PCB consumption.
We will continue to pursue our comprehensive strategy against these
noxious substances, continually reviewing the ways in which we can
reduce human exposure to them. It is now up to national authorities
to ensure that monitoring is properly carried out so that citizens in
all Member States can rely on the same level of protection against
these contaminants."
Protecting the EU consumer
----------
Dioxins and PCBs are toxic chemicals that can provoke serious health
effects such as cancer, hormone disruption, reduced ability to
reproduce, skin toxicity and immune system disorders. They are
extremely resistant to any degradation process, which means that they
persist in the environment and accumulate in the food chain. In an
effort to reduce human exposure to these toxins, maximum levels for
dioxins in food of animal origin and all animal feed have been
applicable since July 2002. However, due to lack of sufficient data
and scientific information at the time, no levels were set for
dioxin-like PCBs.
Since 2002, new data on dioxin-like PCBs has become available, and
the legislation adopted today [3 Feb 2006] lays down mandatory limits
for the combined level of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, based on
World Health Organization (WHO) toxic equivalency factors for these
substances.
Food and feed operators have primary responsibility for ensuring that
the maximum levels are complied with, while Member State authorities
must carry out checks and report to the Commission on their findings.
The Commission intends to further review the maximum levels by 31 Dec
2008, with a view to significantly reducing them further.
More expected targets
-------
It is foreseen that the Commission will also adopt a Recommendation
next Monday [13 Feb 2006] which sets "action levels" and foresees
"target levels" for dioxins and PCBs in feed and food. The action
levels are intended as a tool for the early warning of higher than
desirable levels of dioxins in food and feed. They are set at a lower
level than the maximum levels, and if the action level is exceeded,
an investigation should be carried out as to the cause of the
presence of dioxins.
Once identified, measures should then be taken to reduce or eliminate
this cause. This should result in a further decrease of the presence
of dioxins and PCBs in feed and food. The target levels, which will
be subsequently set, are the levels to be ultimately achieved in
order to bring human exposure below the recommended tolerable intake.
Target levels will act as the driving force for further measures.

Dutch farmers, feed makers angry at dioxin incident
-----------------------------------------------
Dutch farmers and feed makers expressed anger on Monday [6 Feb 2006]
over contamination of feed with the carcinogen dioxin, saying
measures should be taken to prevent such problems that damage the
industry's image.
Hundreds of pig farms, including a handful which also raise chickens,
are still quarantined in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, as
authorities probe levels of dioxin in feed and meat after toxins were
found in Belgian pork fat ingredients.
It is the latest contamination problem to hit Europe after a similar
case in 2004, when dioxin, a class of chemicals widely used in
industrial processes, was found in Dutch potato feed.
"This incident has an impact not only on the quarantined farms, but
the whole livestock breeding industry. Sales are stagnating as a
result of import bans ... and damage to trade is rising rapidly," the
main Dutch farmers' organization LTO said in a statement.
"The damage to our reputation is also considerable. This not
acceptable for us," it said.
South Korea banned pork meat from Belgium and the Netherlands, one of
the world's top meat exporters, some 2 weeks ago, when news about the
dioxin contamination 1st broke.
LTO said the existing rules on controlling animal feed were not
enough to guarantee their safety and urged the Dutch feed makers
association Nevedi to come up with a proposal soon on how to prevent
future incidents.
Compliance with rules
--------
Nevedi, however, said the problem did not lie with the rules but in
their implementation, adding that authorities should do more to make
sure companies, which provide raw materials to the feed industry,
comply with the standards.
"It is very annoying given, the impact it is having on our industry,"
Wil van de Fliert, Nevedi's chairman, told Reuters.
"It is not a question of having a system (of rules and preventive
measures), as the system is in place, but it is a question of people
not complying with it," he said.
A spokeswoman for the Dutch food safety authority VWA declined to
comment. VWA says on its website that safety measures taken by the EU
and the government have increasingly reduced the number of dioxin
incidents in the past several years.
VWA said in a statement later on Monday [6 Feb 2006] that it had
reopened another 42 pig farms after meat test results were favorable.
It expects more results later in the week, as 159 out of the
initially 250 quarantined farms remain shut.
Contaminated feed has triggered several west European food scares,
such as the discovery of dioxin in Dutch potato animal feed in 2004,
an illegal hormone in Dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 Belgian scandal
of dioxin in chickens.
Authorities have said that the dioxin in the latest incident got into
Belgian pork fat ingredients used to make animal feed in October
2005. It was discovered and announced in late January 2006.
Belgian food safety officials have said the contamination was caused
by broken filters which led to the use of unfiltered ingredients to
extract pig fat from the process of making gelatin at Belgian firm PB
Gelatins.
The extracted fat was later distributed to Belgian animal feed
producers, such as Leroy and Algoet. Shares in Belgian chemical firm
Tessenderlo, which owns PB Gelatins, fell last week on the dioxin
news.
The EU said on Friday [3 Feb 2006] it planned to tighten its rules on
toxic chemicals like dioxins in food and animal feed, hoping to avoid
a repeat of the latest scare in the 3 EU countries.
Dioxins are toxic chemicals that originate in pesticides or
industrial processes. They are not soluble in water and are not
biodegradable, so they are persistent and accumulate in the food
chain over time.

EU sets dioxin and PCB levels for food and feed
-----------------------------------------------
The European Commission has set maximum levels for dioxins and PCBs
in food, as fears grow in 3 EU countries, where pig and poultry feed
was found to be contaminated with the family of cancer-causing
chemicals.
The limits will take effect from November 2006, giving food
processors and other sector companies another parameter to test for
when sourcing their ingredients or releasing their products to market.
Any food or feed in which the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs
exceeds these maximum levels will not be allowed to be marketed in
the EU.
Maximum levels for dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) in food and feed have been applicable since July 2002.
However, due to lack of sufficient data and scientific information at
the time, the Commission did not set levels for dioxin-like PCBs.
Since 2002, new data on dioxin-like PCBs has become available, the
Commission stated in adopting the new limits on Friday [3 Feb 2006].
The regulation lays down mandatory limits for the combined level of
dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. The new limit is part of the
Commission's policy to reduce persistent chemicals, such as dioxins
and dioxin-like PCBs in the food chain. Dioxins and PCBs have toxic
properties which can provoke a series of health problems, including
cancer, immune and nervous system disorders, liver damage and
sterility.
The Commission plans to adopt a recommendation today [6 Feb 2006]
that sets action levels and foresees target levels for dioxins and
PCBs in feed and food.
The action levels are intended as a tool for the early warning of
higher than desirable levels of dioxins in food and feed. They are
set at a lower level than the maximum levels, and if the action level
is exceeded, companies would be required to investigate the cause of
the presence of dioxins.
"Once identified, measures should then be taken to reduce or
eliminate this cause," the Commission stated. "This should result in
a further decrease of the presence of dioxins and PCBs in feed and
food. The target levels, which will be subsequently set, are the
levels to be ultimately achieved in order to bring human exposure
below the recommended tolerable intake. Target levels will act as the
driving force for further measures."
Last week, food regulators in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany
placed quarantines on hundreds more pig and poultry producers that
received contaminated feed.
So far, only South Korea has banned the import of pork from Belgium
and the Netherlands as a result of the discovery. The country is the
most important non-EU destination for pork produced in the 2
countries. They exported a total of 25 000 tons of pork worth about
USD 62 million to South Korea in 2005. A total of about 650 pig and
poultry farms are now under quarantine in the 3 countries.
Food safety regulators in the Netherlands and Belgium also announced
that some of the meat from contaminated farms was sold in shops over
the last 2 months. Both regulators said the level of contamination
did not pose any serious risk to public health.
On Friday [3 Feb 2006], Belgium extended a quarantine to a total of
386 pig and poultry producers suspected of receiving feed
contaminated with the carcinogen, doubling the number the country's
food safety agency (FAVV) had originally banned from the market. Of
these, 361 were pig farms, 24 were poultry farms, and one was a
rabbit producer.

Tessenderlo, a feed ingredients company fingered as the source of the
contamination, today [6 Feb 2006] said that an inadequate test had
resulted in the error.
"For Tessenderlo Group, discussions about compensation and amicable
settlements are premature as long as the various investigations are
under way," the Belgium-based company stated. "The problem shows that
the PCB test was inadequate for testing dioxins and that we were
wrong, as were most specialists, to rely on it."
<http://www.foodproductiondaily.com/search/search.asp?KEYWORDS=PCB&period=all>
The discovery of the dioxin contamination was 1st reported by the
Netherlands, which on 25 Jan 2006 sent out an EU-wide alert on pig
fat originating from Belgium. The Netherlands said its tests
indicated dioxin levels 25 times the maximum permitted concentrations
in pork fat.
<http://www.foodproductiondaily.com/search/search.asp?KEYWORDS=dioxin&period=all>
The dioxin was discovered in pork fat produced by Profat. FAVV said
that between 6 and 28 Oct 2005, 2 filters at Tessenderlo Chemicals
were defective, resulting in untreated hydrochloric acid being
delivered to its subsidiary, PB Gelatins. PB Gelatins in turn
supplied animal feed producers with dioxin-contaminated ingredients.
FAVV found that a normal consumption of such gelatin produced by PB
Gelatins is less than 25 percent of the amount of acceptable dioxin
consumption.
"That thus means that there is currently no immediate danger to the
public health," the agency stated.
Belgium and the Netherlands, along with France and Germany, are among
the top pig meat producers in the EU. The Netherlands accounted for
about 8 percent of the EU's production in 2000, according to the
bloc's figures.
Dioxin has been the cause of numerous food scares. It was found in
Dutch potato animal feed in 2004. Pig farmers in the Netherlands were
found to be using it as an illegal hormone for pigs in 2002.
Belgium's meat industry suffered a similar blow in 1999, when dioxin
was discovered in pigs and chickens. Then, the industry lost millions
of euros, either through a quarantine of some 200 Belgian farms, or
through the loss of their export markets after some countries imposed
bans.
The country ended up slaughtering 7 million chickens and 60 000 pigs.
The scare, which occurred just before the 1999 general election,
played a key part in the landslide defeat of the former government of
Jean-Luc Dehaene.

[It seems that the old adage of "if we do not know where we have been
then we are destined to repeat our mistakes" is appropriate here. One
of the worst dioxin events occurred in Italy, and there is well over
25 years of human data from that accident. This particular incident
is many many times below the 1998 level, and that was many times
below the incident in Italy.
Risks in today's world will never be zero. We take the risk of
getting in automobiles, planes, and even on our bicycles. Accidents
will happen despite the best precautions. Therefore, it seems prudent
to base our decisions on science, especially when there is such an
abundance of human data, and stop reacting out of fear. - Mod.TG]
