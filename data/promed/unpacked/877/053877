Recent research - November 2015
-------------------------------
A compilation of recent research publications relevant to rabies epidemiology

1. Epidemiology of rabies in Oman: a retrospective study (1991-2013).
A total of 22 788 cases of animal bites were reported in Oman between 1991 and 2013, with 8 human rabies cases reported (mostly from wild animals) with 100 percent mortality. Of 758 suspected animals tested, 56.1 percent were positive for rabies, with foxes showing the highest positivity rate, or 70.1 percent.

2. Rabies epidemiology and control in Ecuador.
In 1996, Ecuador suffered the highest rate of rabies per capita in the Americas. Human and canine rabies fell sharply until 2012 due to massive canine vaccination campaigns, with a very high correlation (0.925) between annual cases of dog and human rabies. In 2011, a distinct viral strain originating in vampire bat populations led to 11 fatalities in the Amazon region.

3. Rabies cases in the west of China have 2 distinct origins.
In some areas, such as Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, and Ningxia in western China cases have been rising since 2011. Analysis of samples collected from these regions suggests 2 different sources. Strains collected from Gansu and Ningxia are closely related to the viruses of the current epizootic, whereas those from Tibet and Qinghai are related to the Arctic-like-2 lineage that is most commonly associated with wildlife.

4. Government response to the discovery of a rabies virus reservoir species on a previously designated rabies-free island, Taiwan, 1999-2014.
From 2013 up to December 2014, there have been 423 rabies-confirmed ferret-badgers and 3 cases of spillover infection into non-reservoir hosts in Taiwan. The virus is genetically distinct from all other known rabies virus variants, and only one strain, sequestered to the mountainous regions, exists in Taiwan. Dogs and cats should be vaccinated to stop the spread of the disease from mountainous regions to domestic meso-carnivores.
