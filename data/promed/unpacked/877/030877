Today [Wed 8 Jul 2020], 3 more cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) were detected in Penang [Pulau Pinang], bringing to 6 the total number of cases so far [this year (2020)].

State Agriculture, Agro-based, Rural Development and Health Committee chairman Dr Norlela Ariffin said 2 new cases were detected in Sungai Bakap, Seberang Perai Selatan (SPS), and one case in Balik Pulau, Barat Daya district.

"I was informed by the Penang Health Department that the 3 cases have been confirmed positive and the victims are children, but all of them are reported to be in stable condition," she told Bernama when contacted.

Dr Norlela declined to reveal the age and sex of the victims but said they did not show any serious symptoms.

"Tests on pigs are generally negative for JE because the window for JE to emerge is quite short. So it could still come from the pigs in the farms; furthermore, most cases of JE show no symptoms," Dr Norlela said.

She said that since the disease was spread through bites from the _Culex_ mosquito, [destroying] the breeding sites of the mosquito, larviciding fumigation, and fogging will be carried out at the affected locations to break the chain of infection by destroying the larvae and adult mosquitoes.

Pig farmers and owners are advised to maintain cleanliness in their areas and destroy mosquito breeding grounds.

"The public is advised to get immediate treatment at the health clinics or hospital if they have fever and symptoms of JE infection such as headaches, fits, or neurological changes," she said.

[As noted previously, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is endemic in peninsular Malaysia, including Penang, and cases occur sporadically there. In 2014, a student from Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampung Selamat in Tasek Gelugor, Penang, was admitted to the hospital after being infected with the JE virus. And now we have 6 cases this 2020 transmission season.

Because sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occur in Penang and the rest of Malaysia, vaccination is the best preventive measure. Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Peninsular Malaysia is well within the JE virus endemic area. Control of vector mosquitoes is difficult. Elimination of breeding sites around buildings and avoidance of mosquito bites are prudent preventive measures. However, because vector mosquito control over large areas is difficult and expensive, vaccination is perhaps the most effective measure to prevent cases of JE.

In JE virus-endemic areas, birds, especially ardeids (herons and relatives), are reservoir hosts of the virus, which is transmitted by several species of mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_. Pigs can serve as amplifying hosts. - Mod.TY
