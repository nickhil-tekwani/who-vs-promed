The Colorado Department of Agriculture reported on Thu 3 Oct 2019 that 10 equine West Nile virus [WNV] cases have been confirmed in 8 Colorado counties, including one horse in Larimer County.

Three horses were found to have the disease in Weld County, and the others were in Adams, Garfield, Mesa, Montrose, Pueblo and Rio Blanco counties, according to a news release.

"Veterinarians report more of the horses seem to be acutely neurologic with severe symptoms. Four of the horses have been euthanized due to the severity of the clinical signs," the release stated.

The Colorado State Veterinarian's Office recommended vaccinating horses against West Nile, 1st with a 2-shot series, followed by annual booster shots.

[West Nile virus is transmitted to horses by mosquitoes. The vaccine is very effective. It is often combined with vaccines for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), western equine encephalitis, and tetanus, so one vaccination covers a lot of diseases. Each of these diseases generally needs a series of 2 shots followed by revaccination annually. However, in areas where EEE is most prevalent, revaccination may be necessary, as immunity to EEE wanes sooner than EEE season diminishes. - Mod.TG
