Health Experts Fear Chinese Flu Vaccination Plan Could Backfire
---------------------------------------------------------------
China's plans to vaccinate billions of chickens against avian flu
could backfire and end up spreading the disease, poultry and vaccine
experts warned last week [3rd week November 2005].
Vaccination teams can easily carry the virus from farm to farm on
their shoes, clothes and equipment unless they change or sterilize
them each time, the experts said. That could be particularly
difficult in a country like China, where the veterinary care system
is underfinanced and millions of birds are kept in small flocks by
families.
Also, experts said the task is likely to be overwhelming, because the
Chinese eat about 14 billion chickens a year, so mass vaccinations
would have to be repeated again and again, while the risk of the
disease being reintroduced by migratory birds, in which it is now
endemic, would be constant.
Bird vaccination campaigns involve a huge amount of labor because the
animals must be injected one by one. China's Agriculture Ministry
said last Tuesday [15 Nov 2005] that it would inject all of the
nation's 5.2 billion chickens, geese and ducks with a vaccine.
Vaccinators were partly to blame for an outbreak of exotic Newcastle
disease in California that lasted from 1971 to 1973, Dr. Carol
Cardona, a poultry expert at the University of California at Davis,
said last week [3rd week November 2005].
In that case, the disease arrived with South American parrots
imported for pet stores and spread to commercial poultry farms, but
the state tried to vaccinate all "backyard birds," like home-raised
poultry.
"It became very clear that the vaccination crews themselves actually
spread the virus," Dr. Cardona said. "It's very likely that this may
happen in China as well."
To prevent that, crews must use disposable clothes and shoe covers
and disinfect their hands and equipment after vaccinating each flock,
said Dr. David A. Halvorson, a professor of avian health at the
University of Minnesota.
China conducted the largest polio immunization in history in the
1990's, said Dr. David S. Fedson, retired medical director of the
vaccines division for Sanofi-Aventis, a French drug company that
produces flu vaccines. "They have the capability to perform acts of
social engineering beyond our wildest imaginings," he said. "But in
this case, you have to round up rural people and all their chickens.
Can they do it? I think probably not."
In making its announcement on Tuesday, the Chinese government did not
detail how it planned to vaccinate billions of birds safely.
Postings on ProMED-mail, a Web site that tracks outbreaks of
infectious diseases, noted that in photos from the Chinese news media
showing chickens being killed to stop an outbreak, the cullers lacked
even goggles, a standard piece of safety gear for poultry workers who
are likely to be spattered with blood.
Dr. Leon H. Russell, president of the World Veterinary Association,
said that an official from Viet Nam told him recently that Viet Nam
had despaired of ever vaccinating all its birds, because it would
need 100 000 more trained vaccinators [for estimated number of
required vaccinators in China, see item 2].
"So, for the life of me, I can't figure out how China will vaccinate
billions of chickens," he said.

How to Vaccinate 14 Billion Birds
---------------------------------
14 billion. That's how many ducks and chickens are produced in China
every year. To vaccinate all those birds against avian flu, as the
government announced last week [3rd week November 2005] that it was
planning to do, would require about 550 million injections a week.
Sound daunting? Here's another number: 1.3 billion. With 1/5th of the
world's population, China has no shortage of people to accomplish the
task.
G. Donald Ritter, director of health services for Mountaire Farms, a
large poultry producer based in Selbyville, Del., said that, if any
country could inoculate all its poultry, China was it. "It's labor
intensive," he said of the process. "But they've got more people and
labor than anybody."
China has had more than 60 outbreaks of avian influenza among poultry
in the last 2 years. While a widespread vaccination program can help
control outbreaks, the usual procedure in most countries is "cull and
quarantine," killing all birds within a few miles of the affected
area and quarantining all others in a larger area.
Dr. Ritter, who was among a group of veterinarians and scientists sent by the
United States to Beijing 2 weeks ago [1st week of November 2005] to discuss
poultry health issues, said that birds would be injected at about 2 weeks of
age, followed by a booster shot 4 weeks later.
The usual dose is 1/4 to 1/2 a milliliter, so millions of liters of
vaccine will be required. "They can gear up to make tremendous
quantities," Dr. Ritter said. "And it's not tremendously expensive."
The process of injecting the birds is straightforward. "You pen them off," he
said. "And then you work them against the pen, pick them up, [inject] them and
throw them" outside the pen. In the United States, he said, breeder chickens
are vaccinated in this way (for other diseases, not for avian flu); a crew of
about 6 people with vaccine guns can inject about 10 000 birds in 3 hours. At
that level of efficiency, at least 10 000 workers would be needed to vaccinate
China's birds [compared with Viet Nam's estimate of 100 000 vaccinators for
their much smaller country -- see [1] above. - Mod.JW].
But the Chinese program will be nowhere near that efficient.
Vaccinations are easiest in large poultry houses; the workers can
move the pen through the building, methodically injecting every bird
along the way. Most of China's birds are in small flocks in villages,
and often are running loose. "The door-to-door stuff is going to
require more manpower," Dr. Ritter said. "But they've got enough
people to do it. They just need to fan out within the village." And
then come back 4 weeks later and do it again.

[It is impossible to predict if the pessimism in [1] above, or the more
optimistic expectations expressed by Dr Ritter in [2], will prevail. There are
several main optional action schemes which HPAI-affected countries may apply
when the control or eradication of HPAI within their territories is
contemplated:
1. Stamping out* without vaccination.
2. Modified stamping out* without vaccination.
3. Stamping out combined with selective vaccination.
4. Modified stamping out combined with selective vaccination.
5. Modified stamping out combined with mass vaccination.
6. Mass vaccination combined with selective biosecurity measures.
(*The definition of stamping-out policy, according to chapter 1.1.1
("General definitions") in OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2005
edition), is:
"carrying out under the authority of the Veterinary Administration,
on confirmation of a disease, the killing of the animals which are
affected and those suspected of being affected in the herd and, where
appropriate, those in other herds which have been exposed to
infection by direct animal to animal contact, or by indirect contact
of a kind likely to cause the transmission of the causal pathogen.
All susceptible animals, vaccinated or unvaccinated, on an infected
premises should be killed and their carcasses destroyed by burning or
burial, or by any other method which will eliminate the spread of
infection through the carcasses or products of the animals killed.
This policy should be accompanied by the cleansing and disinfection procedures
defined in this Terrestrial Code.
The term "Modified stamping-out policy" should be used in communications to
the OIE whenever the above animal health measures are not implemented in full
and details of the modifications should be given".
While stamping out may involve, in addition to the affected premises,
also the killing of animals in other sites (e.g. within a prescribed
radius around the affected premises, or in-contacts in other
locations), modified stamping out will include the killing of the
affected flocks/herds or affected animals only, applying other, less
severe measures in relation to unaffected in-contacts or
adjacent/close holdings. Generally, stamping out policy is combined
with non-vaccination policy, while modified stamping out is applied
when vaccination is allowed or prescribed. Vaccination may be
geographically restricted or general.)
All the above 6 schemes must include the application of surveillance
and basic, crucial biosecurity measures (quarantine of infected
holdings, movement and transportation restrictions within areas to be
defined, cleansing/disinfection etc). Additional variations may be
considered, such as the use of DIVA (Differentiating Infected from
Vaccinated Animals) strategy; see in 20050307.0680, 20030428.1047.
A key international meeting, addres
sing the Global Strategy for the Progressive Control of Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza (HPAI), was convened by FAO, OIE , WHO and the World Bank in
Geneva during the second week of November 2005. The 600 participants from 100
countries discussed a strategy paper prepared by FAO and OIE, within the
umbrella of the global framework for the control of transboundary animal
diseases (GF-TADs), and in collaboration with WHO; the said document is
available at
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/documents/ai/HPAIGlobalStrategy31Oct05.
pdf>.
Prepared before the publication of the first reported human AI cases
in China, the said document includes the following text in article
3.3.1.4 which deals with the situation in P.R.China -- indicating the
recommended disease-control strategy there:
"China experienced HPAI infection well before the current crisis began in late
2003 and early 2004. It has not reported any human cases, but has a vast duck
population that acts as a source of infection for terrestrial poultry. China
is vaccinating domestic poultry and ducks in high-risk areas, using locally
produced inactivated vaccines, as the principal method of controlling the
disease, given the widespread nature of HPAI in the country. Vaccine efficacy
in ducks appears to be good, with a reportedly significant reduction in virus
shedding.
Within the immediate to medium-term (1-6 years) the current disease control
strategies applied will be improved and consolidated. This will involve
proactive, risk-based surveillance, stamping out, application of biosecurity
measures, and strategic vaccination with well-defined good quality vaccines.
Vaccination of terrestrial poultry will be linked with a well-structured post-
vaccination surveillance programme to provide better information on the
disease dynamics and the impact of increasing flock immunity in domestic
poultry. Further field studies will be carried out to determine the impact of
duck vaccination on the level and duration of virus shedding under field
conditions.
In the medium- to long-term (4-6 years) the disease will be pushed
back into well-defined areas. This will provide an opportunity for
the country to establish disease free compartments to trade safely in
poultry products within 7-10 years."
The new Chinese plan, published after the reporting of human cases
and the further spread of the disease into additional provinces,
seems to take the plan further from strategic vaccination (which
usually involves commercial farms) into mass vaccination (meant to
cover all domestic birds, including small- and backyard holdings).
Such an action should entail the needed post-vaccination surveillance
programme: an additional significant burden.
There is no known precedent to such an ambitious plan. While the required
biosecurity measures by vaccinating teams can be improved, the possible impact
of mass vaccination upon the evolution of new virus strains is a debatable
issue. The response of the international organisations and their experts to
this plan is anticipated with interest. - Mod. AS].
