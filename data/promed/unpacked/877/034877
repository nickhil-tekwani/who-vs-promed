The 1st _Naegleria fowleri_ patient has died at Services Hospital, Punjab Health Department officials confirmed yesterday [2 Nov 2015].

The patient, 28 years old, worked in a private firm, was admitted with fever, headache, and vomiting at the Services Hospital on 21 Oct 2015. On 22 Oct 2015, he became unconscious and was declared in comma [coma].

His CSF sample was examined locally and also sent to Agha Khan University [AKU] hospital in Karachi for naegleria microscopy and PCR test. AKU Hospital declared the sample positive for naegleria. The patient died on [28 Oct 2015].

The epidemiological link could not be established as he had no travel history and no history of swimming. Naegleria cases have been detected in Karachi in the past. The department collected 6 water samples from the victim's house and office and the nearby mosque, which were sent to the Institute of Public Health for analysis. The report says none of the water samples contains _Naegleria fowleri_, a brain-eating amoeba commonly found in lakes, rivers, and hot springs.

Adviser to Punjab chief minister of health, Kh Salman Rafiq, has constituted a committee headed by EDO [executive district officer] Health Lahore for monitoring surveillance and other steps regarding naegleria disease.

He said that WASA [Water and Sanitation Agency], Walton Cantonment Board, and Auqaf [organization] Department have been asked for chlorination of water supply, water ponds and water tanks of mosques for checking breeding of naegleria.

[Please refer to the comment in the 3 Sep 2014 ProMED-mail posting of a similar case from Pakistan (archive no 20140903.2746573), which describes "the religious rite of ablution included in Yogic, Ayurvedic, and Islamic traditions. Within the Islamic faith, ritual nasal rinsing is included in a cleansing process called wudu, or ablution. It is usually performed several times a day in preparation for prayer, according to CDC. The deadly parasite has also been contracted via the use of neti pots. These practices where water is introduced into the sinuses is an obvious route of infection with _Naegleria fowleri_."

The report above does not indicate whether the investigation for risk factors included nasal cleansing practices by the patient. The fact that environmental sampling did not find free living amoeba does not exclude that water used for nasal cleansing was the source of infection. ProMED-mail will be happy to post information on whether the patient had used nasal rinsing before he fell ill. - Mod.EP
