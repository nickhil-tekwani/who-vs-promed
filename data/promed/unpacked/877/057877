There are 3 issues that I would like to comment on with respect to that PROMED posting [refer to items in the see also section, below]:

1. The moderator or others involved in the case appear to have mis-diagnosed the alopecia described in the case as photosensitisation. To my knowledge, hairy-nosed wombats (_Lasiorhinus latifrons_) have all-pigmented skin, so theoretically they will not become photosensitised. Light will not penetrate through the pigmented epidermis to the dermal capillaries which are the site of the photosensitising reaction initiated only when light impinges on the sensitiser molecules (either phylloerythrin in secondary photosensitisation or fluorescent plant pigments in primary photosensitisation) embedded in the vessel walls.

If I am wrong about wombat skin and it is insufficiently pigmented to prevent light penetration (as may occur in the skin of roan cattle, for example), then photosensitisation is possible, but this disease process always produces dermatitis and the clinical description given implies that that had not occurred: no oedema, erythema, weeping of serum from the skin, scab formation, necrosis or skin sloughing were reported. Either way, I do not believe that the wombats were photosensitised.

As an alternative interpretation, may I suggest that the alopecia in these animals is likely to have resulted from a non-specific stress reaction, analogous to that which happens in sheep from time to time when they develop a break in the wool staple following diseases of various kinds (not photosensitisation).

2. A specific technically complete report on the pathological findings (necropsy, histopathology and toxicology) is needed to enlighten ProMED subscribers on the pathological and toxicological basis of this disease. Specifically, was there a liver lesion consistent with pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis? Was liver tissue assayed for the presence of pyrrolic metabolites?

3. The use of plant common names alone in scientific reports is unprofessional and potentially seriously misleading and is to be deplored in the strongest terms. This report appears to have originated from a non-scientific source, so some latitude is reasonable. Ideally, the suspected plants should be submitted to the South Australian state herbarium in Adelaide for professional botanists to confirm their identity and the botanical name reported to ProMED. The common name 'potato weed' certainly appears to refer to _Heliotropium europaeum_ in this case, but in Australia that name may also refer to species of Solanum plants that contain steroidal glycoalkaloids and produce poisoning of a quite distinct and different character to pyrrolizidine alkaloids.

I'm not doubting hepatotoxicity associated with PA's in heliotrope, but perhaps unusual to have hair loss with "normal" skin beneath associated with presumptive photosensitization secondary to liver damage. Such photosensitization is usually associated with severe, acute peripheral vasculitis, much irritation, pain and often secondary trauma to affected areas.

Hair loss associated with apparently normal smooth skin underneath can be associated with demodectic mange (which I presume would have been ruled out in this case), hormonal imbalances and possibly a Cushing's-like mineralocorticoid imbalance syndrome.

I'm wondering whether potential effects from excessive exposure to oestrogenic subterranean clovers or possibly zeralonone toxicity that could theoretically be associated with some fungi in herbage have been considered amongst the differentials?

[I would like to thank Dr. McKenzie for his insightful approach. Indeed, when dealing with lay press it is difficult to know exactly what is being conveyed. The issue of common plant names vs. scientific plant names is only one example.

Another example is the description of the skin lesions. They are quite incomplete. I appreciate knowing that these animals are dark skinned. It may indeed rule out photosensitization. However, does phylloerythrin manifest itself differently in these animals than our other domestic animals? Is there something different in their physiology that would cause a different metabolic pathway?

Dr. McKenzie suggested a number of things, such a finding which plant, if it is a plant causing the problem in these animals, and then sending us the correct name. I hope that he is successful in getting some work done on this problem. Perhaps Dr. McKenzie would agree to undertake these questions and get back to us?

As to David Thomson's suggestions, they are likely very valid and present some other differentials. One would think if it was demodectic mange that it would already have been diagnosed. - Mod.TG]
