The New Mexico Department of Health has reported the 1st case of plague this year [2019], in Quay County. Health officials say a ranch dog was reported with the illness but has since recovered, thanks to treatment from his veterinarian.

Plague is an infectious disease caused by bacteria usually transmitted through the bite of an infected flea. Animals can also be infected through the eating of other animals who are infected.

Humans can contract the plague through contact with tissues of infected animals and rarely through inhalation of coughed droplets from a sick pet. [Humans may also acquire the disease by being bitten by infected fleas. - Mod.TG]

"Plague can be deadly for pets and people if not promptly treated with antibiotics," said Kathy Kunkel, cabinet secretary for the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH). "We encourage pet owners to discuss with their veterinarians the best way to protect their animals from fleas."

Symptoms [in people] of the plague include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. Signs in animals include fever, tiredness, and loss of appetite.

Physicians in New Mexico who suspect plague should immediately call 505-827-0006.

Here are other recommendations from the Department of Health in order to avoid the plague:

- Avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits and their nests and burrows.
- Clean up areas near the home where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush or junk piles, outbuildings, sheds, and abandoned vehicles.
- Since pets who enjoy the outdoors can inadvertently carry infected fleas home, it is recommended they be on a flea-prevention product year-round.
- Prevent pets from roaming and hunting.
- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian.
- See your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and high fever, and be sure to describe to your provider if you've had contact with fleas, sick animals, or rodents.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection.

Plague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever (or chills). These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well as the cat. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat-fight abscess. Contact with the fluid from such an abscess carries a high risk of infection for the person contacting it.

Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities. Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea-prevention treatment for your pet, regardless of whether it is a cat, dog, or even a rabbit. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing, take the vacuum bag outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 3-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home. This disease should be taken seriously, so please be sure your pet is on some form of flea-prevention year around.

If your pets are not on flea prevention, please ask your veterinarian about the best flea prevention. Bathing your pet in dishwashing soap is not sufficient to help your pet avoid diseases carried by fleas. Some of the over-the-counter flea preventions may be harmful to your pet, so please check with your veterinarian. It is also a good time to make sure your pet is current on a rabies shot.

Keeping your pets inside is best, and being inside a yard will help diminish the ability to consume a dead animal and will further reduce the risk of plague to your animal and to yourself. - Mod.TG
