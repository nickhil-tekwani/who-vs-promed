Zoonotic rotavirus transmission may have occurred in Denmark
------------------------------------------------------------
In Denmark, 2 adults were infected in 2006 with a rare rotavirus
strain closely related to animal strains, suggesting zoonotic
transmission, according to a report today in Epidemiology and
Infection. The strain, G8P[14], was found in 2 patients who lived in
the same area, and nucleotide sequences of the VP7, VP4, VP6, and NSP4
genes of isolates from the 2 people were identical. In addition,
phylogenetic analyses showed both viruses closely clustered with
rotaviruses of cow and goat origin. The authors conclude, "The high
genetic relatedness to animal rotaviruses and the atypical
epidemiological features suggest that these human G8P[14] strains were
acquired through direct zoonotic transmission events," which are
uncommon.

[Rotaviruses (members of the genus _Rotavirus_) are classified in the
family _Reoviridae_, together with the genera: _Orthoreovirus_,
_Orbivirus_, _Coltivirus_, _Aquareovirus_, _Cypovirus_, _Fijivirus_,
_Phytoreovirus_, _Oryzavirus_, _Seadornavirus_, _Idnoreovirus_ and
_Mycoreovirus_. The genus _Rotavirus_ includes at least 7 serogroups
(A to G) that may be distinguished on the basis of their antigenic
relationships and the pattern of migration of the 11 dsRNA segments in
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Group A rotaviruses are important
enteric pathogens in humans and in a wide range of mammalian and avian
species. Individual strain designation within group A is complex. With
11 genome segments and ability to reassort genome sub-units, there is
ample scope for extensive genetic variation. Previously G8P[14]
strains have been isolated from cattle in western India and in Japan
which is in accord with the potential for zoonotic transmission
exhibited by the Danish virus.

The abstract of the original article which is published online in the
journal Epidemiology and Infection
(http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8391190
registration required) reads as follows: "Group A rotaviruses infect
humans and a variety of animals. In July 2006 a rare rotavirus strain
with G8P[14] specificity was identified in the stool samples of 2
adult patients with diarrheoa, who lived in the same geographical area
in Denmark. Nucleotide sequences of the VP7, VP4, VP6, and NSP4 genes
of the identified strains were identical. Phylogenetic analyses showed
that both Danish G8P[14] strains clustered with rotaviruses of animal,
mainly, bovine and caprine, origin. The high genetic relatedness to
animal rotaviruses and the atypical epidemiological features suggest
that these human G8P[14] strains were acquired through direct zoonotic
transmission events."
