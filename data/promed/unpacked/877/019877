First West Nile Virus Positive Horse Confirmed in Tennessee
-----------------------------------------------------------
A horse in Greene County, Tennessee, has been confirmed as positive
for West Nile virus (WNV) infection. This is the first confirmed equine
case of clinical WNV infection ever detected in that State. The horse
was an 8-year-old mare that had to be euthanatized on 6 Oct 2001 after
2 days of illness. There was no history of travel or vaccination for
WNV.
WNV infection was confirmed at the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, through positive results on a
WNV IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a
plaque-reduction neutralization test done on a serum sample.
More information on WNV, including WNV prevention and links to
State and local WNV web pages, is available on the APHIS website at:
