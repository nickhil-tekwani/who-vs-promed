Two provinces quarantined over foot and mouth disease outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities of Sukhbaatar and Dornod provinces have quarantined cattle
movement and restricted the sale of meat and milk in their territories
following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD].According to the
emergency commission, over 968 head of cattle had been infected but death
had not been reported yet. The number of infection is likely to grow further.

The problem was detected on 29 Aug 2010 in a farm in Chuluunkhoroot Soum,
Dornod Province when a local veterinarian examined 3 cows showing symptoms
of FMD. The central veterinary laboratory has confirmed that the 3 cows are
infected with the disease.

There are 15 251 head of cattle from 23 herding families in 4 epicenters in
the 2 provinces, 968 have been infected so far in the outbreak.

In connection with the high probability of spread, the State Emergency
Commission [SEC] held an emergency meeting and ordered relevant bodies and
officials to take prompt actions against the spread. In particular, it is
ordered to carry immediate disinfection and liquidations in epicenters and
in major auto road posts, co-work with force agencies to enforce the
quarantine regimen efficiently, limit some traffic in and out, and appoint
field emergency staff in epicenters. Besides, the SEC has decided to
immediately conduct preliminary tests and vaccination for all cattle in
Dornogobi, Dundgobi, Umnugobi, Gobisumber, and Tuv provinces as well in
Ulaanbaatar City.

It has also been decided to submit a draft resolution to [be considered at
a] cabinet meeting, [requesting] the allocation of MNT 50 million [about
USD 38 000] to fight against the disease in Sukhbaatar and Dornod
provinces, respectively, and another MNT 10 million [about USD 8000] for
preventive measures.

[Three FMD outbreaks in Eastern Mongolia were reported to the OIE earlier
this year (2010), occurring between 21 Apr and 14 Jun 2010. The isolated
FMD serotype O virus was sent to ARRIAH (Federal Centre for Animal Health,
OIE Regional Reference Laboratory for FMD for Eastern Europe, Central Asia,
and Transcaucasia in Vladimir, Russia) for further studies including
genotyping. According to the 2nd 2010 quarterly report of the WRLFMD,
Pirbright (see ProMED-mail 20100720.2437), a VP1 sequence, submitted to the
WRLFMD from ARRIAH, was shown to belong to the SEA (South East Asia)
topotype, Mya-98 lineage. Importantly, it appeared to be a different
introduction to outbreaks in PR China, Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea,
and Japan, as it was "most closely related to viruses from Thailand and
Malaysia from 2009".

The said Mongolian epizootic was declared as resolved on 11 Aug 2010; see
summary and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9210>.

On 1 Sep 2010, Mongolia submitted an immediate notification to the OIE on a
new FMD serotype O outbreak which started on 26 Aug 2010 and was confirmed
on 29 Aug 2010, affecting small ruminants (sheep/goats) in Sukhbaatar
(Suhbaatar) province, East Mongolia.

The current newswire indicates that the virus infects cattle as well, and
has spread to the Dornod province, neighbouring Sukhbaatar on its north,
similarly infecting cattle (map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/mongolia_pol_1996.pdf>).

Dornod neighbours the Russian territory of Zabaykalsk. On Mon 6 Sep 2010,
Russia submitted to the OIE an immediate notification on an outbreak of FMD
in the village Makarovo, Shilkinsky, Zabaykalsky Krai (territory).
Reportedly, cattle and swine were affected by an FMD virus of which the
serotyping was "pending" (see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9676>).
A previous FMD outbreak had been reported in the same territory on 19 Jul
2010, 12 km (7.5 mi) away from the Chinese border; this, apparently
solitary outbreak, has been declared "resolved" on 20 Aug 2010. The virus
involved in that outbreak was identified by ARRIAH as FMDV serotype O,
Southeast Asia topotype. Have the outbreaks in Mongolia and Russia been
declared as resolved somewhat prematurely? It may be assumed that the
viruses currently circulating in both countries (and, most likely, in
China) are identical; confirmation will help, as well as information on the
availability of potent, relevant vaccine(s).

A map showing the 17 FMD outbreaks reported by China during 2010 is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8988>; no
outbreaks have been reported from the north eastern regions bordering
Russia and Mongolia. - Mod.AS]
