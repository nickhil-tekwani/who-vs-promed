Mumps cases [are increasing in number] across the metropolis
[Halifax, Nova Scotia]. Public Health Services has confirmed 13 more
cases of this virus infection, bringing the number to 24 so far this
year [2007], whereas one or 2 cases per year is normal.
"We predict that cases will continue to accumulate as some people are
still coming into contact with infected cases. At this point our task
remains finding cases so we can prevent that as much as possible,"
Dr. Gaynor Watson-Creed, chief medical officer for the Capital
District, said in a news release today [Sat 31 Mar 2007].
"We remind people that if they have mumps or think they have mumps
they should not go to work, or school, or other activities until they
have checked with their doctor. We continue to ask cases to
self-isolate for the 9 days after they become sick to be sure that
they do not put others at risk."
Symptoms of mumps include fever and swelling of the glands at the
angle of the jaw [and of the testes. - Mod.JW].

[Information on the origin of this outbreak and the vaccination
status of the 24 victims would be appreciated. Reliance on
self-diagnosis and dependence on observation of personal quarantine
seem hardly adequate responses for containment of a
vaccine-preventable disease. - Mod.CP
