From: Peter H. Connelly <phconnelly@mindspring.com>

Just read with interest your piece on the blood sampling of Queens
residents and the extrapolation of the potential population affected by the
virus.
I am curious as to the group that was sampled from a socio-economic
standpoint. For instance, was the population sampled enticed to provide
samples in any way, possibly resulting in "selecting data" samples from
those possibly in need and more likely to suffer exposure due to poor or no
housing?
Was the sampled population truly representative of the borough?

[All I can do is assure Mr. Connelly that proper epidemiologic and
politically correct procedures were followed. CDC is a very professional
organization. When we have further information we will post it. Meanwhile,
this string is suspended. I am not among those who doubt the good
intentions of my government. - Mod.CHC
