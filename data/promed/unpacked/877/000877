_Culicoides chiopterus_ a potential vector of bluetongue virus in Europe
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In August 2006 bluetongue (BT) appeared for the 1st time in northern
Europe and by December [2006] had affected more than 2000 sheep and cattle
holdings in the 5 Member States (MSs) Belgium, France, Luxembourg,
Germany, and The Netherlands. Following upon a mild winter BT
recrudesced explosively in 2007 and by the end of the year 10 MSs had
reported more than 55 000 outbreaks in total. While outbreaks in The
Netherlands continued to occur in the previously affected southern
regions, ever-increasing numbers of infections were being reported
also from the central and more northerly parts of the country. To
establish which species of _Culicoides_ were involved in this
northward movement of BTV, an entomological field study was conducted
in the central district of Apeldoorn.

Between 3-17 Oct 2007, 45 912 _Culicoides_ were captured in 65 light
trap collections made on one sheep and 4 cattle farms; after
morphological identification and age-grading at the Plant Protection
Service in Wageningen 3138 non-engorged, parous, and gravid female
midges were selected and divided amongst 81 species-specific pools,
and represented by 1899 _C. chiopterus_ (44 pools), 738 _C.
obsoletus/scoticus_ (18), 433 _C. dewulfi_ (14), and 68 _C.
punctatus_ (5); each pool contained 1-65 individual midges. The pools
were code-numbered and then screened by the Central Veterinary
Institute, Lelystad, for the presence of BTV-8 using an in-house
developed, and extensively validated, RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction] test.

Amongst the 44 pools of _C. chiopterus_, one pool of 50 parous midges
was found reproducibly PCR-positive in the RT-PCR assay to BTV. The
field infection rate for _C. chiopterus_ thus approximates 0.05
percent based on the assumption that only one midge contained
detectable levels of BTV. This finding is original in that _C.
chiopterus_ has never before been linked to the transmission of BTV
in Europe.

Aspects of the behavioural ecology of _C. chiopterus_ are known, the
most pertinent from a veterinary point of view being that it attacks
cattle and horses and breeds exclusively in their dung. For these
reasons _C. chiopterus_ can be aligned with another coprophilic
species, that is, _C. dewulfi_, which is considered also a potential
vector for BTV and based on similar RT-PCR-positive results obtained
during the 2006 phase of the outbreak.

Within the Palaearctic biting midge fauna, _C. chiopterus_ is a
monophyletic taxon of the subgenus _Avaritia_, but like _C. dewulfi_
is mostly erroneously placed within the so-called _C. obsoletus_ group
or Obsoletus Complex.

In 2006 a "snapshot" survey revealed both _C. chiopterus_ and _C.
dewulfi_ to be widely distributed across The Netherlands, occurring
on approximately 70 percent of 106 farms sampled; during the same
survey the Obsoletus Complex, another potential vector for BTV, and
represented by 2 species (_C. obsoletus_ and _C. scoticus_) was found
on 94 percent of the farms. This ubiquity of multiple vectors of BTV
holds true for large parts of northern Europe and helps explain the
dramatic spread of BT across the region. Of particular concern is
that some proven world vectors of BTV are competent at transmitting
another -- and more devastating -- pathogen, namely African horse
sickness virus (AHSV). Given the existence of some 400 000 horses in
The Netherlands it is essential that the veterinary authorities now
ascertain the population levels and biting behaviour of _C.
chiopterus_ in the vicinity of stables. This recommendation applies
to all MSs and to other potential vectors, principally _C. dewulfi_
and the Obsoletus Complex.

[The above firsthand, authoritative scientific information is warmly
welcomed and appreciated; it addresses ProMED-mail's requests for
original epidemiological data from the BTV-8 affected countries and
our repeated calls for enhanced entomological research efforts.

It will be interesting to obtain data from other BTV-8 affected
countries. The fact that both _C. dewulfi_ and _C. chiopterus_ are
coprophilic, breeding exclusively in cattle and horse dung, may be of
particular importance for the understanding of the BTV-8
overwintering mechanism in northern Europe, and the scope of its
expected further spread.

The warning of the authors about risk from other potentially
introduceable orbiviruses, such as AHS/African horse sickness viruses
(there are additional ones, such as EHD/epizootic hemorrhagic disease
virus in cattle and equine encephalosis virus), should receive the
required attention. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue: situation and perspectives, updated 19 Mar 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------
The following details, derived from the Source presentation, are of
interest, adding data to currently available information:

Epidemiology
------------
Renewed vector activity anticipated in April [2008]; virus circulation
anticipated mid-July.

Evolution of the epizootic
--------------------------
- 2006: 1st diagnoses end August; centrifugal spread from one initial
focus; 695 infected holdings; sheep/cattle: 4/3.
- 2007: 1st diagnoses mid July; centrifugal spread from the entire
infected zone of 2006; 6870 infected holdings.
- Then, disease peaked 24-30 Aug 2008 (maximal number of outbreaks/day
was 140).

Analysis of sheep mortality, based upon number of collected cadavers
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- in 2006, there was a gradually increasing mortality, totalling 2000
(1 percent of the population), observed mainly during the peak months
in severely affected provinces, predominantly adults.
- in 2007, increased numbers, observed since the beginning of the
season, more than 25 000 dead sheep (10 percent of the population),
affecting both adults as well as young animals.

Evolution of the disease in Europe (number of infected holdings)
----------------------------------------------------------------
- 2006: Belgium 695; Germany 860; Netherlands 451; France 6; Luxembourg 5.
- 2007: Belgium 6870; Germany more than 20 000; Netherlands more than
8000; France more than 12 000; Luxembourg more than 1300; UK more than
100; Switzerland 5; Denmark 1.

Targets for 2008
----------------
In the EU: application of the planned vaccination throughout the
infected area.
Short term:
- vaccination of more than 80 percent of susceptible animals;
- a significant decrease in case number during 2008;
- a decreased severity of clinical signs/symptoms for 2008.
Long term: eradication of the virus.

Vaccination scheme (Belgium)
----------------------------
Expected delivery scheme:
- May: 0.6 million doses for sheep (Merial); 1.5 million doses for
cattle (Fort Dodge)
- June: 2 million doses for cattle (Merial); 0.9 million doses for
cattle (Fort Dodge).
- July: 1 million doses for cattle (Merial)

Organisation of the vaccination
--------------------------------
(the following is presented in sequence of priority):
- compulsory:
1. sheep
2. cattle (under 2 years of age plus bulls for breeding)
3. cattle older than 2 years
- voluntary:
goats, deer, beef calves.
