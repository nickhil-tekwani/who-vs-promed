FDA and CDC Issue Alert on Menactra Meningococcal Vaccine and Guillain
Barre Syndrome
-----------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) are alerting consumers and health care providers to 5
reports of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) following administration of
Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine A, C, Y, and W135 (trade name Menactra),
manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. It is not known yet whether these cases
were caused by the vaccine or are coincidental. FDA and CDC are sharing
this information with the public now and actively investigating the
situation because of its potentially serious nature.
Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) is a serious neurological disorder that can
occur, often in healthy individuals, either spontaneously or after certain
infections. GBS typically causes increasing weakness in the legs and arms
that can be severe and require hospitalization.
Meningococcal infection, which Menactra prevents, is a major cause of
bacterial meningitis, affecting approximately one in 100 000 people
annually. The infection can be life threatening: 10-14 percent of cases are
fatal and 11-19 percent of survivors may have permanent disability.
According to Jesse Goodman, MD, Director of FDA's Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research, at the present time, there are no changes in
recommendations for vaccination; individuals should continue to follow
their doctors' recommendations. FDA and CDC are not able to determine
whether any or all of the cases were due to vaccination. The current
information is very preliminary, and the 2 agencies are continuing to
evaluate the situation.
Because of the potentially serious nature of this matter, FDA and CDC are
asking any persons with knowledge of any possible cases of GBS occurring
after Menactra administration to report them to the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) to help the agencies further evaluate the matter.
Individuals can report to VAERS on the web at
<http://www.vaers.hhs.gov>
or by phone at 1-800-822-7967.
The 5 cases of GBS reported following administration of Menactra occurred
in individuals living in New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. All
5 patients were 17 or 18 years of age and developed weakness or abnormal
sensations in the arms or legs 2-4 weeks after vaccination. All individuals
are reported to be recovering or to have recovered. More than 2.5 million
doses of Menactra vaccine have been distributed to date. The rate of GBS
based on the number of cases reported following administration of Menactra
is similar to what might have been expected to occur by coincidence, that
is, even without vaccination. However, the timing of the events is of
concern. Also, vaccine adverse events are not always reported to FDA, so
there may be additional cases of which we are unaware at this time.
Prelicensure studies conducted by Sanofi Pasteur of more than 7000
recipients of Menactra showed no GBS cases. CDC conducted a rapid study
using available health care organization databases and found that no cases
of GBS have been reported to date among 110 000 Menactra recipients.

5 Develop Nerve Disorder After Receiving Meningitis Vaccine
-----------------------------------------------
5 teenagers developed a serious neurological disorder within 2 to 4 weeks
after receiving the vaccine Menactra, which prevents a severe and deadly
form of meningitis, the Food and Drug Administration reported yesterday [30
Sep 2005].
All have recovered or are recovering from the illness, Guillain Barre
syndrome, which causes weakness in the arms and legs and can spread to the
chest and impair breathing. The drug agency said in a news release, "It is
not yet known whether these cases were caused by the vaccine or are
coincidental."
In the meantime, parents should continue to vaccinate their children, said
Dr. Karen Midthun, deputy director of the drug agency's Center for
Biologics Evaluation.
The vaccine is needed because meningococcal disease is a horrific illness
that comes on suddenly and can be rapidly fatal, with a death rate of about
10 percent. Among survivors, up to 19 percent wind up with permanent
disabilities.
The meningococcal disease affects about one person in 100 000 annually, and
college freshmen living in dormitories are among those at greatest risk of
contracting it.
Guillain Barre syndrome has a death rate as high as 5 percent, Dr. Midthun
said, adding that a majority "do recover, and recover fully."
Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at
Vanderbilt University, agreed that vaccination should continue and said
that he would insist on vaccination if he had children in the age group
generally vaccinated.
Menactra, made by Sanofi Pasteur, was licensed in the United States in
January [2005] and recommended for high school and college freshmen, 11-
and 12-year-olds and all travelers to certain countries. So far, more than
2.5 million people have received Menactra shots, and there have been no
other reports of Guillain Barre.
Statistically, the 5 cases could be coincidental. No cases were detected in
studies in 7000 patients before the vaccine was licensed.
Experts from the company, the drug agency and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention are studying the cases to try to determine whether
the vaccine was to blame. One possibility they will consider is whether the
syndrome was related to an infection caused by Campylobacter bacteria, a
common cause of food poisoning, particularly from chicken. In the United
States, the bacterium is linked to up to 40 percent of Guillain Barre cases.
The 5 cases occurred in New York, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The
limited region is puzzling, given the vaccine's wide use. That pattern
suggests that it is at least possible that something other than the vaccine
could be responsible, Dr. Schaffner said.
To find out whether there are more cases, the Food and Drug Administration
is asking doctors and the public to report any possible cases of the nerve
syndrome after vaccination via the Internet at
<http://www.vaers.hhs.gov>
or by calling (800) 822-7967.

[Information on the background incidence of meningococcal meningitis in the
USA can be found in the 27 May 2005 Recommendations and Reports (RR) Issue
of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Vol. 54 (RR07): 1-21,
Prevention and Control of Meningococcal Disease Recommendations of the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm>.
In 1976, there was an outbreak of GBS in the USA following administration
of the Swine Flu vaccine. A good review of this episode and background
information on GBS (and other suspected neurologic events associated with
receipt of Influenza vaccine) can be found in the Institute of Medicine's
publication Immunization Safety Review: Influenza Vaccines and Neurological
Complications by Stratton K, Alamario DA, Wizemann T, and McCormick MC,
(Editors, Immunization Safety Review Committee)
<http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10822.html?onpi_newsdoc0309090865>.
"GBS is an acute, immune-mediated paralytic disorder of the peripheral
nervous system. Estimates of the annual incidence of GBS range from 0.4 to
4.0 cases per 100 000 population, with most studies pointing to a level of
from one to 2 cases per 100 000 (Hughes and Rees, 1997; Magira et al.,
2003). GBS occurs throughout the year, and in the United States, the
condition is more likely to occur in adults than in children (Asbury, 2000).
About 2/3rds of GBS cases occur several days or weeks after an infectious
event (Hughes and Rees, 1997), commonly a diarrheal illness or a virus-like
upper-respiratory infection. From 20 percent to 40 percent of all GBS cases
are associated with Campylobacter jejuni infections (Buzby et al., 1997).
Exposure to certain vaccines has also been associated with an increased
risk for GBS. The potential association between GBS and influenza vaccines,
most notably the 1976 swine influenza vaccine, has been widely studied and
is the subject of this report.
The characteristic clinical feature of GBS is an acute, rapidly
progressive, symmetrical weakness, with loss of deep tendon reflexes,
possible tingling in the feet and hands, and muscle aches (myalgia).
Approximately 85 percent of patients will return to normal functioning
within 6 to 9 months, but some patients experience relapses or a prolonged
disease course with residual neurological deficits (Asbury, 2000; Joseph
and Tsao, 2002). The mortality rate is 3-5 percent, with patients
succumbing to undetected respiratory failure, malfunction of the autonomic
nervous system, or to complications of immobility, such as sepsis or
pulmonary embolism (Joseph and Tsao, 2002)."
At present, the report of 5 cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) after
more than 2.5 million doses of vaccine have been distributed is not outside
of what might be expected by chance alone. Concerns are that the current
reporting system for adverse events following vaccination is a passive
reporting system, and therefore there may be under-reporting so that these
5 cases may represent the "tip of the iceberg" of a greater problem. Hence,
the alert to the health care profession to be aware of the possibility of
GBS following receipt of this vaccine and the need to report all suspected
cases through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), switching
from a passive reporting system to a more active reporting system, raising
the awareness of the health sector to this potential problem.
