Yellowknife toddlers are catching hand, foot and mouth virus.

A disease that can cause a painful rash, sores and dehydration is circulating in Sudbury, the health unit says. Hand, foot and mouth disease is not on the Ontario Reportable Disease list, so there's no way to know how many cases are in Sudbury, said Lisa Schell, the manager of clinical and family services with the health unit. Schell said the health unit has been receiving calls from concerned parents.

"We do know that there are some children who have been diagnosed in our community," she said. Once we know that there are children in the community with hand, foot and mouth disease, there's certainly probably others who are ill with it as well."

Hand, foot and mouth disease is a virus-transmitted disease. Symptoms include a fever, poor appetite, lack of energy, discomfort, sore throat, headache, small painful mouth sores and a skin rash that looks like red spots, often with blisters on top. That rash usually appears on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, but can show up on other areas of the body, Schell said.

There is no specific treatment. There is no blood test to confirm [the diagnosis], but Schell suggested a visit to a health care provider if a child is showing symptoms. "The diagnosis of hand, foot and mouth disease is based on the appearance of the rash," she said. "With hand, foot and mouth disease, we basically have to let it run its course. There's no specific treatment for the illness."

Children do not need to be excluded [from school] if they are diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease, Schell said. "If the child is unwell, let them lay low and treat them with bed rest and lots of fluids," she said. "Watch for signs of dehydration in case the child is not drinking or eating."

Serious complication includes dehydration, and Schell notes if a child with hand, foot and mouth disease has sores in their mouth, watch what they drink. "It can be painful, especially if they're drinking highly acidic fruit juices," she said. "The good thing about hand, foot and mouth is that once a child has had the disease, they are immune to it subsequently," she said.

The virus also tends to be more common in the summer and fall, Schell said. "It's just the nature of the virus," she explained. "We usually see more individuals getting out and about."

[This is a rather inadequate account of an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Canada. Although comparatively uncommon in well-developed societies, hand, foot and mouth disease is common in underdeveloped or overpopulated regions of the world, and several different enteroviruses have been identified as responsible for outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease, the most prevalent being several coxsackieviruses and, in particular, enterovirus 71, sometimes responsible for neurological effects.

Hand, foot and mouth disease usually begins with a low-grade fever and general fatigue. A rash of tiny, painful red spots will appear within a couple of days and will soon begin to blister and sometimes form ulcers. These spots may appear at several sites over the body. Lymph nodes in the neck may also become swollen. The virus can cause the throat to feel sore and painful. Rarely, dehydration may occur as the pain due to the blisters in the mouth can make drinking difficult.

Daycare centres, parks, nursery schools, and other places where children play with each other are potential sites for the infection to be transmitted among children. HFMD is most common in the summer and early fall.

High standards of personal and social hygiene are the best protection against hand, foot, and mouth disease.

The WHO Surveillance Summary includes information from countries where transmission of HFMD occurs and case counts are routinely reported. - Mod.CP
