Cases of hydatid disease were detected in the suburban areas of
towns, and the Committee on Zoonoses is afraid of the impact on
humans. Approximately 10 000 people are at risk of infection.

In the last 3 years, the commission castrated 80 000 dogs, did 80 000
ultrasound scans and treated 100 000 dogs. They estimate that in
rural areas, between 7000 and 10 000 people may have hydatid cysts
and not know that they do.

The chairman of the Committee on Zoonoses, Ciro Ferreira, said that
although the disease is under control, it remains a serious health
problem for rural communities.

Ferreira said that between 3-7 percent of dogs in suburban areas have
parasites. "And fishing in these places and eating the viscera is
risky in Uruguay; not only are rural workers at risk but also people
in small towns." Ferreira said he is working on pilot programs to
ensure monitoring and control and to warn of the dangers.
