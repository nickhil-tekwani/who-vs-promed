Abdullah Orders Compensation for Rash of Camel Deaths
-----------------------------------------------------
Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah has ordered the
payment of compensations to the herdsmen whose camels died recently
showing symptoms of consuming toxic substances, the Saudi Press
Agency quoted Minister of Agriculture Fahd Balghunaim as saying
yesterday [16 Aug 2007].
Deaths of a large number of camels were reported from Wadi
Al-Dawasser governorate and other places after they showed symptoms
of poisoning. An official of the Agricultural Ministry dismissed the
presence of any camel disease in the region and attributed the
mysterious deaths over the past few days to a cattle feed containing
toxic substances supplied in markets of the region.
Muhammad Al-Shaiha, assistant undersecretary for animal resources at
the ministry, said in a press statement on Wednesday [15 Aug 2007]:
"On receiving reports of animal deaths the ministry sent a veterinary
team to inspect the animals and found that the deaths were caused by
the spasm of the nervous system, which led to a state of paralysis,
loss of consciousness and eventual death." He said the animals that
ate a particular type of feed have shown the symptoms. "The deaths
are not caused by any type of illness."
Al-Shaiha said that a total of 232 camels died while several other
camels responded to treatment by the veterinary team, according to
the Arabic daily Al-Watan. The official said the team sent samples
taken from the dead animals for further investigations.
On the other hand, Ali Al-Hasawi, a member of a veterinary team that
treated a number of cases in the region, said the right treatment for
the disease could not be decided without getting the results of the
laboratory tests and identifying the real cause of the deaths. "The
results of the laboratory tests will soon reveal if the deaths are
caused by any toxic feed or by some virus spreading in the air.
Reports indicate that the disease is spreading in a noticeable manner
in different regions in the Kingdom," the veterinarian said.
Meanwhile, local residents complained that the animal bodies posed a
serious environment threat in the region. They say the foul odor from
the carcasses is spreading in the villages making it impossible for
people to move about freely.
Abdullah Al-Saeed, an official of the local municipality, said that
steps were under way to burn and bury the bodies.

The possibility of Rift Valley fever (RVF) has to be investigated
since the virus had caused severe epidemic and epizootic in Saudi
Arabia in 2000 in animals.
Infection is more common than severe disease, it is often mild or
sub-clinical. Most, if not all, infected pregnant sheep, goats,
cattle (and most likely domesticated Asian buffaloes) and camels
abort affected fetuses at any stage of gestation, usually undergoing
autolysis.
Antibodies to RVF virus have been detected in camels and RVF virus
has been isolated from them during epidemics. Deaths and abortions
almost certainly occur but the disease has been little studied in
this species.

[Pictures of affected camels have been published by the Saudi daily
Al Watan on 15 and 16 Aug 2007, respectively, available at:
<http://www.alwatan.com.sa/news/newsdetail.asp?issueno=2511&id=18024>
<http://www.alwatan.com.sa/news/newsdetail.asp?issueno=2512&id=18087>.
The possible involvement of RVF as a main etiological factor seems
remote, in the absence of disease in the much more susceptible
species: sheep, goats and cattle. In addition, the extremely severe
losses in the Saudi camels do not match earlier descriptions from
RVF-affected countries with camel populations.
However, possible involvement of infectious pathogens will be
definitely ruled out only when final results of the toxicological and
other laboratory examinations, reportedly carried out in Riad, become
available. - Mod.AS].
