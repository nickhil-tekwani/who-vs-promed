Ticks are spreading a blood disease among cattle in Adams County, raising alarm for farmers in the area. Anaplasmosis is deadly to about half the cows that contract the disease, and 5 farms in the southern Ohio county reported cases last year [2011].

"I had not heard of it, and I've had cattle all my life," said a farmer. "We lost 4, had 7 cases of it."

Caleb Grooms, owner of Chapparel Feeds in West Union, said the disease is primarily spread by ticks and flies. "It hasn't been here very long," Grooms said. "The 1st cases were confirmed in 2011 in Adams County, (and) we've already had some confirmed cases here in 2012."

The warm spring is raising concerns that insect populations will rise, and some areas are already reporting an explosion in the tick population. The disease can be transmitted to humans, bringing flu-like symptoms, but it is rarely fatal.

The _Anaplasma_ genus has recently been expanded to include species transferred from the genus _Ehrlichia_, now named _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (compiled from species previously known as _Ehrlichia phagocytophila_, _E. equi_, and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent), _A. bovis_ (previously _E. bovis_), and _A. platys_ (previously _E. platys_), all of which invade blood cells other than erythrocytes of their respective mammalian hosts. Bovine anaplasmosis is of economic significance in the cattle industry.

Clinical bovine anaplasmosis is usually caused by _A. marginale_. Cattle are also infected with _A. centrale_, which generally results in mild disease. _A. ovis_ may cause mild to severe disease in sheep, deer, and goats.

Anaplasmosis is not contagious. Numerous species of tick vectors (_Boophilus_, _Dermacentor_, _Rhipicephalus_, _Ixodes_, _Hyalomma_, and _Ornithodoros_) can transmit _Anaplasma_ spp. Not all of these are likely significant vectors in the field, and it has been shown that strains of _A. marginale_ also co-evolve with particular tick strains. _Boophilus_ spp are major vectors in Australia and Africa, and _Dermacentor_ spp have been incriminated as the main vectors in the USA.

After feeding on an infected animal, intrastadial or trans-stadial transmission may occur. Transovarial transmission may also occur, although this is rare, even in the single-host _Boophilus_ spp. A replicative cycle occurs in the infected tick. Mechanical transmission via biting dipterans occurs in some regions. Transplacental transmission has been reported and is usually associated with acute infection of the dam in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of gestation. Anaplasmosis may also be spread through the use of contaminated needles or dehorning or other surgical instruments.

Affected animals have decreased appetite, milk yield, and stamina. They have thin watery blood which may not transport oxygen efficiently and lead to difficulty breathing as the animal is not being properly oxygenated.

Diagnosis may be made on a Giemsa-stained blood smear.

There is a strong correlation between age of cattle and severity of disease. Calves are much more resistant to disease (although not infection) than older cattle. This resistance is not due to colostral antibody from immune dams. In endemic areas where cattle 1st become infected with _A. marginale_ early in life, losses due to anaplasmosis are minimal. After recovery from the acute phase of infection, cattle remain chronically infected carriers but are generally immune to further clinical disease.

However, these chronically infected cattle may relapse to anaplasmosis when immunosuppressed (such as by corticosteroids), when infected with other pathogens, or after splenectomy. Carriers serve as a reservoir for further transmission, however with treatment this is overcome. Serious losses occur when mature cattle with no previous exposure are moved into endemic areas or when under endemically unstable situations when transmission rates are insufficient to ensure all cattle are infected before reaching the more susceptible adult age.

Tetracycline antibiotics and imidocarb are currently used for treatment. Cattle may be sterilized by treatment with these drugs and remain immune to severe anaplasmosis subsequently for at least 8 months.

Prompt administration of tetracycline drugs (tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, rolitetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) in the early stages of acute disease (such as PCV [packed cell volume] greater than 15 percent) usually ensures survival. A commonly used treatment consists of a single IM injection of long-acting oxytetracycline at a dosage of 20 mg/kg. Blood transfusion to partially restore the PCV greatly improves the survival rate of more severely affected cattle. The carrier state may be eliminated by administration of a long-acting oxytetracycline preparation (20 mg/kg, IM, at least 2 injections with a 1-week interval). Withholding periods for tetracyclines apply in most countries. Injection into the neck muscle rather than the rump is preferred.

Imidocarb is also highly efficacious against _A. marginale_ as a single injection (as the dihydrochloride salt at 1.5 mg/kg, SC, or as imidocarb dipropionate at 3.0 mg/kg). Elimination of the carrier state requires the use of higher repeated doses of imidocarb (such as 5 mg/kg, IM or SC, 2 injections of the dihydrochloride salt 2 weeks apart). Imidocarb is a suspected carcinogen with long withholding periods and is not approved for use in the USA or Europe.
