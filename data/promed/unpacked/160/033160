A ban on the veterinary use of a painkiller in South Asia appears to
be preventing vultures from being poisoned there, say researchers.

Many vultures have been killed by eating livestock carcasses that
were contaminated with the drug.

The crash in vulture populations was so severe that the 3 endemic
species are now threatened with extinction.

This study, published in the journal PLoS One, reveals the 1st signs
that the ban has reduced vulture poisonings.

The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan banned the use of
diclofenac for livestock in 2006. But by this time, the oriental
white-backed vulture population had crashed by 99.9 percent, and
populations of the long-billed vulture and slender-billed vulture had
fallen by about 97 percent.

The researchers set out to assess the effectiveness of the ban by
measuring the concentration of the drug in livestock carcasses.

They took samples from the livers of 5000 cattle carcasses. Some
samples were gathered one year before the ban, some immediately after
its implementation, and some between 2007 and 2008.

This revealed that the proportion of cattle carcasses in India
contaminated with the drug declined by approximately 40 percent
between 2006 and 2008.

In animal carcasses that were contaminated, the concentration of the
drug was significantly lower.

But, according to the RSPB, which helped fund the research,
diclofenac manufactured for human use is still being used in India to
treat cattle.

One of the authors of the research, Professor Rhys Green, a Cambridge
University conservation scientist, said: "The ban on veterinary
manufacture and sale of diclofenac appears to be having some effect,
but the job is only about half done. Diclofenac use must be virtually
eliminated, and not just halved, if vulture populations are to
recover."

The drug, an anti-inflammatory, is used to reduce pain and swelling
in injured and diseased cattle.

For religious reasons, it is not the practice in India to kill dying
cattle to relieve their suffering. So owners give the painkiller to
cattle and buffaloes when they are very close to death.

"Only then is there enough diclofenac left in the tissues of the dead
animal to kill vultures," said Professor Green. "An alternative legal
drug, meloxicam, also relieves pain effectively and is safe to
vultures. Its use is increasing, but it has not yet replaced
diclofenac."

Munir Virani, from the Peregrine Fund, an organisation that supported
research into the cause of South Asia's vulture decline, said the
results were "incredibly encouraging."

"But," he added, "we must be extremely cautious about jumping the gun
to say that vulture populations are on the road to recovery."

[Diclofenac (trade names Voltaren, Cataflam, Solaraze) is a
nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drug (NSAID), inhibiting prostaglandin
synthesis, widely used as a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory drug
in humans and animals.

Its toxicity for 3 Asian vulture species was definitively
demonstrated and published in March 2006; see Swan G, Naidoo V,
Cuthbert R, Green RE, Pain DJ, et al. (2006) Removing the threat of
diclofenac to critically endangered Asian vultures. PLoS Biol 4(3):
e66.
http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040066.

In May 2006, the Drug Controller General (India) withdrew all
licenses to manufacture diclofenac for veterinary use, and similar
action was taken in Nepal and Pakistan. This action was taken to halt
the unprecedented decline of 3 Gyps vulture species that were being
poisoned by diclofenac residues commonly present in carcasses of
domestic livestock upon which they scavenged.

The current information on the recovery of the vulture population is
encouraging. - Mod.AS]
