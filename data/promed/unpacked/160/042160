The Venezuelan minister for health, Eugenia Sader confirmed on
Wednesday [26 Jan 2011] that there are at least 21 cases of cholera in
the country, all of them related to a group that traveled from
Venezuela to the Dominican Republic in order to attend a family
celebration. The disease was acquired through consumption of food
contaminated with the causative bacterial agent.

The minister said that 12 Venezuelans are currently being treated in
the Dominican Republic. Additionally, 21 patients have been attended
until now by local physicians in various sectors of Caracas, 13 of
them at a private medical center in La Trinidad, 5 in La Castellana,
and 3 in San Bernardino.

At a press conference, held on Wednesday [26 Jan 2011] from her
office, Sader explained that this is a group of about 400 Venezuelans,
who on 22 Jan 2011 attended a family reunion in that Caribbean country.

Among the group, 19 cases of significant clinical illness have been
reported, all of whom received the appropriate treatment and are in
good condition at present, but it is likely that several others have
not yet shown symptoms of the disease but are carriers of it.

"We can remain calm. Venezuela has an excellent network of drinking
water and the only thing required is that we all take appropriate
preventive measures," she indicated.

Nevertheless, during a national TV broadcast, president Chavez said
that before the broadcast began, "I was not aware that they were so
many cases, I thought they were only 5, so I asked the health minister
(Sader) to explain the situation." Chavez said that the government had
knowledge of the existence of the cases since Tuesday [25 Jan 2011].
"We have set up an epidemiological barrier," he added.

Sader said that the Ministry of Health has activated the free
telephone line 0800-Vigilan, for all people present at that meeting in
the Dominican Republic (as well as their contacts) to report their
participation, in order to receive appropriate care.

She also urged the exposed individuals living in Caracas to go to the
various Centers of Integral Diagnosis (CDI in Spanish), located on the
east side of the capital, where prepared epidemiological teams are
located, and for those living in other regions of the country, to
visit the corresponding Regional Health Bureaus and notify them.

[The current outbreak illustrates nicely the importance of ProMED-mail
as a reliable, expeditious and efficient system of epidemiological
information worldwide.

The initial cases were seen at a private medical center by Dr Raul
Isturiz, a former ISID president who promptly notified the ProMED-ESP
moderator. A preliminary report was posted less than one hour later
with a description of the epidemiological situation and a clinical
summary of the most relevant findings of the 1st 5 patients. In
parallel, local health authorities were notified and appropriate
microbiology confirmatory samples taken. The same day, a local
Venezuelan physician became aware of a potential additional case in
Boston after a telephone medical consultation and notified the
ProMED-ESP moderator. The Boston individual was notified and advised
to seek medical attention. At the same time expert advice on the
handling of the situation was provided by Dr Eduardo Gotuzzo, also a
former ISID president and one of the foremost Latin American cholera
specialists. Within 24 hours, information was exchanged indicating
that _Vibrio cholerae_ had been isolated and identified from the stool
samples of several patients in Venezuela, and suspicious colonies were
recovered as well from the patient in Boston.

One day after the original ProMED-ESP report, the Venezuelan minister
of health, accompanied by Dr Isturiz and epidemiological authorities,
officially announced the occurrence of the outbreak, during a
Presidential TV and radio national broadcast. Of note, in the same
broadcast the Venezuelan president mentioned that until that moment,
he was aware of only 5 clinical cases, the exact number of cases
described by Dr Isturiz in the initial ProMED-ESP report, which
happened to be the single source of information acknowledging the
existence of the outbreak. On the other hand, inquiries for further
information were made to the ProMED-ESP moderator by several state and
municipal health coordinators, after reading the original posting.

As previously shown during the original SARS and Nipah virus
epidemics, the current cholera outbreak in Venezuela was first
revealed by ProMED-mail, before any official acknowledgement had been
made of the situation. By providing an early warning of these and
other outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging diseases, ProMED-mail has
proven instrumental in inducing public health precautions in a timely
manner, thus helping to prevent further epidemic transmission and to
save lives and avoid transient or permanent incapacity. - Mod.JT
