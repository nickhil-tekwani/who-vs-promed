[According to the report above, a total of 82 965 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4634 deaths, representing an increase of 5 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (18 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases include 5 new cases of confirmed infections -- 4 locally acquired cases (all in Jilin province) and 1 imported case (from Inner Mongolia).

In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1708 imported cases reported.

There were 16 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 15 cases were locally acquired and 1 was imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 368, and 26 of these are importations from abroad. I realize mentioning this on a daily basis is repetitious, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown.

- KCDC is requesting all persons who visited or used "Top Coin Singing Room" (Floor 2), "Jin PC Room" (Floor 11), or in-building elevators at the Vision Plaza building in Michuhol-gu, Incheon City on [6 May 2020] between 15:00 and 24:00 to contact a local public health center or dial 1339 and get tested for COVID-19.

- KCDC is requesting anyone who visited any of the nightlife entertainment venues in Itaewon area including any clubs or bars from [24 Apr 2020] to [6 May 2020] to stay home and refrain from going to other places, contact a local public health center or dial 1339 (KCDC call center), and visit a screening clinic and get tested, regardless of symptoms.

- KCDC also emphasized that persons who work in education, places of worship, indoor sports/gym facilities, or other places that are used by many people should especially report to public health center if they have been exposed to the above venues since their work environment creates a high risk of transmission.

- Even if the test result is negative, it is still possible for the person to have been infected but in the 14-day incubation period before the virus activates. Therefore, those who have been instructed to self-quarantine should strictly follow the self-quarantine protocol. Persons who are not subject to self-quarantine should still minimize contact with other people. They should carefully practice personal hygiene measures including mask wearing and hand washing and get retested immediately if symptoms appear later.

- In light of the upcoming reopening of schools ([20 May 2020]) for high school seniors (high school grade 3), KCDC provided guidance for COVID-19 prevention measures.
-- Systems of inter-institutional cooperation will be created to ensure timely sharing of information and response. Such measures include implementation of hotlines between schools and public health centers and preparing epidemiological investigation response teams at municipal offices of education and public health divisions of local municipal governments.
-- Students, teachers, and staff should check their symptoms in the morning and stay home if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms. They should keep facemasks on at all times while in school and strictly follow personal hygiene measures such as hand washing and cough etiquette.
-- Schools should ensure that every student's body temperature is checked before the student enters the classroom. If a student has a temperature of 37.5 deg C [99.5 deg F] or above or have other suspected symptoms, the school should have the student put on an MFDS [Ministry of Food and Drug Safety]-approved facemask such as KF80, KF94, or KF99 mask and wait in a separate location while the school contacts the student's parent or guardian.
-- If a confirmed case is found in a school, all students, teachers, and staff of the school will be instructed to put on an MFDS-approved facemask and return home. Local municipal government will conduct epidemiological investigation, disinfection, restriction of use of the affected facility, and other necessary infection control measures.
-- To prevent COVID-19 transmission in schools, KCDC has requested testing laboratories to process samples of high school students with highest priority and asked for timely notice of test results.

- In light of the recent rise in local transmissions related to clubs, bars, karaoke rooms, and after-school private academies, KCDC urged people to refrain from social gathering or visiting any enclosed/confined/crowded spaces that are frequented by many people.
-- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded space for an essential reason should carefully follow personal hygiene measures including keeping 2 meters of distance from other people, wearing a facemask, avoiding handshakes, washing hands, and not touching eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands.
-- Persons belonging to high-risk groups (including elderly, pregnant women, persons with chronic illness) should especially avoid any poorly ventilated enclosed space frequented by many people. If such a situation cannot be avoided for an essential reason, it is highly important to wear a facemask.

- Anyone who has come in close contact with a large number of unspecified persons in an enclosed/confined space such as clubs or bars need to be tested at a screening clinic through public health center or 1339 call center.
-- KCDC urged people to visit a screening clinic and get tested especially if 2 or more persons within a household or social group develop COVID-19 suspected symptoms.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 32 cases with 0 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (18 to 19 May 2020) when there were 13 newly confirmed cases and no deaths. A total of 11 110 confirmed cases and 263 deaths were reported today (18 May 2020), up from 11 078 cases and 263 deaths yesterday (18 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 47 consecutive days and below 50 for 40 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 12 days. In today's (19 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 24 of the cases were locally transmitted, and 8 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Incheon and Gyeonggi (8) cases each, Seoul (6), and Daegu and Jeonbuk (1) each. Imported cases were in Seoul (4) and 2 each in Gyeonggi and Quarantine.

According to the English language update, the Itaewon nightclub cluster is now up to 187 cases, 93 club attendees and 94 contacts (family, co-workers, friends) involving 11 provinces/cities in the country: Seoul City (97), Gyeonggi Province (37), Incheon City (33), Chungbuk Province (9), Busan City (4), Jeonbuk Province (2), Daejeon City (1), Chungnam Province (1), Gyeongnam Province (1), Gangwon Province (1), and Jeju Province (1).

One of the locally acquired cases reported yesterday (18 May 2020) is a healthcare worker in a Medical Center in Seoul, who on testing contacts, 3 were found to be positive.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be the main problem, but the Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of the next steps. All individuals with a history of club attendance or other crowded locations are now being encouraged to get tested, even if asymptomatic, recognizing the potential role of asymptomatically infected individuals in transmission of the virus.

Cases in Italy as of 6:00 pm 19 May 2020 CET
--------------------------------------------
Slight increase in new cases but the general trend remains downhill.
This is what can be seen from the health monitoring data on the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] released at 18:00 on [19 May 2020].
- 226 699 cumulative cases, increase of 813 from 17 May 2020
- 65 129 people are currently positive for the virus;
- 129 401 people have recovered;
- 9991 patients are hospitalized with symptoms, 716 in intensive care, and 54 422 are in home isolation;
- 32 169 deaths have been reported; however, this number can only be confirmed after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of death.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 226 699 cases, including 32 169 deaths, up from 225 886 cases and 32 007 deaths reported on 18 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 18 and 19 May 2020 was 813 newly confirmed cases, compared with 451 newly confirmed cases between 17 and 18 May 2020, an increase of 362 from yesterday's (18 May 2020) change -- this may well be a post-weekend reporting artifact. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 81.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 56.8% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy and Piedmont are the only provinces reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 13 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases (Molise was the only province reporting no new cases, but Marche removed 3 cases from their report - probably visitors from another location), and another 7 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Liguria is the only province reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 66 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 65 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 124 603 total cases, 7199 deaths
Date: Tue 19 May 2020 06.08 PM (IST)
Source: WION News [edited]
https://www.wionews.com/world/iran-reports-over-2000-coronavirus-cases-in-24-hours-as-fatalities-cross-7000-299693


Iran authorities said today [19 May 2020] that there were over 2000 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours with no deaths in 10 provinces. "10 provinces have reported zero deaths in the past 24 hours and 6 others only one," health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said.

Iran has 7199 fatalities due to COVID-19 with 124 603 virus cases. The health ministry said that over 97 170 patients hospitalized have recovered, however, several provinces including Kermanshah, north Khorasan, Baluchistan, Kerman are still under the close watch of authorities even as health officials said that the situation was largely stable in the country.

Health ministry official Kianoush Jahanpour had said last week that the "Khuzestan province is still in a critical situation" which is labeled "red" in coronavirus risk index in the country. Authorities in Khuzestan province reimposed the shutdown after relaxation last month as the cases spiraled.

Iran had reported its 1st COVID-19 casualty in February [2020] in the pilgrimage city of Qom. In a report last month [April 2020], Iranian officials had said that there is a "rising trend or the beginning of a peak" in 8 provinces, including Khuzestan.

Amid relaxation measures, President Rouhani announced that from [24 May 2020] restaurants will be allowed to reopen and pilgrims allowed to visit the outdoor areas of shrines but only for 6 hours during the day. Universities will also be allowed to hold final exams on [6 Jun 2020].

[In the 24 hours from 18 to 19 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 122 492 to 124 603 total cases, an increase of 2111 compared with 2294 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (18 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 7057 to 7199, an increase of 142 deaths in the 24-hour period. It's the 1st time the daily death reports have surpassed 100 since 13 Apr 2020 and marks an equal amount of time since the relaxation of the control measures. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Russia, Spain, Brazil, the UK, Italy, France, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 19 May 2020; 21:42 EDT (GMT-4).

As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature as daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 570 583, including 93 533 deaths, an increase from 1 550 294 cases and 91 981 deaths in the past 24 hours.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody-based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The cumulative antibody-confirmed cases is available just above Figure 3 and I am adding it to the PCR cases. There were 295 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with 285 in the preceding 24-hour period [from 16 to 17 May 2020], bringing the PCR- [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 232 037 [278 813] cases as compared with 231 606 [278 188] confirmed cases on 18 May 2020. Daily death reports are decreasing as well, with 27 778 deaths reported today (19 May 2020) and 27 709 deaths reported on 18 May 2020, an increase of 69 deaths in 24 hours.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 18.36, a continual slow decrease over the past 26 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 18.36 today (18 May 2020). Spain has the 2nd highest case count in Europe (Russia surpassed Spain overnight according to Worldometer at 18:49 EDT) and is 3rd globally behind the USA and Russia in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. According to Table 2, of the 232 037 [278 813] cases, an additional 166 cases have been hospitalized (PCR positive), and an additional 11 cases were admitted to ICU (PCR positive). Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
