The Maule Health SEREMI [Regional Health Ministerial Secretariat] confirmed the 1st death of the season cause by a hantavirus carried by the long-tailed mouse that appears mainly in summer.

This concerns a 33-year-old man who contracted the disease in the foothills of Teno. Also confirmed were another 2 people -- a 32-year-old man from Molina who was infected when on an excursion and another 36-year-old man resident of Retiro -- who presented with the disease and later were hospitalized after being sent from their homes.

"To date, we have 3 hantavirus cases in the Maule region, and we lament the death of one of these. The call is for prevention because the high temperatures in the summer period are conducive to the evaporation of the [contaminated materials] that [carry] the virus [contaminated by] the long-tailed mouse," said Marlenne Dur√°n, Maule Minister Health.

From the health SEREMI they pointed out the primary prevention measures to avoid the hantavirus are ventilation and disinfection of closed places in foothills that are visited during the holidays.

Juan Enrique Leiva, Subdirector of the Talca Regional Hospital, explained the hospital facility "has conditions to deal with hantavirus [infections], but in general the urgent case services are jammed. The problem is the capacity of the emergency system and the level of patients who are seen in the emergency room and the number of emergency hospitalizations for other causes," he explained.

[We thank Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur there every year. Andes virus can be transmitted directly person to person but only with very close physical proximity, usually within the family. However, unless specific laboratory tests are done, Seoul hantavirus cannot be ruled out.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
