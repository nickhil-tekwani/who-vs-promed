[With the addition of these 4 newly confirmed cases and one fatality, the tally of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now 1209 cases, including 514 deaths. Since 21 Jul 2015, there have been a total of 145 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Riyadh. From the sound of the media report below, it seems as though there is another hospital that has a nosocomial outbreak with significant transmission among hospital medical staff (see section [2] below). I remain dumbfounded trying to understand what is going on here.

The King Salman Hospital in Riyadh is teeming with coronavirus after reporting 9 cases of MERS-CoV infection, all in hospital staff.

According to sources, the virus began to spread inside the hospital last Sunday [30 Sep 2015] after an examination of a patient with MERS-CoV with sub-optimal infection control procedures, leading to the transfer of the virus to 2 of the doctors caring for this patient and 7 other staff members not working on this patient.

[The article discusses deficiencies in infection control procedures, including in the emergency room. It also mentions that 4 nurses with MERS-CoV infection were transferred to hospital housing where there were no negative pressure rooms, raising concerns regarding transmission in hospital housing. - Mod.MPP]

[Checking the reported data since last Sun 30 Aug 2015, there have been 9 healthcare workers with newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia. During this same period, the number of individuals on "home isolation" has increased from 9 on 30 Aug 2015 to 14 today (5 Sep 2015), all circumstantial evidence that this media report may have validity. Sigh, another nosocomial outbreak, this one involving mostly healthcare workers... - Mod.MPP]
