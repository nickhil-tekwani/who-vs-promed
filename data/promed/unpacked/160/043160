[Bulgaria has submitted to the OIE 2 immediate notifications pertaining to a total of 2 outbreaks of sheep pox during 2013, as follows:
1. Burgas oblast, adjacent to the Turkish border, 23 Sep 2013, stamping out applied; see with map at http://tinyurl.com/nca5tx5
2. Blagoevgrad oblast, adjacent to the Greek border, 7 Oct 2013, stamping out applied; see with map at http://tinyurl.com/o64fha8

According to the above recent ADNS report, there have been 4 "capripox" outbreaks in Bulgaria during 2013. One of them may have been the sheep pox outbreak in the village of Choba, about which media information became available on 10 Dec 2013 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131213.2115155). According to the press, stamping out was applied. Choba village is situated, according to mapping systems, in the Plovdiv oblast, distant from the previous 2 reported outbreaks and from the international borders. For the location of Choba in the region (oblast) of Plovdiv, see map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BU/51/Choba.html.

The 4th outbreak, reported by ADNS, is probably a secondary outbreak in Blagoevgrad oblast ("Kochan 2"), as reported in slide 2 of Bulgaria's presentation to SCFCAH, 7-8 Nov 2013; see at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/20131107-8_sheep_goat_bulgaria_en.pdf.

Greece's sheep pox information by ADNS is similar to OIE's data, namely 62 outbreaks in the north, most of them adjacent to the Turkish border.

In Turkey, both sheep pox and goat pox are regarded endemic; preventive vaccination is applied while no stamping out is applied. No immediate notifications on sheep pox and goat pox are required by the OIE from Turkey. - Mod.AS]
