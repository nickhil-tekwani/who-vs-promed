A 59-year-old woman in Western Kazakhstan has been diagnosed with
anthrax, the country's Emergencies Ministry said on Wednesday [24 Jun 2009].

Eight people have been hospitalized on suspicion of carrying the
disease in recent days, adding to 6 others hospitalized earlier this
month [June 2009].

A report from the ministry said that 185 people who had come into
contact with the infected patients are currently being monitored.

Anthrax affects both wild mammals and domestic cattle that ingest or
inhale the bacterial spores while grazing. Humans can contract the
disease if they are exposed to the blood or tissue of infected
animals. It can be highly lethal, but in some forms responds well to
antibiotic treatment.

[The last official report of anthrax in Kazakhstan was for a single
outbreak in July 2008 in East Kazakhstan:
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7282>.
ProMED records are richer with Kazakh information.

This seems to be part of the Kazakh here-and-there pattern of
outbreaks. The comment "...adding to 6 others hospitalized earlier
this month" would indicate that this has been an ongoing problem
wherever it is in "Western" Kazakhstan and is not being resolved quickly.
