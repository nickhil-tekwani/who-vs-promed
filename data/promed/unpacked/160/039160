The number of people who were diagnosed with scabies in the province of Mecca rose to 1038.

The Directorate of Health Affairs in Mecca said that 394 cases were found at schools. The medical teams have reported 25 other cases over the past 24 hours.

The increasing cases of scabies led the authorities to shut 33 schools for boys and girls in Mecca.

Closed schools are expected to reopen on [Sun 8 Apr 2018] but students diagnosed with scabies will stay at home for up to 2 weeks.

Education Minister Dr. Ahmed Al-Essa toured 3 government schools in Mecca and followed up efforts to deal with the situation.

[Scabies is caused by a mite _Sarcoptes scabiei_ living in the outer layer of the skin. The scabies mites are not vectors of any diseases. Different sarcoptes mites are found on mammals like dogs, cats and rodents, but the common conception is that there is very little cross infection between mammals i.e. the mites from cats at most gives a very transient infection in humans, which is self-limiting.
Infection from one person to another is by close physical contact and poor hygiene especially no access to regular showers and clean clothes is a key factor for the spread in institutions.

Outbreaks reported by ProMED are listed below and hospital acquired infections and outbreaks in nursing homes, prisons and refugees living in camps under poor hygienic conditions illustrate that personal hygiene is the key to prevention. The outbreak described here seems to be focused in the schools of Mecca. Never the less, the concern is spread to the pilgrims performing Umrah in Mecca. - Mod.EP
