A total of 4 people have been killed by anthrax in Sapelga in the Bawku West District [Upper East region of Ghana]. 30 cattle have also been killed by the disease.

The outbreak was recently confirmed by the Pong-Tamale Veterinary College which tested samples of cattle carcasses.

The District Security Council has issued an edict restricting the movement of cattle and other animals to and from the District.

Anthrax recurrently breaks out in the Northern part of the country virtually every year. XYZ News learnt the outbreak has lingered in the region since January 2013 but went undetected until 2 days ago when lab tests confirmed the outbreak.

[Since this was first tentatively reported there have been human cases involved, probably not unexpected considering the high number of cattle affected. - Mod.MHJ
