Abstract
Zikavirus (ZIKV) is an emerging viral pathogen that continues to spread throughout different regions of the world. Herein we report a case that provides further evidence that ZIKV transmission can occur through breastfeeding by providing a detailed clinical, genomic, and virological case-based description.

Luisa Barzon Elena Percivalle Monia Pacenti Francesca Rovida Maurizio Zavattoni, et al. Virus and Antibody Dynamics in Travelers With Acute Zika Virus Infection

Abstract

Background
To improve our understanding of the natural history of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in humans, we described the dynamics of ZIKV RNA shedding in different body fluids and antibody responses in patients with acute infection.

Methods
[A group of] 29 adults with travel-associated infection and one case of sexual transmission were enrolled and followed up with weekly ZIKV RNA testing in blood, urine, saliva, and semen samples and antibody testing.

Results
ZIKV RNA was detected in plasma, urine, and saliva of 57 percent, 93.1 percent, and 69.2 percent of participants, with estimated median times to clearance of 11.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-24 days), 24 days (IQR, 17-34), and 14 days (IQR, 8-31), respectively. In 2 pregnant women, ZIKV RNA persisted in blood until delivery of apparently healthy infants. ZIKV RNA was detected in semen of 5 of 10 tested men; median time to clearance was 25 days (IQR 14-29), and the longest time of shedding in semen was 370 days. In flavivirus-naive patients, the median times to detection of ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were estimated as 8 days (IQR, 5-15 days) and 17 days (IQR, 12-26 days), respectively. ZIKV NS1 IgM antibodies were undetectable in patients with previous dengue.

Conclusions
Prolonged viremia and ZIKV RNA shedding in urine, saliva, and semen occur frequently in patients with acute ZIKV infection. At the time of diagnosis, about half of patients are ZIKV IgM negative. ZIKV NS1 IgM antibodies remain undetectable in patients with previous dengue. Estimates of the times to viral clearance and seroconversion are useful to optimize diagnostic algorithms.

[These results are similar to previous observations except for Zika virus RNA persistence in semen for 370 days, much longer than the previous observation of 188 days. If viable virus is shed this long, it raises questions about the length of time that sexual transmission can occur. However, it is interesting that RNA persistence in semen was variable in 5 men, ranging from a median of 25 days to as long as 370 days. The persistence of infectious virus is not stated. Also of interest is the persistence of virus in blood of 2 women during pregnancy until delivery of apparently normal infants. - Mod.TY]

Matheus S, de Laval F, Moua D, N'Guyen C, Martinez E, Rousset D, et al. Zika Virus Persistence and Higher Viral Loads in Cutaneous Capillaries Than in Venous Blood.

Abstract
We collected venous and capillary serum samples from 21 Zika virus-infected patients on multiple days after symptom onset and found RNA load was higher and median duration of virus detection significantly longer in capillary than in venous blood. These findings raise questions about the role of the capillary compartment in virus transmission dynamics.

[Discussion]
These data raise questions about the consequences of longer persistence and higher loads of Zika virus RNA in the cutaneous capillary blood compartment, although we did not test Zika virus replication capacity. The higher load and longer detection of Zika virus RNA in this compartment might be attributable to Zika virus replication in permissive cells of the skin (e.g., human dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes); capillaries; or both. If the Zika virus RNA observed in the serum samples taken from the capillary compartment reflects the presence of infectious virus particles, symptomatic Zika virus-infected patients would need to be shielded from mosquitoes for a longer period than is currently practiced to limit potential vector-borne transmission.

[5] Type 1 IFNAR placental and fetal infection

Laura J. Yockey, Kellie A. Jurado, Nitin Arora, Alon Millet, Tasfia Rakib, Kristin M. Milano, et al. Type I interferons instigate fetal demise after Zika virus infection.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse fetal outcomes, including microcephaly, growth restriction, and fetal demise. Type I interferons (IFNs) are essential for host resistance against ZIKV, and IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection. Severe fetal growth restriction with placental damage and fetal resorption is observed after ZIKV infection of type I IFN receptor knockout (Ifnar1-/-) dams mated with wild-type sires, resulting in fetuses with functional type I IFN signaling. The role of type I IFNs in limiting or mediating ZIKV disease within this congenital infection model remains unknown. In this study, we challenged Ifnar1-/- dams mated with Ifnar1+/- sires with ZIKV. This breeding scheme enabled us to examine pregnant dams that carry a mixture of fetuses that express (Ifnar1+/-) or do not express IFNAR (Ifnar1-/-) within the same uterus. Virus replicated to a higher titer in the placenta of Ifnar1-/- than within the Ifnar1+/- concepti. Yet, rather unexpectedly, we found that only Ifnar1+/- fetuses were resorbed after ZIKV infection during early pregnancy, whereas their Ifnar1-/- littermates continue to develop. Analyses of the fetus and placenta revealed that, after ZIKV infection, IFNAR signaling in the conceptus inhibits development of the placental labyrinth, resulting in abnormal architecture of the maternal-fetal barrier. Exposure of midgestation human chorionic villous explants to type I IFN, but not type III IFNs, altered placental morphology and induced cytoskeletal rearrangements within the villous core. Our results implicate type I IFNs as a possible mediator of pregnancy complications, including spontaneous abortions and growth restriction, in the context of congenital viral infections.

Elisabeth R Krow-Lucal, PhD, Marcia Regina de Andrade, RN, Juliana Nunes Abath Canana, BS, Cynthia A Moore, MD, Priscila Leal Leite, MS, Brad J Biggerstaff, PhD, et al. Association and birth prevalence of microcephaly attributable to Zika virus infection among infants in Paraiba, Brazil, in 2015-16: a case-control study.

Summary
Background
In 2015, the number of infants born with microcephaly increased in Paraiba, Brazil, after a suspected Zika virus outbreak. We did a retrospective case-control investigation to assess the association of microcephaly and Zika virus.

Methods
We enrolled cases reported to the national database for microcephaly and born between 1 Aug 2015, and 1 Feb 2016, on the basis of their birth head circumference and total body length. We identified controls from the national birth registry and matched them to cases by location, aiming to enroll a minimum of 2 controls per case. Mothers of both cases and controls were asked about demographics, exposures, and illnesses and infants were measured at a follow-up visit 1-7 months after birth. We took blood samples from mothers and infants and classified those containing Zika virus IgM and neutralising antibodies as evidence of recent infection. We calculated prevalence of microcephaly and odds ratios (ORs) using a conditional logistic regression model with maximum penalised conditional likelihood, and combined these ORs with exposure probability estimates to determine the attributable risk.

Findings
We enrolled 164 of 706 infants with complete information reported with microcephaly at birth, of whom we classified 91 (55 percent) as having microcephaly on the basis of their birth measurements, 36 (22 percent) as small, 21 (13 percent) as disproportionate, and 16 (10 percent) as not having microcephaly. 43 (26 percent) of the 164 infants had microcephaly at follow-up for an estimated prevalence of 5.9 per 1000 live births. We enrolled 114 control infants matched to the 43 infants classified as having microcephaly at follow-up. Infants with microcephaly at follow-up were more likely than control infants to be younger (OR 0.5, 95 percent CI 0.4-0.7), have recent Zika virus infection (21.9, 7.0-109.3), or a mother with Zika-like symptoms in the 1st trimester (6.2, 2.8-15.4). Once Zika virus infection and infant age were controlled for, we found no significant association between microcephaly and maternal demographics, medications, toxins, or other infections. Based on the presence of Zika virus antibodies in infants, we concluded that 35-87 percent of microcephaly occurring during the time of our investigation in northeast Brazil was attributable to Zika virus. We estimate 2-5 infants per 1000 live births in Paraiba had microcephaly attributable to Zika virus.

Interpretation
Time of exposure to Zika virus and evidence of infection in the infants were the only risk factors associated with microcephaly. This investigation has improved understanding of the outbreak of microcephaly in northeast Brazil and highlights the need to obtain multiple measurements after birth to establish if an infant has microcephaly and the need for further research to optimise testing criteria for congenital Zika virus infection.

Luciana Pinato, Erlane M Ribeiro, Rebeka F P Leite, Thayse F Lopes, Andra L S Pessoa, et al. Sleep findings in Brazilian children with congenital Zika syndrome.

Abstract
Study Objectives
Zika virus infection during pregnancy may result in congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), whose characteristics are being described.

Methods
The present study aimed to investigate the sleep characteristics of 136 infants/toddlers (88 with CZS and 48 with typical development (TD), age and gender matched, 60 percent girls and 40 percent boys in both groups) using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. The ages of children in both groups ranged from 5 to 24 months (CZS 15.9 +/- 0.4 vs. TD 15.8 +/- 1.0 months, P equal to 0.90).

Results
The results show that 34.1 percent of CZS and 2 percent of TD children were defined as poor sleepers, 15 percent of CZS and 2 percent of TD children remained awake at night for a period longer than 1 hour, and 24 percent of CZS and 2 percent of TD children slept less than 9 hours. The CZS group showed shorter total sleep time (CZS 11.24 +/- 2.6 vs. TD 12.02 +/- 1.9 hours, P equal to 0.03) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration than the TD group (CZS 8.2 +/- 0.2 vs. TD 9.4 +/- 0.2 hours, P equal to 0.0002). In contrast to the control group (P equal to 0.02, r equal to -0.34), in the CZS group, no correlation was found between age and nocturnal wakefulness. Future studies should explore these data in relation to the development and maturation of the central nervous system of these children.

Conclusions
Considering the well-known consequences of poor sleep quality on health in several populations, the presence of sleep disorders should be considered in CZS using multidisciplinary treatments.
