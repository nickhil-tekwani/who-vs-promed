Cluster of wound botulism cases in injecting drug users in England - update
---------------------------------
Six suspected cases of wound botulism have been reported in England,
following the public health alert issued on 30 October 2002 (1,2). All 6
cases are known to be injecting drug users. To date, 16 suspected cases of
wound botulism have been reported in 2002 in the United Kingdom. Nine of
these cases have been laboratory confirmed. _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin
type A was detected in 7 cases, and toxin type B in 2 cases. Tests are
continuing on 2 patients; 2 cases previously reported as suspected cases of
wound botulism are now thought to be more compatible with other clinical
diagnoses.
All of these cases in 2002 have been reported from England, apart from one
case reported from Scotland in February 2002. The most recent cases may be
caused by a batch of drugs contaminated with the anaerobic bacterium _C.
botulinum_. The original alert in England and Wales asked consultants in
communicable disease control to inform local clinical services, drug
services, and coroners of this cluster. Detailed advice is available at
<http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/injectingdrugusers/menu.htm>.
Investigators (see email addresses below) at the Public Health Laboratory
Service (PHLS) in England and Wales would be interested to hear of any
recent cases of botulism in injecting drug users in other European countries.

[This report mentions identification of type A toxin in 7 cases and type B
toxin in 2 cases suggesting that more than one batch of drugs is involved
in this outbreak. More information on the epidemiology of this outbreak
would be appreciated, as well as information from other countries as to
whether a similar occurrence is being observed. - Mod.MPP]
