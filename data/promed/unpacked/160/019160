Comments on some of the issues raised by C.H. Calisher in West Nile virus
surveillance - USA: Questions (03)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot presume to challenge or answer Dr. Calisher's questions but here
are some additional comments/questions along the same lines.
[1 While it is true [that we should not be assuming to have all the
answers in regard to vectors, or even amplifying hosts, there is sufficient
evidence to [deduce that the bird-mosquito-mammal cycle is operating and
it remains the most likely in terms of human exposure (far more mosquito
bites than ticks). The fact the infection appears to have so far remained
relatively well contained geographically rather than spreading along the
paths of migratory birds does suggest [that the crow and related birds are
playing a key role. These birds show a strong preference for roosting in
close proximity to major waterways, rarely travel more than 200 miles and
are know for the behavior termed "vagrancy", where individuals will roam
within [the 200 mile radius [from established roosting grounds to take up
either temporary or permanent residence in other areas of suitable habitat.
The spread of West Nile virus (WNV) to date follows this pattern.
[2 I agree that it appears testing results are being very carefully
released at strategic times in such a way as to allay panic. The trend over
the last two weeks is to drop the bomb on a Friday or Saturday. Web sites,
from local counties to the National Atlas' maps, are always outdated. I
would like to know why sporadic spraying efforts should give anyone a sense
of security. Spraying kills only adults. Mosquito eggs take about 7 days to
hatch, with adult numbers being restored rapidly after each spraying.
(Pyrethrin derivatives have a very short duration of effect, which accounts
for their relatively low environmental toxicity). Equally alarming is the
undeniable evidence that targeting larvae is not effective either. [It is
tempting to think that inexperience in their use may have something to do
with this but even Southern States like Louisiana, which has much more
experience with attempting to control mosquito numbers, [have repeated
problems with mosquito-borne viral encephalitis (witness the current
Eastern equine encephalitis virus problems there, as in years past).
[3I agree [that it is not always/usually clear what test results are
being used to "confirm" WNV infection. I can only assume that if a single
CSF IgM is being used it must be based on presumption. There is no other
way to explain it because a) IgM is an acute phase reactant, and b) WNV is
a new disease to the Western Hemisphere. A corollary to this might be that
it is not reasonable to assume [that the presence of IgM is an amnestic
response in a person who was exposed last year as they should have become
ill on the initial exposure. We have to be careful though of being too
critical of attempts to nail the diagnosis when dealing with naturally
occurring cases. The patient often does not cooperate by staying alive long
enough for serial titers, or the risk of the procedure for collecting
needed samples outweighs the pull of intellectual curiosity.
Finally I agree [that the window of opportunity (if indeed it ever
existed) for eradicating this virus has closed. I also fear [that the
burning epidemiological questions which we all have about the behavior of
this virus in the New World may soon pale beside a pressing need to find an
effective vaccine. We obviously are not doing a very good job of
controlling the vectors and cannot eliminate the entire avian and arthropod
populations.
