State and federal officials said Tuesday [26 Apr 2011] they have
detected bovine tuberculosis in a dairy cow from a San Bernardino
County herd during a routine examination at a slaughterhouse.

A suspicious mass on the cow tested positive for the disease on 25
Mar 2011, and 3 other animals in the same herd were later identified
as also being infected, said Steve Lyle, a spokesman with the
California Department of Food and Agriculture. Lyle declined to
release the name of the dairy.

The discovery does not pose a risk to humans because almost all milk
sold in California is pasteurized, which kills the tuberculosis
[bacteria], said Larry Hawkins, a Sacramento-based spokesman for the
US Department of Agriculture [USDA].

Cows at the state's 2 raw-milk dairies are regularly tested for the
disease, according to a joint statement by the state and USDA.

Other animals in the herd that are found to be infected are
slaughtered and all the animals they came into contact with are also
tested, Hawkins said. "You follow that same regime until you have
eliminated all of the potential exposures from one animal to another
and until you have removed all the animals that have the disease," he
said. "It's a cause for concern to the herd owner because of the
negative impact financially, but in terms of disease it is not a
concern."

All cattle designated for consumption are inspected for signs of
tuberculosis at the slaughterhouse and are rejected if they show signs
of it.

The last known case of bovine tuberculosis in California was in
2009.

[The officials will be busy tracing all the animals going into the
dairy (trace-ins) as well as all the animals leaving it (trace-outs).

Tuberculosis is a disease that can simmer for a long time before it
reaches a stage that can cause a positive test. It grows slowly, but
can spread easily.

Bovine tuberculosis results from infection by _Mycobacterium bovis_,
a Gram positive, acid-fast bacterium in the _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ complex of the family Mycobacteriaceae.

The signs of bovine tuberculosis usually take months to develop in
cattle. Infections can also remain dormant for years and reactivate
during periods of stress or in old age. Similarly, severe disease can
develop in some deer within a few months of infection, while other
deer do not become symptomatic for years. In kittens experimentally
infected by the parenteral route, the incubation period is
approximately 3 weeks; it is probably longer under natural conditions.


_M. bovis_ can infect humans, primarily by the ingestion of
unpasteurized dairy products but also in aerosols and through breaks
in the skin. Raw or undercooked meat can also be a source of the
organism. Person-to-person transmission is rare in immunocompetent
individuals, but _M. bovis_ has occasionally been transmitted within
small clusters of people, particularly alcoholics or HIV-infected
individuals. Rarely, humans have infected cattle via aerosols or in
urine.

Bovine tuberculosis can be difficult to diagnose based only on the
clinical signs. In developed countries, few infections become
symptomatic; most are diagnosed by routine testing or found at the
slaughterhouse. In cervids, tuberculosis should be considered in the
differential diagnosis when abscesses of unknown etiology are found.

The differential diagnosis includes contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia, _Pasteurella_ or _Corynebacterium pyogenes_
pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia (which is often secondary to chronic
wasting disease in cervids), traumatic pericarditis, caseous
lymphadenitis or melioidosis in small ruminants, and chronic aberrant
liver fluke infestation.
