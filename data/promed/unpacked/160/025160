State officials confirmed the presence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in
another northeast Michigan cattle herd.

Members of the Michigan Agriculture Commission were told of the
confirmation Thursday by Dr. Joan Arnoldi, state Veterinarian and Animal
Industry Division Director. Arnoldi told the commission a cow from a small
beef herd in Oscoda County tested positive for the infectious disease.

Oscoda County was designated a high-risk area in July 2002. As a result,
routine annual testing and testing for movement off the farm led to the
discovery of TB in the herd.

Hundreds of beef and dairy cattle in 5 northeast counties have been
destroyed due to bovine TB outbreaks. The state said 77 animals from 29
herds have tested positive for the disease, which has severely restricted
state ranchers' ability to export cattle and products to other states.

TB has been detected in Alcona, Alpena, Emmet, Oscoda, and Presque Isle
counties since testing began in 1995.
