Hand, foot and mouth (HFM) disease, a contagious viral illness that targets mostly infants and children, has affected over 10 000 Vietnamese people in the first 2 months of this year [2013], the Vietnamese Ministry of Health's (MOH) Preventive Health Department warned on Tuesday [12 Mar 2013].

Nguyen Van Binh, head of the department, told local media that the disease has spread to 60 of the country's 64 provinces and cities and, in the past 2 weeks, increased numbers of patients have been reported in 28 provinces and cities. Specifically, in central Da Nang, Khanh Hoa and Quang Ngai, northern Yen Bai and Tuyen Quang, and southern Soc Trang provinces, the number of infected patients increased from 22 per cent to 700 per cent [not clear what this means. - Mod.SH]. So far this year [2013], on average 1000 new patients per week nationwide were infected by the disease, according to the department.

In Viet Nam, the commonest virus [detected] is human enterovirus 71 (HEV-71), which causes sores in the mouth and blisters on the hands and feet of patients. The toxicity of the virus is very high, as proven by the death of a 4 month old baby in southern An Giang province on 28 Feb 2013. The baby died just one day after contracting the virus, reported the department, adding that the same viral toxicity has been seen in Cambodia, where 54 children recently died within 24 hours of contracting the disease.

As many other countries and territories in the region have reported high numbers of new patients, including Japan, China's Macau, South Korea, Singapore, and Cambodia, the disease is forecast to continue spreading in Viet Nam, with an estimated number of 100 000 new patients this year [2013], said the health official. In Viet Nam, HFM disease normally hits its peak during the April to May and September to November periods.

The MOH instructed local authorities to publicise information on the disease -- that is, that the disease can be transmitted though the digestive tract; there are no vaccines or specific medicines to combat the disease; children under 5 years old are most vulnerable to the disease; and the main preventive measures are following hygienic practices in eating, drinking and living. The ministry plans to launch a national campaign to encourage hand-hygiene in April 2013 in addition to efforts to improve environmental hygiene at schools, especially at kindergartens and preschools.

In 2012, HFM disease claimed 151 100 infected cases, up 41.3 per cent year on year, of which 45 died, down 72.4 per cent, according to the Vietnamese General Statistics Office.

[Human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) has emerged as an important cause of viral encephalitis in South East Asia over the past 15 years. A pattern of increased epidemic activity and endemic circulation of HEV71 has been observed since 1997 and is associated with the regular emergence of new genetic lineages. Although the reason for this increase in HEV71 circulation remains unknown, evidence is accumulating that recombination events may drive the evolution of new genetic lineages. Prevention of HEV71 epidemics is likely to require the development of an effective vaccine. Several candidate vaccines are being evaluated, but none are available for clinical use at the present time. - Mod.CP
