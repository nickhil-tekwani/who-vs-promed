In the current concern over the pneumonic anthrax case diagnosed in
Minnesota, the following valuable paper on a lethal case of _Bacillus
cereus_ in a Texas welder may be of relevance:

Abstract
--------
Context: 10 years ago [2001] a bioterrorism event involving _Bacillus
anthracis_ spores captured the nation's interest, stimulated extensive
new research on this pathogen, and heightened concern about
illegitimate release of infectious agents. Sporadic reports have
described rare, fulminant, and sometimes fatal cases of pneumonia in
humans and nonhuman primates caused by strains of _Bacillus cereus_, a
species closely related to _B. anthracis_.

Objectives: To describe and investigate a case of rapidly progressive,
fatal, anthrax-like pneumonia and the overwhelming infection caused by
a _Bacillus_ species of uncertain provenance in a patient residing in
rural Texas.

Design: We characterized the genome of the causative strain within
days of its recovery from antemortem cultures using next-generation
sequencing and performed immunohistochemistry on tissues obtained at
autopsy with antibodies directed against virulence proteins of _B.
anthracis_ and _B. cereus_.

Results: We discovered that the infection was caused by a previously
unknown strain of _B. cereus_ that was closely related to, but
genetically distinct from, _B. anthracis._ The strain contains a
plasmid similar to pXO1, a genetic element encoding anthrax toxin and
other known virulence factors. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that
several homologs of _B. anthracis_ virulence proteins were made in
infected tissues, likely contributing to the patient's death.

Conclusions: Rapid genome sequence analysis permitted us to
genetically define this strain, rule out the likelihood of
bioterrorism, and contribute effectively to the institutional response
to this event. Our experience strongly reinforced the critical value
of deploying a well-integrated, anatomic, clinical, and genomic
strategy to respond rapidly to a potential emerging, infectious threat
to public health.

excess fluids from the lungs and thoracic cavity, whether we are
talking of this _B. cereus_ infection or infection by _B. anthracis_.
