[As of 14 Jul 2019, from 1 Jan - 14 Jul 2019, a total of 3043 suspected cases have been reported from 22 states. Of these, 622 were confirmed positive, 17 probable cases. The above report indicates that there are 78 new suspected cases and 6 new confirmed during week 34. A total case count since 1 Jan 2019 is not given. Cases remain fairly wide spread geographically, with cases reported from 16 LGAs in 13 states. The occurrence of new cases indicates that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing although Nigeria should be beyond the period of the year when more cases usually occur.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:

_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/

There is no mention in the plans above of public education for avoidance of contact with these rodents and their excreta. - Mod. TY
