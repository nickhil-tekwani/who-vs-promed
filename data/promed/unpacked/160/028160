Panic as anthrax kills 2
-------------------------
2 people have died following an anthrax outbreak in Maragua and Samburu
districts. A 73-year-old man died on Monday [2 Jan 2006] while undergoing
treatment at Murang'a District Hospital, while a 7-year-old boy died in
Samburu district. The man was among the 1st victims to test positive for
the anthrax virus following an outbreak in Ichagaki, Maragua.
There was panic in Itara, Gikomora, Irembu and Kiriti villages, where the
disease was 1st reported. 70 people have so far been treated after
screening started at Maragua District Hospital and Itara primary school
last Thursday [29 Dec 2005]. Medics in the district have also intensified
campaigns to sensitize locals against buying un-inspected meat.
The human infections were reported last week [final week December 2005],
after area residents ate meat from weak cows, which later turned out to
have been infected with anthrax. Last week, the District Commissioner
ordered farmers in the affected villages to take their livestock for
vaccination against the disease.
In Samburu, an outbreak was reported in Wamba Division, where the
7-year-old boy died. Several wild and domestic animals are also said to
have died from the disease. The disease, which had been raging undetected,
now threatens the Grevy zebra, which is an endangered species, with only
2000 in the world. The animals have more stripes than other zebras and are
only found in Isiolo, Samburu, and parts of Marsabit.
District Veterinary Officer, Dr. Daniel Thuo, said the outbreak was
detected about a week ago [final week December 2005] by American scientists
researching in the area. The scientists discovered carcasses of 12 Grevy
zebras. "Samples taken to laboratories showed that the animals had died as
a result of anthrax. There have been sporadic deaths of both animals and
people in the area," he said.
Experts have launched measures to control spread of the disease. They fear
more livestock would have been infected if herdsmen had not moved their
cattle to higher lands in search of pasture.

Villagers jammed hospitals for tests after one of them died of anthrax.
Hundreds of villagers who had eaten the infected meat of at least 9 cows
that had died in Itara village over the past month rushed to hospitals in
fear on learning of the man's death over the weekend. The 74-year-old man
died over the weekend of complications related to anthrax. A woman of Itara
Village, Maragua District, survived after eating anthrax-infected beef that
left one person dead last week [final week December 2005]. More than 500
people who suspected they had been infected turned up for treatment at the
Maragua district hospital.
29 [people] tested positive for anthrax, a highly infectious disease of
animals, especially cattle and sheep. [The 1st report has 70 treated after
screening, so we are witnessing a significant outbreak. - Mod.MHJ]
2 were admitted to the hospital; one is under observation at Murang'a
District Hospital, while the other was transferred to Kenyatta National
Hospital, Nairobi for specialized treatment. The male victim at the
Murang'a hospital said that he ate the meat on 3 different occasions and
that he fell ill after slaughtering one of the animals.
Most of the victims had swollen legs, hands and boils all over their bodies.
Villagers said a local inspector checked meat from all of the 9 cows and
said it was safe. He is now being sought for questioning.
The Murang'a medical officers of health, Dr. Lyndon Marani and Dr. Ephantus
Maree, said medical and public health personnel had been mobilized to check
the disease. And in Nairobi, the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries
Development issued a statement saying emergency vaccination will be carried
out on livestock at Iremba, Gikomora and Ichagaki in Maragwa district. The
ministry is expected to address a press conference on the matter at Kilimo
House today [4 Jan 2006].

[Unfortunately, this is a severely under-reported ongoing enzootic problem
in Kenya, with minimal official notifications. This outbreak is but a
repeat of a serious outbreak in Murang'a, Nyeri, Thika and Wajir districts
in 2001, when contaminated meat was sold in the local markets. In Maragua
alone in November 2001, 441 villagers received treatment, with 10
hospitalized; 4 people had been affected in the previous March in Murang'a.
But officially, only 15 human cases had occurred. Following the March 2001
outbreak, when some 15 cattle died, 2000 doses of vaccine were sent to
Maragua and 2000 to Thika. This should have been sufficient to have
prevented the Maragua cases in November 2001 if properly deployed. The
situation is not helped by ongoing inadequate veterinary inspection and
butchers bringing un-inspected meat to markets, with or without forged
documents. In 2001, there was a major bureaucratic fuss when such meat was
sold in Nairobi. Wildlife cases are occasionally reported in various
species in the Nairobi National Park, Tsavo Park, and the Nakuru Game Park.
These have included buffalo, impala, elephants, zebras, and rhinoceros. In
general in East and Southern Africa, it is more usual to see anthrax in
browsing wildlife species than in grazing species. - Mod.MHJ]
