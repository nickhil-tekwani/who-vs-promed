From: Candida St. John <CSJMHealth@aol.com>

In an article about mining in the March issue of National Geographic
Magazine, I read about a flock of snow geese that died as the result of
landing on a lake contaminated with runoff from smelting operations. I
quote "Water filling Montana's mile wide Berkley Pit is so polluted that a
flock of migrating snow geese died within hours of landing on it's surface."
Could this have been the fate of the flock mentioned in the posting from
the 19th? Not necessarily from that same Pit but a similar contaminated
waterway?
