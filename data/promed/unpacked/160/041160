Cuba: Havana On Health Alert After 8 Children Die
-------------------------------------------------
Cuban health authorities urged Havana residents on Sunday [24 Jul 2005] to
take extra hygiene precautions as they investigate the deaths of 8 children
from an unknown cause.
A government communique said that there had been an increase in digestive
and respiratory illnesses reported over the last 2 weeks in the Cuban
capital coinciding with power, cooking gas and water problems, in part
caused by Hurricane Dennis, which passed a few miles east of Havana on 8
Jul 2005.
The statement said children were particularly susceptible, and in some
cases high fever and other complications developed. "In this context 8
deaths among minors have occurred which are being meticulously
investigated," the communique, broadcast during the government's nightly
television newscast, stated.
While children die at high rates in developing countries from various
diseases, such deaths are rare in Communist Cuba, which takes pride in a
relatively well-developed and free health care system.

Cuba: Heat May Be Factor in Children's Deaths in Havana
-------------------------------------------------------
Cuba's health officials called on Havana residents on Monday [25 Jul 2005]
to be especially careful with hygiene after 8 children died in recent weeks
of illnesses aggravated by tropical heat and humidity. A communique by the
Public Health Ministry published in the Communist Party daily Granma
appeared aimed at dispelling persistent rumors circulating in Havana in
recent days about child sicknesses and deaths supposedly caused by
epidemics and contaminated medicine. The ministry denied that anyone died
because of supposedly contaminated medicines. It said the deaths were
caused by severe respiratory and gastronomical ailments worsened by heat
and humidity as well as faulty water and electricity service after
Hurricane Dennis struck the island this month.
"The Public Health Ministry calls on the population to increase hygiene
measures and work the measures undertaken by [governmental] agencies," the
statement said.

[From the limited information we have, it is impossible to hazard a guest
as to the likely nature of the illness. It is not clear whether these
deaths are related or merely indicative of a general deterioration in the
health of the community in the capital following disruption of normal
healthcare services in the wake of Hurricane Dennis. More specific
information from Havana would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
