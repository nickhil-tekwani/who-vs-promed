Ecotourism could be harming wildlife
----------------------------
Ecotourism may be endangering wildlife by spreading human diseases to
animals, and is probably responsible for 3 outbreaks of tuberculosis (TB) in
mongooses and meerkats in Africa, according to a study. Scientists in
Botswana's Chobe national park have documented how the human pathogen was
passed on to mongooses in the popular park and followed an outbreak that
killed meerkats in the Kalahari Desert. [To see what a meerkat looks like,

box -- you´ll get nearly 300 photos. - Mod.JW]
Kathleen Alexander, Botswana's Senior Wildlife Veterinary Officer, and her
team believe the mongooses picked up the illness from contaminated rubbish
heaps in the park. They suspect the meerkats were infected from local people
because no animals in the region are known carriers of human TB. Ecotourism
is a major source of revenue for wildlife conservation in Africa but
Alexander thinks contact between the animals and humans should be minimized
to reduce the threat of infection.
The Aids pandemic, which has swept through Africa, may also be contributing
to the problem. People suffering from HIV/Aids and TB are more likely to
infect animals because they shed more of the bacteria. More than a third of
Botswana's population is afflicted with HIV. "We need to be addressing the
threat that humans pose to wildlife," Alexander told the magazine.

[It is difficult to balance the need for tourism to save the wildlife and
have the wildlife to attract the tourist. However, tourist should be more
diligent in not littering, and in refraining from feeding the wildlife.
Disease transmission to other species is a serious concern, one potentially
having devastating consequences on some groups of animals. - Mod.TG]
[Don´t blame the tourists -- they don´t travel if they are sick with TB. As
stated above, it´s the local people who are infecting the wildlife. How
about a program to treat the locals for HIV & TB & thereby protect the
wildlife? - Mod.JW]
