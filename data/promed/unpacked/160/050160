The Wildlife Rescue Association (WRA) is asking bird lovers to clean and disinfect their feeders and bird baths after admitting more than 50 pine siskins for treatment of salmonella since the beginning of January [2012]. Last year [2011], the WRA had treated only 2 birds with salmonella through the 1st part of the year.

The sick birds exhibit symptoms like fluffed-up feathers, difficulty flying, swollen eyelids, and lethargy. Most salmonella outbreaks in songbirds are caused by contaminated feeders.

Pine siskins, which travel in tight flocks, are particularly susceptible. They ingest contaminated food and water, or contract the infection by coming into contact with feces or other sick birds.

"By being vigilant and proactive, members of the public can help reduce the spread of infection and limit the risk to local pine siskin populations," says Crystal Simmons, the care centre liaison at the WRA.

To help that happen, the WRA recommends anyone who spots sick or dead birds around their feeders or bird bath should take them down for at least a week to encourage the birds to disperse and reduce the chances of infection spreading within a flock. Feeders should be cleaned at least once a week with a solution comprising 10 per cent bleach, then air-dried before being refilled. They should also be moved around regularly to prevent the build-up of feces.

Though the risk of salmonella infection spreading to humans is very small, people should always wash their hands after handling birds and feeders.

Sick birds should be placed in a small box with a towel or facecloth and brought to the WRA for treatment.

[It is important to know which strain of salmonella was the cause of the outbreak, as that determines zoonotic potential or risk to domestic animals. A common salmonella isolated from passerine birds is _Salmonella typhimurium_, which can cause diarrhea in humans and livestock. Being gregarious, siskins (_Carduelis_ sp.) are particularly susceptible to contagion.
