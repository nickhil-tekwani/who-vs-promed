Cabell County's number of confirmed hepatitis A cases rose by 21 percent this week to 114, up from 94 the previous week and nearly tripling from 44 cases 4 weeks ago, according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources [DHHR]. In Wayne County, 20 cases have been confirmed, up from 15 last week and 11 2 weeks ago.

As of [Fri 13 Jul 2018], 540 confirmed cases of hepatitis A have been reported in West Virginia, with 297 in Kanawha County alone, according to the DHHR. Putnam County has reported 60 cases. Men make up 57 percent of hepatitis A contractions in West Virginia, which has been diagnosed in residents aged 14-82. These statewide cases have since been definitively linked to the virus strain found nationwide in an ongoing, multi-state hepatitis A outbreak that also is affecting Kentucky and Indiana.

People at the highest risk for contracting and spreading the disease include those living without sanitary facilities, people who use drugs, and those who travel to areas of the world where the disease is common.

[Date / Cases / New cases per week
23 May 2018 / 106
29 Jun 2018 / 404 / 59
13 Jul 2018 / 540 / 68

These are weekly numbers similar to what is currently occurring in Kentucky. West Virginia at this rate will soon pass California and then threaten Michigan for 2nd on the HAV case number list. - Mod.LL

An outbreak of hepatitis A is spreading in northeast Arkansas, according to the Arkansas Department of Health. The contagious liver disease has now been detected in Independence, CO, south of the original outbreak zone, health officials say.

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease with symptoms including fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored feces, joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and eyes.

Since February 2018, 58 cases have been reported as part of the outbreak, according to the Health Department's website.

[Thirteen cases of HAV infection were reported in Arkansas as of [Tue 1 May 2018]. This report adds 45 more cases in about 9 weeks, a rate of about 5 new cases per week.

Addressing the marginalized cohorts of humanity affected the most, including the homeless and substance abusers, by supplying adequate sanitation and living conditions as was done in the San Diego [CA] area is needed to deal with these outbreaks occurring in a so-called developed country such as the USA. Spill-over into other portions of the population such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers will continue. It is not clear how many of this rapidly increasing total are in individuals outside the described cohorts. - Mod.LL
