A bird flu (H5N1) outbreak has affected 13 poultry farms and one turkey farm at Dhamdara in Phuentsholing. The outbreak was confirmed on 8 Apr 2019 through laboratory testing from the National Centre for Animal Health (NCAH), Serbithang, Thimphu.

No human contact was reported.

In response, a total of 1130 poultry birds in the affected areas were culled, about 4002 eggs disposed, 613 kg (1351 lb) of feed disposed, and 12 chicken coops destroyed.

The National Incident Command Committee (NICC) has activated the Incident Operation Centre (IOC) at Thromde Veterinary Hospital in Phuentsholing with the Rapid Response Team (RRT) from different ministries and agencies for immediate containment and response to the outbreak.

A press release from the ministry states, "As the disease is brought under control at the source of outbreak the public should not panic. The public is also advised to take precautions like washing of hands after handling poultry, chicken and eggs with soap and water."

Program director of NCAH, Dr. RB Gurung, the focal person of bird flu, said the outbreak was reported in the field on 6 Apr 2019. He said the outbreak is under control by about 80% yesterday [Fri 12 Apr 2019]. As the outbreak location was at the outskirt of town, there were not many vehicles on the road, which made it easier, he added.

The response team also created awareness in the community. Vehicles traveling out of the demarcated infected and restricted zones are also disinfected.

Dr. RB Gurung said poultry farmers are cautioned to comply with farm biosecurity measures and not allow visitors into the farms without proper safety measures. "We need to observe the outbreak area for one month," Dr. RB Gurung said.

The Department of Livestock, Chhukha Dzongkhag Livestock Sector, Department of Public Health, Royal Bhutan Police, Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority and the Regional Livestock Development Centre Tsimasham and local authorities in Phuentsholing have initiated the response to the H5N1 outbreak jointly.

[Phuntsholing, also spelled as Phuentsholing, is a border town in southeastern Bhutan and is the administrative seat of Chhukha District. The town occupies parts of both Phuentsholing Gewog and Sampheling Gewog; map at http://tinyurl.com/y672je4t.

It may be assumed that the event in Bhutan is related to wild bird migration; 2 of the 3 earlier outbreaks notified by Bhutan to the OIE took place in a similar season, namely, March (2018) and April (2015). Bhutan has already reported the event to the OIE; see 20190413.6418964. - Mod.AS
