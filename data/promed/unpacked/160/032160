An increased number of cases of subacute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis has killed several dogs in Norway (more than 20), and an even larger number of dogs have shown similar symptoms (more than 60). Case registrations and data collection are still ongoing.

The incident is assumed to have started around 18 Aug 2019, and although the majority of cases have been reported in Oslo and surrounding areas, dogs with similar symptoms have been reported across the whole country.

The Norwegian Veterinary Institute is working together with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (Norwegian Veterinary College), and several of the large veterinary clinics to gather information on epidemiology, clinical course, post mortem examinations, and laboratory analyses in order to better map the disease and to search for possible explanations.

Post-mortem examinations performed in 10 dogs were concurrent and revealed pathological signs of severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.

Bacteriological investigations have identified an increased number of _Clostridium perfringens_ in the gut of dead dogs, together with the gram-negative bacterium _Providencia alcalifaciens_. Tissue samples, stomach, and gut content from dead dogs and faeces from sick dogs are currently under investigation for the presence of virus, fungi, toxins and other possible causative agents. Other possible sources, like dog feed, treats and environmental contaminants are also under consideration.

In dogs with a fatal outcome, the clinical signs have been sudden, and the course of disease has been acute, with death occurring within 24 hours in many cases.

A typical case is described as follows: a healthy dog that suddenly becomes ill with signs of acute, severe hemorrhagic diarrhea, vomiting (often also bloody). The body temperature is normal, in some cases lowered, and there are no signs of leukopenia/neutropenia (common indication of a viral infection). CRP (C-reactive protein test) is in many cases increased. Snap tests for parvovirus are negative.

To our knowledge, there have been no reports of similar incidents in neighboring Scandinavian countries.

[We are grateful to Norway's CVO for the above first-hand information, presenting the most current data of the event and its investigation. Earlier reports were included in 20190910.6663867.

Future findings will be posted upon receipt. - Mod.AS

This canine disease is reminiscent of the human syndrome of clostridial necrotizing enteritis or pigbel. It has also been called "Darmbrand" or "bowel fire" when it was seen in post World War II Germany.

From the Merck Manual:
https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/anaerobic-bacteria/clostridial-necrotizing-enteritis

"Clostridial necrotizing enteritis is a mild to severe clostridial infection, which can be fatal if not treated promptly.

C. perfringens type C occasionally causes severe necrosis in the small bowel (primarily the jejunum). Disease is caused by clostridial beta-toxin, which is very sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and is inactivated by normal cooking. Necrosis is segmental, involving small or large patches with varying degrees of hemorrhage and intramural gas; necrosis ranges from mucosal injury to full-thickness necrosis and perforation.

Clostridial necrotizing enteritis occurs primarily in populations with multiple risk factors, including the following:

Protein deprivation (causing inadequate synthesis of protease enzymes)
Poor food hygiene
Episodic meat feasting
Staple diets containing trypsin inhibitors (eg, sweet potatoes)
Ascaris infestation (these parasites secrete a trypsin inhibitor)
These factors are typically present collectively only in the hinterlands of New Guinea and parts of Africa, Central and South America, and Asia. In New Guinea, the disease is known as pigbel and is usually spread through contaminated pork, other meats, and perhaps peanuts.

Severity varies from mild diarrhea to a fulminant course of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody stool, septic shock, and sometimes death within 24 h.

Diagnosis of clostridial necrotizing enteritis is based on clinical presentation plus toxin in stool."

We await further description of the canine disease. - Mod.LM
