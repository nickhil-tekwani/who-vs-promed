A case of the mosquito-borne illness LaCrosse encephalitis has been
reported in Montgomery County. The Mississippi State Department of
Health says the illness is similar to West Nile virus [infection].

People [especially pre-school age children - Mod.TY] with LaCrosse
encephalitis may have fever, headache, vomiting, lethargy and
sometimes seizures. The department said Monday [2 Aug 2010] this is
the 1st case of the illness reported in Mississippi since 2008.

[Cases of La Crosse virus encephalitis occur infrequently in
Mississippi, in contract to the upper Midwest of the USA where
infections are more common. The following comment was given in
ProMED-mail archive no. 20080717.2164:

La Crosse virus (LACV) is in the California serogroup of viruses in
the _Bunyaviridae_ family. Although most LACV infections [result in]
subclinical or mild febrile illnesses, frank encephalitis progressing
to seizures and coma can occur [but] the case fatality rate is less
than one per cent. In the USA, particularly in the upper midwestern
states, an average of 70 clinical cases are reported annually, the
vast majority in pre-adolescent children. Hospitalizations and
subsequent care can be lengthy with costs approaching USD 450 000.

The virus is transmitted by _Aedes triseriatus_ mosquitoes and
maintained by transovarial transmission with amplification in forest
rodents (chipmunks _Tamias striatus_ and squirrels _Sciurus
carolinensis_). More recently, the virus has been isolated from the
Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_, which has become
established in the Western Hemisphere. No vaccine against LACV is
available. A brief fact sheet for LACV and its pathogenesis and
epidemiology provided by the US CDC can be accessed at
