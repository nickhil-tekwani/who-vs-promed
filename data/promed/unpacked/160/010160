----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reports of concurrent malaria and relapsing fever must be viewed with caution. Malarial microgametes, particularly those of _Plasmodium vivax_, are released in blood specimens prior to staining, and bear a striking resemblance to _Borrelia_ spp. [1]

Following up on our previous conversation, I wanted to inform your that a non-standardized, as well as an 16S universal bacterial PCR remained negative.

I have to acknowledge the esteemed comment of our colleague [Steve Berger]. After extensive discussion with tropical medical specialists from our institution and externally, we have to acknowledge the possibility of a false positive.

[ProMED thanks Steve Berger for alerting us to a possible explanation for a false positive microscopy for _Borrelia recurrentis_. A photo of the exflagellating _P. vivax_ microgametocytes can be seen in the Am J Trop Med J paper cited above.

ProMED also thanks Timo Wolf for informing us about the outcome of the analysis and the conclusion that the microscopy reporting spirochaetes in the blood film most probably was false positive. - Mod.EP]
