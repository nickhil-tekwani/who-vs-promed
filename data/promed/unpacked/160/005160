Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Jordan
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Between [21 and 23 Sep 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of Jordan notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death.

Details of the cases
1 - A 29 year old male health care worker from Amman city developed symptoms on [15 Sep 2015]. After attending the emergency room of the hospital where he works, the patient was treated symptomatically and sent home. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [20 Sep 2015] and was admitted to hospital. Currently, he is in a stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient provided care to a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (see DON published on [18 Sep 2015] -- case no. 2). He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

2 - A 60 year old male from Amman city developed symptoms on [10 Sep 2015] and, on [15 Sep 2015], was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [20 Sep 2015]. Currently, he is in a stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient visited a hospital in which a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case had received care. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with the hospitalized MERS-CoV case or with the health care workers who took care of the case is ongoing. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

3 - A 69 year old female from Amman city was admitted to hospital on [7 Sep 2015] due to a cardiovascular condition. The patient, who had comorbidities, was discharged from hospital on [16 Sep 2015]. On [17 Sep 2015], she developed symptoms and, on the same day, was admitted to another hospital. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on [22 Sep 2015] and, on the same day, passed away. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with the MERS-CoV case in the 1st hospital or with shared health care workers is ongoing. The patient had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

4 - A 39 year old female health care worker from Amman city, who was identified through contact tracing, tested positive for MERS-CoV while asymptomatic on [23 Sep 2015]. Currently, she is still asymptomatic in home isolation. The patient, with no comorbidities, provided care to a laboratory-confirmed case (see DON published on [18 Sep 2015] -- case no. 2). She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1593 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 568 related deaths.

[The nosocomial outbreak in Amman continues, with a total of 15 cases of MERS-CoV infection including 5 deaths reported by the Jordanian MOH to WHO since 1 Sep 2015. There is an additional case related to this outbreak reported by Saudi Arabia (see case no. 2 in section [4] below). Including these cases in the global total of MERS-CoV infections reported to WHO from September 2012 through 1 Oct 2015 brings the total number of cases to 1593 including at least 568 deaths.

[Transmission of the MERS-CoV continues in Saudi Arabia with a mix of primary cases (defined as no history of exposure in the healthcare environment or to known MERS-CoV infected individuals outside of the healthcare environment) and secondary cases (those with a history of contact with other known cases or with the healthcare environment in the 14 days preceding onset of illness). A total of 66 newly confirmed cases were reported by Saudi Arabia during the month of September 2015, compared with 127 cases reported during the month of August 2015. While the number of cases during September was about half of that reported in August, 66 reported cases during the month is not an insignificant number.

Two of the 5 newly confirmed cases were in healthcare workers in Riyadh, confirming that nosocomial transmission is continuing.

[Case no. 2 in the above WHO update is a nosocomially acquired case from Amman, the patient having gone there for medical care -- a reminder that we live in a global village.

The WHO update provides more details on each of the reported cases, including dates of onset, and possible dates of exposure for those individuals with confirmed nosocomially acquired illness.

We are now in the post-hajj period, when the pilgrims are returning to their home countries. Most of the countries with large numbers of pilgrims going to Saudi Arabia are screening returning pilgrims at their ports of entry. We expect to hear of "suspected cases" in individuals returning with respiratory illnesses, and in some cases with febrile illnesses -- not uncommon symptoms in returning travellers. At what point will there be a collective sigh of relief? After one incubation period (14 days) with no confirmed cases? Or after 2 incubation periods (28 days) ... ? - Mod.MPP
