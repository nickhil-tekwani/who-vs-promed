Norway Royal Salmon (NRS) has elected to cull all its fish at its Elva salmon farming site in the Alta Municipality, Finnmark County, Norway, after it detected the presence of the disease Parvicapsulose. NRS confirmed the decision in a filing on the Oslo stock exchange on 14 Jul 2022, saying that the cull will take place for "welfare reasons." The site comprises a stock of 800 000 triploid fish with an average weight of 0.65 kg [1.4 lb].

"The incident will have an impact on the result of the 3rd quarter of 2022 and will reduce NRS's expected harvest volume for 2022 by around 2000 metric tons (MT) [2205 US ton] to 30 000 MT [33 069 US ton]," NRS said in its announcement. "NRS continues to analyze the consequences, and we will return with more information when the reporting for the 2nd quarter of 2022 [occurs]."

Fish disease parvicapsulose is caused by the parasite parvicapsula. The disease is associated with low-grade to significant mortalities.

NRS group owns 36 085 MT [tonnes; 39 777 US ton] maximum allowed biomass (MAB) for salmon farming located in Troms and Finnmark in Norway, and 21 800 MT [tonnes; 24 030 US ton] MAB for salmon farming and 5300 MT [5842 US ton] MAB for trout farming in Iceland through the company Arctic Fish. In addition, the group has minority interest in 2 associated Norwegian fish farming companies which together own 9 fish farming licenses. The group did not report on what the expected monetary impact of the cull will be.

[_Parvicapsula_ is a genus of myxozoan parasites. The phylum Myxozoa includes endoparasites of fish and invertebrates. For most of the time that they have been recognized, myxozoans have been classified as protists, but it is now clear that they represent highly degenerate metazoans.

The myxosporean parasite _Parvicapsula pseudobranchicola_ commonly infects farmed Atlantic salmon in northern Norway. The main site of the parasite in Atlantic salmon is the pseudobranchs. Heavy infections are associated with pseudobranch lesions, runting, and mortality. The life cycle of the parasite is poorly known. - Mod.PMB
