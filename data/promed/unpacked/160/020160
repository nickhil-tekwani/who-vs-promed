The central province of Lopburi is being designated a bird flu exemplar and
research area following the province's swift curbing of its avian influenza
outbreak, according to the interior minister, who praised the cooperation
shown among varied public agencies and local volunteer health workers.
During his visit to the province to observe the local authorities'
preventive and surveillance measures to contain the spead of avian flu, air
chief marshal Kongsak Wanthana said Lopburi examplifies the effective
control of the spread of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus.
While Lopburi is well-known as an army garrison and training centre, it is
also an industrial centre and commercial poultry production centre. During
his visit here ACM Kongsak inspected a local chicken farm.
Lopburi, located 150 km north of Bangkok, was hit by the bird flu outbreak
but it effectively curbed the outbreak in a relatively short time and was
able to systematically control the movement of poultry.
"There's good cooperation here from all directions," ACM Kongsak said, as
he praised the performance of provincial health volunteers. "People want to
maintain the standard of Lopburi's chicken farms to be a centre of chicken
exports," he said.
The minister said he would inspect problem areas and would hold a seminar
for information exchange. Provincial governors, he said, would be invited
to join the seminar to [learn about] more comprehensive measures to fight
the deadly disease along with study of Lopburi's work as a guideline.
The interior minister said cockfighting rings have not yet reopened in
Lopburi. Cockfighting isn't banned there, but local residents voluntarily
shut down their matches to help prevent the spread of bird flu.
As the main centre of the Royal Thai Army outside of Bangkok, the province
enjoys a high standard of education, awareness and public spirit in working
together for community well-being.

[Joe Dudley added the following just remark: "It is interesting to note
that the voluntary cessation of cockfighting by local communities is
highlighted in this government press release as a key and praiseworthy
factor in the successful control of H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in Lopburi
Province". - Mod.AS]

Leaders of 21 Pacific Rim nations, holding their annual summit in the South
Korean port city of Pusan, put discussion of ways to contain the disease
and prevent a human pandemic high on their agenda.
Australian prime minister John Howard told business leaders meeting
alongside the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit that he would
announce "a very significant initiative" on the disease on Saturday.
"Appropriate responses to the potential pandemic will be high on the
agenda" at the APEC summit, Howard said, emphasising "the importance of
putting aside any sense of national pride or self-consciousness about any
outbreak in individual countries. The last thing that any nation can afford
to do, not only in its own interests but in the interests of the fellow
members of the world community, is to hide or cover up in any way."
In London, the leading medical journal The Lancet called on governments to
communicate honestly and openly with the public. Governments "must admit to
uncertainty, act transparently, issue guidance on disease protection and
make sure information is disseminated to the public as quickly as possible"
to avoid panic even before a pandemic emerges, it said in an editorial.
In Vietnam, the Agriculture Ministry said bird flu outbreaks had hit Phu
Tho, Thai Binh and Hoa Binh provinces, and added that the number of dead
and slaughtered poultry in cities and infected areas since early October
2005 had reached nearly 900 000.
China's Agriculture Ministry said an epidemic of highly pathogenic bird flu
had been discovered in northern Shanxi province, a day after confirming its
1st human deaths from the H5N1 virus, but gave no further details.
North Korea, which announced in July 2005 that it had stamped out an
outbreak of bird flu after destroying 200 000 chickens, said it had now
worked out regulations, emergency action plans and prevention strategy in
case of a new outbreak.

For 2 months now, as the news in China about avian flu has become steadily
more alarming, Cao Jiancang has slept just fine at night, a few feet away
from about 200 of his youngest chickens. The chicken farmer moved the
chicks into his cozy brick shack to keep them safe from aggressive weasels
lurking on his mountainside farm on the rural outskirts of Beijing.
Local officials have visited him twice since then to help him inoculate all
3000 of his chickens against bird flu, but the weasels worry Cao more than
the flu. The Communist Party can manage the latter, he said, including the
seemingly overwhelming task of vaccinating all the poultry in the country,
as the government this week announced it would do. "I think that they
definitely can do it," Cao said. "I watched television yesterday and heard
the news that Premier Wen Jiabao is going to work hard on this. If we make
a local analogy, it's just like in old times: When the emperor says
something, it's for sure that it will get done."
China's announcement of its plan to inoculate an estimated 14 billion
birds, and its subsequent 1st confirmation of human cases of the H5N1 virus
strain, have again focused attention on the world's most populous country
and its history of incubating pandemics.
As was the case with SARS in 2003, avian flu is exposing the strengths and
weaknesses of one-party rule in battling an infectious disease. The key
difference is that this time, top officials here and abroad are well aware
of the virus' threat, and because of SARS, they are aware of the
potentially disastrous consequences of a human outbreak.
China's top leaders seem to be responding now, after some missteps, by
confronting the threat directly, cooperating more with international
agencies and, perhaps most significant, publicizing in the state media the
importance of confronting bird flu.
The government has recently shown its capacity for tough reactive measures
by imposing strict quarantines, ordering the killing of chickens in areas
with outbreaks and shutting down live poultry markets in Beijing.
This week, officials went significantly further with their promise to
vaccinate all poultry, as many as 14 billion birds, free of charge. That
plan, which was presented without a timetable, suggests how deeply the
ruling Communist Party fears the potential health and economic effects of
the virus.
The government also announced plans to increase production of the poultry
vaccine, punish makers of fake or bad vaccines and protect the poultry
industry financially.
Chinese scientists have also said they are prepared if necessary to produce
their own version of Tamiflu, the antiviral drug that is believed to be the
only available medicine effective against H5N1 in humans. China has also
joined the race to develop a vaccine against the virus that would work in
humans.
And in a country that takes its cue from the top leaders, Wen, China's
2nd-ranking leader, featured prominently in state media reports about the
government's efforts to "continue to control and wipe out the flu."
"It is very clear that China is very committed to combating avian
influenza. You can see it very clearly not only in agriculture, but in our
dealings with the Ministry of Health," said Henk Bekedam, the World Health
Organization's chief representative in China, at a news conference in
Beijing yesterday. "At the moment, we are confident the government is
responding well and responding strongly."
The H5N1 strain of avian flu has been killing birds in Asia since the
1990s, but it has spread more widely and quickly in the past 2 years and
killed more than 60 people, raising fears that if the virus mutates and
spreads easily among humans, it could kill millions. China's history with
dangerous outbreaks [also causes concern].
At least 2 and possibly all 3 of last century's deadly flu pandemics
emerged from southern China, where ducks, chickens, pigs and people seem to
form a potent viral stew.
Southern China also was the origin of the SARS outbreak in late 2002 that
spread in part because of the government's cover-up of the problem.
Poor local oversight may be partly to blame, for example, for the
widespread use of useless, counterfeit vaccines by chicken farmers in
northeast China's Liaoning province that may have exacerbated an outbreak
there.
When a 12 year old girl died in October 2005 and her 9 year old brother
took ill in Hunan province, officials' initial denials of a connection to
avian flu proved to be a troubling indication of the obstacles the
government faces within its ranks, where authorities at every level fear
reporting bad news.
In such a system it remains to be seen whether the ambitious project of
vaccinating billions of birds nationwide is realistic, especially
considering the vast majority of them are "backyard" birds on small farms.
But experts point to the eventual response to SARS in arguing that if any
country in the world can mobilize its population against a common threat,
it may be China. For weeks in the spring and early summer of 2003,
urbanites stayed off the roads, villages barred their entrances to
outsiders and the Communist Party's old system of neighborhood monitoring
roared back to life as the nation essentially hunkered down to wait out the
threat. The response was crude, overzealous and slowed down the economy,
but it was effective.
Hefangkou, where the chicken farmer Cao lives, was one of many that barred
strangers from entering during the SARS epidemic, which struck hard in the
urban center of Beijing, less than 50 miles away. "I tried my best not to
make contact with outsiders," Cao said yesterday in front of his shack,
where his young chickens are kept warm at night on a brick bed heated
underneath with firewood, a traditional way for farmers to keep warm in the
northern Chinese winter.
Cao, 57, and his wife run a brisk business selling their eggs to passersby
on the road in front of their farm, which is on the way to tourist
destinations including the Great Wall. Few customers have asked about bird
flu, he said, and his family sells all their eggs every day. In fact,
business keeps getting better, he said, and with the government determined
to do something about bird flu, he doesn't see any reason that should change.
"People listen to what the Communist Party is saying right now," Cao said.
"There might be some individual corrupt officials, but when it comes to
this kind of thing, even they will get things done."

[4] China, Hong Kong SAR, preventive measures

Hong Kong has adopted a multi-disciplinary, cross-sectoral approach to
prevent infectious diseases and an influenza pandemic, Permanent Secretary
for Health, Welfare & Food Carrie Yau says.
In a meeting with the Dutch Ministry's of Agriculture's Renee Bergkamp, Mrs
Yau said international collaboration is important in the control of avian
flu so expertise and resources can be pooled to curb the disease's spread.
Noting that the Netherlands is a close partner of Hong Kong, Mrs Yau said
the meeting was a constructive one with valuable information exchanged,
particularly on avian flu prevention. She said Hong Kong has learned a lot
from the Netherlands' experience in central slaughtering facilities and
from their computer system on infectious disease.
"[We] share the view that governments should prepare policy briefs on
infectious diseases to communicate with the public and enhance their
awareness, ability and action in the prevention and protection against
infectious diseases," Mrs Yau said.
"Both of us agree that the control of avian influenza requires co-operation
between different government institutions responsible for agriculture and
for public health, national and international research institutions, and
multilateral organisations. In Hong Kong, we treasure our experience from
the SARS outbreak and we have adopted the multi-discipline, cross-sectoral
approach to prevent infectious diseases and influenza pandemic."
Mrs Bergkamp shared Mrs Yau's view that a concerted effort will be needed
from the community in view of the recent global bird flu outbreak. "Only a
well-organised and concerted action for eradication and prevention across
the region can reduce risks and restore trade relations. Humans can become
infected by close contact with infected birds, and open markets are our
major concern," she said.

[Hong Kong has proven remarkably able to energetically tackle avian
influenza HPAI H5N1 since its initial detection there in 1997.
Collaboration with the Netherlands -- a country which had to kill about 30
million birds during the H7N7 outbreak in 2003 while applying newly
drafted, original biosecurity measures to protect humans from infection --
is based upon mutual interests and will be beneficial for the region,
including China. - Mod.AS]
