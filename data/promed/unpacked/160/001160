Thousands of children in east and central China have been sickened
with hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD], a highly contagious illness
[caused by an enterovirus] that is sometimes fatal, the government
and state press said on Tuesday [24 Mar 2009]; 2 children died of
the disease over the weekend in Heze city in the eastern province of
Shandong, the provincial medical department said on its website.
According to a Beijing newspaper, tests on the causes of another 4
recent infant deaths in and around Heze were still being confirmed by
doctors.

Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include fever and sores. It
can be fatal in children due to their less-developed immune systems.
The disease, which is common in China, took an unusually high toll in
the 1st few months of 2008, infecting nearly 25 000 people nationwide
and killing around 40, according to government figures. By
comparison, 17 deaths were reported in 2007.

According to the Shandong medical department, just over 500 cases of
hand-foot-mouth disease have been reported in the province this year
[2009]. Neighbouring Henan province has reported more than 2100 cases
this year, the local medical department said in a 19 Mar 2009 report
posted on its website.

It is likely that as in 2008 enterovirus 71 infection is responsible
for this serious outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease in children in
central and eastern China. Official confirmation is awaited. - Mod.CP]
