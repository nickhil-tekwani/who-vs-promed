The Epidemiological Surveillance Center (CVE) of the Sao Paulo State Health
Secretariat reports that as of yesterday afternoon [18 Jan 2000 there
remain 9 suspect cases of yellow fever (YF) in the State, all imported from
states of North and West-Central Brazil, where YF is endemic. 14 suspect
cases have been notified since the beginning of the year, but 5 have tested
negative at the Institute Adolfo Lutz.
The director of the CVE, Jose Castro de Moraes, said there is no need yet
for mass vaccination, but that anyone travelling to the states of North &
West-Central Brazil should be vaccinated 10 days before departing.
