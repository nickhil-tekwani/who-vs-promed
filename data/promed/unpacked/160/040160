South Korea's agriculture ministry said on Sunday [8 Aug 2021] that it has confirmed a case of African swine fever (ASF), the first one of the highly contagious and deadly animal disease in about 3 months. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, pigs at a farm in Gangwon Province were infected with the deadly animal disease, prompting the authorities to cull animals there.

The country also issued a special 48-hour travel ban on livestock-related facilities in Gangwon Province and Gyeonggi Province. Prime minister Kim Boo-kyum called on health authorities to make utmost efforts to swiftly contain the spread of the disease.

In 2019, ASF swept through pig farms in northern regions covering Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces, prompting authorities to cull about 400 000 pigs nationwide as part of preventive measures. A total of 14 farms were infected.

Although no new ASF cases had been reported from local farms for the past 3 months, the virus had prevailed among wild boar, which can potentially infect domestic pigs through contact.

ASF does not affect humans but is deadly to pigs. There is currently no vaccine or cure for the disease.

Since 9 Oct 2019 as of 2 Aug 2021, a total of 1505 ASFV infected wild boar were confirmed in 2 of South Korea's provinces, Gyeonggi and Gangwon. The cases in Gangwon-do were found in the following counties: Paju (100), Yeoncheon (416), Pocheon (93), Gapyeong (31). The cases in Gangwon-do were found in the following counties: Cheorwon (36), Hwacheon (422), Chuncheon (173), Yanggu (76), Goseong (7), Inje (103), Yeongwol (14), Yangyang (19), Gangneung (3), Hongcheon (9), and Pyeongchang (3) (http://www.koreapork.or.kr/board/view1?Ncode=issue&number=622, in Korean].

According to MAFRA, as young wild boar born in spring (March to May) have recently started their activities, detection of ASF positive wild boars is currently increasing within the wide-area fences (http://tinyurl.com/56knmnpp, in Korean].

FAO's most recent biweekly update of ASF in Asia & Pacific, updated 5 Aug 2021, including the above and additional epidemiological data from South Korea, is due to become available soon at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/Situation_update.html. - Mod.AS
