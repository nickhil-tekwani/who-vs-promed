A panda in northwest China's Shaanxi Province has died, and 3 others are ill after contracting a measles-like virus, local authorities confirmed on Monday [5 Jan 2015].

The 4 male pandas contracted canine distemper virus (CDV), a viral disease that affects a wide variety of animals including dogs and large cats, early last month [December 2014]. Among them was 8-year-old Cheng Cheng, who died on 9 Dec 2014.

Another 2 pandas, one 8 years old and one 5 years old, are critically ill, while the 14-year-old Zhu Zhu is in stable condition.

More than 30 experts from across China are taking care of the pandas. They also found that 3 other pandas showed symptoms of fever and had them quarantined for further diagnosis.

Canine distemper is a viral disease that affects the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract as well as the spinal cord and the brain. The infected animals usually have signs including high fever, eye inflammation, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, etc. It is highly contagious, with a high fatality rate, and is commonly spread through contact with infected body fluids or contaminated food and water.

The wildlife rescue, breeding and research center of Shaanxi was home to 25 giant pandas. After the outbreak of the epidemic, the center sent the 18 healthy pandas to natural reserves elsewhere in the province.
