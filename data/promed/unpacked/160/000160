Leishmaniasis continues to spread in southern province
------------------------------------------------------
Leishmaniasis continues to spread in Iraq's southern province of
Qadisiyah, about 130 km (81 mi) south of Baghdad, with at least 275
cases so far, a local official said.

The figure of 275 comprises 212 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis,
also known as Baghdad boil disease, and 63 cases of visceral
leishmaniasis, or 'kalaazar', Hindi for black fever, said Mohammed
Sahib, a dermatologist at Qadisiyah General Hospital.

"Cutaneous leishmaniasis is not fatal, but can cause up to 200 facial
lesions and crater-shaped sores, leaving patients seriously
disfigured. Kalaazar can kill, and causes fever, weight loss,
anaemia, and swelling of the spleen and liver," Sahib said.

Children are particularly at risk because they typically have weaker
immune systems than adults, he said. A single sand fly bite can be
enough to transmit the disease.

Local health authorities were still suffering from a shortage of
medicines to treat the disease, he said: "The medicines are not
enough, as the disease is spreading and in addition to medical
treatment there should be insecticide spraying campaigns to kill the
sand flies."

Faqid Abdul-Hadi of the Baghdad health directorate said overcrowded
living conditions in southern Iraq, where it is difficult to access
clean water, and plenty of stagnant pools of water in which flies can
breed, had hampered progress against the disease.

He said leishmaniasis cases had dropped substantially since 2004, but
progress eliminating the disease had been slow.

"Though the disease was first identified in Iraq more than a century
ago and has long been present in the country, outbreaks were rare
before 2003. But since the conflict began, the destroyed health
system has allowed [microorganisms] lurking in the environment to
return," Abdul-Hadi said. The peak transmission season for
leishmaniasis typically begins in May, he said.
