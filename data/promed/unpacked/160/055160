Survey on Pepino mosaic potexvirus on wild and cultivated
_Lycopersicon_ in Peru
----------------------
In March 2000, a survey on Pepino mosaic potexvirus [PepMV] (EPPO
Alert List) was carried out in central and southern Peru (Departments
of Lima, Ayacucho, Apurimac, Arequipa, Moquegua and Tacna).
These areas are part of the 'Sierra' (Andean highlands, mild climate)
and 'Costa' (coastal region, arid and warm).
65 populations of wild _Lycopersicon_ (_L. peruvianum_, _L.
parviflorum_, _L. chilense_, _L. chmiekewskii_, _L.pimpinelli-
folium_), and 4 cultivated tomato (_L. esculentum_) fields were
sampled and tested by DAS-ELISA for 5 viruses (PepMV, ... Potato X
potexvirus, Potato Y potyvirus, TMV and Tomato mosaic
tobamovirus [ToMV]). In addition, 6 samples of other _Solanaceae_
(_Datura_, _Nicotiana_, _Solanum caripense_, _S. muricatum_) were
also collected.
PepMV ... was detected in 24 samples and ToMV ... was found in 2
samples. Mechanical inoculation of susceptible [tomato] (cv. NE-1)
with crude sap extracts of 20 samples confirmed that 15 of them were
infected by PepMV ... (DAS-ELISA positive and, in most cases,
development of symptoms). These infected samples had been collected
from the Departments of Apurimac, Arequipa, and Moquegua, & were
obtained from wild _Lycopersicon_ (3 samples of _L. chilense_, 3
_L. chmielewskii_, 2 _L. parviflorum_ and 5 _L peruvianum_), from
crops of tomato (1 sample) and S. muricatum (1 sample).
These results showed that in Peru, _L. chilense_, _L. chmielewskii_,
_L. parviflorum_ and _L peruvianum_ are natural hosts of the virus, as
well as cultivated [tomato] and _S. muricatum_. The fact that the virus
is found in wild plants, and in many cases in isolated populations,
indicates that factors other than mechanical transmission are involved
in virus spread.
In inoculation tests on [tomato] cv. NE-1, symptoms caused by
Peruvian isolates were milder than those of a European isolate. ...
Genetic differences between European and Peruvian isolates had
already been found in other studies.

[The gist of this report is that PepMV is present in wild
_Lycopsersicon_ species in central and southern Peru. Potexvirus such
as PepMV are highly contagious and are known to spread rapidly by
mechanical contact (with contaminated farm machinery, tools, etc) but
the fact that the virus is so widespread in wild species suggests that
unknown vectors may be a factor in virus spread. Of the 22 known
potexviruses, 11 are thought to be spread by unknown vectors. Clearly,
research on natural spread of potexviruses in wild populations
represents an interesting challenge to a ecologist with interests in virus
transmission. - Mod.DH]
