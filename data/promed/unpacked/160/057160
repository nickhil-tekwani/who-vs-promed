Tilapia lake virus, Colombia
----------------------------
Information received on [and dated] Thu 4 Jun 2020 from Dra. Deyanira Barrero Leon, General Manager, Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Bogota, Colombia

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 2 Apr 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 8 Apr 2020
Report date: 4 Jun 2020
Date submitted to OIE: 4 Jun 2020
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Morbidity: 50%
Mortality: 46.2%
Zoonotic impact: No
Causal agent: Tilapia lake virus
Serotype: Not typed

Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: Villa Francisco, La Cascada, Palmira, Valle [Valle del Cauca]
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Apr 2020
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Water type: Fresh water
Population type: Farmed
Production system: Semi-closed
Total animals affected:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Tilapia (_Oreochromis_ sp.) / 50% / 46.2% / 2600 / 1300 / 1200 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Tilapia (_Oreochromis_ sp.) / 50% / 46.15% / 92.31% / 46.15%
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new live animals, horizontal spread through water
Epidemiological comments: The aquaculture farm is a subsistence one and is dedicated to fattening for self-consumption and local consumption. It does not have the minimum biosecurity measures for the breeding of these animals. The water comes from a nearby river, which receives black and grey water discharges from dwellings and pig holdings in the area. No treatment is carried out on the water used. Wild birds and companion animals have also free access to the production area.

Control measures
Measures applied: Surveillance outside infected and/or protection zone, surveillance within infected and/or protection zone, traceability, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, disinfection, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Disinfection/disinfestation, screening

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National veterinary diagnostic laboratory (national laboratory) / Tilapia (_Oreochromis_ sp.) / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 8 Apr 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly reports will be submitted.

[The following abstract comes from the article by Jansen MD, Dong HT, Mohan CV. Tilapia lake virus: a threat to the global tilapia industry? Rev Aquacult 2019; 11: 725-39. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12254

Abstract
--------
Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) is a recently described virus affecting wild and farmed tilapines. At present, it has been reported on 3 continents (Asia, Africa and South America), and the number of countries where the agent has been detected is likely to increase rapidly as a result of increased awareness, surveillance and availability of diagnostic methods. Any lack of openness regarding the TiLV status of a translocating live tilapia population destined for aquaculture may inadvertently contribute to the spread of the agent. Currently, there is no cure for viral diseases in aquaculture, and while vaccines and selective breeding have proved successful in reducing the severity of some viral diseases, there are currently severe knowledge gaps relating to TiLV, and no effective, affordable vaccines are yet available. This paper summarizes the published scientific information on TiLV and highlights important issues relating to its diagnosis, mitigation and control measures. While there have been no scientific studies on the socioeconomic impact of TiLV, it may pose a significant threat particularly to small-scale fish farmers' livelihoods and wild tilapine populations if left uncontrolled. To aid disease investigations, the authors propose case definitions for suspected and confirmed cases of TiLV infections.
