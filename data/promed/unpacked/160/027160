Viet Nam reports additional provinces hit by pig disease
--------------------------------------------------------
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), known as "blue
ear" disease, has recently stricken 2 more Vietnamese provinces,
raising the total number of affected localities [provinces] to 10,
local newspaper Pioneer reported Tuesday [22 Apr 2008].

Specimens from ill pigs in Yen Mo in the northern province of Ninh
Binh and Y Yen of Nam Dinh province tested positive to PRRS virus, the
paper quoted the country's Department of Animal Health as reporting.

Now, PRRS is hitting the provinces of Thanh Hoa, Thai Binh, Thai
Nguyen, Nam Dinh, and Ninh Binh in the northern region, and Ha Tinh,
Quang Nam, Nghe An, Lam Dong, and Thua Thien Hue in the central
region, said the department.

PRRS was first recognized in the United States in the mid-1980s and
is now present in most pig producing countries. The symptoms include
reproductive failure, pneumonia, and increased susceptibility to
secondary bacterial infection.

[Viet Nam submitted its initial, "Immediate notification" to the OIE
(World Organisation for Animal Health) on PRRS on 11 Apr 2007,
reporting 6 outbreaks of the disease in northern provinces. The start
of the outbreak(s) was, reportedly, 12 Mar 2007. This was followed by
4 "follow-up" reports of 19 Apr 2007, 1 Aug 2007, 3 Oct 2007, and 23
Feb 2008.

Follow-up report No 3, dated 3 Oct 2007, included data on 9 new
outbreaks in 5 provinces, namely Quang Nam (2), Binh Dinh (2), Vung
Tau (1), Khanh Hoa (2), and Ca Mau (2). Out of a total of 1002
susceptible pigs present in the 9 affected premises, 457 were
clinically diseased of which 113 died; the remaining 676 pigs were
destroyed, in line with "stamping out" policy. The report indicated,
under "Measures to be applied," "Vaccination in response to the
outbreak(s)."

Follow-up report No 4 of 23 Feb 2008 indicated the absence of new
cases since the previous report, and is titled "Final report." To
view all 5 reports and a map showing the locations of all outbreaks
in 2007, subscribers are referred to
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5199>.

"Final report" may mean the eradication of a disease; it may also
indicate that the disease has become enzootic (endemic) and,
consequently, follow-up reports became redundant.

The current information on PRRS as allegedly present in 10 of Viet
Nam's provinces, if accurate, indicates that the epizootic is
continuing. Confirmation or otherwise will be appreciated.

PRRS appeared in China as a widely spread and devastating syndrome
(at least) several months before it was recorded in Viet Nam. It may
have been the source of the Vietnamese epizootic, but evidence has
not become available (see commentary in ProMED-mail posting
20070512.1516). China's 1st immediate notification confirming PRRS as
the true cause of what was previously named "swine high fever
disease" was submitted to the OIE on 9 May 2007; one follow-up report
has been sent, namely on 8 Aug 2007, and the epizootic is regarded as
"continuing". For the 2 reports and a map, see
