PHORID FLY SQUADRONS STILL BATTLING FIRE ANTS
Apparently the offspring of thousands of Brazilian parasitic flies released
last summer have survived the first generation. Many field-reared flies have
been found attacking ants and laying eggs to start a second generation. ARS
scientists released the pinhead-sized flies last July through October as
part of an environmentally friendly effort to control imported fire ants,
_Solenopsis invicta_. Fire ants infest millions of acres in the southern
United States.
Because the Brazilian flies are natural enemies of fire ants in South
America, ARS scientists brought the flies to this country. The ARS
scientists are hoping the flies will lower currently high fire ant densities
to the levels normally found in South America.
The fly deposites an egg inside the ant. The egg hatches into a larva within
a day or two. Researchers at ARS Center for Medical, Agricultural and
Veterinary Entomology released the flies at three locations near
Gainesville, Florida: Kanapaha Gardens, the University of Florida Dairy
Farm, and along Hogtown Creek. When scientists last checked in January, they
discovered flies still attacking fire ant mounds. ARS research entomologist
Sanford Porter says this is a good sign, showing the flies can survive and
may have permanently established themselves.
It will take about another year or two to determine how effectively the
flies are controlling fire ant populations at test sites in Florida. The
scientists plan to release more flies in several other states later this year.

[I have always wondered why ARS is working so hard and so long to control
this ant. Our published economic studies indicate that this ant does
significantly more good than harm. See Jemal A & M Hugh-Jones, "A review of
the Red Imported Fire-Ant (_Solenopsis invicta_ Buren) and its impactsw on
plant, animal, and human health. Preventive Veterinary Medicine 17:19-32.
