A 78-year-old Torrance County, New Mexico man is the 1st human case of plague in New Mexico or the USA in 2012. Health officials report the yet unnamed man is currently hospitalized in stable condition.

According to a New Mexico Department of Health press release Thursday (31 May 2012) [http://www.health.state.nm.us/CommunicationsOffice/2012%20News%20Releases/NewsRelease-20120531-PlagueFirstCase-EN.pdf], they confirmed the man as having the plague, or _Yersinia pestis_ [infection]. NM Department of Health Cabinet Secretary, Dr Catherine Torres said, "The Department of Health takes action when a plague case occurs to ensure the safety of the immediate family, neighbors, and health care providers. We inform neighbors door-to-door about plague found in the area and educate them on reducing their risk. We determine whether individuals close to the patient may also have been exposed to the plague and recommend preventative treatment when necessary."

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. It is found in animals throughout the world, most commonly rats but other rodents like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, rabbits, and voles. Fleas typically serve as the vector of plague. Human cases have been linked to the domestic cats and dogs that brought infected fleas into the house.

Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague. In this form, the bacteria typically enter the body through the bite of an infected flea or rodent. Here the bacteria infect the lymphatic system. After a few days to a week, the person will experience fever, chills, weakness, and swollen lymph glands. These are called buboes.

NM public health veterinarian, Dr Paul Ettestad says plague activity usually begins to increase in the spring and continues into the summer months. Now is the season and people need to take precautions to avoid rodents and their fleas which can expose them to plague. Ettestad says, "Pets that are allowed to roam and hunt can bring infected fleas from dead rodents back into the home, putting you and your children at risk."

Health authorities offer the following recommendations to prevent plague:
- Avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and burrows.
- Keep your pets from roaming and hunting
- Talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets
- Clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles.
- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian.
- See your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.

[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA are reported from the Four Corners area of the USA where the states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico come together.

As outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/diagnosis.htm: "Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.

"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.

"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal." - Mod.LL
