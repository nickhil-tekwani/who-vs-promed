Takeaway foods containing chicken may be the source of Adelaide's
food-poisoning outbreak. The Department of Human Services executive
director, Professor Brendon Kearney, said yesterday the particular strain
of salmonella had a historical association with chicken feed.
Adding weight to suspicions that the rare strain, _Salmonella typhimurium_
phage type 135A, was in takeaways was that all 74 reported cases were aged
under 30 - including several children.
Prof. Kearney said it was unusual for salmonella to limit itself to a
particular age group, particularly considering cases were turning up all
over the metropolitan area.
He said authorities had been unable to isolate the source despite the
outbreak reaching epidemic proportions as far back as mid-February.
Individual cases started appearing in January but began climbing markedly
in the third week of February. Prof. Kearney said numbers peaked last
Wednesday.
