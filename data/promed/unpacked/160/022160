A man currently living in Buenos Aires died in a public hospital in this
city because of hantavirus infection, the Ministry of Health confirmed
today [17 Aug 2006]. The Ministry declared in an official bulletin that the
47-year-old patient died last Mon 14 Aug [2006] in Velez Sarsfield
Hospital, where he had been admitted a few days before because of "a flu
condition lasting for more than one month".
The bulletin also stated that the diagnosis of hantavirus infection was
confirmed by the Department of Epidemiology of Malbran Institute.
Suspicions about the clinical condition of this patient arose on 8 Aug
[2006], when the Infectious Diseases Service of Velez Sarsfield Hospital
notified Malbran Institute about a man who was admitted with "a respiratory
condition who is doing poorly". After being treated without any positive
outcome in the outpatient clinic, the man was admitted to the Intensive
Therapy Unit, where his respiratory distress worsened.
The official bulletin pointed out that "physicians proposed different
diagnoses that were progressively ruled out according to the laboratory
test results," prior to considering "a pulmonary syndrome caused by
hantavirus," as it was confirmed later by the Malbran Institute laboratory.
The bulletin also revealed that the man had been doing cleaning work in
stores and depots in the Buenos Aires urban area "with possible presence of
rodents." Because of this case, the Ministry of Health indicated that they
"are looking" for data "in order to determine the original source [of the
virus]."
The 1st fatal case of hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires [Province]
occurred on 17 Jul 2002, when a veterinarian from Villa Lugano, who used to
work in a rural area
in la Plata died in Muniz Hospital.
Dr. Jorge San Juan, chief of the Intensive Therapy Unit of San Juan
Hospital, explained to D & N that hantavirus infection is "an acute
infectious disease caused by a group of viruses transmitted to humans
through contact with feces, urine, and saliva from certain wild rodents;
this material is aerosolized and it enters the human body when inhaled."
The specialist reminded D&N that the disease "has a prolonged incubation
time," 25 to 30 days, and he pointed out that transmission "is also
possible" by being bitten by infected mice, or by contact with feces or
urine that may enter through the conjunctiva, or through skin abrasions.
The virus is acquired through contact with different rodent species; and,
in Argentina, as for the [rest of the] Americas, the disease may present as
a pulmonary syndrome [HPS].

The Oscar Arraiz Hospital confirmed the death of a woman from Villa la
Angostura due to a hantavius. She died on [23 Jul 2006] in a [medical]
center in Neuquen after having suffered acute respiratory symptoms. Her
husband was also a victim of this disease a month and a half before.
According to Dr.Samuel Garcia, of the epidemiological unit of the local
Oscar Arraiz Hospital, the woman, age 52 years, was admitted to the
hospital Wednesday [19 Jul 2006] with an atypical respiratory
condition. The laboratory results were positive for hantavirus and she was
immediately sent to the hospital in Neuquen. She died of her respiratory
problems the following Sunday, despite intensive treatment.
Two family members in direct contact with the couple are under observation
to see if they develop symptoms of this disease [HPS]. So far, they are
negative.
"The most probable source of the infection was her contact with her husband
when he was infected. Had she been exposed to the same source as her
husband, her incubation period exceeds the maximum [time] for this disease
-- 42 days, " indicated Garcia. This is an instance of infrequent
person-to-person transmission.
Her husband, age 48, worked in a rural area some 30 km from this locale,
when he was working in a closed chicken house where, presumably, there was
[hantavirus] excrement from infected rodents that was put into the air and
infected him.
When the woman consulted a physician, the disease was already in the acute
phase. " It is important to advise anyone who has been in [direct] contact
with an infected person to consult with a doctor before symptoms appear"
emphasized Garcia, and added, "The cases resulting from person-to-person
transmission are very rare, but that possibility should not be discounted."
According to the doctor's explanation, approximately 36 cases [of HPS] have
been diagnosed in Neuquen Province, of which only 4 were due to
person-to-person transmission, all of which were within a family
circle. "Similarly, in the mountainous Rio Negro and Chubut Provinces, the
numbers of [HPS] cases would be similar," noted Garcia.
After the death of the man was confirmed as due to hantavirus, the
Municipality, together with health personnel, undertook a cleanup of areas
of high risk which might have been responsible for the infection. The area
was fumigated, cleaned and rodents were eliminated.

[The hantavirus involved was not specifically identified, but likely was
Andes virus, which has been shown to be transmitted person-to-person.
Neuquen Province is located on the eastern slopes of the Andes Mountains,
where Andes virus is endemic. Direct transmission between people with the
other Western Hemisphere hantaviruses is unlikely. - Mod.TY]
[Hantaviruses in South America are maintained in sigmodontine
rodents. Neither the viruses responsible nor their presumed rodents hosts
have been identified. Several hantaviruses have been associated with human
infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed
pigmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), related Andes-like
viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown), Lechiguanas
(in central Argentina in _O. flavescens_), Oran (in northwestern Argentina
in _O. longicaudatus_), and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_)
virus. Other hantaviruses are present in various South American countries
and in Panama (see Mod. CP comments in ProMED archive number 20060220.0553).
The CDC has an excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/hpsslideset/hpsslides1-12.htm>).
