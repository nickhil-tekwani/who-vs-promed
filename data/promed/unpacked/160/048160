After the death of a tourist from yellow fever, the State Department of Health issues guidelines and alerts to take care against the disease.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The State Department of Health (SES) is carrying out the investigation of infection by yellow fever [virus] in São Salvador and Peixe. in the 2 cities, technical advisory activities are carried out, immunization and vector collection after the death of a tourist with the confirmed disease. The management of arboviruses issued an alert about the disease incident.

According to SES, the investigation was based on information from the occurrence of a confirmed case of the disease, with the death of one tourist [from where? - Mod. RNA], who was in Tocantins and was not vaccinated. In March [2022], the tourist was sport fishing in Lago Peixe/Angical, between Peixe, São Salvador, and Parana.

The moment is not one for alarm, but awareness of the local and visitor population. There is a need for guidance from municipal managers and companies that work with tourism, as well as the awareness of the population that it is entering into the Amazon region, which is determined by the Ministry of Health, as priority for vaccination against the disease", said the manager of Arbovirus Diseases, Cristiane Bueno.

Based on SES data, since 2018 Tocantins has not registered cases of yellow fever in humans. However, this Monday, 11 [Apr 2022], SES announced that throughout 2021, from January to December, only 67.80% of the target audience for the yellow fever vaccine is immunized.

[Information about the case is scarce. Where did the tourist come from? What are the dates of onset of symptoms and death? What is the vaccination status of the case? When was the case confirmed? Is/was there evidence of epizootics in the vicinity of the likely sites of infection? Are/were there any other suspected cases?

In any case, the case must be understood as a sentinel event, both as a warning for travelers/tourists who go to the state and for the adoption/intensification of actions aimed at increasing vaccination coverage in the state, the awareness of the surveillance system (including surveillance of epizootics in non-human primates) and of the support network. - Mod.RNA [in Portuguese, trans. - Mod.TY]

Mod.RNA raises critical questions that are important to understand where and when the tourist acquired yellow fever (YF) virus infection. The case is most likely due to spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle of YF virus transmission. Warning the public of the areas where the tourist might have become infected and intensification of surveillance to detect non-human primate YF deaths and any additional human cases is prudent. With only 68% of the local population vaccinated, far below the 80% coverage recommended by the WHO, a timely vaccination campaign in the area is needed. - Mod.TY
