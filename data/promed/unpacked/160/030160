Summary of Weekly FluView -- U.S. Situation Update
--------------------------------------------
Influenza activity in the United States has increased substantially throughout the nation, most notably in the south central and southeast regions of the country. This update reports influenza activity for the period18-24 Nov 2012

Summary of these key indicators:

- The proportion of visits to doctors for influenza-like illness (ILI) was at the national baseline. This is the earliest in the regular season that influenza activity has reached the national baseline level since the 2003-2004 season. This week, 5 U.S. regions reported ILI activity above region-specific baseline levels and 5 states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas), experienced high ILI activity.

- A total of 4 states reported widespread influenza activity (Alaska, Mississippi, New York, and South Carolina). Regional influenza activity was reported by 7 states (Alabama, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Ohio). 19 states reported local influenza activity. This is an increase from the 8 states that reported local influenza activity in the previous week week.

- The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza based on the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System was below the epidemic threshold.

- No influenza-related pediatric deaths were reported for the period 18-24 Nov 2012. Two influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported so far during the 2012-13 season. Nationally, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza viruses in the United States during the week of 18-24 Nov 2012 was 15.2 percent. This is an increase from the previous week and remains relatively elevated for this time of year. The regional percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza viruses ranged from 3.8 percent to 20.6 percent.

- Both influenza A (H3N2 and 2009 H1N1) and influenza B viruses have been identified this season. During this week 571 of the 812 influenza positive tests reported to CDC were influenza A and 241 were influenza B viruses. Among the 571 influenza A viruses identified that week, approximately 35 percent were H3 viruses and less than 1 percent were 2009 H1N1 viruses; 65 percent were not subtypes.

- Since 1 Oct 2012, CDC has antigenically characterized 140 influenza viruses, including two 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viruses, 90 influenza A (H3N2) viruses and 48 influenza B viruses. The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viruses were characterized as A/California/7/2009-like. This is the influenza A (H1N1) component of the Northern Hemisphere vaccine for the 2012-2013 season. All 90 of the influenza A (H3N2) viruses were characterized as A/Victoria/361/2011-like. This is the influenza A (H3N2) component of the Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine for the 2012-2013 season. Approximately 71 percent of the 48 influenza B viruses belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage of viruses, and were characterized as B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like, the influenza B component for the 2012-2013 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. The remaining 29 percent of the tested influenza B viruses belonged to the B/Victoria lineage of viruses.

- Since 1 Oct 2012, the CDC has tested 2 2009 influenza A (H1N1), 122 influenza A (H3N2), and 81 influenza B virus isolates for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors this season. Each of the viruses showed susceptibility to the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and A (H3N2) viruses. (Adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses.

New isolate of A/H3N2v
---------------------
The US CDC also received a new report of H3N2v infection, the 1st to be reported since the end of September [2012]. The patient, from Iowa, had no contact with swine or other livestock the week before becoming sick.

Patricia Quinlisk, MD, MPH, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health, told CIDRAP News that the H3N2v infection was detected within the past 2 weeks through routine surveillance. The patient is a child who has since recovered. Iowa reported 3 H3N2v cases in 2011, but it did not detect any over the summer and fall when several states -- especially Indiana and Ohio -- were reporting cases linked to fairs and other similar events.

The CDC said the new H3N2v case pushes the number of such infections reported since July to 311. Most cases were related to contact with swine in fair settings. The CDC said though instances of human-to-human transmission have been identified, there is no evidence of ongoing transmission.

[In contrast to the current situation in Europe [see: ProMEDmail report entitled: Influenza (108): Europe update 20121130.1432752], influenza activity in the United States is increasing perceptibly in parts of the the nation, most notably in the south central and southeast regions of the country. As yet there is no evidence of the appearance of novel influenza virus strains. Both influenza A (H3N2 and 2009 H1N1) viruses and the influenza B viruses have been identified this season, and are well-matched by the components of the Northern Hemisphere vaccine for the 2012-2013 influenza season. All of the clinical isolates tested have shown susceptibility to the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir.

The A/H3N2v virus associated with sporadic cases of human infection following with contact with swine at agricultural fairs has not disappeared, but although human-to-human transmission has been observed, there is no evidence of sustained ongoing transmission. - Mod.CP
