University of Missouri [MU] Extension specialists recently received several reports of Missouri cattle dying due to fescue foot [endophyte toxicosis], says MU Extension state forage specialist Craig Roberts.

These significant losses show why beef producers should check herds for warning signs of fescue foot in early January when it most often occurs, Roberts says.

Cows grazing on infected fescue are vulnerable to fescue foot following extreme cold spells, he says. During cold weather, producers might notice some cows or yearlings on fescue pastures move slowly or limp early in the day. They should act quickly on these early warning signs of fescue foot.

"Early detection is vital," says Roberts. If signs are caught early, cows can be moved off toxic Kentucky 31 [tall fescue grass] pastures and given other forage or feed. "If you wait to move cattle off infected pastures, it may be too late. If left on toxic pastures, limping cows can lose hooves and become infected with gangrene."

Put lame animals in a chute and check their lower legs, says MU Extension livestock specialist Gene Schmitz. Hooves on hind feet may show swelling where legs join hooves. A cool leg indicates a lack of blood flow.

The toxic alkaloids in fescue are vasoconstrictors. They shrink blood vessels and reduce blood flow to extremities, causing the hoof to die off. Cattle with fescue foot may lose the tips of their ears or switches from their tails. They may survive, but the market value of these "fescue calves" drops.

Cows in advanced stages of fescue foot can't walk or graze and likely will die. Fescue foot, first reported more than 75 years ago, cripples profits as well as cows.

While there is no cure, producers can replace toxic fescue with a novel-endophyte variety [or endophyte-free - Mod.TG] not producing the toxic alkaloid. The novel varieties cure the low rate of gain, low weaning weight, low milk production, and poor reproduction. Also, novel endophytes eliminate fescue foot.

Forage producers can learn how to kill toxic fescue pastures and seed them with a nontoxic variety. In March [2023], the Alliance for Grassland Renewal will offer workshops in 3 states, including Missouri, on how to renovate Kentucky 31 pastures. Missouri's training will be in Mount Vernon on 23 Mar 2023. Details will be announced at http://www.grasslandrenewal.org.

MU Extension agronomists and livestock specialists also can offer advice on how to prevent fescue foot and renovate fescue pastures.

[The toxic agent is an ergot alkaloid that infects the fescue grass. Ergot alkaloids cause extreme constriction of the limbs. This includes the feet, the tip of the tail, and the tip of the ears. This is a very painful condition. _Neotyphodium coenophialum_is the endophyte fungus in the fescue grass, and is responsible for the condition in the animals.

At the 1st sign of even a mild lameness in 1 or 2 animals, all animals need to be removed from the pasture and provided endophyte-free hay and water. The vessel constriction can cause severe lameness, to the point the hoof can actually sluff off, or the tips of ears to fall off, or even the switch on the tail. These animals cannot move without extreme pain and become less valuable if a hoof sloughs off. Animals in this extreme pain often do not eat well and consequently lose weight and value.

Endophyte-infected fescue can also affect horses. It can also affect the developing fetus in horses.

There are endophyte-free varieties of fescue available for planting. The endophyte-free varieties grow well and do not cause the lameness seen in cattle or horses. The endophyte-free varieties produce a good crop.

It may take a producer a year or 2 to completely rid the pasture of the endophyte-infected fescue variety. If possible and if done safely, burning the field can help in getting rid of the infected fescue varieties. Check with your local county agent the recommended methods in your area. - Mod.TG
