Maitland City Council has been made aware of a suspected case of chickenpox at Maitland Pool, New South Wales Australia (Hunter Valley). Council is urging anyone with symptoms of the disease to see a doctor as soon as possible.

Symptoms include an onset of slight fever, runny nose, and feeling generally unwell; and an itchy skin rash which usually appears as small lumps, turns into blisters and then scabs over a 3--4 day period.

An individual with chickenpox is contagious from the beginning of the illness - up to 2 days before the spots appear - until about 5 days after the 1st spots appear.

Early in the illness, the virus is spread by coughing and sneezing.

Later in the illness, the virus is spread by direct contact with the fluid in the blisters.

People with chickenpox should avoid others until at least 5 days after onset of the rash and up until all the blisters have dried. They should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, dispose of soiled tissues, wash their hands well and not share eating utensils, food or drinking cups.

People who have a past history of chickenpox and are vaccinated against the virus are less likely to contract the disease.

Anyone who has not had chickenpox or been vaccinated in the past can get chickenpox.

In particular, pregnant women, newborn babies and people with a weakened immune system should avoid anyone with chickenpox and should see their doctor immediately if they have been around someone with this virus.

A person diagnosed with chickenpox should rest as much as possible and avoid contact with other until no longer infected.

For more information, contact your doctor, or visit the NSW [New South Wales] Health website.

This long Easter weekend, several parents will be staying at home taking care of very sick children, rather than going to holiday festivities.

Parents with babies at the Cub Corner Preschool in Lakeview are seeing something rare - a cluster of children, younger than a year old, with chicken pox.

"It's very common. It's very contagious, and it's very easily spread from one person to the next," said Dr. Michael Wasserman.

Dr. Wasserman is a pediatrician at Oschner for Children and he is not seeing it in his practice. The state Health Department isn't seeing other places with clusters either, but a letter to the parents from the preschool confirms 5 cases. Some parents believe there are now 8. Pediatricians recommend children get the chicken pox vaccine at 1 year and at 4 years of age. In the 1st year of life, they have some immunity passed on from mothers.

But on [Wed 28 Mar 2018], the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals sent a letter to the parents, recommending exposed children, at least 6 months of age and older, get the vaccine. Dr. Wasserman agrees with the state recommendation.

"Would you rather get it (chicken pox) from the immunization, which is controlled, or would you rather get something that is wild and uncontrolled, and could make you much sicker with complications?"

Dr. Wasserman is concerned that children with 30--100 lesions will be at risk for getting staph infection in them, the kind that is resistant to antibiotics. Both he and state doctors recommend children get on the prescription antiviral acyclovir the 1st day the rash breaks out and keep the rash extra clean.

"Chicken pox has a lot of misery associated with it, and so the treatments include, medication for itch such as Benadryl, or one of the other oral antihistamines, Zyrtec or Claritin. You can put Calamine lotion. You can use Aveeno oatmeal baths, and you clean the heck out of the kids," said Dr. Wasserman.

The preschool says a child may have been misdiagnosed with a different infection (impetigo) before coming in. Also doctors remind adults that if they have the shingles, that can be passed on as chicken pox to people who have not been vaccinated or who have never had a case.

Mothers of the primary school "Jose Vasconcelos" of the community of La Valla, called for the support of the health authority to prevent further infections of varicella in the area Rosalia Nieves Rosas

A group of mothers of primary school "Jose Vasconcelos" of the community of La Valla, expressed their concern over the outbreak of Chickenpox and to date, no authority has visited to control and eradicate the virus.

Yesterday [Wed 28 Mar 2018] mothers of the primary school sought to solicit the support of the health authorities to attend a community meeting with the locals to offer information and recommendations to prevent more people from becoming infected by this virus.

As a personal initiative some of the parents chose not to take their children to school to avoid spreading others lower.

They mentioned that for each group at least 2 children were contagious. For this reason, they called for the support of competent authorities in order to prevent further cases of children with this virus, since during this seasonal period it is common to see infection with Varicella.

[According to the CDC, children should receive 2 doses of the vaccine--the 1st dose at 12 through 15 months old and a 2nd dose at 4 through 6 years old. Two doses of the vaccine are about 90 percent effective at preventing chickenpox. - Mod.LK]
