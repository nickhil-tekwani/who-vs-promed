A bacterium long feared by sheep hunters and wildlife managers has been found for the 1st time among wild sheep in Alaska.

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game announced that _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ -- often known as _M. ovi_ -- has been found in sheep killed last year [2017] by hunters in the Talkeetna Mountains area. The bacterium was also found in wild goats in the Kenai Peninsula.

The bacterium is not native to Alaska. In the Lower 48 [states], it is blamed for contributing to big horn sheep population die-offs. The bacteria impair hairline cilia structures in the lungs of sheep and goats, making it harder for the animals to clear other pathogens from the lungs with each breath.

Researchers found the bacteria in 4 Dall sheep among a sample of 136 taken in Game Management Unit 13A, which runs north of the Glenn Highway between Chickaloon and Glennallen. The infected animals appeared healthy, according to a news release from the Department of Fish and Game. 2 infected goats were captured live in the Kenai Peninsula and were part of a sample of 39 mountain goats captured for testing in both southeast Alaska and the Kenai Peninsula.

The state had been surveying sheep and goats to try to detect the bacterium for the last 10 years without previously confirming its presence in wild populations. In recent years, the state boosted the number of animals for testing and began testing animals taken by hunters.

Animals can carry the bacteria without showing signs of illness, and there haven't been any signs of Dall sheep or mountain goat die-offs associated with the bacteria, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game news release.

Both the national Wild Sheep Foundation and its Alaska chapter responded to the news by calling for the state to require testing of domestic sheep and goats.

Alaska biologists haven't confirmed a link between farm animals and the presence of the bacteria in wild animals. The state is working with the US Department of Agriculture to research the strains of _M. ovi_ found in the wild animals to see if they're similar to those found in domestic animals.

Sheep-hunting advocates have long feared domestic animals would spread the disease to Alaska's wildlife. Previous testing by Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation found the bacteria in about 4 percent of Alaska's 1500 domestic sheep and goats.

"We will no longer accept a 'wait-and-see' approach; this wildfire has been ignited, and it could sweep across thinhorn sheep range in the North," Wild Sheep Foundation CEO Gray Thornton said in a written statement. "More than a quarter of all wild sheep in North America call Alaska home, and now they are at risk."

Thinhorn sheep include both the Dall sheep found in Alaska and the Stone sheep found in Canada's Yukon and British Columbia.

The Alaska Wild Sheep Foundation pledged USD 600 000 toward "testing and mitigation" of Alaska farm animals.

In January [2018], Alaska Gov. Bill Walker transmitted a bill to the Legislature that would make some agricultural records confidential, including the voluntary disease testing of farm animals. The bill, HB 315, was referred to the House Judiciary and House Resources committees. It passed through Judiciary last month [February 2018] and has a hearing in the Resources Committee on [Fri 16 Mar 2018].

In 2016, the Alaska Wild Sheep Foundation asked the state Board of Game to remove sheep from the state "clean list" of animals that can be owned without a permit. The proposal drew strong opposition from sheep and goat owners. The game board voted not to take action on the proposal after concluding that as a hunting board it didn't have authority to issue licenses for domestic animals.

[Wild ovid pneumonia (mostly diagnosed in bighorn sheep) has traditionally been considered a multifactorial disease, caused by multiple pathogens. Due to their complexity, understanding multifactorial phenomena like these, usually requires integrated and sustained research efforts. The absence of established and universal explanations for pneumonia outbreaks contributes to conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders over land use and management practices.

However, recent evidence indicates that in northwestern USA there seems to be a pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids.

The normal host range of _M. ovipneumoniae_ (members of Old World Caprinae, including domestic sheep) is consistent with many observations that outbreaks of bighorn sheep pneumonia frequently follow contact with these hosts. Experiments in which bighorn sheep were commingled with domestic sheep resulted in bighorn sheep pneumonia and high death rates. Similar commingling experiments with other ungulates (deer, elk, llamas, horses, cattle, goats, mountain goats) resulted at most in sporadic deaths from pneumonia. What might result from exposure of this pathogen to natural populations of Dall sheep and mountain goat is unknown and the surveillance efforts implemented are warranted.

The bighorn sheep pneumonia web of causation may have an important environmental component. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggest that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant.

This finding in wild sheep from Alaska is a concern for wild ungulate conservation and livestock health.- Mod.PMB
