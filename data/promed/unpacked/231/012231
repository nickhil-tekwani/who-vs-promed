This Thursday [19 Feb 2009] the deaths of a black howler monkey
[_Alouatta caraya_] in Santa Maria and another in Barros Cassal were
confirmed for yellow fever [YF]. The information was released by the
State Center of Health Surveillance (CEVS). Therefore, [the
municipalities of] Gramado Xavier, Boqueirao do Leao, Progresso,
Restinga Seca, Formigueiro, Sao Sepe, and Sao Gabriel will be put on
the list for vaccination against the disease. The 7 municipalities
are being placed in the risk zone as a precaution, announced the
State Secretary Health, Osmar Terra.

- There is no cause for alarm. [We will] enlarge the area of
vaccination for neighboring municipalities is a measure of
precaution. In Santa Maria, for example, there was no recorded
disease, but the population was already being vaccinated because the
neighboring [municipality], Julio de Castilhos, had cases of yellow
fever confirmed in monkeys.

Since 12 Jan [2009] there have been no recorded cases suspected of
yellow fever in humans in the state. The disease killed 4 people
since October last year [2008] in Rio Grande do Sul. The goal of the
State Secretariat of Health is to put in place approximately 100 000
[doses of YF] vaccine in the region in the coming days.

- In cities that are in the area of risk, approximately 92 percent of
population has already been vaccinated.

The analysis of a monkey that died in Estancia Velha in the district
of Boca do Monte, showed the presence of the virus of the disease.
The city is the 5th in the region to have confirmed cases of dead
monkeys from yellow fever [virus infection]. The tests, performed in
a laboratory located in Belem do Para, had shown the disease [virus]
to be present in Tupancireta, Quevedo, Julio de Castilhos, and Toropi.

Officially, 9 monkeys were found dead in the city. Still results are
expected for [only] 4 of them because the others were only
[decomposed] carcasses when they were found.

The howler monkeys are not the cause of yellow fever. They are a
victim of the disease. Since they live in top branches [of the
trees], also inhabited by the mosquitoes that transmit the disease in
forests, the animal is bitten, and serves as host of disease.
