A total of 5 people died of Legionnaires' disease over the summer [2022] at a New York City nursing home that had been cited repeatedly for improper maintenance of the cooling towers where the _Legionella_ bacteria can spread, The New York Times reported.

The outbreak at Amsterdam Nursing Home, a 409-bed facility in upper Manhattan, was the city's worst since 2015 when a cooling tower in the Bronx was blamed for an infection that caused 16 deaths.

The home has restricted water use since the outbreak that ended in September [2022], spokesperson Jeff Jacomowitz said. "All further tests have been coming back negative, and the facility has provided bottled water for drinking and for all sanitary uses."

People can get Legionnaires' disease when they breathe in water vapor containing the _Legionella_ bacteria, which grows in wet environments including hot tubs, fountains and cooling towers. Deaths attributed to Legionnaires' are rare, but the risk is higher for older populations such as nursing home residents.

Following the 2015 outbreak in the Bronx, New York City passed strict rules for maintaining cooling towers that include requiring building managers to register the towers with the city and submit to regular testing.

A review by the Times found that Amsterdam Nursing Home was cited 7 times in the past 6 years for rules violations ranging from not conducting routine maintenance to using inadequate start-up procedures for the towers. One infraction resulted in a USD 500 fine related to record-keeping for water sample analysis, while the other 6 were dismissed after hearings.

Dozens of other nursing home in the city have also been cited for violating cooling tower regulations. The Times found that 43 nursing homes have been fined a total of USD 164 000 since 2015 and they have paid about USD 120 000 of that amount.

Jacomowitz said Amsterdam Nursing Home's cooling tower was cleaned prior to startup in the spring [2022] and tested according to the city's rules. He said the facility "continues to work closely with the Department of Health on anything having to do with the water supply and with anything at all to clear up this matter."

Jeffrey Hammond, a spokesperson for the state Department of Health, said the restrictions on water use at Amsterdam Nursing Home are recommended as a precautionary measure even though no additional Legionnaires' cases have been identified since September [2022].

"The water restrictions will remain in place until additional water culture testing for _Legionella_ has been completed and no additional cases are identified," he said.

The exact source of the outbreak at the facility has not been determined, Jacomowitz said.

[When ProMED last posted on this outbreak on 16 Sep 2022 (Legionellosis - USA (13): (NYC) fatal, nursing home 20220916.8705619), 4 people had died out of 8 cases of Legionnaires' disease at Amsterdam Nursing Home, in Morningside Heights, between June and the beginning of September 2022. In 3 cases, including 2 fatal cases, the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease had been confirmed; the other 5 cases were still suspected to be Legionnaires' disease at the time. The source of the infections in the building's west wing, where the cases lived, had not been determined. The news report above adds a 5th death, but we are told there have been no additional cases since September 2022.

Morningside Heights is a neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City, bounded by Morningside Drive/Morningside Park to the east, 125th Street to the north, and 110th Street to the south. A large portion of Morningside Heights is part of the campus of Columbia University, in addition to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Riverside Church, St. Luke's Hospital (now Mount Sinai Morningside), and Grant's Tomb. A map showing the location of Morningside Heights can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Morningside+Heights,+New+York,+NY.

_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot-water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment.

Also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _Legionella pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems, which is usually done by culture, would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of amoeba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop Legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume only sterile water until the source has been remediated.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the cases of Legionnaires' disease will help confirm if this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. We have not been told if _Legionella_ had been isolated from any environmental water sources or if genotyping has been done on any clinical or environmental _Legionella_ isolates.

More information on the outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
