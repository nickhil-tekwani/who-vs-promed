Ireland: cases of West Nile virus infection in Ireland contracted in Portugal
-----------------------------------------------
2 cases of West Nile Virus infection have been confirmed in Ireland. In
both instances, the patients had recently visited the Algarve in Portugal.
West Nile Virus usually causes mild symptoms, such as fever or skin rashes,
but can be deadly. It killed 264 in the USA in 2003. The [UK] Health
Protection Agency has warned people travelling to Europe to take measures
to avoid being bitten by infected mosquitoes.
The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes that suck the blood of infected
birds and then feed on humans. It has been found in parts of Africa,
Europe, the Middle East, Asia, as well as North America. In Europe, recent
outbreaks have occurred in Romania and Russia. The [UK] Department of
Health announced, in May 2004, that it had drawn up plans for dealing with
an outbreak of the potentially deadly West Nile virus as a precaution. The
Irish cases were confirmed, after tests on samples from the patients were
carried out at the [UK] Health Protection Agency laboratories in Porton
[Salisbury, UK].
Dr. Dilys Morgan, a Health Protection Agency West Nile Virus expert, said:
"although these are the 1st cases, that we are aware of, having been
contracted in the Algarve, there have been sporadic clusters of West Nile
Virus in a number of European countries in recent decades. However, the
risk of humans becoming infected in Europe is still thought to be very low."
Dr. Morgan stressed that West Nile Virus cannot be passed from person to
person. She said that, "80 percent of people infected will have no
symptoms; around 20 percent will have a mild, influenza-like, illness, and
only around one percent will develop a more severe disease, including
encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (inflammation of the
membrane surrounding the brain), which may produce headaches, fever, stiff
neck, sore eyes, disorientation, muscle weakness, convulsions, coma, and
other neurological features."
The Health Protection Agency advises travelers to areas where mosquitoes
are problem to: wear loose fitting, light-weight clothing that covers up
skin as much as possible; limit outdoor exposure during peak times of
mosquito feeding, usually the hours from dusk to dawn; apply insect
repellents to exposed areas; consider wearing clothes that are treated with
insecticide sprays; make sure that indoor accommodation is screened to
prevent mosquitoes from entering; consider placing insecticide-treated
netting around beds.

[West Nile virus is not transmitted from person-to-person because viremia
is low. For the same reason, competent vector mosquitoes probably rarely
transmit virus from an infected human host. It remains possible, however,
that West Nile virus could become established in Ireland, if a susceptible
avian species became infected. Antibodies to West Nile virus have been
detected in several species of wild birds in the UK, although, so far, no
infectious virus has been isolated from any wild bird. - Mod.CP]
