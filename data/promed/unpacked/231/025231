[1] Cholera - Nigeria (Ebonyi State)

No fewer than 20 people have died in a cholera outbreak in Ebonyi state, the state director, public health and disease control, in the Ministry of Health, Dr Chris Achi revealed. Speaking to newsmen in the Ebonyi state capital, Abakaliki, Dr Achi said 7 local government areas namely Ohaukwu, Izzi, Ezza North, Ishielu, Ebonyi, Abakaliki and Ohaozara have recorded the highest number of cases. He further said 1 student of the Ebonyi State University has died from the epidemic while 9 others are in the hospital after contracting the disease.

Dr Achi, who revealed that the outbreak of the disease was largely due to the villagers in the communities fetching and using water from a dirty pond, further said 15 students of the Girls High School, Azuinyiokwu, were also affected by the disease and were rushed to the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, where they were treated and discharged.

According to him, "Some of the community members have boreholes and when some of the boreholes breakdown, the people, rather than repair it, resort to pond water. Hawkers will display Suya along the road and flies perch on them and people patronize them without considering the health implication. In Abakaliki, most houses do not have toilet facilities and people defecate around the houses. This leads to disease outbreak because the same flies that perch on the faeces also perch on foods." He also attributed the death of some students to self-medication and urged the citizens to assist the state government by reporting such cases rather than resorting to self-medication.

[2] Cholera - Ghana (Brong-Ahafo Region)

Despite reports that the cholera epidemic has been restrained in the country, the Techiman Holy Family Hospital said it has recorded 30 new cholera cases with a death in the 1st quarter of 2015. The Techiman municipality [Brong-Ahafo Region] was one of the areas hit by the epidemic when it got worse in 2014.

Confirming the cases to Citi News, Dr Ernest Ameyaw, the medical director at the hospital said, though the reported cases are true, most of the cases were brought from surrounding towns with some from the municipality. Madam Hi-Sin-Ta Kumpuolo, a public nurse at the Techiman Holy Family Hospital in charge of reproductive and child health services, encouraged Ghanaians to keep their environment clean with the onset of the rainy season.

Meanwhile, the management of waste in the municipality remains a big challenge despite attempts to clear some of the "mountainous" refuse dumps in the municipality. "It is therefore important that individuals would take it upon themselves to manage the refuse they generate so as to avoid any further spread of the disease," she said.

At least 11 people have been hospitalised following an outbreak of cholera in Mombasa county. 6 are at Coast General Hospital, 4 in Mrima Hospital, Likoni, and 1 at Port Reitz Hospital. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday [15 Apr 2015], health executive Binti Omar said the county government is vaccinating residents to contain the outbreak.

"Rains and shallow wells, which are at a high risk of contamination, are causing the spread," she said. Omar urged residents to chlorinate drinking water, maintain high standards of cleanliness and eat well-cooked food.

Initially it was one of the former districts of Kenya, but in 2013 it was reconstituted as a county, on the same boundaries. It is the smallest county in Kenya, situated in the south eastern part of the former Coast Province, and can be seen on a map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombasa_County.

[4] Cholera - Malawi (Chikwawa District)

The Centre for Alternatives for Victimized Women and Children-CAVWOC has challenged health authorities in Chikwawa [District] to put in place explicit measures so that the cholera outbreak does not spread to flood survivor camps. CAVWOC's director, Joyce Phekani, made the call during a mobilization meeting with flood survivors at Jombo camp. Flood survivors were sensitized on issues including reproductive health and dangers of gender based violence. Phekani's sentiments came amid reports that villages near flood camps under chief Ngabu and Nchalo continued to register cholera cases.

Chikwawa district environmental health officer Thomson Kajombo said the district hospital had recorded 1 cholera death and the number of treated patients had increased from 98 to 192 as of Wednesday [15 Apr 2015]. "The outbreak is still causing havoc here, especially in the areas of Senior Chief Ngabu and around Nchalo Trading Centre," said Kajombo. According to Kajombo, the 1st 8 cases were Mozambican nationals who were referred to receive treatment in Malawi at Mkumaniza Health Centre. The outbreak has spread to various areas of Chikwawa including Ngowe, Kasisi and Chapananga.
