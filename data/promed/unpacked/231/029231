[Re: Strangles, canine - USA (02): (OH), RFI 20091207.4174]
-----------------------------------------------------------
We would like to make the following clarifications with respect to
the recent postings of _Streptococcus_ spp. infections in dogs and
the possibility of canine influenza virus predisposing to this. There
appears to have been some unintended errors communicated during this
correspondence, which we feel probably warrant clarification:

Canine strangles
----------------
_Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ is a bacterial (not viral as originally
transcribed from the lay report) pathogen associated with a number of
opportunistic infections of horses including respiratory disease,
keratitis, and abortion. It is however, as its name suggests, a
potentially zoonotic pathogen capable of infecting many mammalian
species, including dogs and humans. There have been a number of
documented cases of it being the aetiological agent of acute fatal
haemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs (1-3) and serious disease in humans
such as nephritis, septicemia, and meningitis (4-6). Garnett et al.
demonstrated that _S. zooepidemicus_ isolated from an infected dog
was capable of causing acute fatal haemorrhagic pneumonia in healthy
dogs, thereby fulfilling Koch's postulates (2). Furthermore,
particular _S. zooepidemicus_ strain types appear to be more capable
of causing acute fatal haemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs (7). Recently a
veterinary nurse developed severe systemic disease after being
coughed on by a dog with _S. zooepidemicus_ associated respiratory
disease (8) highlighting a not inconsequential risk to staff.
_Streptococcus equi_ (in fact an equine adapted subtype of _S.
zooepidemicus_) and the cause of equine strangles has also been
reported as the cause of upper respiratory tract disease in one dog (9).

Canine influenza
----------------
We believe the majority of naturally occurring canine influenza to be
H3N8 (rather than H3N5 as recently reported), which has been
associated originally with spillover events from horses infected with
equine H3N8 influenza virus. It is speculated that the original
spillover into greyhounds in the USA (1) and quarry hounds in the UK
(2-4) was through either ingestion of infected horse offal or close
contact between dogs with infected horses. Close contact between dogs
and horses has also been suggested as the reason for several cases of
canine H3N8 influenza during the large outbreak of equine influenza
in Australia in 2007 (5) and has been reproduced experimentally in
Japan using a closely related virus to that involved in the
Australian outbreak (6). There have been previous reports too of H3N2
infection in dogs in South Korea in 2007 (7) and experimental
reproduction of this disease in dogs has been recently reported (8).
H1N1 human pandemic influenza has also recently been reported via
ProMED-mail (Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009, animal (30): China,
canine 20091128.4079) as having been isolated from 2 dogs in China.
