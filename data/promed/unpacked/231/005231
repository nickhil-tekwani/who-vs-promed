Viet Nam begins anti-bird flu campaign
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam launched a national campaign to prevent bird flu Saturday
[30 Dec 2006] as more poultry deaths were reported in the southern
Mekong Delta. The month-long campaign aims to raise public awareness
of bird flu, disinfect poultry farms, markets and slaughter houses,
and vaccinate poultry flocks. Provincial and city administrations
are required to closely monitor the transport and trading of poultry
and poultry products and seize and destroy poultry and poultry
products of unclear origin.
Elsewhere, health animal officials in Bac Lieu province reported
Saturday [30 Dec 2006] they had culled over 600 ducks and geese with
flu symptoms. Bac Lieu is among the 3 Mekong Delta provinces along
with Hau Giang and Ca Mau that recently reported bird flu recurrence
[see Viet Nam's notification of 19 Dec 2006 at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_65.HTM#Sec10>].
Bird flu outbreaks have hit 9 districts in these provinces, killing
and prompting the culling of tens of thousands of poultry.
Animal health authorities said samples of dead poultry found in Bac
Lieu and Hau Giang provinces had tested positive for an H5 strain of
bird flu virus.
The World Bank has approved a USD 10 million grant for Viet Nam for a
program to combat bird flu.

Agriculture minister calls for action against bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Rapid and far-reaching steps must be taken to stamp out new bird flu
outbreaks in some Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta provinces to keep the
epidemic from spreading to other regions, said the country's top
farming official. Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Cao
Duc Phat made the appeal Thursday [28 Dec 2006] in a message sent to
government ministries and People's Committees in several provinces and cities.
The move comes after 2 fresh outbreaks were reported in the Cuu Long
(Mekong) Delta's Hau Giang Province [map at
<http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap/hagiang.html>]. Bird flu
has spread to 10 communes in 3 provinces, including Bac Lieu and Ca
Mau since earlier this month [December 2006]. The outbreak was the
1st in about a year.
Most of the birds that died from the H5N1 virus were young ducks that
had not been vaccinated.
The minister asked chairmen of provincial and municipal People's
Committees to immediately reinstate local level steering committees
designed to contain avian flu. Officials should rally local
authorities and social organizations, Phat said, to supervise the
epidemics, raise public awareness and carry out preventive measures
in each household. Each commune should be allocated at least one
animal health official to regularly help local residents prevent and
control the epidemics, Phat said. In case localities face
difficulty, they should urgently report to the national steering
committee before coming to the Prime Minister for solutions, the
message stated. "They should not ignore the problem because of
financial shortages," Phat said. The message pointed out dangers of
underestimating the disease, especially for farmers who do not report
problems with their poultry. The minister called for a home-to-home
surveillance campaign in the next 2 months to quickly detect and
control possible outbreaks.
The Animal Health Department said it has planned to import an
additional 25 million doses of H5N1 vaccines and 4.5 million doses of
H5N9 vaccines from China for domestic waterfowl. The agriculture
ministry has recently decided to inoculate white-winged ducks (ngan)
[see comment] with H5N1 vaccines. Currently, only ducks and chickens
receive the vaccines against avian flu.

[According to the website "Birds of East Asia & Mainland Southeast
Asia" (Glossary of Species Names in Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese; see
<http://www.cjvlang.com/Birds/duck.html>),
the following terminology applies to ducks in Vietnamese:
"The general word for 'duck' is Vit. Wild ducks are known as Vit troi
(wild duck) or Vit nuoc (water duck), also called variously Mong ket,
Le, Le le, and Le te. The latter are used for several types of teal.
The word ngan is used for the white-winged duck or wood duck,
_Cairina scutulata_, and other members of the genus."
For a picture and additional information on _Cairina scutulata_, see

Reportedly, ngan is one of the 3 local duck breeds raised in southern
Viet Nam (the others are Co Lun and Sen); see Table 3 in the paper
"Biodiversity Approach In Poultry Breeding In Viet Nam" by Duong
Thanh Liem, available at
