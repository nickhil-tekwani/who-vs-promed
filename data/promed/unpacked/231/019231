Whirling Disease in New York State Trout
----------------------------------------------
Whirling disease has wiped out about a third of the rainbow trout the state
planned to stock next spring in waterways throughout New York. The disease
was detected at state-run fish hatcheries in Randolph, Cattaraugus County,
and in Chateaugay, Franklin County.
About 175 000 fish were destroyed because of the infection. State policies
prohibit the stocking of fish with whirling disease.
The parasitic disease causes fish contracting it to swim erratically. They
can also suffer skeletal deformities. Trout and salmon species are affected
by the disease, and domestic strains of rainbow trout are especially
susceptible to the illness.
There is no known health hazard to humans who consume fish infected with
the whirling disease parasite. The commissioner of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation (DEC), John Cahill, credited "aggressive fish
monitoring'' at the agency's fish pathology laboratory with catching the
disease before more damage was done.
The precise way the infection was introduced into the fish population is
unknown, DEC spokeswoman Jennifer Post said. Scientists believe the
outbreak occurred at the Randolph hatchery -- possibly when an animal who
had been exposed to diseased fish passed the infection on to the hatchery
fish, she said. The infected fish discovered at Chateaugay had been
shipped from Randolph, Post said.
DEC officials estimated the value of the destroyed fish at about $60
000. The dead fish were fall fingerlings, about 6 inches long. In 1994
and 1995, about 650 000 brown and rainbow trout had to be destroyed at 4
state-run hatcheries because of a whirling disease outbreak. DEC
biologists have recommended about 2.15 million brook, brown and rainbow
trout be stocked next spring. About 30 percent of the rainbow trout have
been lost to whirling disease. Officials said the overall total of trout
for stocking will likely fall by about 10 percent due to the outbreak.
