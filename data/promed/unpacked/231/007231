MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE - USA (MICHIGAN): ALERT
*********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Gillian Stoltman <StoltmanG@state.mi.us>

A case of _Neisseria meningitidis_ [infection] has been diagnosed in a
young woman who attended a Rave party near Hoags Lake, in Mason County,
Michigan over the past weekend (18 Aug to 20 Aug 2000). It has been
reported that there was [a] considerable amount of drinking and sharing of
a pacifier which had been dipped in the drug "ecstasy". There also appeared
to have been a considerable amount of close contact between the young woman
and many of the other attendees at the party. However, the young woman is
unable to identify all potential contacts. It is not known where the 700 -
1000 attendees came from, although it is assumed that most of them came
from Michigan. Known contacts have been received prophylaxis. Many of the
attendees have not told their parents that they attended the party. It
does appear that communications take place between the teens through an
internet chat room, and an item has been placed in the chat room, informing
them about the situation and to seek medical treatment if they show any
symptoms or signs of illness. Because of the difficulty of identifying
contacts and the apparent extensive contact that the young woman had, it is
recommended that any attendee receive [antibiotic] prophylaxis
(ciprofloxacin or rifampin).
