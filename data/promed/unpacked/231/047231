- In week 48/2014, influenza activity remained low across the WHO European Region.

- 14 countries reported sporadic influenza activity, and 6 reported increasing trends in consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI).

- Of the 889 specimens tested from sentinel ILI and ARI sources from 31 countries, 29 (3 percent) from 12 countries tested positive for influenza virus. At present, most circulating viruses are A(H3N2) and influenza B- The number of hospitalized laboratory-confirmed influenza cases increased from the previous week, with 2 countries reporting a total of 13 cases for week 48/2014. All were admitted to intensive care units.

- Although sporadic influenza virus detections were reported in an increasing number of countries, there is no indication that the influenza season has started in the region, which is normal for this time of year.

- No indications of increased mortality have been reported through the European monitoring of excess mortality for public health action project (EuroMOMO http://www.euromomo.eu).

External news
----------
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that less than 50 percent of the A(H3N2) viruses characterised during this season showed a good match with the current A(H3N2) component of the seasonal influenza vaccine (http://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00374.asp).

Primary care data
-------------------
37 of the 46 countries submitting data on qualitative indicators reported low intensity of influenza activity for week 48/2014; one (Azerbaijan) reported medium intensity. 14 countries reported sporadic influenza activity, the Netherlands, regional spread. Six countries (Azerbaijan, Belarus, Poland, the Russian Federation, Spain and the United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland)), mostly in the eastern part of the European Region, reported increasing influenza activity, while the remainder reported stable or decreasing trends. Increasing ILI and ARI rates were observed in most countries, but these remained below the epidemic threshold.

In week 48/2014, 889 sentinel specimens were tested across 31 countries, with 29 influenza virus detections (3 percent) reported by 12 countries; 15 were of type A and 14 of type B. 12 of the influenza A viruses were subtyped; 2 were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 10 were A(H3N2). Two of the 14 B viruses were of the B/Yamagata lineage.

Over the 1st 9 weeks of the weekly reporting period for the 2014/2015 influenza season, influenza viruses have been detected in 125 (2 percent) of 5410 sentinel system specimens. 78 (62 percent) were positive for type A influenza virus: 54 (69 percent) A(H3N2), 10 (13 percent) A(H1N1)pdm09 and 14 (18 percent) un-subtyped. 47 (38 percent) were positive for type B influenza virus; the lineage was determined for 9 of these viruses; 2 were B/Victoria lineage and 7 B/Yamagata lineage.

In sentinel specimens tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 29 in 6 countries were positive, and 827 specimens from other sources were found to be positive in 16 countries. In the previous week, 30 positive specimens were reported from sentinel testing and 760 from other sources.

Virus characteristics
-----------------
Since week 40/2014, 20 antigenic characterizations of influenza viruses have been reported: 3 A(H1N1)pdm09 were A/California/7/2009-like, 10 A(H3N2) were A/Texas/50/2012-like, 3 were B/Massachusetts/02/2012 and 2 B/Wisconsin/1/2010 (both B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage).

42 viruses have been genetically characterized, 40 belonging to the A(H3N2) A/Texas/50/2012 subgroup (3C) and 2 belonging to the B/Wisconsin/1/2010 clade.

Most of the viruses that have been characterized to date are similar to those included in the vaccines currently recommended by WHO. The September 2014 virus characterization report of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) offers more details on viruses with collection dates since 31 Jan 2014.

Three influenza A(H3N2) and 3 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses underwent phenotypic test for neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility. All were normally inhibited by oseltamivir and zanamivir.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that less than 50 percent of the A(H3N2) viruses characterised during this season showed a good match with the current A(H3N2) component of the seasonal influenza vaccine (http://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00374.asp).

[The European influenza data are very similar to those published so far for North America in terms of antigenic characteristics and response to neuraminidase inhibitors. No novel antigenic types have made an appearance, and those isolated so far are well-matched by the components of the current Northern hemisphere vaccine now available for use. No European data have been published so far comparable to the US data suggesting that less than 50 percent of the A(H3N2) viruses characterised during this season so far have shown a good match with the current A(H3N2) component of the current vaccine (http://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00374.asp). It remains to be seen whether this will be a general phenomenon and enhance the proportion of patients suffering from H3N2 virus infection. - Mod.CP]
