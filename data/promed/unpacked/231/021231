A 90-year-old nursing home patient died from stomach flu last year
[2006], marking the 1st time US health officials confirmed that the
highly contagious bug is sometimes fatal. The North Carolina woman so
far is the only person for whom lab tests confirmed norovirus as the
killer, but health officials believe the virus killed at least 18
others and caused thousands of illnesses late last year [2006].
Noroviruses are a group of viruses that cause stomach flu, or
gastroenteritis. They also are sometimes called Norwalk-like viruses.
Health officials don't systematically count and diagnose norovirus
cases. But last winter [2006-2007] seemed to be particularly nasty,
with more than 1300 outbreaks reported in 24 states, according to the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
In the outbreaks 2 new strains of norovirus were identified and may
have driven the heavy caseloads, according to an article this week in
a CDC publication, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [see
ProMED-mail "Norovirus activity, 2006-2007 - USA 20070824.2779". - Mod.CP]
It isn't known which strains caused the deaths, said Jackie Tate, a
CDC investigator who co-authored the article. In recent years, cruise
ships have become famous norovirus carriers, with several large
outbreaks grabbing headlines. But nursing homes and other long-term
care facilities were the scene of many of last winter's [2006-2007]
outbreaks, she said.
Proof that the virus killed the North Carolina patient is significant
but not surprising, said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the
department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. "It is
likely norovirus has been responsible for at least some fatal
infections in the past," Schaffner said.
The virus is particularly dangerous for the very old, the frail, and
the very young, he added. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and stomach cramping. Some people also suffer a low-grade
fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness. The illness
often begins suddenly, but in most people symptoms last only one or 2 days.
There's no good treatment for norovirus. Doctors usually advise
drinking fluids and try to treat the symptoms, Tate said. The virus
is spread through food, personal contact, and touching contaminated
surfaces. It's not clear how the virus spread in many of the nursing
home settings, Tate said.
