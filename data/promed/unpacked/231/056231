Volunteers and biologists walking the beaches of northwestern Michigan's Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore the past few days have counted nearly 300 dead or dying loons and other fish-eating birds -- all victims of botulism that has scientists concerned about the changing ecology of the Great Lakes.

"This last couple days has been off the charts," said Dan Ray, a biologist in charge of a project monitoring the botulism among fish-eating birds at the park. "I'm sitting here looking at our graph and for the loons, this appears to be one of the worst seasons."

Strong southwest and northwest winds in recent weeks explain why the dead loons are coming ashore, possibly from many miles into Lake Michigan.

The death of loons -- with their haunting 2-note cry and striking looks -- gets the public nervous, too, Ray said. "It's almost strange from a biologist's standpoint," he said. "When loons show up (dead), people freak out."

On Tuesday [16 Oct 2012], Ray walked 2 1/2 miles [4 km] of shoreline near the mouth of the Platte River with Eleanor Comings, one of the volunteers, and found 88 dead birds, mostly loons. On Wednesday [17 Oct 2012], Comings walked the same stretch and found 22 more loons.

After seeing today's story in the Free Press and on freep.com, several people have reported more dead birds, including loons. Calls and emails came from as far south as Onekema and as far north as Charlevoix.

Bernie Misko, who has a home on Lake Michigan about 3 miles [4.8 km] north of the Portage Lake channel, said he found 5 loons on Tuesday [16 Oct 2012] while walking along the beach.

"One of them had coyote tracks walking up to it and around it, but it didn't bother" the carcass, Misko said.

The botulism issue, long a problem in southern US reservoirs, 1st was a significant concern in Lake Michigan in 2006, Ray said, and was a problem again in 2007, but has been mostly in check the last few years. In 2011, only about 40 loons succumbed on the beaches of the national lakeshore, which Ray said seems to be like the end of a funnel where infected birds from northern Lake Michigan wash ashore.

Many of the birds are migratory, coming from Ontario, the Upper Peninsula, and Wisconsin, as well as from northern Michigan, biologists said.

[It is not clear from the text if botulism was confirmed as the cause of death. Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Spores of these bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. In the past, loon die-offs caused by type E botulism have been reported in the Great Lakes.
