The mysterious disease that has affected deer in Kent County has been
determined. State veterinarians say it is eastern equine encephalitis
(EEE), sometimes found in horses but identified only once before in wild
whitetails in the United States. In recent weeks, residents of the south
west Michigan county have reported seeing deer stagger, drool, grow thin,
and lose fear of humans before dying.
The state Department of Natural Resources said its veterinarians and
researchers at Michigan State University have confirmed eastern equine
encephalitis in 2 deer from Kent County and have 2 more suspect cases at
the DNR laboratory in Lansing. The state Agriculture Department recently
confirmed the disease in 3 horses, 2 of them in Kent.
Human cases of the mosquitoborne disease are rare, DNR veterinarian Dan
O'Brien said on Friday [23 Sep 2005]. The disease typically is transmitted
from mosquitoes to songbirds, which aren't affected by it, he said.
"Horses are sometimes infected, but the levels of the virus in a horse are
much lower than birds," O'Brien said. "That's why few people get the
disease from contact with horses."
Last month [August 2005], people around Townsend Park near Grand Rapids
began seeing deer that acted strangely and died. Several said they saw
emaciated deer staggering, walking into trees and buildings, and ignoring
people who walked up to them.
The DNR's veterinarians reacted quickly, because the symptoms were similar
to those in chronic wasting disease, a malady 1st seen in Colorado in 1967.
It's fatal in deer, although it has not infected people. The state
veterinarians didn't think the Kent County outbreak was chronic wasting
disease, but they were concerned because, as veterinarian Steve Schmitt
said, "there's something out there, and I can't put an "it is..." on it."
O'Brien said a scientific journal reported last January about the only
other known case of eastern equine encephalitis in wild deer, a single
animal found in Georgia in 2001. "The new thing about this is that it's in
the deer," O'Brien said. "It's not a new disease." The chances the disease
will spread should decrease dramatically "after we get a couple of frosts,
and the mosquitoes are knocked back," he said.
Even if deer are seen staggering, a cluster of animals with similar
symptoms doesn't mean they all have the same disease, O'Brien said. Of 6
deer tested from Kent County, 4 had eastern equine encephalitis, and 2 died
of other ailments.
A DNR news release about the outbreak included this statement: "Hunters and
the general public should not dispatch any deer that they suspect might be
infected with EEE, but instead, report abnormally behaving deer to the DNR
immediately. It is critical that these deer be properly euthanized to
preserve organs for testing. Timely and proper collection of deer specimens
is crucial to accurate diagnosis."
Though the risk of infection in humans is low, the DNR and state Health
Department said one human case of eastern equine encephalitis was
documented in Michigan in 2002. It's possible to get the disease if
infected matter from a deer's brain or spinal cord gets in the eyes, lungs
or open wounds.
As a precaution, the DNR said hunters should not eat or handle any deer
that appears sick or acts abnormally, and hunters should avoid contact with
brain or spinal tissue when gutting deer or removing the antlers. Hunters
shouldn't take antlers from deer that appeared to be sick or acting
strangely. Hunters should use handsaws rather than power saws to remove
racks from deer and wear safety glasses and rubber or latex gloves when
field-dressing them.
The DNR also recommends that hunters bone out carcasses, leaving the head
and spine intact, wash their hands with soap and water after handling
carcasses and before and after handling meat, and disinfect equipment and
work surfaces with a solution of one tablespoon of bleach to a gallon of water.

[Although the clinical signs are suggestive of chronic wasting disease and
not necessarily suggestive of epizootic hemorrhagic disease, it is a bit
unexpected for the diagnosis to be EEE. Lesions of CWD are relatively
distinct on pathology; it also makes one wonder whether there has been any
EEE testing in animals confirmed with CWD. - Mod.TG]
