Remove diseased raspberry canes; 'cane disease' is the most important
infection in this fruit crop. Amongst healthy, vigorous shoots, canes
are found which have produced few or no shoots. Leaves and flowers on
these canes will die prematurely. The bark cracks, flakes off, and
turns silvery-grey. The disease is caused by the fungi _Didymella
applanata_ and _Leptosphaeria coniothyrium_, says the Agriculture
Department of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The most important actions in spring are culture methods to regulate
moisture, as well as continuous pruning of affected canes. Only 6 to
8 bearing canes per meter should remain. Disease control with
fungicides is not possible. Nutrient applications may increase the
resistance of the plants.

[Cane blight caused by _Leptosphaeria coniothyrium_ and spur blight
caused by _Didymella applanata_ are 2 different diseases affecting
raspberries and related bramble crops (_Rubus_ species). Cane blight
symptoms include brown or grey areas around pruning or other wounds;
branches suddenly wilt and die above the blighted area. Spur blight
symptoms include brown areas at the nodes of young canes; eventually
the bark may split lengthwise.

The 2 fungi have different disease cycles but often occur together on
the same cane, as reported above from Germany. Infected canes are
generally weak and more susceptible to cold damage during winter. The
fungi overwinter in infected canes. Spores are spread to new canes
during spring by splashing rain or overhead irrigation. Disease
management for the fungi includes use of disease free planting stock,
cultural measures and removal of pathogen reservoirs. Crop varieties
with reduced levels of sensitivity are available, although some of
these are in turn more susceptible to other fungal diseases.
