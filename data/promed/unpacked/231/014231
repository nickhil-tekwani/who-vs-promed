Between 16 and 22 Oct 2020, EU Member States reported 7 human cases of WNV [West Nile virus] infection: Greece (5), Spain (1), and the Netherlands (1). All cases, except the case in the Netherlands, were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. This week no deaths were reported. No human cases of WNV infection or deaths were reported from EU neighbouring countries.

Since the start of the 2020 transmission season and as of 22 Oct 2020, EU Member States have reported 306 human cases of WNV infection and 34 deaths through TESSy: Greece (142, including 20 deaths), Spain (76, including 7 deaths), Italy (65, including 5 deaths), Germany (12), Romania (6, including 1 death), Hungary (3), Bulgaria (1, including 1 death), and the Netherlands (1).

The province of Pazardzhik in Bulgaria, the province of Badajoz in Spain, the region of Utrecht in the Netherlands, and 5 regions in Germany (regions of Barnim, Ostprignitz-Ruppin, Saalekreis, Halle (Saale), and Meissen) reported locally acquired human cases of WNV infection for the 1st time. All other cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. No cases have been reported from EU neighbouring countries.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 173 outbreaks among equids have been reported. These outbreaks have been reported by Spain (131), Germany (20), Italy (12), France (5), Portugal (2), Austria (2), and Hungary (1) through the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS). Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 2 outbreaks among birds have been reported through ADNS, both by Bulgaria.

Between 30 Oct and 5 Nov 2020, EU Member States reported 7 human cases of WNV infection: the Netherlands (5), Spain (1), and Germany (1). These cases were reported from areas that have already been affected during the current and/or previous transmission seasons. This week no deaths were reported. EU neighbouring countries reported 17 human cases of WNV infection; all were reported by Israel.

Since the start of the 2020 transmission season and as of 5 Nov 2020, EU Member States have reported 315 human cases of WNV infection, including 36 deaths, through TESSy: Greece (143, including 22 deaths), Spain (77, including 7 deaths), Italy (66, including 5 deaths), Germany (13), Romania (6, including 1 death), the Netherlands (6), Hungary (3), and Bulgaria (1, including 1 death). The province of Pazardzhik in Bulgaria, the province of Badajoz in Spain, the region of Utrecht in the Netherlands, and 5 regions in Germany (Barnim, Ostprignitz-Ruppin, Saalekreis, Halle (Saale), and Meissen) reported locally acquired human cases of WNV infection for the 1st time.

[West Nile virus (WNV) infection represents a serious burden to human and animal health worldwide because of the capacity of the virus to disperse quickly and adapt to a large variety of environments, causing large epidemics. In Europe, the virus was detected for the 1st time in 1958 in Albania and sporadically recorded until 1996, when a major outbreak of infection occurred in Romania, characterised by a high fatality rate (10%) with 393 confirmed cases.

Since then there has been a continuous increase and spread of reported WNV cases in humans and horses across Europe. This can partly be attributed to improved surveillance and diagnostic capacities, but also to the introduction and establishment of WNV lineage 2 strains, which have been responsible for major outbreaks in central European and eastern Mediterranean countries such as Greece, Serbia, Italy, Hungary, and Austria.

In 2018, an extraordinary increase in human cases of WNV across the EU/EEA and neighbouring countries was observed, with the total number of human infections (n=2083) far exceeding the total for the previous 7 years (n=1832). Furthermore, the distribution of the virus expanded northwards, with the 1st equine outbreak reported in Germany in 2018, followed by autochthonous human cases in 2019. This unprecedented rise in disease incidence, combined with the rapidly growing geographic expansion of the virus, indicates the urgent need for an increased capacity to address and contain the threat across Europe.

ECDC has published a detailed technical report titled "Vector control practices and strategies against West Nile virus" on 6 Nov 2020, which is available at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/vector-control-practices-and-strategies-against-west-nile-virus. This report aims to identify and evaluate the operational challenges each country in Europe is facing in implementing vector control and to prioritise the needs to be addressed in order to facilitate national public health authorities in developing and/or enhancing their national WNV response capacities. In addition, existing knowledge and operational experience on the effectiveness of vector control practices in reducing WNV risk was collated through a scoping literature review. - Mod.UBA
