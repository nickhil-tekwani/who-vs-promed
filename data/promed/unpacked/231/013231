Tea plantations affected by disease
-----------------------------------
A disease [that is] spreading in tea plantations in the Southern Province has affected the harvest. Head of the Federation of Tea Small Holders' Associations, Lal Premanath, says the disease, named as Deniyaya [Matara District] disease, has caused a significant drop of income of the tea growers.

He pointed out that around 35 000 small holder families are engaged in the industry in Deniyaya and that swift action is needed. He said that the Tea Research Institute [of Sri Lanka], Deniyaya [Extension Centre] has not taken steps to control the disease.

The Institute said the disease is not new and has been reported [from] time to time since 1995. They said that measures have been taken to control the disease.

[Tea (_Camellia sinensis_) can be affected by a number of fungal, a few bacterial, and several nematode pathogens causing diseases of leaves, stems and roots. The most important leaf disease in tea cultivation in Southeast Asia is blister blight (caused by the fungus _Exobasidium vexans_), but it has been present in Sri Lanka since long before 1995, so it does not seem likely to be the problem referred to above.

We would be most grateful for any additional information on this outbreak.
