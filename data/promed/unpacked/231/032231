A German woman, aged 34 years, returned on 27 Feb [2018] from a holiday trip in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro/Ilha Grande). On 26 Feb 2018, she developed a fever, severe headache, and flu-like symptoms. On 2 Mar 2018, I examined her, and the lab showed markedly increased values for ASAT/ALAT (over 1400 U/l), leucopenia, and a moderate thrombocytopenia. Bilirubin was normal, therefore, no jaundice. Serology for dengue, hepatitis A/B/C/E were negative. Yellow fever virus RT-PCR PS carried out at the BNI in Hamburg was positive.

The patient recovered completely, meanwhile.

From travel history and incubation period, it is most likely that she acquired the virus on Ilha Grande.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Weigand for sending in this case report. Fortunately, his patient survived her infection and has recovered completely, which has not been the case for several foreign travelers to Ilha Grande, Brazil.

This is the 2nd case of a German citizen who became infected with yellow fever virus in Brazil. There have been several other European travelers this year (2018) who also have become infected there. A Dutch man, aged 46 years, who traveled to Sao Paulo state for 3 weeks during December 2017-January 2018 was infected. The 2nd case occurred in a French woman, aged 42 years, who traveled to Minas Gerais state in Brazil for 4 weeks during December 2017-January 2018. The 3rd and 4th cases occurred in a Romanian man, aged 34 years, and a Swiss man, aged 44 years, each of whom visited Brazil for approximately 2 weeks in February 2018. The 5th case was in a German man, aged 33 years, who spent a week in Brazil in late February 2018. The Swiss and German travelers died from their illnesses. Among the 10 international travelers reported with yellow fever acquired in Brazil, 8 acquired the disease on Ilha Grande, a forested island off the Rio de Janeiro coast, where one human and one nonhuman primate yellow fever case were reported in early February 2018. Of the 8 patients who acquired the disease on Ilha Grande, 4 died (Hamer DH, Angelo K, Caumes E, et al. Fatal yellow fever in travelers to Brazil, 2018. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 16 Mar 2018.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6711e1).

These cases underscore the need for individuals traveling to YF endemic areas to be vaccinated at least 10 days before arrival and illustrate the risk of international spread of the virus. Fortunately, these European travelers returned to areas where vector mosquitoes were not present, with no risk of ongoing transmission.
