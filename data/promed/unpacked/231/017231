Disease threatens Brazil's orange crop
------------------------------------------
Brazil's Agriculture Ministry has taken drastic steps to halt the
spread of citrus huanglongbing (HLB), a dangerous disease that could
destroy millions of orange trees in the world's largest
orange-producing country. First detected in Brazil in March 2004, it
has spread by tree psyllids to 46 districts. CG has already killed
millions of trees in Thailand and South Africa, and the only way to
control it is to uproot trees.
The Agriculture Ministry issued an Executive Order (EO) that requires
growers to pull up any infected orange trees and hedgerows, the
natural habitats of the insect, [and also] requires growers in
orange-growing districts to pull up ornamental plants in urban areas.
The EO also ordered that saplings be grown only in roofed
greenhouses, has prohibited transportation of saplings without
certification, and introduced mandatory annual inspections of healthy
groves and twice-yearly inspection of infected groves.
Growers are obliged to notify authorities on discovering the disease
and have 15 days to pull up plants. Should they not comply with the
EO, local authorities will do it for them.
In extreme cases where growers obstruct eradication, producers could
be liable for up to 5 years in prison.
Citrus greening is currently concentrated in the Araraquara region of
Sao Paulo state but has spread north and south. The incidence of CG
remains very low but is rising. Trees infected with CG become stunted
and produce small, inedible fruit.
In 2005, the Sao Paulo orange crop will total 354.3 million 41-kg
boxes, down slightly from the year before.

[Citrus is one of the most important fruit crops in the Asian and
Pacific region. Unfortunately, most citrus orchards are now suffering
severe losses from bacteria-like citrus greening ("huanglongbing" or
HLB). There is no effective control of HLB. Trees gradually decline
in vigor and yield, and eventually die. The best control for HLB is
exclusion. In areas where HLB has been established, management to
reduce losses include propagation of HLB-free trees for planting,
reduction of the psyllids populations by removing species which
continually flush, application of insecticides when threshold
population levels are attained, and by pruning symptomatic sectors
from the trees. Use of parasites to control psyllid populations has
been successful in Reunion and some other areas. Before the
development of shoot tip-grafting methods to eliminate
graft-transmissible pathogens, budwood was therapeutically treated at
an elevated temperature, up to 60 deg C, for a few minutes before
propagating. - Mod.DH]
