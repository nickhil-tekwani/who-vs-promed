Velay A, Solis M, Kack-Kack W, Gantner P, Maquart M, Martinot M, et al. A new hot spot for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE): A marked increase of TBE cases in France in 2016.

Abstract
OBJECTIVES:
Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a zoonotic agent causing severe encephalitis. In 2016, in Northeastern France, we faced a TBEV infection increase, leading to a warning from the Regional Health Agency. Here, we report the confirmed TBE cases diagnosed between January 2013 and December 2016, with particular emphasis on the year 2016.

METHODS:
A total of 1643 blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from everywhere in France, corresponding to 1460 patients, were prospectively tested for anti-TBEV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA. Additional 39 blood and CSF samples from patients with suspected Lyme neuroborreliosis were retrospectively investigated.

RESULTS:
The TBEV seropositivity rate was estimated to 5.89 percent and 54 patients were diagnosed as TBE-confirmed cases. A significant increase in TBE cases was observed during the year 2016 with 29 confirmed cases, instead of a mean of 8 cases during the 3 previous years (p=0.0006). There were 6 imported cases and 48 autochthonous cases, located in the Alsace region (n=43) and in the Alpine region (n=5) were reported. Of these, 46 patients experienced neurological impairment and 9 patients showed an incomplete recovery at last follow-up (from 15 days to 8 months post-infection). TBE diagnosis was performed earlier for patients taken in charge in the Alsace region than those hospitalized elsewhere in France (p=0.0087). Among the 39 patients with suspected Lyme neuroborreliosis retrospectively investigated, one showed a TBEV recent infection.

CONCLUSION:
The TBE increase that occurred in France in 2016 highlights the need to improve our knowledge about the true burden of TBEV infection and subsequent long-term outcomes.

[There is an earlier report this year (2017) of a patient, presumably from France (see Tick-borne encephalitis - France 20170630.5141304). Although that is the 1st report of a tick-borne encephalitis case that ProMED-mail has posted for France, the above report indicates that there have been many cases of TBE in France over the past 3 years, and especially last year (2016). This is not surprising because the virus is widely distributed across Europe with many cases reported in Germany and Switzerland recently.

The TBE-infected individuals in the above report were from northeastern France, provinces adjacent to Germany and Switzerland, countries in which TBE is endemic, and many human cases occur. The WHO states: "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of TBE are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious" http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/

Tickborne encephalitis is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
