Regarding the article [archive number: 20111120.3480] published by
ProMED on 29 Nov 2011, the government of Japan reports as follows and
requests ProMED to post this information.

>From the article heading mentioned above, it seems that the 37th case
of BSE in a cow was confirmed in Japan. However, it is not a fact that
the government of Japan has reported or announced a 37th positive case
of BSE in a cow.

In Japan, 36 cases of BSE in cows have been confirmed as of now, and
the latest case of BSE is the 101-month-old cow announced on 30 Jan
2009.

In Japan, no BSE case has been confirmed since the 36th case in
January 2009.

[ProMED-mail published, on 29 Nov 2011, a retraction of the
media-derived information on a 37th BSE case in Japan, expressing
regret at the recycling of a piece of information on an atypical BSE
case in a 23-month-old bullock that dated, in fact, back to 2003
(archived post 20111129.3485).

The current official announcement by the Japanese government is
appreciated and gratefully acknowledged.

Japan's BSE history was briefly reviewed in the commentary to posting 20111129.3480.

Since the detection of the 1st case of BSE in Japan, in September
2001, tests on over 10 million cattle led to the detection of 35
additional cases, the last one in January 2009. Subscribers may refer
to a recent paper (Ref. 1), which addresses models developed to
explore the possible source of introduction of BSE into Japan,
evaluate the effectiveness of control measures, estimate the
prevalence of BSE in different birth cohorts, predict a future BSE
epidemic, and simulate the impact of changes in surveillance
strategies.
