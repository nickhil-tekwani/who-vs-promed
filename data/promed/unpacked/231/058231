[This is the 1st time HPAI subtype H5N6 has been identified in Nigeria and may be the 1st detection on the African continent. It would be interesting to know the sequence of this subtype to determine if this H5N6 is the same strain that has been circulating in China, the strain circulating in Europe, or a new H5N6 strain.

According to OIE's latest information, "HPAI H5N6 viruses 1st emerged in China in 2013 and have been reported by several Asian countries. The Asian lineage H5N6 causes severe clinical signs in poultry and associated mortality. The outbreaks in these countries have led to significant destruction of poultry for control measures by the veterinary authorities. This group of H5N6 viruses has also been associated with human infection, including a number of deaths. A total of 19 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A (H5N6) virus, including 6 deaths, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014."

"In 2017 - 2018, a new variant strain of HPAI H5N6 emerged and caused multiple outbreaks in poultry and wild birds of Asian and European countries. Many of these outbreaks are now resolved, and only a few outbreaks are currently reported in comparison to the previous events. These viruses are different from the H5N6 viruses associated with the human infections in China. Detection of this new strain of H5N6 virus in migratory bird species poses a potential threat for the dissemination of this virus by wild birds within and outside Asia and Europe."
