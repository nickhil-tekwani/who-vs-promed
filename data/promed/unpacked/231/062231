The Chinese mainland reported 13 146 local COVID-19 cases on Sunday [3 Apr 2022], including 1455 confirmed and 11 691 asymptomatic ones, the highest number of daily increases since the latest outbreak, which has already infected over 100 000 people.

While one of the severest-hit regions in north east China's Jilin Province successfully curbed the epidemic, the infection curve has not seen signs of decline, and a new omicron variant mutation was detected in East China's Jiangsu Province, neighboring Shanghai, where the mass majority of cases in China have been found in recent days.

Shanghai, in particular, reported 438 local confirmed and 7788 asymptomatic cases on Sunday [3 Apr 2022]. Chinese vice premier, Sun Chunlan, on Saturday [2 Apr 2022] made an official visit to the city to help battle the virus. Sun stressed that the dynamic zero-COVID strategy must be upheld with resolute and swift action, while recognizing the enormous challenges that the mega city of 25 million faces in both maintaining the normal operation of its core functions and battling the omicron variant outbreak.

"Even with the omicron variant, as long as we take proactive measures, it still can be brought under control," said Zhang Boli, an academician from the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of the Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), adding that the high percentage of asymptomatic cases in the current epidemic outbreak is due to the characteristics of the variant itself, but is also tied to the speedy mass testing rollout. Zhang also noted that the increase in vaccination rates among residents has boosted herd immunity against the virus, and those who get infected will show lighter or no symptoms. As of Sunday [3 Apr 2022], the Chinese mainland had administered a total of over 3.27 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine, according to health officials.

Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Friday [1 Apr 2022] that the reason China reports more asymptomatic cases and fewer severe cases is not the result of the characteristics of omicron, as foreign countries are reporting even more deaths caused by omicron than with delta. "It is the result of our effective epidemic-prevention work, namely the early identification of the epidemic, timely response, and the whole-process management for all infected people, including the asymptomatic cases, giving them traditional Chinese medicine to improve their immunity and prevent severe infection," Wu said.

If more asymptomatic cases are to be discovered as the epidemic progresses, there is a possibility that the asymptomatic cases who meet the quarantine conditions can be quarantined at their own homes, Chen Erzhen, the deputy head of Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai, said in an interview with the People's Daily on Friday [1 Apr 2022]. Wu said that epidemic control would be more challenging for a city when infections exceed 10 000 within a short period. For one thing, more patients need to be treated, and greater quantities of close contacts need to be quarantined; for another thing, medical staff are put under increased pressure. However, he believed that the Chinese tradition of helping others in need will help regions win this hard battle eventually.

With Shanghai's hospital system on the verge of being overwhelmed, medical teams and supplies from across the country are flooding in to help fight the outbreak, with thousands of medical workers coming from neighboring provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to assist in nucleic acid testing and the building of makeshift hospitals among other epidemic prevention tasks. Apart from medical supplies, food and other daily necessities are being sent to Shanghai to ensure local residents maintain a state of normality. A total of 10 regions from across China had come to the aid of Shanghai as of Sunday [3 Apr 2022].

Shanghai has distributed antigen self-testing kits to help with citywide screening. Local infectious disease expert Zhang Wenhong said that through the antigen test, authorities can acquire the basic infection data and contain parts of the infection sources so that they can prevent the transmission in a timely manner. To conduct antigen tests aside from the nucleic acid test can also boost the efficiency, he said.

Suzhou in East China's Jiangsu Province, which borders Shanghai, discovered a confirmed coronavirus disease patient infected with a mutation VOC/omicron variant BA.1.1, unidentified in previously found strains worldwide, posing new threats to the already-dangerous situation in the region. Another region hard-hit by the epidemic, Jilin Province, has seen little sign of improvement, recording 4455 cases on Sunday [3 Apr 2022]. Jilin city announced on Sunday that it had successfully curbed the virus.

"...The lockdowns are also laying bare Shanghai's social inequalities. Affluent residential compounds have been able to organize private food deliveries, yet the city's migrant workers and homeless population struggle to find shelter or testing.

"'A lot of them don't even have an ID card, so they cannot register themselves for the PCR test, which is connected to cell phones,' said Jimmy McWhinney, the co-founder of Renewal, a project to help homeless people in Shanghai.

"'Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease,' said Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases professor and research director at Duke NUS medical school in Singapore. 'Lockdowns come with a price. The health of the population is more than just the absence of COVID.'

"Prominent health experts are calling for a clearer roadmap in China for eventually easing restrictions and living with an endemic COVID through higher vaccination rates among the elderly, with more efficacious mRNA vaccines.

"Gabriel Leung, a Hong Kong epidemiologist and public health adviser, urged the city to embrace a more flexible approach to containing the virus. 'That we move toward an endemic disease using the safest way, or we do so by cutting all and every transmission [chain], it is a matter of time,' he said at a press conference last week.

"In an essay widely circulated in China (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/u-SqQPCiu5DA-e_j1pspCg), Zuo-Feng Zhang, a professor of epidemiology of University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), suggested China put mild COVID cases into home isolation rather than centralized quarantine at a government facility that sends people to stay in, for example, storage containers or stadiums, and to import foreign-made COVID vaccines and treatments. Currently, China has only approved domestically made vaccines which do not perform as well in preventing infection.

"This week, Shanghai's government said it supported importing vaccines and COVID treatment drugs. The northern province of Jilin, which remains sealed off because of an omicron outbreak, says it has secured 10 000 doses of Pfizer's Paxlovid pill to treat cases.

"The ongoing outbreaks in Shanghai, as well as far larger outbreaks in Hong Kong and Jilin, are also giving experts the richest source of China-specific COVID data so far in the pandemic.

"Two people with direct knowledge told NPR that Chinese health officials are closely paying attention to Shanghai and Hong Kong's outbreaks. They're providing valuable data about how well vaccines work, how fast infections have spread, and perhaps could shape a gradual opening-up strategy, someday, in China." - Mod.LK]

[2] New SARS-CoV-2 virus variants
[A] Detection of new variant, XE
Date: Mon 4 Apr 2022
Source: ABC News [edited]
https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-19-variant-xe-identified-experts-alarmed/story?id=83862042


A new COVID-19 variant has been identified in the United Kingdom, but experts say there is no cause for alarm yet. The variant, known as XE, is a combination of the original BA.1 omicron variant and its subvariant BA.2. This type of combination is known as a "recombinant" variant. Public health experts say that recombinant variants are very common and often crop up and disappear on their own.

"Right now, there's really no public health concern," said Dr John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. "Recombinant variants happen over and over. In fact, the reason that this is the XE variant recombinant is that we've had XA, XB, XC, XD already, and none of those have turned out to be any real concern."

According to an update last week from the UK Health Security Agency, 637 cases of XE have been identified as of 22 Mar [2022], with the earliest detected 19 Jan [2022]. An early indication from the UK suggests XE could be slightly more transmissible than BA.2, but the World Health Organization said more research is needed.

Meanwhile, XE makes up less than 1% of total COVID-19 cases that have undergone genomic sequencing in the UK, and there is no evidence to suggest that the variant can escape vaccines, cause more severe disease, or is more deadly. "This particular recombinant, XE, has shown a variable growth rate, and we cannot yet confirm whether it has a true growth advantage," Professor Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for UKHSA, said in a statement.

So far, no cases of the recombinant variant have been reported in any other country, including the United States. [A news report dated 3 Apr 2022 says a case has been reported in Thailand, a long way from the UK (https://thethaiger.com/coronavirus/first-case-of-new-omicron-variant-xe-detected-in-thailand). - Mod.SH]

Brownstein said there are still a lot of unanswered questions surrounding XE, but that -- in the US -- there is a high level of protection both from vaccines and from natural immunity during the omicron wave. "It's possible it may be more transmissible, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's more severe," he said. "And given the sheer number of infections we've already seen with omicron, it's really unclear whether even being slightly more transmissible means we'll see any impact of this variant whatsoever."

Brownstein said one of the reasons the UK was able to pick up on the variant as quickly as it did is because of its robust surveillance system. According to the global database GISAID, the UK has submitted more than 1 million omicron samples for genomic surveillance. The US has submitted more than 781 000. "The UK has done a phenomenal job of sequencing a large number of cases, doing analyses, and producing the output of that work," he said. "So you could see the identification of XE actually as a positive because it shows that our public health systems are working, identifying new variants even when the case numbers are super small." Brownstein added, "This shows that some of these variants can be needles in a haystack, and here we have an example of one being identified very early on."

The World Health Organization released its own report, saying it is monitoring XE, but there is no evidence yet that it is a variant of concern like alpha, delta, and omicron. "WHO will continue to closely monitor and assess the public health risk associated with recombinant variants" and will "provide updates as further evidence becomes available," the organization said in a report published 29 Mar [2022].

Brownstein said variants will continue to emerge, but it is important for people to follow COVID-19 mitigation measures so they don't get a chance to spread. "Being vaccinated and boosted, as well as practicing good hygiene and following public health recommendations, all help to drive transmission down in the community," he said. "When we have uncontrolled spread, that's when the virus is given chances to mutate."

The UKHSA said it is also monitoring 2 other recombinant variants known as XD and XF, both of which are a combination of the delta variant and BA.1. To date, only 38 cases of XF have been identified in the UK and none since mid-February [2022] while the XD variant has been identified in global databases in only 49 cases, mostly in France.

B. Fresh focus on COVID mutations
Date: Mon 4 Apr 2022

https://www.bloombergquint.com/coronavirus-outbreak/china-variants-and-omicron-xe-put-fresh-focus-on-covid-mutations


The disclosure of new COVID variants emerging in China and the rise of a potentially more transmissible strain in the UK has recast the spotlight on the ongoing risk of the virus, even as health experts say there's no reason to panic. The World Health Organization said a hybrid of 2 omicron strains -- BA.1 and BA.2 -- that was first detected in the UK and dubbed XE could be the most transmissible variant yet. It is estimated to spread 10% more easily than BA.2, which itself was more transmissible than the original omicron famous for its ease of penetration.

Meanwhile in China, which is experiencing its biggest outbreak since Wuhan, authorities have disclosed 2 novel omicron subvariants that don't match any existing sequences. It's unclear if the infections were one-off events of little significance, or if they may be a sign of problems ahead.

"If the Chinese authorities' efforts to constrain transmission are ineffective against a highly, highly transmissible virus, like an omicron variant, this could become a threat for the rest of the world," said Rajeev Venkayya, a former White House biodefense adviser who became the chief executive officer of drugmaker Aerium Therapeutics Inc in March [2022]. "We know that uncontrolled transmission of the virus can lead to more viral evolution and an evolution around vaccines and therapeutics," potentially making them less effective, he said.

The continued circulation of COVID-19 nearly 2.5 years after it was first detected in China, driven by the development of mutations that allow infections to surge and deaths to batter the same locations again and again, remains a key issue for a world ready to live with the virus. The US Food and Drug Administration is holding a hearing this week to discuss what booster shots will be needed and how to select which specific strains of the virus they should target.

The numbers of infections from these new variants are tiny given the scope of the outbreaks still continuing worldwide, and scientists have documented the emergence of many variations that have gone nowhere. The UK health authorities have recorded more than 630 cases of XE, underscoring that more information is needed. "We should monitor the new recombinants closely, but we should not panic at the moment," said Leo Poon, a virologist and University of Hong Kong professor who has tracked and written reports on the emergence of new strains. It's not unexpected to see COVID recombinant variants, or a mix of 2 previous strains, particularly since the delta and omicron strains have been circulating widely, he said. It's likely that some people would be infected by both strains. If a variant were to be detected in multiple regions and was spreading in the community, then that would be of concern, he said.

China's recent disclosures on novel variants come at a very early stage of spread, making it hard to know how significant the findings are. Officials in the eastern Chinese city Suzhou, about 110 km [68 mi] from Shanghai, reported an infection with an omicron subvariant derived from BA.1 over the weekend. It didn't match any existing sequences in China or in the international database for viral sequences known as GISAID. It was found in a patient with a mild case of COVID, the city's health authorities said.

A second infection found in the north eastern city of Dalian was caused by a BA.2 subvariant that doesn't match any sequences of domestic or imported cases in the country so far. It was found in a fashion store clerk who was selling clothes imported from South Korea. Close to 400 close contacts were tested. All were negative.

The novel strains from around the world are now cropping up in Asia. The 1st infection caused by the XE variant in Thailand was detected on Saturday [2 Apr 2022], while in February [2022] a different recombinant variant was found in 2 people who arrived in Hong Kong from Europe. The strain hasn't been detected in the community, and the 2 travelers recovered fully.

Most of the infections in China and Hong Kong, where more than half of the city is estimated to have been infected since the start of the year, stem from existing variants thus far, said Stephen Goldstein, a virologist from the University of Utah. So while the outbreaks are an emergency for the governments and public health officials, they don't currently represent a global health threat, he said. "I don't really expect a new variant to emerge from the omicron epidemics in Hong Kong and China," Goldstein said. "That said, this virus has certainly surprised us before, and we need to stay vigilant."

[In the past 24 hours, 22 countries -- South Korea (265 995), UK (142 807), Germany (122 651), Australia (64 367), Viet Nam (48 717), the USA (35 351), Italy (31 329), Japan (33 834), Belgium (30 475), France (27 648), Thailand (21 088), Greece (18 424), Russia (15 291), Israel (14 346), New Zealand (14 183), Brazil (12 982), Austria (12 305), Turkey (12 647), Finland (11 710), Canada (10 980), Netherlands (10 773), and Malaysia (10 002) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3098 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 02 Apr 2022 to late 03 Apr 2022).

A total of 42 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 42 countries are from the European region, 6 are from the Americas region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 9 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 15.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 39.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 7.9% decrease in daily reported cases and 21.5% decrease in reported deaths. The overall global trend shows decreasing cases and reported deaths.

Impression: Worldwide over 1.04 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours. There are now over 492.84 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.17 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
