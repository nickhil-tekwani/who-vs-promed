Unexplained Deaths among Rhesus Monkeys in Kathmandu, Nepal
---------------------------------------
Rhesus monkeys (_Macaca mulatta_) are common species in Nepal. There are
more than 1000 rhesus monkeys in the valley around Kathmandu, [the capital
city of Nepal. They are mainly concentrated around the temple area where
they range free, in a semi-wild condition and receive food partly from
pilgrimages.
More than 400 monkeys are living in a Buddhist stupa [a hemisphere-shaped
shrine in the Swayambhu area. Recently some (5-10) monkeys died from some
illness that is still unknown. They showed symptoms of lethargy, weakness,
and sat [clasping their hands for some time.
Local residents say that [the monkeys are affected by cold. As the capital
city is quite near this stupa and more than 1 million people dwell in the
valley, it is necessary to know more about this disease. Kathmandu dwellers
are afraid that if the disease is communicable [to humans then inevitably
there will be danger to local residents.
Could readers of ProMED-mail provide some information on signs and symptoms
of diseases common in rhesus monkeys? It could help us identify this
disease earlier as we perform postmortem examinations on the dead animals.
Primatologists and local zoo veterinarians are investigating the problem.
