A person in Laramie County [Wyoming] has been diagnosed with a potentially fatal bacterial disease called tularemia. Officials at the Cheyenne-Laramie County Health Department are urging people to take precautions to avoid contracting the disease.

The disease causes symptoms that range from sore throat to diarrhea, and swollen and painful lymph glands. If the bacteria are inhaled, people can suffer chills, headaches, joint pain and pneumonia.

An unusually high number of cases have occurred in Wyoming this year. So far in 2015, 16 cases have been reported in Wyoming, well above the state's average of 1 or 2 cases a year. A man from Big Horn County died from the disease.

The unidentified Laramie County man was diagnosed with tularemia in the last week or so, according to Kim Deti, spokeswoman for the Wyoming Department of Health. She wrote in an email Wednesday, 23 Sep 2015, that she did not know the man's medical condition, but she did not think he was hospitalized.

Higher numbers of cases of the disease have been reported in Colorado too. In Weld County, Colorado, 5 people have been infected with the disease so far in 2015, according to Eric Aakko, public information officer for Weld County's Department of Public Health and Environment. No one in the county has died from it, he wrote. The county typically sees zero cases or one case a year.

The local health department wants people to be alert, deputy director of City-County Health Gary Hickman said. He also is the director of the agency's environmental health division. "(Tularemia) is around all the time," Hickman said. The disease has a tendency to peak when rodent populations are up, which is what has happened this year. "We are in a big year with rodent populations," he said.

Tularemia, also called rabbit fever and deer fly fever, often affects rabbits, hares and rodents. It has been associated with rabbit and rodent die-offs. People can get tularemia if they are bitten by infected ticks, deer flies or horseflies. The disease can be transmitted if people handle infected animals, through ingestion, contact with untreated and contaminated water, or with meat that is not properly cooked, the city-county agency's release said.

In 2015, a disease called tularemia has been widely reported in Nebraska and neighboring states. 18 cases have been reported to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services so far in 2015 which represents a 25-year high. Many of the cases are in the Panhandle. Age range of people affected is 3-82 years old. 11 people have been hospitalized.

Tularemia is a disease that can affect animals and people. It is caused by a bacterium found in animals, insects, soil and water. Rabbits, rodents and hares are especially susceptible. Tularemia can be transmitted to people through insect bites, skin contact, contaminated food or water, or inhaling contaminated particles.

Tularemia can cause a wide range of symptoms including certain flu-like symptoms, an open sore and swelling at the site of a tick bite or swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms usually appear 3-5 days after exposure to the bacteria, but can take up to 14 days to appear. Tularemia can be a potentially serious disease but most infections can be treated with antimicrobials. Tularemia is not spread person-to- person.
