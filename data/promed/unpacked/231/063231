Euro 2 Tattoo has voluntarily stopped piercings after customers who had their upper ear cartilage pierced came down with a bacterial infection.

The Winnebago County Health Department has updated the case count of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infections. Preliminary data indicate 12 laboratory confirmed cases and an additional 4 probable cases. Cases range in age from 13 to 49; all had ears pierced between 28 Mar 2013 and 9 Jul 2013. Six patients were hospitalized, and 10 required surgical intervention as part of their treatment. According to the Winnebago County Health Department, people who developed infections reside in Winnebago, Boone, Ogle, Dekalb, and Stephenson Counties.

Because this is an ongoing epidemiological investigation, please contact the Winnebago County Health Department at (815) 720-4050 to report a recent history of ear piercing and symptoms at the site of the ear piercing.

People living in Boone County may contact the Boone County Health Department at 815-544-2951. People living in Ogle County may contact Ogle County Health Department at 815-732-7330. Individuals living in Stephenson County may contact the Stephenson County Health Department at (815) 599-8429.

[The number of cases has risen. It is more than likely that genetic testing will show that the isolates are identical. The probable source of the bacterium is a washing antimicrobial solution from the piercing salon that contained an antiseptic inactive against _P. aeruginosa_.
