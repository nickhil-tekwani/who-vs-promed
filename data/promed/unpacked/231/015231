Over the last week, 19 citizens in 3 villages in the Palue
Subdistrict, Sikka, were bitten by dogs suspecting of having rabies.
Two heads of the dogs were sent to Maumere to be checked further,
while the bite casualties were treated in the Palue Community Health Centre.
The Kupang Post in Maumere on Thu 21 Sep mentioned that, of the 19
bitten by possible rabid dogs, 5 came from the Reruwairere Village, 4
from Maluriwu and 11 from the Nitunglea Village [this gives a total
of 20; clearly an error somewhere]. "This report was given by the
Palue Sub-district Head to the Sikka Regional Government," said a
citizen from Palue.
Separately, the Representative of the Regent Sikka, Drs. Yoseph Ansar
Rera, confirmed the information on Thu 21 Sep. According to Wabup
Ansar Rera, the Sub-district Head of Palue, he was just handed the
report concerning the rabies dog bites last Tuesday (19 Sep). "After
I received the report from the sub-district head, bite casualties
from the Reruwairere Village and the Maluriwu Village were
immediately handled by a doctor from Puskesmas Palue. Casualties
from the village of Nitunglea were treated the next day. I did not
know whether the bites happened almost simultaneously or not, but I
just received his report on Tuesday (19 Sep)," explained Wabup Ansar Rera.
Apart from handling these cases, the Sikka Regional Government also
dispatched 6 officials of the ministry of agriculture to perform
vaccinations in Palue. "If the report had been handed in earlier,
then the officials would have been dispatched earlier," [an official?] said.

[Our thanks to Thomas for this useful translation. At this time it is
unclear whether there were multiple dogs involved, of which 2 were
caught and their heads recovered for virus confirmation, or just one
dog. Such events can be fairly chaotic on the ground, and so such
uncertainties are not unexpected. So far it would appear that rabies
was confirmed in at least one dog involved in the attacks.
When humans are exposed, immediately washing the wound and
vaccination in the first few days following the bite effectively
prevents the onset of the disease. Of ProMED reports on rabies in
Indonesia (see below), 7/17 involve East Nusa Tenggara, where some 44
people died of the disease in 2005 and probably a similar number in
1998 -- the reports are confused for that time period. In 1998 they
were controlling the disease by killing urban dogs in large numbers,
which at best is totally ineffective. Controlling urban rabies by
annual vaccination of the canine population, especially if the
vaccination campaign is completed in about 4 weeks and timed during
seasonal fertility, so that the maximum number of young dogs can be
vaccinated, has long been shown to work very well, cheaply, and with
maximum cost effectiveness. Frankly, urban rabies control is to
veterinary public health what mastitis control is to farm
veterinarians -- fundamentally simple and straightforward.
