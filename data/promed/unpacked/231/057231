2000/182 _Fusarium proliferatum_ reported on date-palms in Saudi Arabia
[edited]
------------------------------------------------
Date-palm [_Phoenix dactylifera_] is an important crop in Saudi Arabia (15
million trees producing approximately 649 000 tons of fruit). In the Al
Qassim and Al Medina Al Monawara regions, date-palms showed symptoms of
wilt and dieback, very similar to those caused by _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.
sp. _albedinis_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest). _F. oxysporum_ f. sp.
_albedinis_, the causal agent of Bayoud disease, is not present in Saudi
Arabia and phytosanitary measures are [in effect] to prevent its entry. _F.
proliferatum_ was the main fungal species isolated from diseased leaves and
roots [of date-palm in Saudi Arabia]. Koch's postulates were completed [by
stem-injection of date palm seedlings using 2 strains of _F. proliferatum_].
_F. proliferatum_ is a well-known pathogen, present in many countries on
various crops (e.g., maize, rice and asparagus). [Results of pathogenicity
tests on date-palm seedlings showed that] _F. proliferatum_ should be
regarded as a potentially dangerous pathogen of date-palm in Saudi Arabia.
[9 strains of _F. proliferatum_ isolated from date-palms were tested for
production of toxins] (beauvericin [BEA], fumonisin B1 [FB1],
fusaproliferin [FUP], fusaric acid and moniliformin [MON]). [All strains
produced at least 3 of these toxins and 2 produced all 5]. In addition to
phytotoxic effects, these toxins have some effects on human health.
More studies are needed on the possible risk of consumption of contaminated
date-palm fruit. [This is the first report of pathogenesis in date-palm by
_F. proliferatum_ in Saudi Arabia]. Further investigations are needed on
the distribution of the pathogen in [other] date-palm-producing countries.

[According to the authors, this is the first isolation of toxigenic strains
of _F. proliferatum_ belonging to mating population D of _Gibberella
fujikuroi_ from diseased date-palm plants. Of interest to public health and
veterinary professionals are the toxins produced by the pathogen which are
associated with human and animal diseases. Fumonisin B1 is related to human
esophageal cancer and several mycotoxicoses. Others affect brain and pineal
neurotransmitters in rats and MON was reported to cause hematological
disorders, myocardial hypertrophy and mortality in farm animals. See the
