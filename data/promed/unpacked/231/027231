Additional FMD-affected livestock reported
------------------------------------------
The government said Saturday [11 Dec 2010] it discovered an
additional case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the southeastern
part of the country, raising the total number of cases to 35.

The ministry of agriculture reported that cattle at a farm in
Yeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, were found to be infected with
the highly contagious disease.

[In case the above information is confirmed, this will mean 35
outbreaks since the reported start of the South Korean epizootic, on
26 Nov 2010, 16 days ago. This exceeds the number of farms affected
during a similar time-frame by the same, extremely infectious FMDV
serotype O virus strain in Miyazaki prefecture, Japan, where the
epizootic reportedly started on 20 Apr 2010. Until 5 May 2010, 23
Miyazaki farms were notified as infected, of which 13 cattle farms
and 10 pig farms.

It took the Japanese 3.5 months before being able to declare their
epizootic resolved, on 5 Jul 2010, with an accumulated total of 292
outbreaks, involving 28 percent of all the farms in Miyazaki.
Reportedly, 68 266 cows were lost which amounts to 22 percent of the
entire prefectural population, as well as 220 034 pigs, 24 percent of
the pigs in the prefecture.

The disposal of the bodies was also a huge task. 252 individual land
lots were assigned as "disposal/burial grounds" and the total surface
area of these amounted to 1.42 square kms. The financial loss to the
farming community has been calculated at approximately 235 billion
yen (2.8 billion US Dollars); see
<http://www.zenoaq.jp/english/aij/1009.html>.

The South Korean FMD control policy is similar to the Japanese one,
namely stamping out without vaccination. On top of the quality of the
performance of the prescribed biosecurity measures, their prospects
of early eradication of the disease depend upon the density of cattle
and pig farms within and around the affected area and upon the
weather. Certain weather conditions have been shown to influence
airborne spread of the virus, particularly from infected pigs. -
