New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Lesoma, Chobe, Kasane [North-West district]
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Jul 2010
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Species: cattle
Susceptible: 346
Cases: 34
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0

Species: goats
Susceptible: 99
Cases: 0
Deaths 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0

Species: swine
Susceptible: 66
Cases: 0
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: the pigs and goats showed no suspect signs of FMD.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species.
Epidemiological comments: the suspected outbreak is outside the "FMD
free zone where vaccination is not practiced" recognized by the OIE;
hence it will not affect the disease status of FMD free zones within
the country. The village in which the suspected outbreak occurred is
along the international border between Botswana and Zimbabwe
sandwiched between 2 national parks (Hwange in Zimbabwe and Chobe in
Botswana). Cattle in this village are communally reared and watered
from a natural spring in the outskirts of the village and the spring
is frequented by wild animals from both parks. Historically, FMD
susceptible animals and their products are not allowed to leave this
zone. The disease is controlled through routine scheduled
vaccinations, which are undertaken 3 times a year using a 3PD50
trivalent vaccine. Because the animals are herded and kraaled at
night throughout the year to guard against predators, coverage during
vaccinations is almost 100 percent. The experienced proportion of
vaccinated cases was below the expected.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country;
screening; zoning; disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); dipping/spraying; no vaccination; no
treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s).

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Botswana Vaccine Institute (OIE's reference
laboratory)
Species: cattle
Test: virus isolation
Test date: --
Result: pending

Species: cattle
Test: virus sequencing
Test date: --
Result: pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Botswana's beef industry is export oriented, with South Africa being
it's largest target market and Europe also playing a major role.
Since this outbreak is not inside the FMD export zone, there should
be no impact on exports at all. This is important because beef plays
an important role in Botswana's economy.

The report is forwarded based on clinical disease with laboratory
results pending. Given the frequency and importance of this disease
and the distinct clinical syndrome where obviously painful, visible
lesions are present, it is not surprising and very helpful to have
such rapid reporting through official channels. Lesions in cattle
commonly include vesicles in the mouth, tongue, palate, teats, and
feet. Remedial vaccine coverage will hopefully prevent spread.

This outbreak occurs in the Northeast of the country very close the
border with Zimbabwe and near the Zambian border as well. The far
western sliver type extension of Namibia is also not far away from
outbreak location, so the outbreak is situated at the confluence of
the 4 countries. The location of the outbreak can be seen appended to
the OIE WAHID reference cited above or on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/r/01-*>. Mod.PC]
