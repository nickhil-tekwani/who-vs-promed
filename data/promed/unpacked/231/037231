Bovine anthrax -- Buenos Aires, Argentina
-----------------------------------------
An estancia [cattle ranch] in General Alvear Province, Buenos Aires,
lies amidst the rich soils of Cuenca del Rio Salado, the archetypal
area for cattle breeding. The outbreak occurred in an unvaccinated
herd of 280 2-year-old heifers, one of which suddenly died. There was
an exsanguination of blood from the natural orifices, and on opening
the abdomen the veterinarian noted a marked splenomegaly; a sample
cultured positive for _Bacillus anthracis_.

Antibiotic sensitivity was noted to Penicillin, Ampicillin,
Ciprofloxacin, Florfenicol, Tetracycline, Tilmicocin and Gentamicin,
and resistance to Trimethoprim. The herd was vaccinated with Sterne
vaccine.

The estancia has a history of more than 40 years of anthrax
outbreaks. The carcass had been attacked by 'Chimangos' or caracaras
(_Milvago chimango_)[hawks]. The recovery of anthrax spores from
their faeces in the Province of Santa Fe is described in a 2007 paper.

free ranging raptors from central Argentina, _Journal of Wildlife
Diseases_, 43: 136-141.] The carcass was immediately buried.

[Unfortunately a characteristic history. It is proving very difficult
to persuade the estancieros to routinely vaccinate their stock in this
part of Argentina, where the black steppe/pampas soil is perfect for
spore survival. So each year they get a number of outbreaks, virtually
always on ranches with unvaccinated stock. The cost of the resulting
dead stock far exceeds the trivial cost of Sterne vaccine.

One will only find anthrax spores in the faeces of scavenger birds
when they have been feeding on carcasses that had been open for a
couple of days -- this allows the necessary access to air and time for
sporulation. Vegetative cells will not survive passage through the
bird's stomach, and thus after feeding on freshly dead animals their
faeces are normally without spores. In Texas, where I do most of my
fieldwork, the caracaras, beautiful though they are, are not as
aggressive as the Turkey buzzards that can gut a whitetail deer in
minutes of it dying. So the Texas caracaras manage with roadkill and
small dead animals.

is found in Texas, Arizona, and Florida. See:
