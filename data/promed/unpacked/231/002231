BLUETONGUE IN CANADA in a sentinel herd in Okanagan Valley
Emergency report
----------------
Text of a fax received on 10 December 1998 from Dr N.G. Willis, Executive
Director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Winnipeg:
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
--------------------
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 28 October 1998.
---------------------------------------------------
Estimated date of first infection: September 1998.
----------------------------------
Location of animal health incident:
-----------------------------------
Okanagan Valley, province of British Columbia, approximately 16 km north of
the 49th parallel (the border with the United States of America).
Description of affected population:
-----------------------------------
two animals in a sentinel herd of seven.
Background:
-----------
In 1987, a sentinel herd programme was put in place in the southern range
of Okanagan Valley, at sites of highest historical seroprevalence. The
sentinel animals are distributed in six sites, at seven animals per site,
at the southern end of the Okanagan Valley, internationally recognised as
the only region of Canada where bluetongue has been known to occur. The
pre-selected animals are tested at approximately three week intervals from
June until the middle of October.
Two incursions have been detected since the beginning of the sentinel herd
programme, in late August 1987 and in September 1988.
Diagnosis:
----------
The herd had been previously sampled on 15 September 1998, and reported
negative. The first positive report was on 28 October, from a sample taken
on 13 October. The positive animal was resampled on 4 November for virus
isolation.
The seven animals, including the positive animal, were resampled on 12
November. On 19 November, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases
confirmed the initial result on the above animal and reported an additional
positive animal. On 24 November, an additional sample was taken from this
second animal for virus isolation.
On 4 December, the laboratory reported that the virus had been isolated
from the first serological reactor's blood.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was confirmed: National Centre for Foreign
Animal Diseases, Winnipeg.
B. Diagnostic tests used: the virus was isolated after one passage in
embryonated chicken eggs and cell culture. The isolate was identified using
a group-specific monoclonal antibody and a serum neutralisation test.
C. Causal agent: bluetongue virus serotype 11.
Epidemiology:
-------------
There has not been any significant die-off in the deer population, there
have been no significant disease occurrences in the cattle population of
the area, and, more importantly, there has been nothing unusual in the
sheep population.
Experience to date indicates that transmission of bluetongue occurs in
Canada only at sporadic intervals and only in the Okanagan Valley.
Control measures during reporting period: measures are in place to ensure
that susceptible animals from the Okanagan Valley are identified prior to
being moved to other locations in Canada.
Conclusion:
-----------
considering the nature of the disease and its finding in a sentinel herd of
the Okanagan Valley, the finding does not affect the health status of the
Canadian livestock population outside this area.
