Crocodile deaths puzzle ecologists
----------------------------------
A think tank of veterinary surgeons, scientists, researchers, rangers, and
managers met in Skukuza in the Kruger National Park (KNP) on Tue 3 Jun 2008
to discuss the discovery of at least 30 crocodile carcasses found in the
Olifants River last week.

"We are in unknown territory and we certainly don't have the answers as to
why these crocodiles seem to be dying, so we need to look at the problem
closely and find a solution," said the KNP's head of Department for
Scientific Services, Mr Danie Pienaar after the meeting.

Carcasses were first spotted by trails rangers from the Olifants Wilderness
Trails on Tue 27 May 2008 and these were reported to Skukuza. A veterinary
surgeon from Phalaborwa went to the Olifants River and found one decomposed
crocodile with a distinctive yellow-orange hardened fat in its tail.

In turn, this information was reported and, on Thu 29 May 2008, a
helicopter with researchers and veterinary technologists on board flew over
the entire length of the Olifants River within the boundaries of the park
and the Letaba River from Letaba Rest Camp to the confluence of the Letaba
and Olifants rivers.

During this aerial survey, some 30 crocodile carcasses were discovered in
various stages of decomposition and sample tissue of the yellow-orange
hardened fat was taken, as well as a fresh crocodile carcass, and sent to
the University of Pretoria's Onderstepoort for further analysis.

It is believed at this stage that the yellow-orange fat is a condition
known as pansteatitis, which is usually associated with the consumption of
rotten or rancid fish.

"The carcass and the samples have been sent for a thorough post mortem and
further tests as we are not sure, at this stage, what caused this condition
in the Olifants Gorge as there were no recent fish kills reported from this
river in the KNP. We have decided that further samples of crocodiles, fish,
water, and sediments are needed for detailed analysis before we can
identify the cause," added Mr Pienaar.

KNP rangers, trails rangers, and scientists will continue monitoring the
situation along the Olifants River with regular flights of the Bantam
Ultralight Aircraft and reports from the rangers, trails rangers, and
guides based in the area while the situation is extensively researched.

"We will be looking at this problem from all angles and have not ruled out
any possibility. Although a clear cause/effect relationship cannot be found
at this stage, it is clear that the Olifants River system is strained
beyond it capacity to deal with this level of stress," added Mr Pienaar.

Mr Pienaar concluded that the Olifants River is the most polluted of all
the rivers in the KNP and the system now has further strain from the
Massingir Dam that has pushed back into the Olifants Gorge, causing
sediments to be deposited.

Visitors to the KNP need not worry about their own health as water utilized
from the Olifants River is exhaustively monitored before declared fit for
human consumption.

[According to the information above, the current event involves crocodiles
exclusively. Are other wildlife species exposed to the same polluted water
without being affected? Such information may have public health implications.

Earlier reports on wildlife mortalities in the KNP, posted in April 2008
and November 2007, addressed various mammal species in the area of the
Silolweni Dam, reportedly affected by blue green algae (cyanobacteria)
poisoning. The event led the authorities to drain the dam, reportedly
"putting an immediate end to this point source bio-intoxication outbreak";
see details and Mod.TG commentary in ProMED-mail posting 20071107.3617.

For a review on crocodile diseases, including a picture of pansteatitis in
a Nile crocodile (fig. 13), see FW Huchzermeyer's paper in Rev sci tech Off
int Epiz 2002; 21(2): 265-76, available online at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/publicat/rt/2102/HUCHZERMEYER.pdf>.

Laboratory results from Onderstepoort, desirably addressing toxicological
and infectious aspects of the event, are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
