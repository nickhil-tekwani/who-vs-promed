Ingham County health officials are focusing on the possibility of _E.
coli_-tainted food that was delivered to the Michigan State
University (MSU) campus as the source of an outbreak earlier in
September 2008 that sent 10 MSU students to local doctors.

Investigators stress they have not honed in on a particular food or
source of food, only that "they're focusing on food from off-campus
and delivered to campus," Marcus Cheatham, spokesman of the Ingham
County Health Department, said earlier today [23 Sep 2008].

Lab tests have confirmed 7 of more than 30 possible cases as an
infection by _E. coli_ O157:H7, a potentially deadly strain
especially for the elderly and young children. 16 of the 30 remain
"probable cases" as investigators await lab results. Others have been
ruled out.

The MSU students are expected to fully recuperate, health officials
have said. The outbreak seems to have been confined. No new cases
that were ultimately confirmed have been reported since 13 Sep 2008.
Though the last possible case was reported on 18 Sep 2008, several of
the latter cases have been ruled out, Cheatham said.

The department continues interviewing students and waiting for
results from stool samples from some of several of students who
either sought medical treatment or called the health department to
report gastrointestinal problems after MSU officials e-mailed
students last week to alert them to the outbreak.

The interviewing is tedious because investigators are asking students
to recall the details of what they ate more than a week ago. "It's
'Did you have lettuce on that grinder?'" Cheatham said, stressing
that investigators have not yet honed in on a particular food or
condiment. "It's sort of gumshoe work at this point," he said.
