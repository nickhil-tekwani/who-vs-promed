Following the 1st announcement on 3 Oct 2016 of the confirmation of New World screwworms in Big Pine Key, Florida, the United States Department of Agriculture and Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services today [18 Oct 2016] announced that the screwworm has also been detected on the keys listed below, which are all west of Big Pine and No Name keys and in close proximity. Additional detections are not unexpected, as enhanced surveillance efforts are underway.
- Big Torch Key: adult screwworm flies detected.
- Middle Torch Key: adult screwworm flies detected.
- Little Torch Key: adult screwworm flies detected.
- Cudjoe: adult screwworm flies detected.
- Ramrod: adult screwworm flies detected.
- Summerland: adult screwworm flies detected and screwworm-infested Key deer observed.

New World screwworms are fly larvae (maggots) that can infest livestock and other warm-blooded animals, including, in rare cases, people. They most often enter an animal through an open wound and feed on the animal's living flesh.

This is the 1st local infestation in the United States in more than 30 years. On 3 Oct 2016, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H Putnam declared an agricultural state of emergency in Monroe County, Florida.

Eradication efforts include:
- an Animal Health Check Point at Mile Marker 106 in Key Largo. This animal health checkpoint is a crucial part of ensuring animal health and protecting Florida from the spread of this pest. All animals are briefly checked to ensure they do not have screwworm. Early detection of screwworms can be successfully treated in pets and livestock. 883 animals have been checked to date, and none has been positive for screwworm;
- the release of sterile flies, a scientifically proven method to achieve screwworm eradication, began on Tue 11 Oct 2016;
- the USDA continues to increase production and evaluate additional sites for release;
- enhanced surveillance to determine the scope of the screwworm infestation; and
- extensive public outreach in order to engage the public in early detection of the screwworm.

Residents who have warm-blooded animals (pets, livestock, etc.) should watch their animals carefully and seek veterinary care for open wounds, then report any potential cases to 1-800-HELP-FLA (1-800-435-7352) or non-Florida residents should call (850) 410-3800.
To report a suspected case of screwworm in the Key deer, call (305) 470-6863, option 7.

In a follow-up on the screwworm situation in the Florida Keys, US and Florida agriculture officials report that screwworm has been detected in multiple Keys west of Big Pine and No Name Keys.

As of a Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) update [Tue 18 Oct 2016], screwworm flies have been detected in the following areas: Big Torch Key: adult screwworm flies detected; Middle Torch Key: adult screwworm flies detected; Little Torch Key: adult screwworm flies detected; Cudjoe: adult screwworm flies detected; Ramrod: adult screwworm flies detected and Summerland, where adult screwworm flies detected and screwworm-infested Key deer observed.

To date, nearly 10 percent, or 97 cases of the Key deer population, an endangered species, has been euthanized due to screwworm infestation.

Since the National Key Deer Refuge was established in 1957 and the Key deer became one of the 1st species protected under the Endangered Species Act, their population has climbed back up to approximately 1000 individuals with the core population on Big Pine Key and No Name Key, according to FDACS.

This is the 1st local infestation in the United States in more than 30 years. On 3 Oct 2016, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H Putnam declared an agricultural state of emergency in Monroe County, Florida [see at http://www.freshfromflorida.com/content/download/71554/1775990/10032016_proclamation.pdf].

The Department of Agriculture has implemented the following eradication efforts:
- an Animal Health Check Point at Mile Marker 106 in Key Largo. This animal health checkpoint is a crucial part of ensuring animal health and protecting Florida from the spread of this pest. All animals are briefly checked to ensure they do not have screwworm. Early detection of screwworms can be successfully treated in pets and livestock. 883 animals have been checked to date, and none has been positive for screwworm;
- the release of sterile flies, a scientifically proven method to achieve screwworm eradication, began on Tue 11 Oct. 2016;
- the USDA continues to increase production and evaluate additional sites for release;
- enhanced surveillance to determine the scope of the screwworm infestation; and
- extensive public outreach in order to engage the public in early detection of the screwworm.

[While these 2 articles point out many of the same issues, that is, where screwworms have been found, when sterile flies were released, and which Keys are affected, only one of them gives us the staggering news that 10 percent of the endangered Key deer have been euthanized. Furthermore, both articles make note that animals can be treated. So being an endangered species, why are Key deer being euthanized, not treated?

There are 2 possible arguments for this behavior. One of the possible issues is that the state does not have facilities to handle deer or that there are not wildlife people that could come up with a mobile way to treat deer. The 2nd possible argument for this behavior is that the euthanized deer were moribund. Remember this is 10 percent of an endangered species. It seems like treatment is warranted. - Mod.TG
