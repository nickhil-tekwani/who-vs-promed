Vets are stepping up research into the deadly dog disease Alabama Rot after confirming 8 more cases, including one in Worcestershire and one in Warwickshire.

David Walker, from Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists, the UK's leading expert on the condition, announced that the 1st Alabama Rot "conference" will be held in May [2017] with scientists from human medicine alongside vets from academia and private practice teaming up to discuss ways to learn more about the disease.

The new cases take the total number of confirmed cases to 94 since the disease was 1st detected in the UK in 2012.

"It is concerning that we are continuing to identify cases across the whole of the UK, and now we have also confirmed the 1st cases in Ireland and Warwickshire," said Mr Walker.

Alabama Rot, which 1st appeared in the late 1980s affecting greyhounds in America, has now been found in 29 counties across the UK since 2012.

The cause of the disease, clinically known as idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV), is still unknown, and while there is currently no known way to prevent a dog from contracting the disease, there is a useful guide available online to help people understand where in the UK confirmed cases have been found and advice on how to spot signs.

To help collate accurate data about the disease, Anderson Moores is asking all vets in the UK and Ireland to contact them if they see a dog they suspect has Alabama Rot.

The 11 cases confirmed so far this year [2017] are from Dublin, Penkhull in Staffordshire, Bearwood, West Chelborough and Ensbury Park in Dorset, Cullompton in Devon, Stalybridge in Greater Manchester, Crewe in Cheshire, Caldicot in Monmouthshire, Claverdon in Warwickshire, and Malvern in Worcestershire.

Treatment is supportive but is only successful in around 20 percent of cases, which is why dog owners are being encouraged to use the online guide to help them understand the clinical signs and confirmed locations of the condition.

The 1st sign that is normally seen is a skin sore that isn't caused by a known injury. Most commonly, these sores are found on the lower half of the leg and appear as a distinct swelling, a patch of red skin, or are open and ulcer-like.

"Any dog owners who are worried that their pet might have Alabama Rot should contact their veterinary practice immediately," said Dr Huw Stacey.

[Similar cases, some of them referred to as "new forest disease," have been addressed by ProMED-mail since its 1st appearance in the UK, initially (2011) referred to as "undiagnosed." In 2015, the disease was designated "cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy" (CRGV or Alabama rot), close to a condition which has been seen in the USA in greyhounds for almost 30 years.

This yet unclarified syndrome seems to spread; see commentary in ProMED post 20170314.4899193. - Mod.AS
