As of 1 Jul 2013, enterovirus infection has been confirmed in 254 inhabitants of the Lipetsk Region, according to Anatoly Chesnokov, the principal infectious disease specialist of the Lipetsk region.

More than 200 people are in hospitals of Lipetsk and Yelets: 150 patients were under observation in Lipetsk (127 of whom are children) and 52 in Yelets (including 35 children). The average age of affected children is from 3-15 years.

Chesnokov observed that the rate of enterovirus infection in the region is stabilising. On Sat 29 Jun 2013, the virus was detected in 17 people seeking medical attention, whereas on Sun 30 Jun 2013, the number had declined to 9. The number of severe cases among patients in the Lipetsk region was not reported. Routine medical treatment appears to be adequate to contain the outbreak.

Unfortunately, the reason for the increased transmission of infection in the Lipetsk region has not been revealed. Specialists believe that the most likely routes are: bathing in river water, failure to observe elementary rules of hygiene, consumption of [contaminated] fruits and vegetables from markets, and contact with infected persons. Thus, in the village of Bystraya Sosna, specialists found pathogens in a number of samples, but not in all of them.

[The outbreak of enterovirus infection in the Lipetsk Region has been attributed to human echovirus 30 and human echovirus 6 and is characterised as mildly severe, in comparison with the current outbreaks of human enterovirus 71 and human echovirus 11 in Rostov-on-Don. Currently, outbreaks of enterovirus infection are continuing to increase in a number of other regions of Russia. - Mod.NP]

[In recent weeks, there have been increasing reports of enterovirus infection, often designated "meningitis" (see ProMED-mail post: Aseptic meningitis - Russia: epidemic 20130701.1801989). These outbreaks have not been reported because identification of the etiologic agents has not been reported. The outbreak in Lipetsk Region, reported above, confirms that these outbreaks are caused by enteroviruses and are an accompaniment of deficiencies in hygiene during the summer months.

The Lipetsk Region is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast) which was formed in 1954. Its administrative center is the city of Lipetsk, population 1 173 513 (2010 Census). The modern oblast was formed by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from parts of 5 neighboring provinces: Voronezh, Ryazan, Tambov, Tula and Oryol.
