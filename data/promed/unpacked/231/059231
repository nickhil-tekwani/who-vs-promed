Mycolactone: a polyketide toxin from Mycobacterium ulcerans required for
virulence.

_Mycobacterium ulcerans_ is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, a severe
human skin disease that occurs primarily in Africa and Australia. Infection
with _M. ulcerans_ results in persistent severe necrosis without an acute
inflammatory response. The presence of histopathological changes distant
from the site of infection suggested that pathogenesis might be toxin
mediated. A polyketide-derived macrolide designated mycolactone was isolated
that causes cytopathicity and cell cycle arrest in cultured L929 murine
fibroblasts. Intradermal inoculation of purified toxin into guinea pigs
produced a lesion similar to that of
Buruli ulcer in humans. This toxin may represent one of a family of
virulence factors associated with pathology in mycobacterial diseases such
as leprosy and tuberculosis.

[Buruli ulcer is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, and is an emerging disease
in Western Africa according to recent WHO commentary. See Buruli ulcer -
