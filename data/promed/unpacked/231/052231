The posting above refers to a number of wild birds, especially carrion birds that were found dead in early 2014. These 'undiagnosed deaths' have been confirmed to be due to illegal pesticide poisoning (tested by SASA, Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture). - Mod.TG]

In one of the most widely-publicised incidents of recent years, a large number of dead birds of prey were found on farmland on the Black Isle [a peninsula within Ross and Cromarty, in the Scottish Highlands] in March and April 2014 (see Table 2, row 3) [available at the source URL above]. 12 red kites and 4 buzzards were subsequently confirmed as being victims of illegal poisoning, having consumed bait laced with a banned pesticide. Despite considerable media attention, a significant police investigation and the offer of a reward totalling GBP 26 000 [about USD 32 400], no suspect has been identified.

Poisoned red kites were found in 3 other locations during 2014, highlighting that, regardless of erroneous claims to the contrary, the illegal use of poison continues to be common. All of these incidents were confirmed by toxicological testing carried out at the SASA laboratory. In addition to these, stockpiles of banned pesticides were found at 2 locations. Such potentially-lethal substances continue to threaten the safety of the general public, and specifically estate employees, a number of whom have been convicted for the illegal storage and use of pesticides in the workplace.

[It is always helpful when we finally get a diagnosis of one of the undiagnosed cases. Although we don't know which pesticide, it is a pesticide and it seems a bit of a potent one, and perhaps used incorrectly. - Mod.TG
