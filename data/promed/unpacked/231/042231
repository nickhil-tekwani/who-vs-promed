Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] has caused the death of one man in Iran in recent days, Bashir Khaleghi, an Iranian MP, said.

Kaleghi, who is a member of the Parliament's Health Commission, said that at least 4 people have so far caught the disease in the recent days, ILNA [Iranian Labour News Agency] news agency reported.

The cases have been reported in Iran's south eastern province of Kerman (3 cases) and southern province of Fars (one case), he added.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia. The virus is a member of the Bunyaviridae family of RNA viruses.

It is a zoonotic disease carried by several domestic and wild animals. While clinical disease is rare in infected animals, it is severe in infected humans, with a mortality rate of 10-40 percent.

Since 2000, at least 1000 cases of Crimean-Congo fever have been reported in Iran, according to the Iranian officials.

In last fiscal year, ended March 2018, some 120 people caught the virus, 8 of them died.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a zoonotic viral disease that is asymptomatic in infected livestock, but a serious threat to humans. Human infections begin with nonspecific febrile symptoms, but progress to a serious hemorrhagic syndrome with a case fatality rate of 2-50 percent. Although the causative virus is often transmitted by ticks, livestock-to-human and human-to-human transmissions also occur.

The disease is one of the most widely distributed viral hemorrhagic fevers occurring in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and some parts of Europe.

In a study by Chinikar et al published in 2010 (J Clin Virol. 2010; 47(2):110-4. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2009.10.014), among 1297 probable CCHF human sera collected from different provinces of Iran from the years 2000 to 2008, 534 were confirmed as CCHF positive, covering 23 out of 30 provinces in Iran.

It is clear that control of tick populations in endemic regions can play an important role in prevention and incidence of CCHF disease. Climate changes such as drought and warming of the broad geography of Iran and adjacent countries resulted in increased tick populations and consequently in the numbers of CCHF cases during the last decade. Human and veterinary surveillance of CCHF is an important aspect for planning detection and response to outbreaks associated with arboviruses and viral hemorrhagic fevers. - Mod.UBA
