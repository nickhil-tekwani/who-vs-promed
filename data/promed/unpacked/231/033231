FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, SYNTHETIC MARKER VACCINES

Synthetic marker vaccines for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) are all still at
the developmental stage. Unlike the current vaccine, made from killed whole
FMD virus, they elicit different antibodies to those elicited by infection,
usually because they are missing antigens present in the wild virus. They
might also carry an extra marker antigen. Hence vaccinated meat [animals]
can in theory be distinguished from infected meat [vaccinated]. The
inability to distinguish the 2 is, besides cost, currently the chief
disincentive to routine vaccination, as importers who wish to remain
FMD-free will not buy such meat.
The European Commission's scientific committee on animal health reviewed
FMD vaccine development in 1999 and concluded the vaccines might be useful
for ring-vaccinating to control an outbreak, but that the specific protein
tests that distinguish infection from vaccination need more development. A
dissenting view at the end of the report opposes ring vaccination. The
report is at:

There is some reporting on current marker vaccine development, and
implications for the current outbreak, at:

[ProMED-mail does not normally post items on investigational or
experimental vaccines or vaccine development. However, given the recent
discussions here on the use of molecular biology to design a vaccine
against the Foot-and-mouth disease viruses, it seems appropriate to present
the information above. - Man. Ed. DS]
