Ticks Tied to Reports of Cattle and Deer Deaths
-----------------------------------------------
Acting State Veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven says the Animal Industry
Board has received several calls about unexplained cattle, horse, and
deer deaths in an area south of Interior, South Dakota. "Local
veterinarians have worked closely with veterinary diagnostic
laboratories in attempts to reach a diagnosis," Oedekoven said. "At
this point, it appears multiple factors have contributed to cattle
deaths in that area, including ticks, severe weather, lack of
nutrition, and possibly infectious diseases." A heavy tick
infestation is a common factor in the deaths, he said.

The tick species identified from some of the cattle is known as the
"winter tick," which can be found on deer, elk and cattle. Ticks and
other external parasites can cause animals to become weak and anemic,
and can affect their immune systems. Oedekoven said cattle can be
treated for ticks, and it may be an important part of a herd health plan.

During pre-calving months, adequate nutrition is a must, as cows
expend large amounts of energy growing healthy calves and preparing
for births. Cattle pregnancies correspond to some of the harshest
winter months, another reason to ensure proper nutrition.
"Anaplasmosis, a tick-borne disease that causes anemia, has not been
identified in any of the samples collected from cattle," Oedekoven
said. "Samples from several ranches were tested for a variety of
other diseases, none of which appear to be widespread problems at this point."

Dr. Oedekoven said a request to report cattle herds with tick
infestations or unexplained deaths was sent to area veterinarians and
ranchers, but no additional reports have been received. "This
experience once again demonstrates the importance, even with disease
issues that seem routine, of getting proper samples and notifying a
veterinarian so diagnosis and any treatments are timely and
appropriate," Oedekoven said. "Anytime a producer notices something
out of the ordinary, such as increased death losses or high parasite
loads, it is advisable to contact a local veterinarian."

People seeing dead or ill deer, elk or other wildlife should contact
the nearest Game, Fish and Parks Division of Wildlife office or local
conservation officers. "We are concerned whenever there is loss of
wildlife," said Tom Kirschenmann, Game, Fish and Parks Chief of
Terrestrial Resources. "Our department has also received calls from
landowners in regards to sick and dead deer. In response, we have
worked closely with those producers and local veterinarians, as well
as the Animal Industry Board, to collect and submit samples to the
diagnostic lab in the same manner as livestock samples. We will
continue to remove sick deer reported by landowners and encourage
them to consult their local veterinarians on livestock questions and concerns."

The ticks may be a piece of the puzzle here -- but the real problems
appear to be more related to the severe winter weather South Dakota
received. These cows were stressed due to weather, calving, and
inadequate nutrition in some cases. The parasite load did not help matters.

There were wide rumors that anaplasmosis was spreading from wildlife
to cattle herds, and the press release was issued in part to dispel
that myth. No anaplasmosis was identified, serologically or
otherwise, in any samples from cattle. Reported to me were 2
seropositive deer samples. However, no organism has been identified
in those samples.

An Ehrlichia was identified in a small number of samples. This helps
to explain an apparent response when weak cattle were treated with
tetracyclines.

We have had significant losses in our state and neighboring states
due to severe winter weather.

[Our thanks to Dustin for this valuable background information.

Winter ticks (_Dermacentor albipictus_) can take a high toll on
livestock and wildlife during the northern winters when they need to
be in good condition to survive. For example:

winter tick infestations on calf moose. 2007.

Abstract:
---------
Moose (Alces alces) are susceptible to late winter mortality from
infestation of winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus) throughout much
of North America. Calves, perhaps more so than other ages of moose,
likely experience chronic, and eventually acute anemia from blood
removal by adult female ticks that peaks during weeks 4-6 of the
8-week engorgement period. We modeled the potential metabolic impact
on protein and energy balance of moose calves associated with blood
loss during 4 levels, low to severe, of winter tick infestation. Our
conservative estimates indicated that total blood loss in weeks 4-6,
as a percent of total blood volume, ranged from 27 to 48 percent and
64 to 112 percent during moderate (30 000 ticks) and severe (70 000
ticks) infestations, respectively. The percent of the daily
metabolizable energy requirement needed to replace daily blood loss
during weeks 4-6 was 4.9-8.2 percent and 11.4-19.2 percent during
moderate and severe infestations, respectively. The protein deficit
associated with blood loss and regeneration was the most critical
metabolic impact. Daily protein loss during weeks 4-6 was 29-49
percent and 68-114 percent of the daily protein requirement in
moderate and severe infestations, respectively. Daily protein losses
of approximately 30 to more than 100 percent occurred for 2
continuous weeks. Energy costs associated with compensating for blood
loss would likely elevate the daily energy deficit normal at end of
winter, accelerate nutritional decline and weight loss, and cause
increased physiological stress related to concurrent anemia. Severely
infested calves are obviously susceptible to late winter mortality,
and the impact of moderate infestations would be exacerbated by
secondary parasitic infestations, severe winters, and poor body
condition. (Full text follows at above URL)

As yet there is no explanation why this Spring should be worse than
usual for what must be a constant threat.
