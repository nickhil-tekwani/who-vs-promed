Chinese authorities have confirmed an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) among cattle in Tibet.

China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) said that 7 head of cattle in a village in the Xigaze Prefecture had shown signs of the disease, and tests confirmed they were infected with type A FMD.

Local authorities destroyed 46 animals to control the spread of the disease and sealed off the infected area.

[The above outbreak in Tibet has been reported by China to the OIE in its follow-up report No 9, submitted on 8 Jan 2014, available with map at http://tinyurl.com/q2sm5j6.

This epizootic in Tibet reportedly started in April 2013, so far causing 7 outbreaks, and is reportedly "continuing". A summary of this epizootic, since its start, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014618_20140108_151916.pdf. The report includes a map and the following statistics:
Outbreak summary:
Total outbreaks: 7 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1198 / 315 / 0 / 1198 / 0
Sheep & goats [mixed flocks] / 54 / 0 / 0 / 54 / 0
Sheep / 81 / 0 / 0 / 81 / 0
Swine / 6 / 0 / 0 / 6 / 0
Epidemiological comments: Virus subtype, SEA 97 G2 ["New strain"].

The FMD serotype A "New strain" virus has been, reportedly, spreading in China since early 2013. In addition to Tibet, it has been reported from Xinjiang, Guangdong, and Qinghai and has, probably, a wider circulation. The same virus has been identified in outbreaks in Russia (Amur) since March 2013. An outbreak of FMD serotype A was reported also in east Kazakhstan in May 2013, on the border with China. The genotyping results indicate this strain to be identical (99.21 per cent) to the Chinese (and Russian) strains; see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLMEG-2013-00017%20A%20Kazakhstan%202013.pdf. - Mod.AS
