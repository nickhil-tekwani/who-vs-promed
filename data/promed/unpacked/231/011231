Officials looking into Briery Creek die-off
-------------------------------------------
The reports from readers came in around late June 2010: Fish are
dying in Briery Creek Lake. "Have you heard anything about this?" was
a common theme of their e-mails.

Word spread fast and theories were tossed about -- not surprising
considering the lake's status as Virginia's premier impoundment for
lunker bass. Now we know what likely was behind the die-offs: a
combination of intense heat and, more ominously, a disease known as
largemouth bass virus (LMBV).

According to a press release from the Department of Game and Inland
Fisheries (DGIF), largemouth bass virus is a disease that impacts
several fish species but appears to cause death only in largemouth
bass. LMBV was 1st discovered in Florida in 1991, and then spread
throughout the southern United States and was responsible for a
number of fish kills in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

"The virus is the kind of thing that may be lurking all the time,"
said DGIF fisheries biologist Dan Michaelson, "but when you have an
environmental stress like the hot temperatures . . . [the fish] just
become more susceptible when they're stressed." Michaelson emphasized
that the number of deaths in Briery wasn't huge, and the fishing
hasn't suffered noticeably, but, he added, there's no way to tell if
it will in the future. Given the lake's popularity, he said, "It's
something we're going to keep a very close eye on."

The hope in Prince Edward County is that Briery Creek Lake escapes
the fate currently befalling Kerr Reservoir (Buggs Island Lake) to
the south. LMBV also has been found there and in much greater
numbers, leading to a significant decline in the fishery.

"We actually were approached by anglers last winter saying they were
starting to see a decline," Michaelson said. "And the way they
described it -- not catching as many 3-4 pound fish, taking longer to
catch those fish -- it immediately sounded to us like some sort of a
disease." The biologists working the case didn't know it was LMBV at
1st, but they immediately began sampling and testing, looking at
growth and mortality rates as well as surveying local anglers. From
the last time the department sampled Buggs Island Lake in 2004 to
this year, he said, "mortality went way up. It was about a 10 percent
increase in mortality. And growth declined a little bit."

A total of 41 percent of sampled fish tested positive for the virus,
and unlike at Briery so far, they're dying in numbers big enough to
impact the fishing, especially for larger bass.

"It's definitely harder on larger fish," Michaelson said. "There's
not as many big fish for one thing, so if 40 percent of the
population has it, that's 40 percent of a lot fewer fish when you're
talking about big fish."

As with many viruses fish can acquire, not much is known about LMBV.
Michaelson said they're not sure how it arrived in Virginia from
points much farther south, and right now there's nothing that can be
done about it. In places such as Alabama and Texas, it was "about a
3-year cycle where they saw declines and then it improved real
rapidly. Hopefully, at Buggs Island, it'll be the same thing."

But he tempered that hopeful thought with this one: "We don't have
growth rates like they do in Texas. It may take a little longer to
recover than what they saw down there."

Fewer fish and longer waits for dwindling lunkers is the new normal
at Kerr Reservoir. At Briery Creek Lake and elsewhere, the fishing
holds, but no one knows why or if it will last.

[LMBV is in the family Iridoviridae. There are 4 genus level groups
in the Iridoviridae family, _Iridovirus_, _Chloriridovirus_,
_Ranavirus_, and _Lymphocystisvirus_. It is not known what genus this
specific virus belongs to.

The virus was 1st discovered in Florida but its true origin remains
unknown. However the disease has been diagnosed in Texas, Virginia,
Tennessee, Oklahoma, Vermont, Mississippi, Indiana, Illinois,
Kentucky, South Carolina, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Arkansas,
Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Louisiana and Georgia, in addition to Florida.

Fish that are carriers of the virus may not appear visibly ill. The
virus kills largemouth bass, but may not kill other fish that it
infects. The disease has been found in guppies, bluegill, crappies,
sunfish and smallmouth bass. Some largemouth bass may carry the
disease and do well until a stressor effects them. Some stressors
include water temperatures above normal, or temperatures above normal
for long periods of time, overcrowding, pollution, poor nutrition,
other infections and frequent handling by anglers.

The virus can be transmitted through the water, by contact with
infected fish, and consumption of prey that may be infected.

Sadly, much remains to learn about this disease, especially how to
prevent it or control it.
