4 Cambodians dead, 59 sick after eating turtle
-----------------------------------------------
4 Cambodians died and another 59 suffered food poisoning after eating a sea
turtle, officials said on Wed 15 Jun 2005.
Fishermen caught the 34 kg (75 lb) turtle off the south coast on 12 Jun
2005, local police chief Kheng Sophal told Reuters. Some villagers made
curry with the meat, and others fried it. Women and children were among
those who became ill, he said.
"Our fishermen keep all species they net from the sea for food, because we
are poor," Kheng Sophal said, in a country where an estimated 36 percent of
the 13 million people make less than USD 1.00 a day.
He did not identify the type of turtle eaten. Many species of sea turtles
are on the endangered list.

[ProMED would appreciate more information regarding this and similar
events. Episodes of sea turtle poisoning can be found in the literature. An
example of one episode was posted in the Sea Turtle List-serve
<cturtle@lists.ufl.edu> by a marine conservation officer in the Solomon
Islands:
"28 people (20 children and 8 adults) of Niniveh Village in Marovo Lagoon,
western province, Solomon Islands suffered nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pains, needles and pins and general weakness after eating turtle meat
(which turtle species is yet to be confirmed) on the evening of 16 Jan
2001. The symptoms described occurred 4 - 6 hours after consumption of
turtle meat. The said people consumed only turtle meat (no other protein
source consumed). Those who did not consume turtle meat did not experience
the symptoms.
6 people (all children between 3 months - 11 years old) out of the 28
people died within 5 days. Observers reported that the turtle, when caught,
was weak; upon being butchered, it was reported to have gut contents
smaller than usual; there was a strong smell of urea/urine in the gut, and
the meat was unusually soft."

Yasumoto T: Fish poisoning due to toxins of microalgal origin in the
Pacific. Toxicon 1998; 36:1515-18:
"From the meat of a turtle, _Chelonia mydas_, implicated in fatal
intoxication, lyngbyatoxin A was identified. . . As turtles feed on sea
grass, contaminating blue-green algae belonging to genus _Lyngbya_ were
deduced to be the source of the toxin."
Ranaivoson G, Champetier de Ribes G, Mamy ER, et al: Mass food poisoning
after eating sea turtle in the Antalaha district. [Article in French] Arch
Inst Pasteur Madagascar. 1994; 61:84-6:
Abstract: In December 1994, a mass food poisoning through ingestion of
turtle affected about 60 persons on the northeastern coast of Madagascar.
The prevailing clinical signs were digestive (nausea, vomiting, dysphagia,
acute stomatitis) and might persist during several weeks. The poisoning
attack rate was 48 percent with a lethality of 7.7 percent. Such [an]
accident, even if rare in Madagascar, requires a structured organization to
control sea products poisoning and to set up adequate prevention measures.
Turtle poisoning (chelonitoxication) appears to be caused by eating the
flesh of certain marine turtles (Green Sea Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle,
Leatherback Turtle). Turtle meat is considered a delicacy in many
countries. Hawksbills carry a toxin in their skin called chelonitoxin,
which may be accumulated through the food chain as noted above. People who
eat the skin and/or meat of the turtle can experience nausea, a burning
sensation of the lips tongue and mouth, difficulty in swallowing and a
tightness in the chest, skin rash, enlargement of the liver, or even coma
and death. - Mod.LL]
