The Nigerian Army has raised an alarm over an outbreak of Lassa fever. A statement on Wednesday [16 Jan 2019] by Maj Ikechukwu Eze, the acting deputy director of Army Public Relations, 3 Division, said the disease killed an officer on Tuesday [15 Jan 2019].

[The statement] read: "The Headquarters 3 Division wishes to inform the general public that a male senior non-commissioned officer of the division was admitted and being managed for resistant malaria at the 3 Div Hospital after returning from Kogi state, where he went for his father's burial.

"Consequently, the soldier was managed, but there was no significant improvement, which resulted to him being referred to Bingham University Teaching Hospital (Jankwano) Jos for further management. Unfortunately, the soldier died on Tue 15 Jan 2019, 4 days after his case was reported. Available medical information confirmed that the soldier may have died of Lassa fever."

The division said that while the investigation is ongoing, it had taken the following measures:

- Contact tracing and monitoring for both primary and secondary contacts in collaboration with representatives of World Health Organization (WHO) and medical personnel of Bingham University Teaching Hospital and 3 Division Medical Services and Hospital.

- Sensitization for residents of Maxwell Khobe Cantonment, the host community, and the general public has also commenced.

"The general officer Commanding has further directed that the entire Maxwell Khobe Cantonment be fumigated," Maj Eze said.

[Lassa fever virus transmission will occur as Nigeria enters the new period when an increase in cases usually occurs. The above case is indicative of the sporadic cases that occur annually across a broad geographic range in Nigeria. Since no mention is made of hospital transmission, the individual presumably was infected by viruses shed by rodent hosts. It would be interesting to know if Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in this area.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus can be seen as follows:

The Kwara state government has confirmed 2 cases of Lassa fever infecting a husband and wife in the state.

Speaking with newsmen on Tuesday [15 Jan 2019] at a news briefing, the Kwara commissioner for health, Alhaji Usman Rifun-Kolo, said the outbreak of Lassa fever was identified in a farm settlement in Taberu, Baruten local government area.

He explained that the 2 cases of the disease affected a husband and wife, natives of Benin republic, which shares a border with the state. He added that the husband and wife are farming in Baruten. "These cases of Lassa fever originated from Benin republic, whose citizen have interrelations with people in the Baruten area," he said.

According to him, the husband and wife were diagnosed in a health facility, and the state government had already deployed a disease-surveillance team to identify those who have been in contact with the patients.

Rifun-Kolo further explained that the surveillance team identified 4 people with a history of fever in the area. He said that the 4 cases raised suspicion of Lassa fever, which prompted them to take samples from the individuals for further investigation. He noted that the 4 individuals have commenced treatment in Taberu, Baruten LGA.

[The above report states that the couple was infected in Benin, although the timeline when that may have occurred is not given. The report also mentions 4 individuals in the Kwara state who had a history of Lassa fever, implying that the virus is present in that state in Nigeria as well. In December [2018], there were Lassa fever cases in Benin that were imported from Nigeria as well as infections that were locally acquired in Benin, so the Lassa fever cases cross the border in both directions. The source of the infecting virus for any of these cases is not mentioned. - Mod.TY
