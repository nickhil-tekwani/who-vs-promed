A Further Comment on Measles Encephalopathy without Rash
--------------------------------------------------------
There is not much I could add to Marjorie Pollack's elegant
epidemiologic assessment of the so-called measles outbreaks ("Siliguri
fever") in North Bengal and across the border in Bangladesh [see
20010709.1327. However, a few comments might be in order before
ProMED-mail cuts the thread on further discussions of this diagnostic
mess.
1. Measles encephalopathy is rare.
2. Outbreaks of measles encephalopathy are unknown.
3. There was no atypical measles virus circulating in the area where
the cases occurred.
4. Uninformed treatment with salicylates may as likely have been the
etiologic agent of these apparent instances of Reye's syndrome as
anything
else.
5. The laboratory documentation of the diagnosis of measles is
woefully incomplete in these cases, possibly inadequate. The absence
of rash in the presence of antibody is inconsistent with a diagnosis
of measles. At the most, these could be considered measles virus
infections, but certainly not measles cases. Measles without rash is
like hemorrhagic fever without bleeding.
6. Cases occurred in all age groups, which is unlikely to be
consistent with measles in India, particularly in a place where
measles vaccine has been given on a regular basis over a long period
of time and immunity to this virus is extremely high. This reminds me
of the Malaysian experience with the newly-recognized Nipah virus,
first thought to be an inordinately pathogenic strain of Japanese
encephalitis virus in a Japanese encephalitis virus-immune population.
Nonsense.
7. Cases in a nursing home and among medical staff are inconsistent
with the usual measles distribution.
8. Unreported messages from Indian epidemiologists and elsewhere
indicated that the field investigations were not handled at all well.
I suggest that ProMED-mail cut the thread on this apparent hysterical
diagnosis before more misinformation is disseminated.

[Prolonged enquiries by ProMED-mail have failed to obtain confirmation
of the laboratory isolation and characterization of atypical strains
of measles virus associated with these outbreaks of disease, or of any
such atypical measles viruses in circulation in the northeastern
region of the Indian subcontinent at the present time. In the absence
of such evidence, further discussion of these outbreaks is
terminated. - Mod.CP
