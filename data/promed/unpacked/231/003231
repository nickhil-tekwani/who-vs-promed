The number of scarlet fever and measles cases reported in Kent has hit worrying new levels in the past year [2018]. But perhaps more worryingly, cases of scarlet fever hit their highest level since available records began in 2010.

Scarlet fever is a very contagious, seasonal bacterial illness that usually presents with a sore throat, fever, headaches, and a rosy rash that generally starts on a patient's chest. It mainly affects children and the sickness usually peaks between December and May, meaning we are now in its prime season.

The figures show there [was] a record high of 1143 cases of scarlet fever reported in Kent in 2018, up from 362 in 2017. PHE [Public Health England] suggested that the increase in cases in scarlet fever was partly due to more infections, but also partly due to more awareness of the condition leading to better reporting.

Reported scarlet fever cases across the whole country hit a record 31 865 in 2018, up from 17 813 in 2017.

Two of the most severe, but rare, forms of invasive GAS [group A streptococcal] disease are necrotising fasciitis (occasionally described as "the flesh-eating bacteria") and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. There were 663 cases of invasive group A streptococcal disease in 2018, the highest number since records began in 2010.
