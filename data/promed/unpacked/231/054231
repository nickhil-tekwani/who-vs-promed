Investigators at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) [Spain]
and of the Parc Tauli Hospital in Sabadell have detected more than 40
cases of a rare infectious disease, which is transmitted by ticks
that feed on wild boars and which is primarily affecting children.

Unlike ticks on dogs, which are much more common, these hematophagous
arachnids (that feed on blood) are larger in size, are more active in
autumn and winter, and are usually found in medium and high
mountainous zones, and found on animals such as sheep or pigs,
according to Dr Ferran Segura, director of the Parc Tauli-UAB
Department of Infectious Diseases. Upon penetration of a person's
skin, this tick, called _Dermacentor marginatus_, transmits an
infection, which while not severe, provokes a series of symptoms and
sequelae to those affected.

So far, the Sabadell Hospital has identified 40 cases, mostly
children (89 percent) and skiers and mountaineers who had tick bites
while walking in the countryside, in wooded areas, or in areas at
high latitudes.

[Based on the information given, the information strongly suggests
that the illness reported is tick-borne lymphadenopathy, a disease
caused by _Rickettsia slovaca_ with the tick vector being _Dermacentor
marginatus_. Reported from Spain initially in 2004 (1) [see ProMED
ref. at end], the infection had previously been reported from France
(2) and Hungary (3), both in 1997.

The disease (sometimes shortened to TIBOLA) occurs primarily during
the colder months unlike most other tick-related diseases. It
presents with a local eschar (similar to the 'tache noir' of
Mediterranean spotted fever), sometimes with an erythema migrans-like
rash around it, headache, and the development of painful regional
lymph node enlargement. There is rarely any other rash and fever is
not prominent (4). In Spain, adult _D. marginatus_ feed on wild boars
(_Sus scrofa_) but in other areas of Europe a variety of other
mammals can be blood sources.
