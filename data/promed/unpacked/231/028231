Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Uganda
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH), Uganda, has confirmed an outbreak of
Ebola haemorrhagic fever, in Bundibugyo District, western Uganda. As
of Thu 28 Nov 2007, 51 suspected cases, including 16 deaths have been
reported. Among the reported cases, 3 health care workers were also
infected, including one fatality. The patients are being hospitalized
at Kikyo and Bundibugyo.

Laboratory analysis undertaken at the National Reference Laboratories
and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta,
USA, has confirmed the presence of a new species of Ebola virus in
samples taken from cases associated with the outbreak.

Based on initial field investigations, the MoH/WHO Country office has
reported that the outbreak might have been ongoing since September
2007. A national task force comprising MoH, WHO and other
international partners in the field, is coordinating the response to
this outbreak. WHO Country office is assisting the MOH national field
team and the District health officials.

Uganda's Ebola outbreak is new strain
------------------------------------------------
A lethal Ebola virus that has killed at least 16 people and infected
51 others in western Uganda is a previously unknown strain, health
authorities said Friday [30 Nov 2007]. Analysis on victims' blood and
tissue samples sent to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease
Control's pathogens laboratory behaved differently from previous
known strains of Ebola, they said. "It is a new type of strain. It is
different from the one we suffered in Gulu and also different from
the one that was reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo," said
Sam Okware, who chairs Uganda's national hemorrhagic fever task
force. The 1st Ebola case was reported on 10 Nov 2007 in Bundibugyo
district on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 3
patients are currently in an isolation ward.

Virologists say previous strains destroyed the linings of blood
capillaries and vessels, prompting fluids to drain out of the
circulatory system through the body's orifices and pores, killing the
victim through shock. But there is not much bleeding in the new
strain that appears to kill its victims after provoking a high fever,
they say.

Authorities have assembled epidemiologists and virologists in the
affected district to monitor the disease. "We have put our people on
alert for anyone who is complaining of fever, abdominal pain,
vomiting and has developed rashes," Okware said, referring to the
early symptoms of the disease caused by the new strain.

An outbreak of Ebola, a highly contagious disease that can have
fatality rates as high as 90 percent, killed at least 170 people in
northern Uganda's Gulu district in 2000. A similar outbreak has
killed at least 26 people in the West Kasai region of the Democratic
Republic of Congo in recent weeks, according to the country's Health
Minister Victor Makwenge Kaput.

It spreads by direct human contact, especially through infected
blood. The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 in Sudan and in a
nearby region of Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire).
Outbreaks of Ebola have also occurred in the Ivory Coast and Gabon.

[The difference in symptoms of the disease associated with this new
strain of Ebola virus, and its less hemorrhagic presentation, may
account in part for the delay in identifying the causes of the
outbreak. On the basis of the WHO report it must be presumed that the
disease was present in the region for several weeks prior to
recognition of the 1st case on 10 Nov 2007.
