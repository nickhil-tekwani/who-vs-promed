Man at center of Las Vegas ricin case arrested, charged
-------------------------------------------------------
An unemployed graphic designer who authorities believe was nearly
killed by ricin was arrested Wednesday [16 Apr 2008] on federal
charges of possessing the deadly toxin in what he described as an
"exotic idea," never carried out, to poison unspecified enemies.

[The man] was arrested upon his release from the hospital where he
had been treated since 14 Feb 2008.

He is charged with possession of a biological toxin and 2 weapons
offenses stemming from materials authorities said were found 26 Feb
2008 and 28 Feb 2008 in his room at an extended-stay motel several
blocks off the Las Vegas Strip.

"He was released from the hospital and he's in custody," said FBI
Special Agent Joseph Dickey, spokesman for the bureau's Las Vegas
office.

The charges carry a possible penalty of 30 years in federal prison
and a USD 750 000 fine. [The man], 57, was scheduled to appear
Wednesday [16 Apr 2008] afternoon before a federal judge in US
District Court in Las Vegas. Prosecutors allege in a 6-page complaint
that [he] obtained castor beans by mail in June 2002 and made ricin
from them while living in Reno and in the basement of his cousin's
house in Riverton, Utah.

Cancer research is the only legal use for ricin, which has no
antidote and can be lethal in amounts the size of the head of a pin.

Authorities do not allege [the man's] possession of ricin had
anything to do with terrorism, according to court documents. "[He]
characterized the production of ricin as an 'exotic idea,'" the
complaint said.

Over the course of several interviews with the FBI, "[the graphic
designer] admitted that there have been people who have made him mad
over the years and he had thoughts about causing them harm to the
point of making some plans," the complaint said. "However, he
maintained that he never acted on those thoughts or plans."

Officials say [his] symptoms were consistent with ricin exposure, but
it may never be certain that the toxin sickened him because all
traces of the substance are eliminated from the body within days, and
the ricin in his hotel room was found well after he got sick.

[His] cousin, 54, was charged this month in Salt Lake City with
misprision of felony, which officials said means he had knowledge of
a crime but failed to report it. [The man charged] told investigators
that [his cousin] was not involved in the production of the toxin.

[The man's] brother said he spoke with him Tuesday [15 Apr 2008] by
telephone. "He just said he wasn't going to face charges, but I don't
think that was based on fact," said [the brother], who lives in
Escondido, Calif. "It's my impression that he didn't understand the
hazard he posed." [He added] he did not know whether his brother had
spoken to an attorney.

[The graphic designer], who lived with his dog and 2 cats, summoned
an ambulance to his Las Vegas motel room 14 Feb 2008 complaining of
respiratory distress. He spent almost 4 weeks unconscious at a Las
Vegas hospital. Family members said he also was treated for kidney
failure.

[His cousin] was collecting [the man's] belongings from the motel
room 28 Feb 2008 when he gave a motel manager a plastic bag
containing several vials of what turned out to be ricin powder.

The complaint characterizes the ricin found in Las Vegas as "crude."

Police and homeland security officials have said they found no ricin
contamination in any place [the man charged] stayed.
