This memorandum provides an update regarding APHIS' and Idaho State
Department of Agriculture's ongoing efforts in response to the pale potato
cyst nematode (PCN), _Globodera pallida_, finds in Idaho.
After the initial detection of PCN in Idaho on 19 Apr 2006 a 2nd detection
occurred on 13 Jun 2006 from a 45 acre field in northern Bingham County.
Soil samples tested positive for pale PCN based on morphological and DNA
analyses. Production in the area is for fresh market and processed
potatoes, not seed potatoes. As part of the investigation following the
initial April detection, more than 4800 samples, representing over 75
fields and facilities associated with the positive detection, have been
collected and tested, and as part of these investigations, additional
suspect fields were identified.
On 12 Jul 2006, a soil sample from another field within the same farming
operation in northern Bingham County also tested positive for pale PCN.
Confirmation was made based on morphological and DNA analyses.
The 2 positive fields are about 0.5 miles apart.
APHIS and ISDA continue to implement a rigorous detection and delimiting
survey of adjacent and associated fields and facilities. A statewide survey
of commercial and seed potato production systems will be conducted during
the current and future years. Regulatory plans are being developed.
Additionally, best management practices for field and facilities sanitation
are being developed for statewide distribution.

[2] 2nd Idaho field with pale PCN

State and federal inspectors have found another field in Bingham County in
eastern Idaho with pale PCN, but say they are confident the infestation
isn't widespread.
In April 2006, Japan banned all fresh potato imports from the United
States, and Canada and Mexico banned all fresh potato imports from Idaho,
after the pale PCNs were found.
Officials say the pest is not harmful to humans and doesn't have any effect
on the potatoes themselves. But it feeds on the roots of the potato plant
and can reduce crop production by as much as 80 per cent.
Officials say the second field with the cyst nematodes is about half a mile
from the 1st field, and that both fields have been quarantined.

On 19 Apr 2006, officials of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) and the Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA)
announced the detection of the pale potato cyst nematode (PCN), _Globodera
pallida_, a major pest of potato crops. This was the first detection of the
pest in the United States. The nematode cysts were detected during a
routine survey of tare soil at an ISDA grader facility in eastern Idaho. In
that survey, more than 3500 samples were analyzed, and only one was
positive. That survey, conducted as part of Cooperative Agricultural Pest
Survey (CAPS), is designed to demonstrate that areas are free of exotic
nematodes or, if they are present, to detect them as soon as possible after
their introduction into domestic production systems.
On 13 Jun 2006, soil samples collected from a 45 acre field in northern
Bingham County tested positive for pale PCN. On 12 Jul 2006, a soil sample
from a 2nd 60 acre field in Bingham County tested positive. The 2nd
positive finding was not surprising because of the field's proximity to the
already-identified positive field. ISDA and APHIS officials continue to
believe the pale PCN infestation in eastern Idaho is isolated because of
the more than 6175 additional samples taken since the April detection, all
have been negative for pale PCN except for those from the 2 fields. The
6175 samples taken since April are from investigations involving 17
production fields, 21 seed potato fields, and 54 facilities. Additional
surveillance will continue.
The goals of APHIS and ISDA in the pale PCN Response and Recovery Program
are to:
- prevent the spread of pale PCN;
- delimit the current infestation;
- restore lost foreign markets;
- preserve current markets.
Updates and related information:
ISDA and APHIS continue to search for the original pale PCN source. A trace
of seed sources for the 1st positive field has been completed, but did not
yield any helpful information.
Investigation into seed sources for the 2nd positive field is progressing.
Investigators continue to examine other possibilities for introduction of
pale PCN into Idaho, including imported farm equipment, nursery stock,
foreign flower bulbs, illicit potato seed importation, and other means.
Surveyors continue to sample fields that are located near the positive
detections or have common equipment, tenants or workers.
Additional unassociated fields are being surveyed in eastern Idaho and a
plan for a statewide survey is being developed.
The new ISDA Nematology lab in Twin Falls should reach full processing
capacity in a few weeks, speeding the survey program.
The 2 positive fields are under federal restrictions (no more potatoes to
be planted, no soil to leave and equipment to be cleaned). Plans are being
developed to provide safeguards when the current crop of potatoes from the
2nd positive field is transported to a nearby processing plant.
Canada, Mexico and Korea have stopped importation of Idaho potatoes. Japan
has stopped importation of US potatoes.
Officials from ISDA and APHIS continue to work with trade partners to
inform them of the PCN response and recovery program in Idaho. Both
agencies are answering Japan's questions about the PCN situation in Idaho
in an effort to reopen the Japanese market to US chipping potatoes.
Canadian and Japanese agricultural officials have planned visits to Idaho
in August to review progress in the PCN Response and Recovery Program.
Canada has stopped importation of balled and burlaped nursery stock from
Idaho, but recent communication from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
indicates that a resolution to the embargo may be reached in the near future.
Idaho and national potato industry officials continue to work closely with
ISDA and APHIS to encourage cooperation by growers, packers and processors
to insure that delimiting surveys are conducted swiftly and efficiently.
Several grower and industry outreach meetings have been conducted and more
are planned for the near future.
The APHIS PCN Regulatory Work Plan is nearing completion and will be
published as a federal order followed by an interim rule in the next few
weeks. As that time approaches the necessity of the ISDA Quarantine issued
27 Apr 2006 will be evaluated and if necessary state rules may be
promulgated to parallel the Federal Work Plan.

[The crop plant potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) is susceptible to the potato
cyst nematode (PCN). PCN is found in many places where potatoes are grown,
including Europe. The white or pale PCN (_Globodera pallida_) was reported
for the 1st time in the USA in Idaho 21 Apr 2006 (20060423.1195). Prior to
that report _G. pallida_ was only known in Newfoundland, Canada in North
America (see link for worldwide distribution map).
This update contains reports from the North American Plant Protection
Organization (NAPPO), from a news source, and from the Idaho Center for
Potato Research and Education at the University of Idaho, College of
Agriculture and Life Sciences. They each provide details about a 2nd
infestation, from a pair of fields in northern Bingham County, south of
Idaho Falls. Both fields are under federal restrictions. The detection of
cysts in soil samples from the fields is significant. The more intense soil
sampling predicted in a previous posting (20060615.1657) has clearly been
accomplished (6175 additional samples taken since the April detection). The
fact they all have been negative for pale PCN except for those from the 2
fields seems to suggest there is a low probability of a widespread
infestation in Idaho. Despite this, Canada, Mexico and Korea have stopped
importation of Idaho potatoes and Japan has stopped importation of US
potatoes. The duration of such actions may depend on an APHIS PCN
Regulatory Work Plan, which has yet to be issued. How these isolated
infestations were introduced remains a mystery. The 3rd item provides
details about how the State of Idaho is responding.
