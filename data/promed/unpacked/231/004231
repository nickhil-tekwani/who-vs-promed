Discovery of new human case of avian influenza
----------------------------------------------
Dr Abdel Rahman Shahin, spokesman for the Egyptian Ministry of
Health, has stated that today [19 Jan 2011] a new human case of bird
flu [avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection] has been discovered.
The case is an 18-month-old child in the governorate of Alexandria.
This case is the 121st since the onset of the disease in Egypt in March 2006.

He stated that the child has been admitted to a hospital in
Alexandria and is suffering from high fever, cough, runny, and
febrile convulsion. The child had been exposed to domestic birds
(chickens and ducks) that appeared to be infected with bird flu. The
child was given Tamiflu and his health condition is now stable.
