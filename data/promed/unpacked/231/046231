INFECTION CONTROL - UTAH, USA
=============================
Date: Fri, 31 May 1996 13:57:44 -0700
From: Infection Control - Utah, USA

Here at our facility, we see approximately 5 to 6 cases
a year of MRSA, usually linked to the patients' previous
admission at a larger facility.
In Utah, the State
epidemiology lab reports at least 6 cases of
Vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE), mostly in
the Salt Lake Valley area, within the last year or so.
VRE is not listed as reportable, so the actual number
may be higher. We have not seen any VRE here in
Logan, yet.

May I add how valuable I have found ProMED-mail to be.
[Thank you very much, Debbi - Mod.JW]
Each email is like a "mini-inservice", and I have
learned a great deal. At our Infection Control
committees, as well as education and information for
staff and physicians, we try to include community
data, as well as state, regional, national and
international data, not just what goes on in the facility.
For example, I've used the reports from ProMED-mail as
part of education pieces, such as the diphtheria
outbreak in the Russian Federation, to educate my
staff that, No, diphtheria has *not* disappeared from the
world, and it's important to keep their Td vaccinations
current. I used the influenza reports to encourage
our staff to get "flu shots". It's an ongoing struggle to
get staff as well as physicians to see that infection
control has to reach beyond the four walls of our
facility.
