China reports new bird flu outbreak in Inner Mongolia
-----------------------------------------------------
BEIJING: China has reported its first outbreak of bird flu in over 6 weeks
after poultry were found dead in the far north of the country. The H5N1
virus killed 985 chickens in a village in Baotou city in Inner Mongolia,
the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday, citing the Ministry
of Agriculture. Nearly 9000 other chickens had been slaughtered to prevent
the outbreak spreading, the ministry said.
No date was given for when the first signs of the bird flu appeared, but
the virus was confirmed as H5N1 on Friday. The infected area had been
quarantined and the outbreak was under control, according to the ministry.
The last report of an outbreak of bird flu in China was on 16 August, when
the agriculture ministry said that 200 000 fowl had been slaughtered at a
duck farm in Hunan province, central China.
The latest case in Inner Mongolia brings to 39 the number of bird flu
outbreaks among poultry in China since October last year.
Twenty-one people in China have contracted bird flu, and 14 of them have
died, according to official figures. The most recent fatality occurred in
July in the western region of Xinjiang. China confirmed in August that its
first human bird flu victim died in late 2003, 2 years earlier than
previously reported.
