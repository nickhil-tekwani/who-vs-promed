The Urban Caracal Project was saddened to announce the death of Orion, one of the 1st caracals the organisation collared. Collars are used to monitor movements and foraging behaviours. Orion was first captured in August 2016 near Cape Point and weighed 12.2 kg (26.8 lb).

He died in the same month in which he was tagged and is the 1st cat to form part of the Urban Caracal Project's "Meet the Cats" feature, which allows the organisation to introduce the cats to all those who support their work. Orion's cause of death has been attributed to pesticides and disease.

"Our testing shows he was exposed to anticoagulant rat poisons, as well as DDT and PCBs, and evidence of blood parasites, while tests for other common feline diseases are still pending," the organisation said. "Rat poisons frequently accumulate through the food web and become concentrated in predators, like caracal, that feed repeatedly on poisoned 'target' animals. When the rodents we target eat anticoagulant rat poisons, they can take up to 10 days to die, can become disoriented, and can easily be eaten by a predator in that time.

"Even so-called 'safe' or 'owl-friendly' poisons (such as Racumin and Rattax) act in this way. Because predators, such as caracals, are often chronically exposed to these anticoagulant rat poisons, they too may eventually die directly of exposure, or indirectly if they become more vulnerable to other stressors such as disease. Our testing has shown that 94% of caracals are exposed to rat poisons in Cape Town, and so this issue is extremely common."

The organisation thus encourages Capetonians not to use poison in their homes or businesses.

"First, reduce the amount of food and shelter for rodents by reducing waste, not feeding wildlife and sealing holes. Then look for poison-free alternatives, such as owl boxes or snap traps," it advised.

[The caracal (_Caracal caracal_) is a medium-sized wild cat native to Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and India. It is characterised by a robust build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears, and long canine teeth. Its coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, while the ventral parts are lighter with small reddish markings. It reaches 40-50 cm (16-20 in) at the shoulder and weighs 8-19 kg (18-42 lb). It was first scientifically described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776. Three subspecies are recognised (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal). A photo of a caracal may be seen at http://www.itsnature.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/caracal1.jpg.

Caracals are fascinating animals but are not generally of the temperament to be a pet. They can be destructive and are not prone to wanting to cuddle, as house cats. They are a larger version, weighing in at approximately a maximum of 20 kg (44 lb). Hissing is a warning to stay back. For more information on caracals' personality, as well as some excellent photos, see http://www.lifewithcatman.com/catman/caracal-cat-pet/.

The name caracal is derived from a Turkish word "karakulak" meaning "black ear." The caracal was once trained for bird hunting in Iran and India. They were put into arenas containing a flock of pigeons, and wagers were made as to how many the cat would take down. This is the origination of the expression "to put a cat amongst the pigeons." The caracal is capable of leaping into the air and knocking down 10-12 birds at one time (https://bigcatrescue.org/caracal-facts/).

In consideration of the vast impact of rodents' activities on public health throughout the world, the usefulness of rodenticides to control their populations is unquestionable. Insofar as possible, limiting their access to food and harborage should control rodent populations. There is an antidote allowing for effective treatment (vitamin K). Attempts have been made to identify and develop so-called natural substances extracted from plants, but so far without real success. For wild animals, treatment with vitamin K may not be feasible, as they first have to be caught, or when they are caught it is because they are already dying from the rodenticide and may not be able to be saved.

Rodenticides, used to control rats and mice around dwellings, represent an example of a potent toxic hazard to which animals are more often exposed than humans. Rodenticides are often placed near places where rodent infestation exists but where pets and wildlife may also have access. The toxic elements in some rodenticides are anticoagulants, including warfarin and related compounds, killing rodents by causing internal bleeding. The signs of rodenticide ingestion are bleeding complications, including hematomas, GI bleeding, hematuria, anemia, and prolongation of the bleeding, especially internal bleeding as well as the international normalized ratio. Treatment consists of administration of vitamin K to reverse the warfarin effect on the coagulation pathway. Unfortunately, wild animals, especially caracals, and birds of prey would be unable to receive this treatment.

A newer rodenticide agent, bromethalin, is a neurotoxic agent that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria of the CNS. Animals poisoned with bromethalin develop cerebral edema and neurological signs including ataxia and paralysis (portions of commentary extracted from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/rodenticides). - Mod.TG
