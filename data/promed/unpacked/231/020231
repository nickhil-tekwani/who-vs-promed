Cermaq ASA Norway [a salmon farming company] has detected infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus in 2 pens at its farming site Langoyhovden in Nordland, northern Norway.

Although mortality at the site is low and there are no clinical signs of outbreak, Cermaq is considering culling the fish in the 2 affected pens to prevent the spread of infection to the remaining fish at the site.

The Langoyfjord site contains approximately 660 000 fish of an average live weight of 2.6 kg. Out of these, 173 000 fish will be culled.

The culling of these fish is expected to have only limited financial impact, said Cermaq. The firm has notified the Food Authority.

Following an ISA outbreak at other [salmon] farming operators' sites in the region, Cermaq has monitored its operations with regular testing, said the company.

Back in May [2014], ISA virus was confirmed at a farm belonging to Egil Kristofferson & sonner in Bo commune, in Nordland. A month earlier [April 2014], also in northern Norway, the virus was confirmed at another salmon farm belonging to Jokelfjord Laks.

[ISA is a disease of Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) caused by an orthomyxovirus and affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease can be systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs.

It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry. The disease is of obligatory notification to the OIE.

One wonders what the epidemiological connection is between the 3 affected farms -- do they import stock from each other and from outside Nordland? - Mod.JW]
