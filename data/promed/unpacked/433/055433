In Thailand, the world's 4th biggest chicken exporter before bird flu
struck in 2004, a single chicken at an isolated house in the eastern
province of Rayong had been confirmed to have been infected by the virus.
The remoteness of the Rayong house led officials to believe that the
chicken had been infected by wild birds, Livestock Department chief Yukol
Limlaemthong said.
Migratory wild fowl, which can carry the virus without showing symptoms,
are widely blamed for bringing it to Asia, and experts say H5N1 is now
endemic in the region.
Thailand banned all poultry imports after its 1st outbreak in January 2004.

[Thailand has meticulously sent weekly follow-up updates on HPAI to the OIE
since 6 Feb 2004. All can be seen at OIE's last "Update on Avian Influenza
in Animals in Asia (Type H5)", published 14 Jan 2005.
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/A_AI-Asia.htm >
In its last follow-up report of 14 Jan 2005 (No. 40), Thailand reported an
HPAI outbreak in Rayong province, Klaeng district, during the preceding
week. The outbreak affected a flock of 40 native chickens and 10 cases were
recorded; the remaining 30 birds were destroyed. During the preceding week
(the 1st week of 2005), 7 outbreaks were reported (6 in Phitsanulok
province and 1 in Nakhon Sawan province).
According to the reports, the outbreaks are "part of the highly pathogenic
avian influenza epizootic affecting the country since the re-occurrence of
the disease on 3 Jul 2004". - Mod.AS]
