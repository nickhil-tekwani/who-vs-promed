[1] Senegal: declared Ebola free by WHO

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Senegal is over
------------------------------------------------------
Senegal is now free of Ebola virus transmission. 42 days have now passed since the last contact of Senegal's single confirmed case of Ebola virus disease completed the requisite 21-day monitoring period, under medical supervision, developed no symptoms, and tested negative for the virus.

The response to Senegal's 1st case, confirmed on 29 Aug [2014], on the part of President Macky Sall, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, headed by Dr Awa Coll-Seck, and several other sectors of government, carries some instructive lessons for many other developing countries that are now wisely preparing to respond to an imported case. Other lessons come from staff at the WHO country office, senior epidemiologists sent to investigate and support the response, and WHO's many institutional partners in outbreak response.... -- more

Ebola comes to last safe district in Sierra Leone
-------------------------------------------------
Ebola has infected 2 people in last untouched district -- Koinadugu -- of Sierra Leone, far north; 15 people have also died....

Planes can't fly to the affected countries because they are afraid they will be refused landing elsewhere, said the African Union chair Nkosazana Zuma on Thursday [16 Oct 2014] and airlines that wanted to restart service couldn't. Currently only Moroccan airlines and Brussels Air fly to all 3 countries. Sierra Leone's Finance Minister Kaifalah Marah on Thursday warned that border closures and cutting flights were "killing our economies," describing the isolation as a de facto economic embargo.... -- more

[4] Nigeria: outbreak response
Date: Sat 18 Oct 2014
From: Tamsin Dew <t.dewe14@imperial.ac.uk> [edited]


A very impressive, transparent and enlightening talk was given at Imperial College London last night [17 Oct 2014] by Mrs. Sara Beysolow Nyanti, Team Lead for Management & Coordination in the National Ebola Emergency Operation Center, Nigeria; Chief of Office, UNICEF Lagos. I don't know how much of this information is in the public eye already, but Mrs. Nyanti described the Nigerian outbreak response in detail and I urge you to contact her for further information about it.

The response was co-ordinated by Ebola Emergency Operation Centres (EOC) established in Lagos and Port Harcourt and involved heads of 6 different teams (epi/surveillance, clinical management, organisation/management, etc) reporting to a single Incident Manager, Dr Faisal Shuaib from the Federal Ministry of Health/Nigerian CDC. Appointments were skills- and motivation-driven, from a variety of state and federal government bodies and technical partners (including MSF). Far-sighted governmental support, strong leadership, and solid communication and co-operation between different individuals and groups seem to have been critical.

Daily team meetings and strategy group round tables were implemented and all tasks were allocated, tracked and followed up daily. An isolation ward was purpose built under guidance from MSF [Medecins Sans Frontieres]. Danger pay and risk-based life insurance policies were implemented for all at-risk staff. A dedicated rumour line was established and all calls responded to. A social mobilisation and communication team that targeted neighbourhoods of contacts (using GIS to go house-to-house, radially) was instrumental in reducing stigma and spreading important information about the disease, as well as gathering additional leads.

Mrs. Nyanti reports the following figures:
- 899 contacts traced (only 1 lost to follow-up)
- 20 cases, 8 deaths, CFR [case fatality rate] of 40 percent
- 1289 staff in Lagos and Port Harcourt EOC, including more than 300 in epi/surveillance, more than 500 in social mobilisation/communication, more than 300 at ports of entry, more than 100 in clinical care/case management, more than 20 lab staff, and more than 20 in the management/coordination team
- no health workers involved with case management were infected.
