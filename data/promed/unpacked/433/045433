Brazil's Agriculture Ministry confirmed this week another outbreak of foot
and mouth disease (FMD), 2 months alter an initial outbreak led several
countries to ban Brazilian beef and pork imports.
The latest outbreak was reported in the state of Parana, 450 kilometres
west of Sao Paulo, admitted Agnes Melo, spokesperson for the Agriculture
ministry.
The origin of the FMD cases reported is believed to be linked to the
October 10 Matto Grosso do Sul reported outbreak and possible cattle
purchases before that date.
Brazilian officials admitted the existence of 28 outbreaks during the last
2 months in the state of Matto Grosso do Sul, which has a common border
with Paraguay.
The Sao Sebastiao de Amoreira farm with 2212 head of cattle has been in
quarantine since last October when sanitary authorities began blood testing
in the area, said the Agriculture Ministry spokesperson. "All the cattle in
the farm will be terminated to prevent any possible contagion".
However sanitary authorities admitted that another 10 faros and cities from
northern Parana which purchased cattle from Matto Grosso do Sul are also
under quarantine until the final results of the testing are double-checked.
When the Matto Grosso do Sul outbreak [was announced], over 50 countries
banned imports from Brazil, which has recently become the world's leading
exporter.
Brazilian trade authorities had forecasted beef exports of 3 billion US
dollars in 2005, but the figure is now down to 2.8 billion.
