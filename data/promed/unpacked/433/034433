The local government took measures to prevent the increase of dengue
haemorrhagic fever in Cali. Between December 1997 and January 1998, just at
one health institution, the Hospital Departamental [State Hospital, Cali,
102 cases were reported.
Five deaths have been reported.
Laureano Quintero, Director of Emergencies at the Hospital Departamental,
officially expressed his concern to the local Health Authorities. However,
according to Edgar Ivan Quintero, Municipal Health Secretary, at least two
more weeks will be taken before a state of emergency is declared.
Municipal Health Minister Ortiz named an interdisciplinary committee to
develop a plan of action.
Fernando Gutierrez, director of the local Social Security Clinic, also
expressed his concern as 389 suspect cases of DHF had been admitted to the
hospital, of which 290 were Cali residents.
It cannot be said that we have an outbreak, the number of cases clearly
indicate that what we have is an epidemic, said Fernando Rosso, dengue
authority. Rosso advised that the first DHF case in Cali was reported in
1990 and that the dramatic increase in the number of cases was due to
climatic changes. He also advised that there are certain similarities with
the dengue epidemic which took place in Cali between 1994 an 1995, in which
566 cases were reported.

[It is more likely that the increase in the number of cases of DHF is due
to the spread of a different type of dengue virus than the type that was
active in past years, leading to an increasing number of secondary
infections which are at higher risk for hemorrhagic complications. - Mod.JW
