[I queried a good colleague of many years, Richard Clifton-Hadley,
Statutory & Exotic Bacteria Programme Manager, Veterinary
Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, about the increase in UK feline bTB
(bovine tuberculosis) diagnoses, who passed it to Tim Crawshaw, who
heads up the Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural
Affairs) project on TB in species other than badgers and cattle.
Richard forwarded Tim's reply with the comment, "My perception is
also that we are dealing with a heightened awareness of TB in cats
leading to more samples being submitted. However, the intensity of
cattle infections in the west of the country in particular must
indicate a greater risk of spillover into cats" -- with which one
cannot disagree. Our thanks to both gentlemen. - Mod MHJ]

[Re: bovine tuberculosis, domestic animals]
-------------------------------------------
I have extracted the figures for cat submissions and isolates of
_Mycobacterium bovis_ for 2003 to 2008. Both the number of
submissions and isolates have increased over the period but the
proportion that are positive remains at 10 to 15 percent. The New TB
order came in at the start of 2006 and this was accompanied by
encouragement from Defra to submit samples. I think this accounts for
the increase seen in submissions in that year [2006]. The act was
talked about before it came into force and I suspect that is why the
number of submissions increased in 2005 as well.

There is no doubt that there has been increased effort to detect TB
in cats in the UK. I think I would expect the proportion of positives
in the submissions to increase if there was an escalating problem.
How the increased surveillance affects the proportion is open to bias
(selection bias or geographical bias could be possibilities) but my
feeling is that there is just an increased awareness so we are
getting more submissions from basically the same population. There
may have been some selection bias in 2006 as the proportion was a bit
lower in that year (but ?significantly lower). This could be that the
encouragement from Defra resulted in a bias to non-_M. bovis_ cases
(cases that were not likely to be _M. bovis_ were submitted just
because of the encouragement).

Possible explanations of the "constant" proportion:

Underlying constant level of TB in cats -- increased surveillance,
submissions not really biased -- probably best explanation;

Underlying increased level of TB in cats -- increased surveillance
but submissions biased to non-_M. bovis_ cases -- no real evidence
for this apart for one year where there was encouragement and the
proportion did fall (2006);

Underlying decreased level of TB in cats -- increased surveillance
but biased to _M. bovis_ cases -- not really plausible.

Year / _M. bovis_ isolates / Number Submissions / Percent
2008 / so far 11 / 95 / 11.6
2007 / 15 / 103 / 14.6
2006 / 14 / 136 / 10.3
2005 / 13 / 98 / 13.3
2004 / 6 / 39 / 15.4
2003 / 2 / 8 / 25.0

It is possible the data we have is insufficient to show any changes
and we might see a significant change in the proportion in the
future. I will keep a monitor on it.

Overall, while the _M. bovis_ isolates from cats have increased, the
most plausible explanation is that it is due to the increased
surveillance resulting from the introduction of the TB order and the
accompanying encouragement by Defra to submit samples.

[The percentages in 2003-2004 should be discounted as the numbers of
submissions were so small. - Mod.JW]
