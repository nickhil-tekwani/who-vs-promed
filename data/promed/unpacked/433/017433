--------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Egypt has reported a new confirmed human
case of avian influenza. The case is a 14-month old girl from
Dekernes District, Dakahlia Governorate. Her symptoms began on 25 May
2009. She was admitted to Mansoura Chest Hospital on 29 May [2009]
where she received oseltamivir and is in a stable condition.

Investigations into the source of infection indicated that she had
close contact with dead and sick poultry. The case was confirmed by
the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratories.

Of the 77 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 27 have been fatal.

[This is the official WHO confirmation of the 77th human case or
avian A (H5N1) influenza reported in the preceding ProMED-mail post
Avian influenza, human (97): Egypt 77th case 20090531.2024.

Daqahliya governorate can be located at no. 7 in the map of the

[Tamiflu (oseltamivir) treatment was only begun on the 4th day of
illness, after admission to hospital, but the drug is only supposed to
be effective if used in the 1st 48hrs. It is impossible to know
whether the stabilization of her condition is due to some effect of
the drug, or the natural progression of the disease in her case. -
