A death in west central Saskatchewan has been attributed to [a] hantavirus [infection].

Provincial health officials confirmed in a news release Wednesday [26 Jun 2013] that a man in the Heartland Health Region died from complications related to the virus [infection]. Another death in the region is also being investigated for a link to the illness.

Hantavirus infection is a rare illness most often associated with exposure to airborne [virus contaminated] particles of feces, urine and saliva from infected mice. It is often contracted while cleaning out infested buildings, but can be transferred by bite as well, said the release.

Since 1994 there have been 24 confirmed cases of human hantavirus infection in Saskatchewan, resulting in 7 deaths.

[Sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in humans have occurred in Canada's Prairie Provinces and British Columbia for several years. This report does not indicate which hantavirus is involved in this case, but it likely is Sin Nombre virus. Both Sin Nombre and New York hantaviruses have deer mice as reservoir hosts. A US CDC site, with extensive information about hantaviruses, including those in North America, with clinical signs, treatment, epidemiology, and an image of the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/.

The deer mouse is one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in North America. A map showing its distribution can be accessed at http://www.discoverlife.org/nh/tx/Vertebrata/Mammalia/Muridae/Peromyscus/maniculatus/images/Peromyscus_maniculatus_map.320.jpg.html.
