Brucellosis confirmed in Wyoming cattle herd
--------------------------------------------
The Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) reported to the state
veterinarian Monday [16 Jun 2008] that it has cultured _Brucella
abortus_ out of tissues from 2 cows from Daniel, Wyoming. This is
confirmation from the WSVL that the herd is infected with
brucellosis. Official confirmation is pending culture results from
the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.

Blood from these cows initially tested positive at a sale barn. The
blood was sent on to WSVL where testing confirmed the reaction seen
at the sale barn. However, since false positive blood tests can
occur, the cows were sent to the lab where they were necropsied and cultured.

With culture, tissues are tested for the actual bacteria. In this
case, the bacterium was cultured from tissues from both cows.

The Wyoming Livestock Board and USDA (US Department of Agriculture)
Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) plans to test the
remainder of the cattle herd this week to discover if additional
cattle may be infected. Once that is complete they will test
neighboring cattle herds and complete investigations in an attempt to
discover the source of the infection and determine if the infection has spread.

If the herd is not depopulated, the state may lose its
brucellosis-free status granted by APHIS, the Wyoming Livestock Board
said, noting that the producer may choose to undergo a repeated
testing and removal program. Loss of this status would result in
testing requirements for all cattle in the state when they are sold
or move out of state.

[The state may loose its "brucellosis-free" status even if the herd
is depopulated. A state is allowed 2 cases over a 2-year period.
Animals moving into the herd (trace-ins) and animals moving out of
the herd (trace-outs) have likely not been completed, then it is
difficult to determine if there are other cases. Also it is possible
that there could be cases coming into the state within the next 2 years.

The state is likely to institute rules reflecting the change in the
risk to the state and require a negative brucellosis test within a
certain number of days before coming into the state.

It is standard to depopulate the index herd to decrease the immediate
loss of a state's "free" status. Should the owner elect to refuse to
depopulate, the state will immediately loose its "free-state" status.

This case represents a risk to the state. Likewise, the proximity to
the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) increases the risk to the state.
GYA has brucellosis in some subset of its elk and bison. There has
been a committee that for several years has been established to
examine methods of eradicating the disease without jeopardizing the
animal populations within the national park.

Brucellosis can transmit to human beings through unpasteurized milk
as well as through exposure to birth fluids. - Mod.TG
