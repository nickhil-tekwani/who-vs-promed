Another man undergoing rabies shots in Erwin
-----------------------------------------------
An elderly East Tennessee man is undergoing rabies shots, the 5th
person to be treated to prevent onset of the disease in the region
since May 2005.
The man, who lives near the North Carolina border, recently told his
daughter he was scratched below the knee by a strange cat on 13 Jan
2006. The daughter said she didn't think much about her father's
account until she read news reports of a man and his toddler son
being bitten by a cat nearby and beginning shots to prevent rabies.
The animal was killed with a shovel, and a test on the body found it was rabid.
Health officials determined, because of the dates of the attacks and
how close the victims live to each other, that the same cat probably
attacked all 3 of them. In all but one of the local cases,
authorities have determined the animal that attacked was rabid.
Last summer [2005], federal and state wildlife officials dropped bait
laced with an oral vaccine along a 35-mile strip from Lake Erie into
eastern Tennessee in an attempt to turn back the westward spread of rabies.

[A minor report maybe, but this is the 1st report we have had of a
long ongoing rabies problem in Tennessee. In fact, it seems that we
have no prior postings on rabies in Tennessee. - Mod.MHJ]
