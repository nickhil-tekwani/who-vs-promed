On 3 and 4 Oct 2016, nearly 60 people were bitten by foxes in Garuda-2, Rautahat district of Nepal. According to the victims, there may be at least 15 foxes that appeared suddenly and started biting villagers indiscriminately. Of these, 17 victims suffered severe bite injuries, and therefore were referred to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital for rabies immunoglobulin treatment. Nose, lips, chin and periorbital region were the most frequently injured body parts of these victims. Villagers, however, still fear being attacked by foxes suspected of having rabies, since authorities have not yet initiated an investigation, or captured or killed these foxes.

[Our thanks to Dr. Pun for informing us of this strange episode. In Nepal, the sylvatic cycle is maintained by wild carnivores living in forest zones, national parks, or wildlife reserves, such as mongooses (family Herpestidae) and jackals (_Canis aureus_). The direct importance of this cycle is thought to be less important than the urban cycle maintained by dogs.

The report indicates it was foxes, not jackals, the biting canids. In Rautahat, besides jackals, there are Bengal foxes (_Vulpes bengalensis_). The fact that the animals conformed a large pack suggests that they might be jackals and not Bengal foxes, as the latter are less social. - Mod.PMB
