More warnings after 6 rabid dogs bought at market
-------------------------------------------------------
Public health officials have issued a 2nd warning and expanded the
scope of their investigation after confirming at least 6 rabid dogs
were bought from a Toronto flea market.
"Those individuals who purchased puppies from this business are asked
to contact their local public health unit," said Dr. Rosana
Pellizzari of the Toronto Public Health office.
Since the 1st alert was issued Wednesday night [23 Jan 2008],
Pellizzari said his office has received close to 200 calls from
worried people who believe they may have come in contact with the
pups at Dr. Flea's market since 5 Jan 2008.
"And any resident who has come in contact will be referred for
treatment if required," said Pellizzari. "Rabies is a rare and very
serious condition that, left untreated, is most often fatal."
Just 2 of the 6 dogs have died, but public health officials said at
least 4 others remain unaccounted for. A Brampton, ON, family and a
humane society official are known to have contracted [?been exposed
to - Mod.MPP] the disease from a border collie, which has since died.

Rabies case alarms officials
-----------------
Public health officials say they might have a possible rabies crisis
on their hands after a border collie puppy died from rabies at the
Toronto Humane Society last week.
The dog was one of about a dozen pups sold from the Pets R Us booth
at Dr. Flea's, a popular weekend bargain market at Highway 27 and Albion Road.
The vendor also sold pets in Chesley, Ontario, under the business
name "Feed Me More Pets."
The city urged anyone who may have been exposed at the market to come forward.
"Rabies is a rare and very serious condition that, if left untreated,
is most often fatal," said Dr. Rosana Pellizzari, associate medical
officer of health. She said the city has tracked down several of the
puppies sold at the market, but the alert remains.
The original investigation was limited to those who visited the
market on Sunday,[13 Jan 2008] - the day the puppies were sold.
But the city recently expanded its search to include everyone who
touched dogs at the booth since [5 Jan 2008].
So far, about 200 people have called the city's hotline from
residents worried they may have been exposed to the diseased puppies.
Though no human cases have been found so far, officials fear many may
be walking around with dormant rabies, which can become life-threatening.
Residents who believe they may have come in contact with animals sold
at the market will be assessed and, if necessary, vaccinated. The
vaccine is free in Ontario.

Massive rabies case traced to local farm
-----------------------
A rabies alarm raised in Toronto has spread across the province with
hundreds of possible infections -- traced back to puppies from Perth
and Bruce counties.
Health officials urge anyone in Ontario who came into contact with
the infected puppies or who bought puppies from a Bruce County
business after [3 Jan 2008] to contact their local health unit.
The deadly virus came from 3 puppies at a family farm near Newton,
about 15 kilometres southeast of Listowel in Perth County, health
officials said yesterday [24 Jan 2008].
The Perth district health unit is contacting at least 40 people who
might have had contact with the puppies or their mother at the farm.
"We are following up on each one of them," said Dr. Miriam Klassen,
Perth's medical officer of health.
Perth health officials also are urging any other people -- from
friends to service people -- who visited the farm between [29 Nov
2007] and [3 Jan 2008] to contact them.
Untreated, rabies is fatal in humans.
It is found in the saliva of animals and can be passed through a
bite, cut or scratch.
A person could catch the rabies virus simply by playing with the
puppies, Klassen said.
The mother of the border collie cross pups was a family pet, but was
not vaccinated against rabies, she said.
After delivering the pups, she killed a skunk that was likely rabid,
Klassen said.
The pups likely got the rabies from licking and nibbling their
mother, she said.
The mother died, as did some of the pups.
The family, unaware of the rabies, sold 3 of the puppies to a dog
broker in Chesley, said Drew Ferguson, spokesperson for the Grey
Bruce health unit.
The broker kept the puppies for 10 days.
Health unit officials have contacted 6 people who had contact with
the 3 puppies, Ferguson said.
The broker took the puppies to Dr. Flea's, a flea market at Albion
Road and Highway 27 in west Toronto.
One of the 3 infected puppies was purchased [13 Jan 2008]. The puppy
became sick and was taken to the Toronto Humane Society, said
investigator Tre Smith.
The puppy died [14 Jan 2008] and an autopsy 3 days ago showed it was
infected by rabies.
"We are not exactly sure how many people came in contact with this
animal at Dr. Flea's," said Smith. "But we are assuming it could be
upwards of hundreds of people who walked by and petted the animal."
That dog was one of at least 10 sold by the Dr. Flea's vendor that
day and each of those dogs may have rabies too, said Dr. Rosana
Pellizzari, with Toronto Public Health.
Toronto Public Health officials issued a warning Wednesday night [23 Jan 2008].
"This is very serious," Pellizzari said. "Rabies should be treated as
a fatal illness -- no ifs, ands or buts."
Officials said yesterday they have received nearly 200 calls from the
public since 1st issuing the alert, and have since found a number of
puppies sold at the flea market.
The investigation has not found any human cases of rabies.
The infected 8-week-old puppy that prompted the alarm was bought by
[a woman in] Brampton for her son.
[The woman], her husband, son and brother-in-law all have to get
rabies treatments, typically 6 shots in 28 days.
This case should serve as a warning to people buying pets, health
officials said.
Buy from a registered kennel or store and make sure the dogs or their
parents have been vaccinated, Ferguson said.

[Although Rabies is an old disease, constant reminders and diligent
education is necessary to keep this disease before the public eye. It
cannot be emphasized enough to vaccinate pets, including horses and
cattle, against rabies. A vaccination is very cheap insurance when
you relate it to the death of an individual, or the loss of a pet.
The animals most likely to be a rabies reservoir depends upon your
location. But it often a safe bet that bats, skunks, raccoons will
likely have rabies. There are other animals, of course, but they may
be specific to your area.
An incident such as related in these articles should have caused the
owner to report the incident to the veterinarian and/or the health
department. Vaccination against rabies is critical for animal and
human health.
Flea markets, swap meets, or other names are unregulated exchanges of
a variety of animals. Often there are no records kept and it is
difficult for authorities to track exposed individuals. Media alerts
are one of the most effective ways. Hopefully the exposed individuals
will get in contact with authorities. - Mod.TG]
