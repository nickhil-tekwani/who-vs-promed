In a study published in July [2020] in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, scientists from the Pune-based Maximum Containment Laboratory and ICMR-National Institute of Virology have noted the presence of antibodies against the Cat Que virus (CQV) in 2 human serum samples.

What does the study say?
------------------------
The presence of the Cat Que virus has been largely reported in _Culex_ mosquitoes in China and in pigs in Viet Nam. For the study, 1020 human serum samples that showed acute febrile illness during 2014-2017 were collected. All these samples, however, were found to be negative for CQV when subjected to the real-time RT-PCR test. Of these samples, the majority (806) were collected from Karnataka, followed by Maharashtra (116), Kerala (51), Madhya Pradesh (20), and Gujarat (27).

However, antibody positivity was recorded in 2 of the 883 samples that were tested for the presence of antibodies. These 2 samples were taken from Karnataka in 2014 and 2017. Significantly, the study notes that a virus was isolated from a jungle myna serum sample in Sagar district of Karnataka in 1961. This virus was characterised as CQV in 2016 using next-generation sequencing technology.

Why was this study undertaken?
------------------------------
The study, which was conducted in 2017-2018, was undertaken to develop diagnostic tests for CQV prompted by the spread of similar species of _Culex_ mosquitoes in India.

What is the Cat Que virus?
--------------------------
For CQV, domestic pigs are considered to be the primary mammalian hosts. Antibodies against the virus have been reported in swine reared locally in China, which indicates that the virus has formed a "natural cycle" in the local area and has the ability to spread in pigs and other animal populations through mosquitoes.

A paper published in the journal Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases in 2015 says that CQV belongs to the Simbu serogroup and infects both humans and economically important livestock species. It was 1st isolated in 2004 from mosquitoes during the surveillance of arbovirus activity in northern Vietnam. In this study, researchers reported a CQV strain (SC0806), which was isolated from mosquito samples collected in China in 2006 and 2008 (see report [2] below].

How can humans get infected and is there a cause for concern?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Humans can get infected through mosquitoes as well. In the study, scientists note that because of positivity in human serum samples and the replication capability of CQV in mosquitoes, there is only a "possible disease-causing potential" of CQV in the Indian scenario. Further, "Availability of vector, primary mammalian host (swine) and confirmation of CQV from jungle myna signifies the potential of this _Orthobunyavirus_ as a public health pathogen in India," the study says" (CQV belongs to the genus _Orthobunyavirus_).

So, is this virus dangerous?
----------------------------
It is not clear. Other viruses that belong to the same genus as CQV and are similarly transmitted through mosquitoes include the Cache Valley virus that can cause meningitis, the La Crosse virus that can cause paediatric encephalitis, the Jamestown Canyon virus that causes Jamestown Canyon encephalitis, and the Guaroa virus that causes febrile illness.

Abstract
--------
The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a highly diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock species. Cat Que virus (CQV), a Simbu serogroup virus of the genus _Orthobunyavirus_ (family Peribunyaviridae), was first isolated in 2004 from mosquitoes during surveillance of arbovirus activity in acute pediatric encephalitis in northern Viet Nam. We report here the complete genome sequence of SC0806 isolated from mosquitoes (_Culex tritaeniorhynchus_) in Sichuan Province, China. Consistent with the genomic organization of Simbu serogroup viruses, the SC0806 genome comprises 3 RNA segments -- a large (L) segment (6928 nucleotides) that encodes the 2261-amino-acid RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a medium (M) segment (4481 nucleotides) that encodes the 1433-amino-acid polyprotein, and a small (S) segment (984 nucleotides) that encodes a 234-amino-acid nucleocapsid protein and a 95-amino-acid nonstructural protein. The respective lengths of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and 3'-UTR of L, M, and S are 56 and 86, 43 and 136, and 44 and 238 nucleotides. Sequence (nucleotide and deduced amino acid) comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that SC0806 was closely related to the reported Vietnam isolate CQV. This is the 1st time that CQV has been isolated in Sichuan Province, China. Anti-SC0806 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies were found in pigs reared locally, indicating that CQV has formed a natural cycle in the local area. Surveillance of the distribution and pathogenicity of SC0806 should be strengthened.

Cat Que virus (CQV) is a member of the Manzanilla species complex of Simbu serogroup. It was isolated in a field study carried out in 2002-2004 from mosquitoes during surveillance of arbovirus activity in acute pediatric encephalitis in northern Vietnam (Bryant JE, Crabtree MB, Nam VS, et al. Isolation of arboviruses from mosquitoes collected in northern Vietnam. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2005; 73(2): 470-3).

Since that original isolation, studies of the geographic range of the virus and its animal and human health importance have been few. With the reports of occurrence in China, Viet Nam and India, it is likely that this virus is widespread in Southeast and South Asia as is the mosquito (_Culex tritaeniorhynchus_) from which it was isolated. Although additional studies are needed, without convincing evidence that CQV is, indeed, of public or animal health significance, obtaining support for such studies is likely to be difficult. - Mod.TY]
