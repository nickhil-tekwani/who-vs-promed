In November 2012, the Norway Public Health Institute found that 10 people are infected with an uncommon strain of bacteria called _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Mikawashima. Patients were infected in Norway and live scattered in several counties (Oslo, Akershus, Vestfold, Aust-Agder, Vest-Agder, Oppland, Hordaland, and Nordland). All who have been ill so far are adults, most aged 20-50 years. Salmonella infections are usually not serious.

The Institute works with community health services in routine surveillance, conducting interviews and taking samples from persons in the community to try to determine whether there may be a common source of infection. This work can take time, and it's not always possible to find the source of infection.

The Institute has previously received notice of 0-3 cases of _S._ Mikawashima annually, of which about half are infected abroad. The few who are infected domestically, usually have had contact with people who have become ill after being infected abroad.

[Outbreaks of salmonellosis in the Scandinavian countries are less common than in the USA, in part due to dietary differences. _S._ Mikawashima is an uncommon serotype as well. We await more information regarding the vehicle of this outbreak. - Mod.LL
