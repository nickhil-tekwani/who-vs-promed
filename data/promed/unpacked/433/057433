Rabies, animal (epidemic awareness) - Russia (Moscow)
-----------------------------------------------------
The epidemic situation for rabies has reached the highest levels of
concern in Moscow. There were 257 animal rabies cases last year
[2009], more than 10-fold the means of previous years.
Rosselkhoznadzor [the federal service of phytosanitary and veterinary
surveillance] considers taking unprecedented measure to control the
epidemic, like banning movements of pets to suburban cottages,
canceling a show dog exhibition and mass immunization of wild and
domestic animals.

The veterinarians say that the situation was worse only during the
post-WW2 years, when the annual numbers were above 2000 cases. Only
the mass shooting of stray dogs, foxes and raccoon dogs controlled the
epidemic, they think.

These measures were so effective that almost nobody remembered about
rabies until the late 60s. Since then, there were only single rabies
cases reported. The regional deputy of Rosselkhoznadzor announced
during a conference that there were from 2 to dozens of rabies cases
from the 1970s until recently, when the number of cases increased to
hundreds.

The situation is worst in the North-West of Moscow oblast where, the
specialists think, the natural conditions are favorable for
maintaining the rabies epidemic. There are several water bodies and
nature conservation areas in this territory, which create a
environment favorable for wild animals to live in. The water restricts
the movements of the animals, especially if they are already rabid.
This causes some level of crowding of rabid animals with subsequent
enhanced transmission. This is why about 42 percent of the rabies
cases last year occurred exactly in the North West of the Moscow oblast.

The officials say that each weekend, about 30 000 pets are being
carried to the suburban country cottages [dachas], where these animals
are at risk to become infected and bring the infection into the Moscow
region. The stray dogs add their contribution to the epidemic process.
The people still remember the case of a rabid dog last year [2009],
which bit 36 people before being neutralized [see ProMED post
20091230.4392].

The authorities say that they have to control somehow the movement of
pets to and from Moscow, while understanding that it will cause
traffic jams. The movements of non-immunized pets will be forbidden
and the law will be strictly enforced.

The coming international dogshow is under threat of cancellation if
the rabies situation does not improve.

Rabies in feral dog populations
-------------------------------
In an African city where I resided for a number of years, the control
of loose dogs was simple and effective. At intervals, municipal
workers would tour the streets of the city in open trucks from which
they distributed poisoned baits of raw meat. Many people may find this
abhorrent, but considering the size of the problem and the resources
available, it had one overwhelming advantage; it worked.

[OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code includes chapter 7.7., titled
"Guidelines on stray dog population control"; see at
<<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/MCODE/en_chapitre_1.7.7.pdf>http://www.oie.i

nt/eng/normes/MCODE/en_chapitre_1.7.7.pdf>.

The preamble includes the following statement:

"Whilst acknowledging human health is a priority including the
prevention of zoonotic diseases notably rabies, the OIE recognises the
importance of controlling dog populations without causing unnecessary
or avoidable animal suffering. Veterinary Services should play a lead
role in preventing zoonotic diseases and ensuring animal welfare and
should be involved in dog population control, coordinating their
activities with other competent public institutions and/or agencies".

Article 7.7.6. thereof deals with "control measures".- Mod.AS].
