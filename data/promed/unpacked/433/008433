An outbreak of measles among a travelling community from England in
Norway: a preliminary report
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Between 7 and 14 May 2007, Nasjonalt Folkehelseinstitutt (the
Norwegian Institute of Public Health, NIPH) was notified of 6 cases
of measles, all occurring in a group of families from England staying
at camping sites in Norway.
Epidemiology of measles in Norway
---------------------------------
Measles is no longer considered an endemic disease in Norway [1].
Except for one imported case earlier this year [2007], there have
been no cases of measles reported in Norway since 2004, when 7 cases,
also imported, were notified. The last cases of measles of probably
endemic origin in Norway were in 1999. Measles is a notifiable
disease in Norway and every case is to be reported individually by
both clinicians and laboratories. In addition, the disease is subject
to immediate early warning to local and health authorities and the
24/7 doctor on call at the NIPH.
MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine is included in the national
vaccination programme and children are vaccinated at 15 months and 12
years of age. The vaccination coverage for the 1st dose of MMR was 86
percent in 2003, but has increased to 91 percent for 2006. The
coverage for the 2nd dose was 91 percent in both 2003 and 2006.
Vaccination is also recommended for non-immune persons within 72
hours of being been exposed to measles.
Outbreak description
--------------------
On 7 May 2007, the NIPH received a laboratory report indicating
measles in a 7-month-old girl (case no. 1) admitted to Stavanger
University Hospital in the southwestern part of the country.
Following up this report, we learned that the child had onset of
fever on 27 Apr 2007, and was examined at the hospital outpatient
department the following day. Due to worsening of her condition, she
was admitted to the paediatric department on 1 May 2007, and then
developed a rash and was isolated. The measles diagnosis was
confirmed by a positive IgM test in serum.
The patient was the child of an English family staying in a caravan
at a camping site in the municipality of Sola, adjacent to Stavanger.
According to the mother, the child had been in contact with a child
with measles in England shortly before they travelled to Norway. The
Municipal Medical Officer in Sola was notified by the hospital and
the NIPH. He visited the camping site and found 3 to 4 English
families staying there on vacation. Two children of these families,
aged 5 (case no. 3) and 9 years (case no. 4), had fallen ill on 8 May
2007, and had been to an outpatient clinic. They were later confirmed
as having measles based on serology test of serum. They were
unvaccinated. The remaining 7 children of the English families at the
camping site had been vaccinated, according to their parents.
On 10 May 2007, the NIPH was notified by St. Olav University Hospital
in Trondheim, a city in central Norway (at least 16 hours drive from
Stavanger), of a case of measles in a child 15 months of age (case
no. 2). The child fell ill on 4 May 2007, with fever and diarrhoea
and a rash developed on 7 May 2007. The child was admitted to the
paediatric ward on 8 May 2007, and isolated the following day. The
child was a cousin of the 1st case in Stavanger, and had been staying
at the same camping site in Sola at the time when the 1st patient
fell ill. The family had later gone with their caravan to a camping
site in the municipality of Malvik, near Trondheim. The child had not
been vaccinated against measles. According to her father, who also
was not vaccinated, the girl and her brother of 4 years had not been
vaccinated because the parents feared serious side effects.
On 12 May 2007, the father (case no. 5) of the child in Trondheim
(case no. 2) also came down with fever. He became so affected that he
was admitted to St. Olavs Hospital on 15 May 2007. The brother of
case no. 2 also fell ill with fever on 13 May 2007 and had developed
a rash when he was seen by a doctor on 17 May 2007. He was also
admitted to St. Olav Hospital on 18 May 2007. The diagnoses for all 3
cases of this family were confirmed by PCR [polymerase chain
reaction] in throat swab and serology in serum.
Table. Case Histories

3 / 5 yrs / F / 8 Nay / IgM / Sola camping
4 / 9 yrs / F / 8 May / IgM / Sola camping
5 / 21 yrs / M / 12 May / PCR, IgM / Father of 2
6 / 4 yrs / M / 13 May / PCR IgM / Brother of 2
Public health measures
----------------------
NIPH informed general practitioners and public health officers
through [its] biweekly newsletter MSIS-rapport on 8 May 2007, and
gave more comprehensive information on the website from 11 May 2007.
An early warning was also issued through EWRS [early warning response
system] on 11 May 2007. On 15 May 2007, further information was sent
to all hospitals in the country.
Both the index patient in Stavanger and the 1st patient in Trondheim
had visited outpatient clinics and paediatric wards during their
infectious period. The hospitals could therefore not rule out the
possibility that they might have infected other children. Stavanger
University Hospital posted information to 30-40 families with
children who might have been in contact with the patient. St. Olav
Hospital and the municipal Medical Officer in Trondheim traced
patient contacts and offered vaccine and gammaglobulin. Three
unvaccinated children aged 9-15 months received MMR vaccine and one
child below 9 months of age received gammaglobulin. In addition, 3
adult contacts and 6 health workers received vaccination. So far, no
secondary cases due to contact in the health services have been reported.
The Senior Medical Officers in Malvik, in Sola, and in the city of
Trondheim were involved in contact tracing. The patients in Trondheim
were staying at a camping site in Malvik together with approximately
24 other English families with a total of approximately 75 persons.
MMR vaccine was offered to all members of these families. So far, 15
have accepted and received vaccine, and 2 infants below the age of 9
months have been given gammaglobulin.
International investigation
---------------------------
It is not common to see English families with school-aged children on
camping holidays in Norway at this time of the year, and there were
also indications that the families were reluctant to vaccinate
children. As this suggested that the families were from the
travelling community, we sought more information from the Health
Protection Agency in the United Kingdom (UK). Around 20 cases have
been confirmed so far this year [2007] among travellers from several
sites in the UK, most arising after a large gathering that occurred
in southeast London on 3 Apr 2007. On further interviewing, it
appears likely that the index patient in Stavanger attended this
event early in April 2007. The mother reported hearing that someone
with measles had been at that event, but as the index patient fell
ill on 27 Apr 2007, however, it is likely that she contracted measles
following contact in the UK with other travelling children. These
details of the intermediate cases remain to be investigated.
Travelling communities in the UK report poorer health than comparable
groups of residents from socially deprived inner city areas, other
ethnic minorities and rural residents [2]. Outbreaks of measles have
indicated that they have lower vaccination coverage than the stable population.
Conclusion
----------
Norwegian health authorities are investigating an outbreak of measles
among English nomadic travellers in Norway. The infection is most
likely imported from England and linked to other current clusters in
the UK. So far, no cases in the Norwegian population can be linked to
the outbreak. The investigation of the outbreaks continues and
intensified surveillance during the coming weeks will show if the
outbreak will continue or not. Due to low vaccination coverage and
wide travels, the travelling communities in Europe represent a
particular challenge for the measles elimination campaign [4].

[In Europe in recent times there have been several outbreaks of
infectious disease associated with movement of travellers (Roma
communities and others) where certain population groups have eluded
public health surveillance or actively resisted vaccination. This
Norwegian investigation illustrates both the nature of the problem
and the effectiveness of vaccination in protection of the non-migrant majority.
