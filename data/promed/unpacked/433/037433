Zambia: Measles outbreak of over 200 cases
------------------------------------------
More than 200 cases [of measles] have been detected in several districts in
Zambia, said Canisius Banda, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Health, on
Wed 27 Jun 2007. Affected districts were Kaputa, Chinsali, Chibombo, Mbala
and Mazabuka and medical teams have been sent to provide aid.
Those who have contracted the disease are presumed not to have been
vaccinated during the most recent immunization campaigns. The next
immunization campaign against measles is scheduled for the period 9 to 14
July [2007].
Measles remains one of the main childhood diseases and one of the most
important causes of mortality in developing countries despite the
availability of a good vaccine.
