The MSPCA's Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston says it has seen the 1st local case of a dog flu that is quickly spreading across the Midwest.

MSPCA (Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) said a 5 year old female terrier with a hacking cough was brought in on 3 May 2015 following a family trip to Chicago. The hospital is awaiting confirmation of the exact strain, but veterinarians suspect it is the same strain that has now become an epidemic in the Midwest. The dog is recovering at home in Watertown.

More than 1700 cases of dog flu -- dubbed H3N2 -- have been confirmed in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin and Texas, the MSPCA said. Experts say dog-to-dog contact is the primary means by which the flu is spread, and dog owners are urged to avoid trips to the veterinary hospital if they believe their dog may have been exposed to the virus.

Canine flu is not fatal in most cases, nor does it pose a threat to humans, cats or other pets, the MSPCA said. Angell's prevention protocol centers on the following recommendations:

if traveling to the outbreak states, steer clear of all dog parks, veterinary hospitals (save for emergency treatment) or other areas in which dogs assemble;
do not assume your dog is protected if he or she has been vaccinated against canine flu. H3N2 is a different strain; as yet there is no vaccine for it, and prevention is the only surefire way to avoid infection;
know the primary signs of canine flu, which generally include coughing, runny nose, decreased activity, decreased appetite, and generally seeming unwell. If any of these symptoms are present, call you veterinarian immediately;
if your dog is sick, seek treatment at your veterinarian's office or Angell -- but inform staff upon arrival if your dog has traveled to the outbreak states, and keep well clear of all other dogs in the waiting area(s).

The new canine H3N2 flu virus has now been detected in as many as 13 states, though most cases have been reported near Chicago, where the virus 1st turned up in the middle of April 2015, according to veterinary groups and lab reports.

The virus is related to an H3N2 strain that has infected dogs in southern China and South Korea since 2006. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in late April 2015 that a genetic analysis of the new strain found no sign that it can infect or cause severe disease in humans.

The more common H3N8 canine flu, which has been circulating in the United States since 2004, also poses a low threat to humans.

Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) has been monitoring detections nationwide, and its most recent map as of 6 May 2015 shows that positive tests for the virus have come from 11 states: California, Texas, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Alabama, and Michigan.

Since then, tests in Georgia and possibly in Ohio have detected H3N2 in dogs, which would raise the number of affected states to 13. The University of Georgia Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratories (UGVDL) announced on 19 May 2015 that the strain was detected in a dog from the metropolitan Atlanta area that had recently been in contact with other dogs at an Atlanta boarding facility.

Meanwhile, a possible case was detected in the Ohio city of Newark this week, but a 2nd round of tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis, according to a 20 May 2015 statement from the Ohio State University (OSU) College of Veterinary Medicine. Joshua Daniels, DVM, PhD, associate clinical professor in veterinary clinical sciences, said, "Because this is an emerging disease in a single animal in a new geographic area, it should be confirmed by a secondary test."

Detections outside of Illinois appear to be sporadic. But in the Chicago area, more than 1700 cases, including 8 known deaths, have been reported, the Chicago Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA) said in a 18 May 2015 statement. Donna Alexander, DVM, director of the Cook County department of animal and rabies control, urged dog owners to remain on heightened alert and said there has been no let-up in the number of severe canine respiratory cases in the Chicago area. The CVMA said that, because of the high risk of dog-to-dog spread, owners should take precautions and avoid allowing dogs to socialize with other dogs in settings such as training classes, kennels, doggie daycares, dog parks, and grooming facilities until further notice.

The Cornell AHDC, which has been heavily involved in testing samples, said in its background materials that all subtyped samples from the Chicago area have been the new H3N2 strain. Though the virus can be transmitted to cats, no cats have tested positive in the outbreak so far. Cornell experts said it's not known whether an H3N8 vaccine that is available for dogs offers any protection against the H3N2 strain. They said group settings pose the most risk, and -- as for other infectious diseases -- extra measures should be taken for puppies, older dogs, and those that have underlying health conditions. The Cornell group added that especially severe disease has been seen in some groups of greyhounds.

[Both of these articles indicate that this influenza virus is on the move. Preventing it is certainly the key. The virus can incubate for about a week, so you may not be able to judge if a visiting canine or a social canine has the virus. So while your canine may not be able to be quite as social, he or she may live a longer and healthier life. Take care of your canine friends and protect their health in social settings.

It is interesting to note that this strain seems to have somehow come from China and South Korea. Coincidentally, the avian influenza causing so many problems in the USA also seems to have originated in that area of the world.
