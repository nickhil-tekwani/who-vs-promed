Over the past month, 16 children have died, half while under treatment at Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College for encephalitis, a type of brain disease that chief minister Yogi Adityanath recently claimed had almost been wiped out from his political fief.

A report sent to the health directorate in Lucknow said the patients who died were suffering either from Japanese encephalitis (JE) or acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), an affliction that has already killed close to 150 children in neighbouring Bihar.

Of the 16 deaths in Uttar Pradesh, 6 each were from Gorakhpur and Kushinagar districts, while 2 each were from Maharajganj and Deoria districts. All 4 are in east Uttar Pradesh.

Adityanath, who held a meeting with officials at BRD Medical College on Saturday [22 Jun 2019] to review the situation, called for fresh initiatives to eradicate the disease from the region.

"The death rate has reduced drastically in recent years, but we need to chalk out a new strategy to eradicate it completely," a health officer quoted Adityanath as saying.

The chief minister also hoped that the treatment would be more effective once the under-construction AIIMS in Gorakhpur starts functioning by the end of next year [2020].

"It (the disease) is spreading because of unhygienic conditions, open defecation and contaminated drinking water," the BJP leader said while speaking to reporters later.

"We have got good results from our strategy of the previous years and managed to control JE and AES to a large extent. It is a continuous process," he added, but refused to answer any questions.

The affected areas are considered Adityanath's fief. He had claimed recently that encephalitis had almost been eradicated in Gorakhpur, the epicentre of the disease for over 2 decades, and surrounding districts where thousands of children have died since 1998.

Adityanath, also the mahant of Gorakhnath temple, represented Gorakhpur in Parliament from 1998 to 2017 before he took over as chief minister.

According to the latest report of the health department in Gorakhpur district, 130 JE and AES patients were admitted to the hospital between 1 May-19 Jun 2019. "The [2019] patients started dying from 5 May [2019]. We have yet to count the deaths after 19 Jun [2019]," said a health department officer who didn't want to be named.

"Adityanath has launched the Dastak programme, which would be started from 1 Jul [2019] to create awareness among people about encephalitis in Gorakhpur and adjoining districts. We will also conduct an encephalitis vaccination programme [presumably for JE - Mod.TY] till 25 Jul [2019]. But the fact remains that most encephalitis deaths take place in the month of June, when there is rain," the officer said, adding that a vaccination drive should have been conducted in January and February [2019].

For the record, parents of most patients in Bihar, including Muzaffarpur, where the AES outbreak has taken a heavy toll, would earlier rush to the medical college in Gorakhpur, around 300 km [186 mi] away, because the BRD Medical College has a dedicated encephalitis ward.

This year [2019], however, the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital in Muzaffarpur has been admitting most of the local patients.

Some parents in Muzaffarpur have alleged that the Gorakhpur hospital refused admission to their children this year [2019]. An official at BRD Medical College denied the allegation.

[The above report does not specify how many of the encephalitis fatalities were due to JE and how many to AES.

Eastern Uttar Pradesh state has been an important locality for JE and AES cases over recent years. JE vaccination campaigns likely are responsible for fewer JE cases this year (2019). As noted in many ProMED-mail posts reporting JE and AES in India, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Cases in neighboring Bihar state over the past 2 months have been attributed to the consumption of lychees.

The above report refers to the spread of the disease as due to "unhygienic conditions, open defecation and contaminated drinking water," which suggests enterovirus infections. Laboratory testing of these cases is essential to determine the etiologies of these cases that, in turn, are necessary to develop effective control measures. - Mod.TY
