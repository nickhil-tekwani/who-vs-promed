Biosecurity authorities have confirmed 2 horses have died in separate outbreaks of hendra virus in central and north Queensland. The properties near Rockhampton and at Ingham have been quarantined. Queensland Health staff are on their way to the 2 properties where it is understood a total of 4 people have had exposure to the sick horses.

In 2009, there was an outbreak at a Cawarral property near Rockhampton, where local vet Alistair Rodgers and several horses died. Last year [2011], hendra virus was detected at Hervey Bay, in northern Brisbane, and also on the Gold Coast.

A property south of Townsville was placed under quarantine after another outbreak in January [2012].

[Sadly, this virus just keeps cropping up. Last year (2011) seemed like the never-ending nightmare of Hendra virus and it does not seem to be regressing into its hiding place.

Horse owners please note that flying foxes are messy eaters. They dribble; they drool; they slobber. And for some reason the horses like to be right where they are eating their fruit. The juices, the bits of fruit must all be attractive to the horse. Please fence those fruit trees off from the horses.

We all hate to deprive our horses of the lovely trees and their shade, but I would rather give the horses a giant umbrella than I would have them acquire this horrible virus.

Sadly it also seems that there is little progress on the vaccine.
