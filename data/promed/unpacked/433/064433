The strain of malaria responsible for this outbreak [see ProMED
archive 20101206.4368] is vivax, imported by rubber tappers hired for
the tapping season from malaria-endemic areas of Amazonia. The
disease is spreading locally.

Blood slides have been collected from 90 people on the farm, of which
20 were positive; together with 13 cases in hospital, this makes a
total of 33 cases so far.

[ProMED thanks Otavio Silva for this firsthand information.

Local outbreaks of malaria originating from migrant workers with no
or few symptoms are well known, and infections in such workers are
the most probable cause of small outbreaks or single cases previously
reported in ProMED (see below) from areas where malaria transmission
no longer occurs. - Mod.EP]
