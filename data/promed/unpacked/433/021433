[C] Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) multi-country outbreak -
Update 11 27 Mar 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_27/en/>

WHO recommends new measures to prevent travel-related spread of SARS
-------------------------
WHO is today recommending new measures related to international travel
aimed at reducing the risk of further international spread of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The recommended measures include screening of air passengers departing from
a small number of affected areas on flights to another country. The
affected areas, where transmission of the SARS infectious agent is known to
be spreading in a human-to-human chain, are kept under constant review and
posted each day on the WHO web site. At present, only 4 countries are
concerned. [see affected areas [B] above]
No additional precautions for the screening of departing passengers at
airports in any other parts of the world are called for in todays
recommendations.
The screening measures, recommended for consideration by national health
officials and port authorities, involve an interview with passengers,
departing from a limited number of areas, to detect illness with symptoms
that give reason to suspect that a passenger may be infected with SARS.
National authorities may wish to advise travellers with fever departing on
international flights from the few areas where SARS transmission has been
documented to postpone travel until they feel better. All international
travellers should be aware of the symptoms of SARS and seek immediate
medical attention should symptoms occur.
Since global surveillance of SARS began at the end of February 2003, some
evidence suggests that a small number of suspected and probable cases of
SARS have departed from the small number of affected countries on flights
to other countries.
Most cases continue to occur in persons in close face-to-face contact with
SARS patients. Close face-to-face contact could conceivably occur in an
aircraft among persons seated close to a person infected with SARS and
coughing or sneezing.
WHO has also issued detailed recommendations to airlines on steps to take
should a suspected case of SARS be detected in flight. The WHO
recommendations include advice on step-by-step procedures for following up
fellow passengers on the flight who may have had close contact with the
possible case and the specific advice that should be given to these
travellers and their families.
WHO recommends that contacts of a person be allowed to continue to travel
so long as they do not have symptoms compatible with SARS.
The WHO case definition, which is being widely used for surveillance
purposes, is posted at the WHO web site and is kept under constant review.
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/casedefinition/en/>
Many national health authorities have also issued SARS-related advice to
international travellers.

[A] Figures on atypical pneumonia 27 Mar 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As at 1 PM 27 Mar 2003, a total of 367 people with pneumonia symptoms have
been admitted to public hospitals. The 51 additional patients reported
today include 6 healthcare workers and 22 patients from Amoy Garden. The
remaining 23 were new patients and contacts of patients with atypical
pneumonia.
As of 27 Mar 2003, 19 patients have been discharged from hospitals. A total
of 45 patients are receiving treatment in the intensive care unit. An
additional patient, a Filipino female with atypical pneumonia, died in
Queen Elizabeth Hospital on 24 Mar 2003.
DH confirmed 4 new cases of atypical pneumonia involving school children
comprising 3 boys and a girl aged from 5 to 13. These cases are among the
367 cases reported today.
Meanwhile, the Department of Health (DH) appealed to patients who had
consulted a private doctor, Dr Lau Tai Kwan, between 20-22 Mar 2003 to
contact the Department at 2760 7721 during office hours. Dr Lau suffered
from atypical pneumonia and has been included in the reported cases.
Dr Lau's clinic address is Room 130, Tung Ying Building, 100 Nathan Road,
Tsim Sha Tsui. He developed symptoms on 20 Mar 2003 and was admitted to
Princess Margaret Hospital on 22 Mar 2003.
DH and HA are pleased to see the development of rapid diagnostic test,
which facilitates prompt confirmation of severe respiratory syndrome cases
and evaluation of effectiveness of treatment.
"We have great appreciation for the efforts of the health professionals in
the management of atypical pneumonia, and the important research progress
of the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong
towards identification of the cause of the disease," a DH spokesman added.
The breakdown of figures is as follows:
Total Admissions (The numbers in bracket are those with pneumonia symptoms)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 149 (148)
10 of the patients were discharged
Patients, family members & visitors 221 (219)
9 of the patients were discharged
Total admissions 370 (367)
19 were discharged

[B] Ordinance amended to control infectious disease 27 Mar 2003
In order to enhance control over the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (commonly known as atypical pneumonia) in the community, the
Director of Health, Dr Margaret Chan, on 27 Mar 2003 added Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome to the list of infectious diseases specified in the
First Schedule to the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance (Hong
Kong Laws Chapter 141).
"This enables the application of the provisions of the Ordinance and its
subsidiary legislation as and when appropriate. This would enhance the
coverage of our infectious diseases surveillance system so that Department
of Health can better monitor the occurrence of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome." Dr Chan said.
Regulation 4 of the Prevention of the Spread of Infectious Diseases
Regulations requires medical practitioners to notify the Director of Health
if they have reason to suspect the existence of any of the infectious
diseases specified in the First Schedule to the Ordinance.
"The reporting of infectious diseases is an important element of the
surveillance, control and prevention of outbreak of infectious diseases."
said Dr Chan.
Dr Chan reminded medical practitioners of the requirement to notify
Department of Health any suspected cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.
Dr Chan exercised her power in accordance with sections 72 and 8(4) of the
Ordinance and amended the First Schedule to the Ordinance and Form 2 in the
Schedule to the Prevention of the Spread of Infectious Diseases Regulations
respectively by making the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance
(Amendment of First Schedule) Order 2003 and the Prevention of the Spread
of Infectious Diseases Regulations (Amendment of Form) Order 2003.
With the addition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a total of 28
infectious diseases are included in the First Schedule to the Ordinance.

16 SARS patients discharged 27 Mar 2003
------------------
As of 27 Mar 2003, a total of 16 SARS patients have been discharged from
hospital. The number of SARS patients reported to MOH is 78. The 4
additional patients consist of one family member and 3 hospital staff.
This brings the total number of family members, friends, or close contacts
infected by SARS to 38, and the total number of hospital staff affected by
SARS to 37. 2 patients have passed away. Among the 60 patients who are
still hospitalised, all are in stable condition, except for 11 patients who
are in serious conditions.
The Ministry would like to reiterate that SARS is not infectious until the
person develops fever. Transmission of SARS is only through close contact
with infected persons, and all SARS cases in Singapore so far could be
traced back to the 3 index cases. There is no evidence to date that the
disease spreads through casual contact.
SARS patients have been isolated for treatment at TTSH/ CDC, while those
who had close contact with them have been quarantined under the Infectious
Disease Act. The risk of transmission to the general public is therefore
very low, so Singaporeans should stay calm and continue with their daily
routine.
The Ministry of Health advises the public to heed our travel advisory and
to avoid travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi and Guangdong province in China for the
time being, unless absolutely necessary. This would help us greatly in our
efforts to cut off any imported index cases.

[This represents an increase in 6 from 26 Mar 2003. In a press briefing
today, there was mention that 5 cases have occurred in people who had
contact with people who were ill with SARS, and there are 2 health care
workers who are ill as a result of caring for one patient with a suspected
case. This suggests that there has been local transmission within the USA.

Update #12 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
----------------------
As of 27 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 29 individuals who
have become ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario
and British Columbia. There have been 3 deaths in Canada. All Canadian
cases have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact
with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The
information contained in this update is based on the best available
information Health Canada has at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario: 28 total cases. To date, all cases have occurred in close family
contacts of travelers returning from Hong Kong or in heath care workers who
have cared for these cases.
British Columbia: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after
returning from travel in southeast Asia.
At this time, the cause of SARS remains unknown, however national and
international laboratory testing and collaboration is ongoing. Here are the
most recent developments:
Due to the mounting concern about transmission of the SARS agent in
non-hospital and community settings in the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; Hong
Kong SAR, and Guangdong Province in China; and Singapore, Health Canada
recommends that persons planning to travel to these areas should defer all
travel until further notice. Health Canada also recommends alternate
routing be considered, when possible, if a traveller is transiting through
Hong Kong SAR; City of Hanoi, Vietnam; or Singapore. Health Canada is aware
that health authorities in these affected areas are making concerted
efforts to contain the spread of SARS in their populations. Given the
uncertainties of the current situation, Health Canada believes it is
prudent to await the outcome of national and international control measures
before undertaking travel to these destinations.

[A] Japan from Sanyo Shimbun 27 March 2003 [submitted & trans. by Shizuka
Shimura and Cherie McCown] [edited]
A man coming back from Taiwan was taken to hospital in Hiroshima Prefecture
and reported as a suspected case of SARS on 26 Mar 2003. According to the
Prefecture's investigation, the man went to Taiwan on 11 Mar 2003 and
returned to Japan on 25 Mar 2003. He had onset of fever (nearly 39 C),
radiographic examination of his chest revealed pneumonia and was admitted
to the hospital on 26 Mar 2003.
[To date there have been no official reports of suspected or probable cases
of SARS to WHO from Japan. This is the second newswire suggesting there
may be cases in Japan. More information from official sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

Haydon <Teal414@aol.com> and Pamela Johnson <pamela@voxiva.net> for their
submissions.
The data reported by WHO above represent an increase of 85 cases in the
past 24 hours, of which 14 were in China, 51 were in Hong Kong SAR, China,
4 were in Singapore, and 9 were in Canada, all areas with local
transmission. There were an additional 5 suspected (not using the WHO
probable case definition) reported from the USA, where local transmission
has not yet been confirmed. There were an additional 4 deaths reported due
to SARS, with the case fatality rate based on today's numbers 3.7 percent.
The travel advisory recommendation by WHO contained in the Update 11 above
([1] [C]) is new, recommending that airlines begin screening passengers for
possible symptoms compatible with SARS for exclusion from travel. This
represents a real concern that there has now been documentation of
transmission of SARS on airplanes, as reflected in several countries'
recommendations that travel to the affected areas be postponed. - Mod.MPP]
