First Report of _Phaeomoniella chlamydospora_ on _Vitis vinifera_,
_Vitis labrusca_, and French American Hybrids in Pennsylvania and New
York.

E. L. Stewart and N. G. Wenner, Department of Plant Pathology, The
Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802; and B. E. Hed,
Lake Erie Research and Extension Center, North East, PA 16428. Plant
Dis. 87:750, 2003; published on-line as D-2003-0404-01N, 2003.
Accepted for publication 5 Mar 2003.

_Phaeomoniella chlamydospora_ [Pc] (W. Gams, Crous, M.J. Wingfield. &
L. Mugnai) Crous & Gams (= _Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum_) was
isolated during the growing seasons of 2001 and 2002 from roots,
trunks, and cordons of grapevines including cultivars Concord,
Niagara, Steuben, Catawba, Dutchess, DeChaunac, Vidal, Seyval,
Chambourcin, Chardonnay, Riesling, Sangiovese, Dolcetto, Baco Noir,
Merlot, Villard, Pinot Gris, GR7, and 3309C root stock representing
18 locations in Eastern, Central, and Lake Erie regions of
Pennsylvania as well as the Lake Erie and Finger Lakes regions of New
York.

Pc was isolated from 89 percent of samples from vines 3 to 45 years
old showing decline symptoms in the field. Isolates were identified
based on a previous description (1) and by internal transcribed
spacer (ITS1-5.8S- ITS2) rDNA sequences identical to those of Pc
isolated from _Vitis vinifera_ from Italy (ex-type culture CBS229.95,
GenBankAccession No. AF197973).

Pc is firmly established as a member of the petri and esca disease
complex and as a pathogen of grapevines (2,3). To test pathogenicity
of our isolates, approximately 30 microliters of a suspension of 1
million conidia/ml, obtained from 6 isolates, was injected into the
pith of 60 single-node, dormant, unrooted cuttings of '3309C' and
'Concord'. 10 control cuttings of 'Concord' and '3309C' were injected
with an equal volume of sterile distilled water.

From 24 to 32 weeks after inoculations, all Pc-inoculated cuttings
exhibited dark streaking of the vascular tissue extending 45 to 50 mm
from the point of inoculation. The vascular streaking observed in
inoculated plants was identical to symptoms observed in declining
vines in the vineyard. Vascular streaking was absent in the controls.

Pc was isolated as a monoculture from regions of vascular streaking
in 89 percent of inoculated cuttings. Pc was not isolated from the
water-treated controls. Pc is widespread and readily isolated from
declining grapevines in Pennsylvania, New York, and other national
and international grape growing regions.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of Pc from the cultivars
cited above in Pennsylvania and New York.

[Pc is a frequent pathogen of grapevine and is of considerable
concern to growers in temperate areas of USA, France, Italy, New
Zealand, and South Africa. Infected plants are frequently stunted
with chlorotic, sparse, and stunted leaves and are poor producers of
grapes. Several other fungi (another species of _Phaeomoniella_, 2
species of _Phaeoacremonium_, and _P. inflatipes_ and _P.
aleophilum_, have been associated with young grapevine decline in
major production regions of California. The disease caused by Pc is
difficult to detect in its early stages, but a PCR technique has been
developed. Disease management involves use of hot-water-treated
planting material, avoidance of damage by mechanical equipment,
pruning late in the season, and application of systemic fungicides.
