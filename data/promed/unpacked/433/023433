A patrolling team of the forest department identified the carcass of a female baby elephant with multiple injuries Tuesday [10 Aug 2021]. On Monday [9 Aug 2021], the department had initiated an investigation into the deaths of 2 animals whose carcasses were found at different spots [in Tamil Nadu's Mudumalai Tiger Reserve]. The probe revealed that electrocution in a wire fence caused the death of the male sloth bear while anthrax is suspected to have caused the death of the sub-adult female elephant.

Regarding the death of the female elephant, physical evidence suggested the cause of death to be anthrax. Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by Gram positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_. Anthrax can be found naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals around the world. The carcass of the elephant would be disposed of in line with the protocols. It is notable that pictures of the elephant's body showed bloodstains on the ground near the trunk and the mouth of the elephant.

Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, located in the Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu, is at the tri-junction of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. It is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. Animals such as tiger, leopard, elephant, Indian Gaur (bison), and sloth bear are often sighted at the Reserve.

An elephant, which was found dead at Mangalapatti near Thengumaradha in Nilgiris district on Tuesday [10 Aug 2021], may have died of anthrax, according to the forest department. This is the 2nd anthrax-related elephant death reported the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve in one month.

"Initially, our staff identified the carcass as that of a cow elephant. After a close look on Wednesday [11 Aug 2021], we realised that it was a male elephant, aged around 4. We did not conduct a postmortem since we suspect that it could have died of anthrax as blood was oozing from the trunk and mouth." said LCS Srikanth, deputy director of MTR.

The carcass was burnt as per protocol after veterinarians collected blood samples. A water hole in the vicinity would be disinfected and the animal husbandry department would soon organise vaccination for cattle roaming in the surrounding areas, he added. It may be recalled that a cow elephant died of anthrax near Anaikatti on 12 Jul 2021, the 1st in 4.5 years [see Anthrax - India (03): (TN) elephant 20210714.8518866].

Meanwhile, a month-old elephant calf was found dead in Theppkadu on Wednesday [11 Aug 2021]. Forest officials suspect that it might have been killed in a carnivore attack, as bite injuries and pug marks were found on the carcass. Forest officials said that carnivores attacking an elephant calf was quite common inside the forest.

[My colleague Joe Dudley (<joseph.p.dudley@leidos.com>), very experienced in anthrax in wildlife in Africa, has kindly informed me that Asian elephants and African Savanna/Bush elephants are preferential grazers and facultative browsers. When grasses are readily available in their most palatable growth phases, both species will eat grasses to the exclusion of anything else except ripe fruits. African forest elephants are unique among living elephants in that grasses -- even when available -- do not constitute a significant component of the diet. Both species consume soil directly from mineral licks and incidentally when feeding on roots of grasses and woody plants [thanks, Joe]. - Mod.MHJ
