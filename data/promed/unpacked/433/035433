BOSTON: The potentially deadly West Nile virus has infected a horse in the
town of Bedford, the first such case in Massachusetts. - an indication that
a human could contract the disease, the state health department announced
Friday [1 Sep 2000. The horse had severe central nervous system symptoms,
including disorientation and paralysis, and was euthanized on Tuesday [29
Aug 2000.
Ralph Timperi, director of the State Laboratory Institute, said that
"Finding an infection in a horse is a direct indication of a risk to
humans. You know that the mosquitoes that could transmit it to humans are
carrying the virus".
Timperi said that "Health officials were still holding out hope that humans
might escape infection because it is late in the season". There have been
no reports of humans infected with the virus in Massachusetts.
The department also said that the total number of birds found with the
virus in the state had climbed to 68, with recent discoveries in Billerica
and Tewksbury. Three pools with mosquitoes containing the virus have been
found, 2 in Brookline and one in Boston.

[This is the second equine case, this year; the first was reported in New
York. As horses are more subject to exposure to mosquitoes, one might
hypothesize that their sentinel capacity as a species may be short-lived
since they are more likely to be bitten and thus become immune than humans
in their air conditioned living apartments. Also with the relatively
shorter mosquito season in the northern USA, there may always be a
substantive susceptible proportion of the human population at risk. It will
be interesting to observe how many horse cases will be reported this year
in relation to seroprevalence of West Nile virus infection (i.e., if anyone
is bleeding them}. New England is not a major horse breeding area, so only
replacement animals will be at risk in future. -Mods.MHJ/CP
