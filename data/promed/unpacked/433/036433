In less than 3 months of 2022, there have been 5 cases of hantavirus [infection] in Los Santos, a disease that -- since first detected in 1999 -- has left hundreds of people affected as well as causing dozens of deaths.

Los Santos is one of the provinces with the most infections. In 2021 it reported 10 cases, but already this year [2022] -- in 2 1/2 months -- at least half that number of cases have been confirmed. In addition, unlike other years, the cases are not confined to a single area but several districts already have confirmed cases of the disease.

According to the Los Santos health director, Ayvar Hernández, this week the province recorded its 5th case, a 51 year old patient resident of Los Olivos district in Los Santos. The patient is in the intensive care unit of the Gustavo Nelson Hospital on Chitre hill, in stable but serious condition.

Three of the 5 confirmed cases have been reported in March 2022. Also, among the 5, 3 have hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and 2 presented with hantavirus fever.

The places that have confirmed cases in the province are Las Palmitas in the Las Tablas district, El Guayabal and Los Olivos in Los Santos district, and in Tonosí and Macaracas districts, while, according to the epidemiological report, the 10 cases in 2021 were all concentrated in the Tonosí district.

The director of health indicated that the technical teams and health promoters are carrying out tours and inspections in the surroundings of the residence where the case was confirmed in order to look for possible risk factors. In addition, recommendations are provided to the community to prevent them from keeping food scraps in their yards or houses and to store grain well [securely] since the rodent that transmits [the virus] is in search of water and food.

[The Los Santos province has new cases again this year (2022). The occurrence of cases of hantavirus infections is not unusual at this season of the year. They frequently occur in Panama's central provinces, including Herrera and Los Santos, every year.

Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these 5 cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases, based on genomic sequence analysis (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
