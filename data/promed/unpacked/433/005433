Lab mice infected with rabies missing
-------------------------------------
SIAULIAI, Lithuania - Rabies-infected mice have been missing from a
research laboratory for nearly a week, authorities said Friday, warning
the rodents could infect other animals.
Police said they believed the rodents, which went missing on Monday, were
either stolen to sell as pet food for snakes or someone robbed the
containers holding 23 mice without realizing they were inside.
The mice had been injected with blood from pets believed to have rabies 
a way to confirm the diagnoses, said Jonas Lydzius, head of the
veterinary service in Siauliai, 130 miles north of the capital, Vilnius.
He said most of the mice would have contracted the disease by now.
"This is a very dangerous situation. The mice must be brought back, dead
or alive," he said, adding police, veterinary officials and volunteers
were checking open markets for anyone selling white lab mice.
He said rabies was a serious problem in this former Soviet Baltic
republic of 3.7 million people, especially since up to 80 percent of all
house pets have not received vaccinations to protect them against the
deadly disease.
If the mice were released, cats could catch them and become infected; the
pets, in turn, could infect their owners with rabies, which can be fatal
in humans unless promptly and effectively treated, Lydzius said.
