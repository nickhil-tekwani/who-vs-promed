Russian authorities announced new cases of African swine fever (ASF) in the Amur region near its border with China on Wednesday [21 Aug 2019]. Pigs infected with the deadly ASF virus that has no cure or vaccine at this time were found at 2 private farms in the village of Volkovo near Blagoveshchensk, Reuters reports. In early August [2019], an ASF outbreak was detected at a small farm in Russia's Primorsk region near the country's border with China.

The ASF virus is highly transmissible between pigs, but it does not affect humans. The disease poses no risk to food safety. For more information on ASF and its spread, visit <porkbusiness.com/ASF>.

[For the location of Volkovo village in Amur province, see map at https://tinyurl.com/y29x9764. Similarly to the earlier outbreak this month (August 2019) in the Primorskyi krai (20190806.6609342), the source of infection is likely to be China's adjacent Heilongjiang province, where the virus has been circulating since late 2018.

Heilongjiang was the site of one of the solitary ASF events in China in which wild boar were reportedly involved (20181210.6203157). Information on the wild boar ASF situation in China is rather scarce. It would be interesting to note if surveillance in wild boar is being applied there, in particular in the regions bordering Russia's far east territories; results, if available, will be welcomed.

According to FAO's weekly "ASF situation in Asia update" of 22 Aug 2019 (not yet on the internet), China's Ministry of Agriculture has released on 15 Aug 2019 statistics showing a 32.2% decrease in the number of live pigs and a 31.9% drop in the number of breeding sows in China for July 2019 over the same period last year (2018).

The update presents also a link to the 26 presentations discussed during the 2nd meeting of the standing group of experts on African swine fever (SGE-ASF) for Asia, held in Tokyo, Japan on 30-31 Jul 2019 (https://rr-asia.oie.int/activities/regional-activities/gf-tads-framework/standing-group-of-experts-on-asf/201907-2nd-sge-mtg/). - Mod.AS
