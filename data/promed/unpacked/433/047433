The Dutch Food and Consumer Safety Authority (NVWA) will cull 107 000 chickens on Saturday [30 Oct 2021] due to a bird flu outbreak at a large poultry farm in Grootschermer in the municipality of Alkmaar, Minister of Agriculture Carola Schouten wrote in a letter to the Tweede Kamer.

Schouten wrote it concerns a "broiler farm with 3 sheds: 2 sheds with 40 000 animals and one shed with 27 000 animals. In one barn, the animals showed signs of bird flu," Schouten said.

The samples taken show that there is, indeed, a case of contamination.

Near the infected farm there is another chicken farm with 18 700 broilers. According to the agriculture minister, it is "responsible" not to clear this company preventively because no other commercial poultry farm is located within a radius of 10 kilometers [6.2 mi] "where the spread could occur."

On Tuesday [26 Oct 2021], Schouten announced an obligation of commercial poultry farmers to keep their chickens indoors for the time being to limit the spread of the virus.

The Ministry also called on Netherlands residents to report any dead wild birds they come across so that these can be tested for bird flu. Information about how to report can be found on the NVWA website.

The distance, as the crow flies, between Zeewolde and Grootschermer is about 55 km [34 mi]. Migrating birds are suspected to be the source of infection. - Mod.AS
