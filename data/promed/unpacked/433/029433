More Than 50 Cases of Sleeping Sickness Diagnosed in Negage [Uige Province]
--------------------------------------------
[Detection of] about 55 new cases of sleeping sickness is the result of the
Active Prospecting Campaign "The doctor goes to meet the sick" held during
the last 15 days of December 2002, at Negage municipality, 37 km from Uije
city. According to the doctor of Uige project Angotrip Dr Kiala Gode, the
new data are the result of an Active Prospecting among more than 1000
people from Negage peripheral settlement and Quisseque commune.
He considered the situation of the sleeping sickness in the region
worrisome. Hundreds of new cases were reported during the previous year
[2002], of which more than 100 died.
