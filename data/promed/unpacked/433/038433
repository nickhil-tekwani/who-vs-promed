A genetically engineered vaccine against _Escherichia coli_ O157 tested in
a small group of adult volunteers appears safe and stimulates the
production of antibodies against the potentially fatal pathogen,
researchers reported in the February issue of the Journal of Infectious
Diseases.
A vaccine against _E. coli_ O157 would be a valuable weapon against the
pathogen, because the infection doesn't respond well to antibiotics.
Moreover, some researchers believe that antibiotics may increase the
incidence of a sometimes fatal complication of the infection, hemolytic
uremic syndrome, by promoting the release of a bacterial toxin into the
bloodstream.
Researchers at the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development, Bethesda, Md, and the Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC,
tested the vaccine on a group of 87 volunteers, nearly all of whom
developed antibodies within 1 week, with no adverse effects other than a
mild irritation at the site of the injection. The antibody levels produced
throughout the 6-month trial were sufficient to kill the bacteria in
laboratory cultures. (None of the volunteers was exposed to the pathogen
itself.)
Further clinical trials are needed to test the vaccine in children and to
determine if it actually protects against infection. In the meantime, the
investigators are exploring a strategy to cut off a major source of _E.
coli_ O157: vaccinating cattle, which are asymptomatic carriers of the
pathogen.
