3 patients have died and 122 were reported in serious condition after
a food poisoning outbreak in a hospital near Zagreb, authorities said.
According to the reports, food poisoning broke out in a hospital for
developmentally disabled people at the Dugo Selo suburb of Zagreb on
Thu, 11 Mar 2004, when the 3 patients died.
All the patients had eaten liver, and Croatian health authorities
believe that the food might have contained _Clostridium perfringens_
bacteria.
Illness caused by this bacterium usually occurs 8-15 hours after
ingestion of the contaminated food. The symptoms include intense
abdominal cramps, gas, and diarrhea. "But when this affects persons
whose health is already seriously damaged, it may lead to death, as
in those 3 cases," Dr. Ante Berus said, quoted by local media.

[This food-borne enteritis is a not uncommon disease and, unlike
_Staphylococcus aureus_ food poisoning, in which the toxin is
ingested preformed, the enterotoxin is elaborated in the intestinal
tract after ingestion of vegetative cells of _Clostridium
perfringens_. In Europe and the USA, meat and meat products are the
principal foods associated with outbreaks. Type A _C. perfringens_
has been responsible for almost all cases of foodborne illness.
This short-lived toxin illness (usually 24 hours or less) presents
with more diarrhea than staphylococcal enterotoxin B disease, minimal
if any vomiting, usually no fever, and with a incubation period of
8-20 hours. Unless the toxin burden is very large, mortality is
generally very low; although if fluid and electrolyte balance is not
maintained in chronically debilitated individuals, increased
morbidity and mortality may occur.
Epsilon toxin of _C. perfringens_ is listed as one of the category B
bioterrorist agents. It is not elaborated by type A _C.
perfringens_, but rather by types B and D. Epsilon toxin causes a
rapidly lethal, acute toxemia in sheep primarily but also in other
herbivores such as goats and cattle. Eating habits appear to be
particularly relevant as an introduction of a diet containing protein
and energy-rich foods as what may occur with fast growing young
animals is associated with increased susceptibility. The
"overeating" disease may be caused by undigested, starch ladened food
reaching the intestines where _C. perfringens_ spores are better able
to germinate and produce the prototoxin which undergoes protease
digestion into the active toxin, the gene for which has been cloned
in _E. coli_.
The toxin causes an increase in intestinal permeability and some
enteritis, producing toxemia, pulmonary edema, pericardial effusions,
and swollen hyperemic kidneys ("pulpy kidney disease"). Central
nervous system disease is reflected by nervousness in sheep and less
commonly as seizures or loss of consciousness. Cattle and older
sheep are more likely to demonstrate neurological signs, and goats
manifest more diarrhea. Cerebral edema in toxin-exposed animals
appears to be a stimulus for the release of catecholamines and
secondarily adenyl cyclase. In calves and adult goats, subacute
nonfatal cases occur. Intravenous injection of epsilon toxin in
calves produces similar histopathological changes seen in sheep and
goats after enteric exposure including acute pulmonary edema and
cerebral edema.
Delivered to humans as an aerosol in adequate doses, it is thought
that the toxin could initially cause pulmonary edema with the
possibility of secondary kidney, cardiac, and nervous system damage.
As with staphylococcal enterotoxin B disease, the doses of epsilon
toxin possible to be delivered would result in debilitation of
military or civilian populations rather than death. Although not
specifically listed as a agent of biological warfare, _C.
perfringens_ alpha toxin (a potent phospholipase), when aerosolized,
to cause severe, lethal pulmonary disease in animals due to a
pulmonary capillary leak resulting in ARDS. Absorbed alpha toxin
could lead to intravascular hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and liver
damage.
