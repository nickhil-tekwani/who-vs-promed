With the death toll of children suffering from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Bihar rising to 124 today [Fri 20 Jun 2014], Union Health Minister Harshvardhan is arriving in Patna tonight to take stock of the situation.

"Altogether 123 people have died in 2 hospitals here so far, including 6 in the last 24 hours; 20 new cases have also come, taking the number of hospitalised children to 670. The patients admitted in Muzaffarpur are local as well as from East Champaran, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Vaishali and Samastipur districts," said Muzaffarpur Civil Surgeon Dr Gyan Bhushan.

"A child of Bhagalpur has died here of AES. One patient each from Khagaria and Madhepura districts is admitted in Muzaffarpur. We are establishing a separate ICU to tackle a situation. Instructions have been issued to government officials to help detect ill children and rush them to hospital," said Bhagalpur Civil Surgeon Dr Uday Shankar Chaudhary.

Health department officials said Harshvardhan will visit to Muzaffarpur, where 670 patients are admitted in 2 hospitals, Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) and Kejriwal Hospital. He will monitor the efforts being made to check the loss of lives.

A very high death rate of around 26 per cent has made AES more alarming, and the doctors are keeping their fingers crossed. What makes it worse is that the reasons behind the syndrome are yet unknown.

"We are doing our best and praying for rains to lash Muzaffarpur. So far, there have been no rains here. Past experience shows AES incidence declines rapidly once the monsoon rains start," said Bhushan.

Meanwhile, T Jacob John, an expert from Christian Medical College, Vellore in Tamil Nadu said the major reason behind the spread of the disease is malnutrition and unhygienic conditions. "The blood glucose level of the affected kids has been found to be very low, and we are trying to find out whether it is due to some virus or toxins particular to the heat and humid weather prevalent in these parts during this season," said John.

The symptoms vary from high fever, body ache, stiffness of limbs to meningitis and coma.

The Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said today [22 Jun 2014] that Atlanta-based CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) will be requested to help in the Bihar encephalitis case. They are requested to test the blood samples of children affected by AES (acute encephalitis syndrome), which has taken the death toll to 130 in Bihar. Mr Vardhan told reporters: "This encephalitis disease in Bihar is still a mystery to be solved. We are unaware about the exact cause of the disease. I will request the world-famous CDC institute based in Atlanta to test the blood samples of the infected children and find out the reasons behind it. Our Indian scientists are also working on the samples to come out with the cause of the disease."

"The Union government will provide all help to Bihar to tackle the acute encephalitis syndrome. A 2-day special immunisation programme will be conducted on 22 and 23 Jun 2014 in the affected districts [immunization against what? The etiology of this disease has not been determined. - Mod.TY] If malnutrition is a reason, it will also be removed," Vardhan said. A majority of children who died of AES were from Muzaffarpur, East Champaran, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Vaishali and Bhagalpur districts. Cases were also recorded in Samastipur, Begusarai and Khagaria districts.

In the absence of the identification of virus, bacteria or agents causing the deadly disease, having a death rate of 26 per cent, doctors at their best could provide only symptomatic treatment to patients. The symptoms varied from high fever, body ache, stiffness of limbs to meningitis and coma. Usually, the syndrome affected malnourished children with very low sugar levels and plummeting levels of electrolyte in the body.

Encephalitis is a disease that results in inflammation of the brain. The patient's central nervous system is affected. While the lesser symptoms include headaches and fevers, the more severe ones cause the onset of mental issues like seizures, confusion, disorientation, tremors and hallucinations. It can be caused due to bacterial or viral infections of the brain, injection of toxic substances, or increased complications of an infectious disease.

[The number of fatal encephalitis cases reported continues to climb. On 18 Jun 2014, the count was 107 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140619.25) and now has climbed to 124 just 2 days later, as reported in [1] above and then to 130 mentioned in [2], another 2 days later. The nature of the vaccination campaign in report [2] is not mentioned but most likely is for Japanese encephalitis. However, Dr Jacob John dismisses JEV etiology in these early season AES cases (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140615.2540893). He pointed out that the outbreaks in the Muzaffarpur district in Bihar state, annually recurrent, are quite different from many other outbreaks of JEV in various parts of India, including some parts of Bihar. He noted that JEV has a post-monsoon seasonality, obviously due to increase in _Culex_ mosquitoes that are vectors of JEV. Muzaffarpur outbreaks are during May-June (with some in April and some in July), and with onset of monsoon rains, the outbreak stops. The clinical and laboratory parameters of these cases in Bihar are not like encephalitis, rather, are typical of encephalopathy. It is not clear from the report [2] above whether the CDC will just test blood samples sent from India or whether CDC clinical team members will be involved in the field in Bihar as well, collaborating with Indian colleagues. Close collaboration between clinical staff attending affected patients and those providing laboratory support will be essential to arrive at a diagnosis.

The low blood glucose levels suggest Reye's syndrome. This syndrome occurs in children who have been given aspirin when they have a viral illness, most commonly chickenpox or influenza. Infections with other viruses, such as parainfluenza, adenovirus, or enteroviruses are less commonly associated. Patients develop an acute encephalopathy and fatty liver and present with vomiting and altered mental status. Reye's syndrome or Reye-like syndrome has also been associated with exposure to other drugs or toxins. Blood ammonia levels are high, as are levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The mortality rate can be as high as 50 percent. - Mod.ML]
