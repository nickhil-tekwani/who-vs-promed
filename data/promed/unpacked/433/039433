[1] China (Hong Kong). 2 Feb 2020. The Centre for Health Protection said late on Saturday [1 Feb 2020] that a 14th person has tested positive for the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, with further tests scheduled to confirm the diagnosis. The 80-year-old man, who lives with his wife at Luk Kwai House in Kwai Chung, was admitted to the Caritas Medical Centre with fever on Thursday [30 Jan 2020] and has since been transferred to the Princess Margaret Hospital. He's in a stable condition.

The centre says the man had made only a brief visit to the mainland recently, spending a few hours there after crossing the Lo Wu checkpoint into Shenzhen on 10 Jan [2020]. He also took a flight to Tokyo on 17 Jan 2020 and joined a cruise from Yokohama with his 2 daughters on 20 Jan [2020]. They arrived at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal on 25 Jan [2020]. The centre says the man had not visited health facilities, wet markets or had contact with wild animals during the incubation period. He developed a cough on 19 Jan [2020] but only sought treatment after a fever developed on Thursday [23 Jan 2020?].

Meanwhile the Centre has placed 2 Hong Kong residents under medical observation after they travelled on the same train from Wuhan to Pingxiang, Jiangxi province, on 21 Jan [2020]. A fellow passenger was confirmed to have the virus.

Health officials expressed worries earlier on Saturday [1 Feb 2020] as they said a 75-year-old man could've been infected with the new coronavirus locally. The man was confirmed as Hong Kong's 12th case of the infection on Thursday [30 Jan 2020]. He returned from Shunde in Guangdong on 7 Jan [2020] and visited Macau between 10-14 Jan [2020]. Then he spent almost all of his time in his neighbourhood of Tsing Yi;

Prof Joseph T Wu, PhD, Kathy Leung, PhD, Prof Gabriel M Leung, MD. Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study.

Summary

Background
Since 31 Dec 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.

Methods
We used data from 31 Dec 2019, to 28 Jan 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from 25 Dec 2019, to 19 Jan 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from 1 Dec 2019, to 25 Jan 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began 23-24 Jan 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CrI).

Findings
In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2.68 (95% CrI 2·47-2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of 25 Jan 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8-7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks.

Interpretation
Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

[Although the R0 in this report is somewhat higher than previous ones (2.2), the patterns of spread are likely the same and are already playing out in China and beyond. The authors' advice that preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally is on target. Outbreaks from introduction of the virus into crowded megacities around the world would be difficult to contain. - Mod.TY]

[3] Philippines ex Wuhan China 1st death. 2 Feb 2020. The Philippines reported the 1st death outside China on Sunday [2 Feb 2020] from the coronavirus that has now killed at least 304 people, infected thousands and spread to dozens of other countries. The man who died in the Philippines was from Wuhan, where the coronavirus is thought to have originated late last year [2019]. He was 44;

[4] USA (Boston Massachusetts) ex Wuhan China. 1 Feb 2020. U.S. confirms 8th Case. A man in New York City is suspected of having the coronavirus after returning from China, and a college student in Boston is in isolation after becoming the 8th confirmed U.S. case of the deadly disease. The 8th person in the U.S. diagnosed with the novel coronavirus is a student in his 20s at the University of Massachusetts in Boston who recently visited Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. The student, who is feeling well, doesn't need hospitalization and has been asked to stay at home in isolation;
