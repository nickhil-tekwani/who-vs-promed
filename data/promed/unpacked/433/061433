Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / 23 / 23 / 100 / 23
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering, contact with wild species

Epidemiological comments: an African swine fever outbreak has been reported in free-range pigs from villages at the north-eastern border. Free-range pigs spread the disease before it could be confirmed. The affected areas have been put under quarantine to limit spread of the disease. 2 24 hours veterinary check-points have been mounted along the major roads leaving the Nyakomba and Nyamaropa areas to prevent illegal movement of live pigs and pig products from the affected areas. Disease surveillance currently on-going to determine the extent of spread of infection. Veterinary personnel on the ground, in collaboration with local village leadership and members of the dip tank committee, have started awareness campaigns in the affected villages. Farmers are being instructed to confine their pigs in pigsties and report all ill or dead animals to their local Division of Veterinary Services offices.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; ante and post-mortem inspections; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Swine / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 13 Feb 2019 / Positive

Future reporting

[During 2015, 8 outbreaks of African swine fever were reported in Zimbabwe. See event summary report and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=18195

The information below is quoted in a research article entitled "Reemergence of African swine fever in Zimbabwe, 2015," by van Heerden J, Malan K, Gadaga BM, Spargo RM. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5): 860-1. The complete article is available at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/5/16-1195_article

"Zimbabwe is the only country in southern Africa with no reported African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks during 1993-2014. However, the 2015 discovery of genotype II ASF virus in Zimbabwe indicates the reemergence of ASF in this country and suggests that this viral genotype may be spreading through eastern and southern Africa.

"Zimbabwe had outbreaks caused by ASFV genotype I in 1990 and 1992 and by genotype VIII in 1961. No further outbreaks were reported in Zimbabwe until July 2015, when ASF was detected in domestic pigs in Mashonaland Central Province in northern Zimbabwe, where it was confined to the area along the border with Mozambique. The virus spread locally because of the salvage slaughter of infected pigs, the selling of infected pig meat at discounted prices, the movement of pigs between villages, and the inappropriate disposal of infectious carcasses.

"All villages affected during the 2015 outbreak in Zimbabwe were along the northern border with Mozambique, where genotype II has been found before." - Mod.CRD
