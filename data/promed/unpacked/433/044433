The Ministry of Health of Córdoba reported 10 new cases of canine leishmaniasis, a disease transmitted by the bite of a small insect, and requested extreme prevention measures to avoid a greater number of infections.

Of the cases detected this year, 9 occurred in dogs from the provincial capital, while the remaining one is located in the town of Parque Siquiman, in the Punilla Valley. These are added to another 6 registered between 2019 and 2021 in the same localities, making a total of 16 confirmed cases in the province of Córdoba.

What causes visceral leishmaniasis?
Visceral leishmaniasis is a disease caused by a parasite called _Leishmania infantum_, which is transmitted through the bite of a small insect called a sandfly.

The head of Epidemiology of the province, Laura López, highlighted, "It is important to direct efforts to canine surveillance and control actions -- such as those we have been carrying out -- in addition to environmental planning and early warning to the health system in the event of any [occurrence]. For this reason, it is essential both human and animal health teams, as well as the community in general, be aware of the modes of transmission of this infection, its signs and symptoms, and ways to prevent it."

Visceral leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease affecting both animals and people, and it is serious in humans, particularly in children. If proper treatment is not provided on time, it can lead to death, the health ministry said.

The disease in humans occurs when a sandfly feeds on the blood of a dog infected with the parasite and then bites a person.

It is not transmitted from person to person or by direct contact with animals.

In dogs, infection occurs from the bite of an infected sandfly, but also sexually and transplacentally (from mother to offspring during gestation).

The main signs in dogs are body wasting; loss of appetite and hair; scaling, especially around the eyes and on the muzzle; exaggerated nail growth; skin ulcers; and nosebleeds.

In people, infection presents with prolonged fever, enlarged abdomen, loss of appetite and weight, dry cough, diarrhea and vomiting, anemia (pale skin and/or mucous membranes), and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and / or mucous membranes).

The treatment of this disease must be carried out under medical supervision.

Leishmaniasis is sensitive to climatic conditions, since the climate affects its epidemiology in several aspects.

Changes in temperature, precipitation, and humidity can greatly affect vectors and animal reservoirs, altering their distribution and influencing survival rates and population size. Small fluctuations in temperature can have a marked effect on the developmental cycle of _Leishmania_ promastigotes in sandflies, allowing the parasite to be transmitted in areas where the disease was not previously endemic.

Droughts, famines, and floods resulting from climate change can lead to mass displacement and migration of people to areas of leishmaniasis transmission, and malnutrition can weaken the immunity of affected populations.

["Leishmaniosis is a chronic, severe disease of humans, dogs, and certain other mammals caused by single-celled protozoa of the genus _Leishmania_. Canine leishmaniosis (also called viscerocutaneous leishmaniosis) is characterized by skin lesions and disease of internal organs.

"Infection in dogs is prevalent in Central and South America, the Middle East, Asia, and the Mediterranean region. The disease is found intermittently in North America, especially in foxhounds. Isolated cases are diagnosed around the world in animals having visited areas where the disease is well established.

"Leishmaniosis can be transmitted from dogs to people. Humans most frequently catch this disease when they are bitten by a sand fly or other insect having previously bitten an infected animal or human. While there are only a very few human or animal cases in the US each year, worldwide there are about 700 000 to 1 million new cases of human leishmaniasis and 20 000 to 30 000 deaths a year. Most human cases of visceral leishmaniosis are reported in Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan.

"The incubation period is quite variable, ranging from months to several years. The signs vary but may include skin lesions, weight loss, reluctance to exercise, lethargy, poor appetite, local or generalized disease of the lymph nodes, eye lesions, kidney failure, nosebleed, lameness, and anemia. Occasionally, some dogs have chronic diarrhea or liver disease. The most common skin lesions are areas of baldness with severe dry skin shedding, usually beginning on the head and extending to the rest of the body. Other animals develop chronic ulceration, located particularly on the head and limbs. Ulcers on the ears can bleed considerably. The signs invariably progress slowly.

"Canine leishmaniasis is diagnosed using specialized blood tests identifying the parasite or the dog's immune response to the parasite. Direct observation of the parasite is more difficult, even in dogs with full-blown disease.

"Drug treatment is available for dogs with visceral leishmaniosis and may last 6 to 12 months or longer. Treatment usually only improves the dog's signs and does not eliminate the parasites. Treated dogs can remain carriers of the infection, allowing it to spread to others. Relapses after treatment are common. Topical insecticides against sand flies are critical for dogs living in areas where leishmaniasis is common, dogs traveling to these regions, and infected dogs (to reduce likelihood of transmission). In areas where the disease is common, rapid treatment of infected dogs, control of stray and homeless dogs, and control of sand flies are recommended. Vaccines against canine leishmaniosis are available in Europe and Brazil, and other vaccines are under development. Because dogs can serve as a source of infection for people, especially young children, preventing canine infections is important for human health in areas where leishmaniasis is prevalent."
