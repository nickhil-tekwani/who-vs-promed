A Chinese woman farmer died after contracting H5N6 avian flu in central China's Hunan province, health authorities said today [Mon 21 Nov 2016].

The 47 year old farmer from Shaoyang City [Hunan] was admitted to a local hospital last Friday [18 Nov 2016], when her health condition became critical, but she died yesterday [Sun 20 Nov 2016], according to the Hunan provincial disease control center (CDC). [The woman] had contact with dead poultry before she fell ill. No human-to-human transmission has been reported yet.

Experts from the CDC warned people who have had contact with live poultry to stay alert and for others to stay away from poultry and excrement, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

[The WHO risk assessment considers that influenza A/H5N6 poses a relatively low risk for human to human transmission. But every human case is an opportunity for the avian viruses to evolve and potentially adapt to humans. Continued surveillance and monitoring are therefore essential. - Mod.UBA
