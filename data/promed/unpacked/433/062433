[There was another outbreak during April 2010 in Bavaria. Over the
last 5 years, there has been a low level of occurrence equine
infectious anemia in Germany. In 2006, there were 7 outbreaks, 2 in
2007, 10 outbreaks in 08 and 4 in 2009. The outbreaks are not
clustered or occur within a small contiguous areas but rather they
seem to be spread widely over most of the country with only the
northern parts of Germany spared. A very nice, informative map is
available from OIE WAHID database at

The location of the present outbreak can be seen appended to the OIE
