State officials in Iowa have confirmed 15 more infections from a rare, food-borne parasite. The number of cyclospora cases in Iowa jumped to 60 by Saturday [13 Jul 2013], the Iowa Department of Public Health reported. Nebraska has reported 35 cases.

Investigators believe the parasite came from tainted vegetables, though they haven't determined what kind. The parasite causes severe diarrhea.

Iowa had only seen 10 confirmed cases in the previous 20 years. The current outbreak started in mid-June 2013. Authorities suspect that whatever vegetables caused the problem probably have already been sold and consumed or thrown out. But they continue to recommend that people carefully wash their produce. Cooking vegetables also should kill the parasite. Vegetables from home gardens should not be a problem, because the source of the outbreak, apparently, was commercially sold produce.

Experts recommend that anyone who has serious diarrhea lasting more than 2 days go to a doctor for testing. The infection can be treated with antibiotics, which can cut the duration of the illness.

Testing continues at the University of Iowa Hygienic Laboratory, and the health department plans to give an update on the situation Monday [15 Jul 2013] morning.
