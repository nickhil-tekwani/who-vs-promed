Russia: Hepatitis A Situation Eases in the Tver Region
----------------------------------------------------
The gravity of the hepatitis A disease outbreak in the southwest district
of the Tver region has been downgraded, the Response Headquarters in Rzhev
told Itar-Tass on Mon 13 Jun 2005. This has considerably eased the task for
medics and improved the epidemiological situation as a whole. No quarantine
or other restrictive measures are being considered there.
"A tendency towards reduction of disease incidence has been observed,"
deputy head of the Response Headquarters Albert Vyskubov said. As of 09:00
a.m., Moscow time, 13 Jun 2005, [another] 34 people have been
hospitalised. "A number considerably less than during the 4 previous
days", the official said. It is the intention to release another 13 people
from hospital on Tuesday.
A total of 547 people have contracted hepatitis A in the Tver region
[during the current outbreak]. An active vaccination program is continuing.
Over 1900 people who have had contact with hepatitis patients have been
inoculated against hepatitis [A virus infection]. Over half of those in the
Zubtsov district who have dad contact with hepatitis patients have been
vaccinated. The vaccination program will be continued on Tuesday. A total
of 1100 people from [high]-risk groups (medics, teachers, salesmen, food
service and public utility workers) have also been vaccinated.
The mayor of Rzhev, Alexander Kharchenko, stated that: "Assistance has been
provided by the Moscow region governor in the form of medicines." Tver
region governor Dmitry Zelenin sent a letter of thanks to Moscow region
governor Boris Gromov.
6 special vehicles are expected to arrive in Rzhev on Tuesday [14 Jun 2005]
as assistance to local public utility workers. A second prophylactic
examination will be carried out in the Olenino settlement and vaccination
of local food service workers continued. Sanitation measures will be taken
in the town of Zubtsov.

I am responding to the query of Mod.JW regarding the high number of
children who fell ill, apparently after drinking beer.
It is not official yet, but it is believed that the outbreak was caused by
products from the Rjevpivo brewery. This brewery manufactures not only
beer, but also lemonade (14 forms) and kvass (a Russian non-alcoholic
drink). Approximately 85 percent of those who fell ill had consumed these
drinks beforehand.

[If other bottled products from the same producer are involved, the common
source would be the water, but it is still problematic how the virus could
have survived the beer-brewing process. Perhaps this Russian beer is
produced by a cold process? Or the bottles are recycled, and washed in
contaminated water? At any rate, because the epidemic curve is declining
since sales of the drinks were suspended, that is circumstantial evidence
that the drinks were in fact the source of the outbreak. - Mod.JW]
[If in fact water was the source, the vehicle for spread does not have to
be beer at all as the soft drinks could have served as the vehicle for all
ages. - Mod.DK]
