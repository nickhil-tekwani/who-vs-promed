A cholera outbreak in Yemen has killed 51 people since [Thu 27 Apr 2017], the WHO said on [Thu 11 May 2017], more than double the toll of 25 reported 3 days ago. WHO said there are 2752 suspected cholera cases and 58 more people have been confirmed as having the diarrheal disease.

An epidemic late in 2016 faded but outbreaks are frequent and made worse by the degrading of health and sanitation systems by more than 2 years of civil war that has also killed at least 10 000 people and displaced millions. Only a few medical facilities are still functioning and two-thirds of the population are without access to safe drinking water, the UN has said.

The capital Sanaa was worst hit, with 34.6 percent of the cases, followed by the surrounding province with 12 percent, the data showed. Cases were also reported in Yemen's other major cities: Hodeidah, Hajjah, Ibb, Taiz and Aden. WHO said that 7.6 million people live in areas at high risk of cholera transmission. Although most sufferers have no symptoms or mild symptoms that can be treated with oral rehydration solution, in more severe cases the disease can kill within hours if not treated with intravenous fluids and antimicrobials.

Yemen's conflict pits the Houthi movement and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh against the Saudi-led military coalition, backing the internationally recognized government.

[After a winter lull, this _V. cholerae_ epidemic has returned big time.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera, in Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):

The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs. 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose - or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref. 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
