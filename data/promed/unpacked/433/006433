Avian botulism is the likely cause of more than 80 bird deaths at a Manchester park, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs [Defra] said.

In the past week [16-22 Jul 2014], ducks, geese, and coots have been found dead in the lake at Boggart Hole Clough, Blackley [a district of Manchester].

Defra said further tests were needed, but the disease was suspected following an autopsy on a bird.

Humans are not thought to be in danger, as the disease cannot be spread by touching or being near infected birds.

Avian botulism is caused by a water-soluble toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ and is more often seen in warmer weather.

It was first thought that toxic blue-green algae may be responsible, but Environment Agency water samples found no trace of the bacteria in the water.

Manchester City Council said visitors are being asked not enter the lake or allow their dogs to play in water "as a precaution".

The park covers 190 acres [77 ha] and includes woodland, play areas and tennis courts.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Spores of these bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.
