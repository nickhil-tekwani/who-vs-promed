Iceland health officials reported on [Sat 2 Mar 2019] a confirmed measles case in an 11-month-old child. The unvaccinated child was in the same flight as a person with infectious measles during a flight last month [February 2019].

The child was admitted to Hringinn's Children's Hospital on [Fri 1 Mar 2019]. Officials say the likelihood of further transmission is low as long as you're vaccinated.

The initial case, traveling from the Philippines on [14 Feb 2019], was onboard flights from London to Reykjavík on [14 Feb 2019] and on Air Iceland Connect from Reykjavík to Egilsstaðir.

Officials note at present there are no known additional infected individuals; however, it is possible to get infected until [7 Mar 2019], when then 3 weeks have passed since the person with measles was traveling both abroad and in Iceland.

https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/press-release/ukraine-red-cross-deployed-help-contain-largest-measles-outbreak-europe-four-years/


Ukrainian Red Cross Society volunteers are being deployed to help contain a measles outbreak that has affected more than 75 000 people, making it the largest outbreak in Europe since 2015. This includes 54 000 measles cases reported in 2018, and more than 21 000 cases registered thus far in 2019.

Poor immunization coverage has contributed to the measles outbreak in Ukraine. In 2018, the measles vaccination rate for newborn babies was only 54%, which is amongst the lowest in the world. This is well below the target of 95% recommended by the World Health Organization. A rate of 95% would protect even those members of the community who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.

Professor Mykola Polishchuk, Acting President of Ukrainian Red Cross Society, said: "Ukraine has one of the lowest vaccination rates against measles in the world and this is a very worrying trend. We are deploying 100 Red Cross volunteers to raise awareness about vaccination and conduct education campaigns to stop the spread of this disease."

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has released 109 000 Swiss francs from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to help the Ukrainian Red Cross Society tackle the outbreak.

Officials say the low coverage rate and widespread transmission of the virus is due to many factors, including transport costs for those in rural areas, a high number of people with weakened immune systems - such as people living with HIV and tuberculosis -, and vaccine refusal. The funds will allow Ukrainian Red Cross Society to assist 90 000 people, including the most at-risk - children under 6 years of age, people with weakened immune systems, and people who have never been vaccinated against the disease.

The emergency funds will also allow volunteers to help health authorities raise awareness about vaccination, to conduct education campaigns in kindergartens, schools, hospitals and aged care facilities, and to provide protective equipment for Red Cross volunteers.

IFRC Europe Regional Director, Simon Missiri, said vaccine refusal is an increasingly worrying trend worldwide. "It is hard to believe that children are dying of measles in Europe in 2019," he said. "This disease is almost completely preventable. Red Cross workers have an important role in helping communities understand the importance of vaccines, and in answering concerns that are increasingly prevalent in many countries."

The measles operation will run for 4 months in 5 regions across the country.

Recent global declines in vaccination rates resulted in more than 110 000 measles deaths worldwide in 2017. The Ukraine outbreak coincides with other measles outbreaks across Europe and in the Philippines where measles cases are up more than 547% in 2018 compared to 2017.

The first 2 cases of measles in Bulgaria's cities of Plovdiv and Bourgas amid the recent outbreak of the disease were reported by the Health Ministry on [5 Mar 2019]. The ministry said that there were currently 66 cases of measles, of which in 41 cases the diagnosis had been confirmed by laboratory tests.

Apart from Plovdiv and Bourgas, 3 other districts in Bulgaria are affected, with 48 cases in the district of Blagoevgrad, 8 in the city of Sofia and 8 in the district of Sofia. The largest number of cases, 29, was in the age group of 1 to 4-year old.

A total of 37 cases involved people who had not been immunised, of whom 35 were children. Of the latter, 16 had not reached the age for immunisation. In 12 cases, there was no proof that they had been immunised.

The Health Ministry issued a reminder that on [14 Feb 2019], all regional health inspectorates in Bulgaria had conveyed an order that everyone between the age of 13 months and 18 years for which there was no proof of immunisation, should be identified.

The [5 Mar 2019] report on the outbreak in Plovdiv came the day after it emerged that more than 1000 children in the district had not been given the measles, mumps and rubella immunisation.

Measles vaccination in Guinea was drastically reduced during the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic, partly because attention and most resources were focused on Ebola management but mainly due to fear.

A new outbreak of the measles epidemic has just been reported in a dozen districts of the country, according to official sources. More than 200 suspected children with measles have been identified and 88 of them are already affected by the disease, Dr. Sakoba Keita, Director General of the National Agency of Health Security (ANSS) said on [Sat 2 Mar 2019] on national radio.

According to him, children already suffering from measles are hospitalized in the centers of responses and treatment of diseases with epidemic potential, implanted already all around the country, following the appearance of the Ebola fever in Guinea between 2014 and 2015.

With the support of foreign partners, the National Health Security Agency supplies health facilities for the treatment of potential epidemic diseases in the country with the necessary products and medicines to cope with urgent cases.

This measles outbreak is explained by the low immunization coverage rate of children under 5 years of age who are identified in high-risk epidemic areas. Nowadays, according to statistics from the Ministry of Health, only 25% of middle-aged children have correctly received all vaccine doses throughout the country.

"We are planning to send teams to the most remote locations so that every child can be properly vaccinated in time," said Dr. Keita.

Over 900 people have died due to a measles outbreak in Madagascar, the UN children's agency UNICEF said in a statement. According to the statement issued on [Fri 1 Mar 2019], 76 871 people were infected by measles from [3 Sep 2018 -- 21 Feb 2019]. Among the infected people, 928 have died a majority of who were children.

"Over 2 million children were immunized in 25 districts. In [February 2019], 1.4 million children were vaccinated, with another 3.9 million more to follow in [March 2019]," the statement said.

The fact that measles vaccination is not mandatory in Madagascar makes it difficult to reach a large number of children.

In violation of a health-department quarantine, a Brookfield man and his wife were charged after visiting a local health club while the man had the measles.

The 2 were charged with one count each of exposing the public to communicable disease, a misdemeanor, on [1 Mar 2019] in Waukesha County Circuit Court.

The quarantine in this instance was the least restrictive form, allowing the immediate family members living within the home to enter and leave at any time because they had been vaccinated against the virus.

The individual was ordered to be quarantined in his home 24 hours a day, 7 days a week until he was either deemed non-contagious by Health and Human Services or until [7 May 2019], the complaint said.

The focus on measles in the Pacific Northwest intensified on [Fri 1 Mar 2019] as public health officials in Oregon announced a new case of the highly contagious disease unrelated to an ongoing outbreak in Washington state that's sickened 68 people so far.

An unvaccinated Illinois resident who spent time overseas visited Portland International Airport and various locations in Salem, Oregon last week while contagious with measles, the Oregon Health Authority said. The case is unrelated to an ongoing measles outbreak in southwest Washington state that's sickened dozens. Public health officials in Clark County, Washington, said 3 new cases were identified on [Fri 1 Mar 2019] and 2 more are suspected.

That brings the number of cases in the Portland, Oregon bedroom community of Vancouver, Washington, to 68 -- more than 40% of the number reported nationwide since [1 Jan 2019], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in updated statistics released [Fri 1 Mar 2019].

There have been 159 measles cases identified nationwide through [21 Feb 2019], the CDC said, and Washington accounted for 69 of those. There have been 6 outbreaks nationwide, including in Illinois, Texas, New York City and Monroe and Rockland counties in New York state. An outbreak is defined as 3 or more cases at a time.

Most cases in Washington are young children under age 10 who were not vaccinated.

Before [Fri 1 Mar 2019], Multnomah County -- home to Portland, Oregon -- had identified 4 people with measles and 1 who could have measles. One man in King County, which is home to Seattle, also had measles. Those cases were thought to be connected to the outbreak in southwest Washington, however.

The viral illness has a long incubation period and 21 days must pass without a new case before the outbreak could be considered over in southwest Washington, said Dr. Alan Melnick, public health director in Clark County, Washington.

State legislatures in both Washington and Oregon are considering laws that would remove non-medical exemptions for the routinely administered measles vaccine. Both states currently allow parents to opt out of the measles immunizations if they have a religious or philosophical objection.

According to the Osaka Municipal Health Center, the new [measles] infection was confirmed in the women in their 50s who worked at Abeno Harukas main branch of Kintetsu Department Store. In department stores customers and employees who visited the "Valentine Fair" held from the end of January [2019] to the middle of February [2019] were infected with measles one after another. The woman is working on a different floor from the event venue, but that means she used a break space for employees on the same floor as the venue every day. There are 25 measles cases in this store in total, and in the case of symptoms suspected of measles, the city calls for medical examination in advance and contacts medical institutions.

The Department of Health (DOH) in the Soccsksargen region said another child died of suspected measles on [Wed 27 Feb 2019] in Sarangani, raising the death toll to 3 in the region since January [2019], health officials said.

Jenny Ventura Panizales, DOH Region 12 focal person on measles eradication, said a 9-month-old child died of suspected measles in Glan, Sarangani, and another one in Alabel, Sarangani.

"The causes of death of these 2 children are (still) being validated but health workers and parents confirmed of cases of measles in their communities," Panizales said.

Last week, DOH confirmed that measles was the cause of the death of a 4-month-old baby in Polomolok, South Cotabato. The DOH has monitored 342 suspected measles in various hospitals in the region as of [27 Feb 2019]. The number is 14% higher than the 299 cases monitored in the same period last year [2018].

The number of measles cases in the Philippines has almost reached 15 000, even as the government steps up its campaign against a health scare surrounding the dengue vaccine Dengvaxia.

The government had recorded 14 938 cases and 238 deaths from measles as of [28 Feb 2019], Health Department Undersecretary Eric Domingo said, adding that "the number of cases is still rising".

The Philippines declared a measles outbreak in Manila early last month [February 2019] as infections and fatalities from the highly contagious respiratory viral disease spiked.

The vaccine scare was triggered by deaths allegedly caused by Dengvaxia, which has since been banned in the country. The deaths drove many parents to shun the government's free immunisation drive.

[18] Immune amnesia
Date: 4 Mar 2019
Source: National Geographic [abridged, edited]
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/03/measles-vaccine-protect-disease-immune-amnesia/


Without vaccination, the highly contagious virus can allow other diseases to flourish in unsuspecting populations for more than 2 years after an infection.

Measles is spiking worldwide, UNICEF announced on [1 Mar 2019], with 98 countries reporting more cases in 2018 than in the prior year. Spread through the air, measles is highly contagious, and the virus can linger in a room for up to 2 hours after an infected person has left.

But danger lurks even for those who survive an outbreak. Measles not only weakens your immune system in the short term, bouts with the virus seem to wipe your immune system's memory, causing the body to forget how to fight off things that you may have already conquered. For some people, this "immune amnesia" may linger for more than 2 years.

Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, it was nearly guaranteed that every child would catch it, and an estimated 2.6 million died from the disease each year. Luckily, the measles vaccine is incredibly effective, with 2 doses imparting nearly 97% protection. So why can't we get rid of the disease?

In some parts of the world, infrastructure issues and civil strife have been interfering with vaccination campaigns and are partly behind the recent spike in cases. But that's not the only issue: complacency about vaccination is also a factor, according to UNICEF.

"The benefit of the vaccines has actually been kind of its own downfall," says Yvonne Maldonado, an epidemiologist at Stanford Medical School. "People just don't see this as a relevant intervention."

However, the data show that's not the case: Not only did cases of measles plummet once vaccine use became widespread, but cases of other diseases dropped as well--pneumococcus, diarrhea, and more. In resource-poor regions, the decline was as dramatic as 50%; in impoverished regions, it dropped by as much as 90%.

"We actually saw the whole overall baseline for childhood mortality drop precipitously," says Harvard's Michael Mina, an author on a 2015 study analyzing the decline. In essence, the measles vaccine seems to not only protect populations against measles, it seems to be keeping a slew of other infections at bay. And one way it may be doing this is through prevention of immune amnesia.

By infecting memory cells, the virus not only wiped out some of the body's immune recollections, it essentially turned the system against itself by forcing healthy immune cells to kill off their infected comrades.

"If the virus didn't kill those memory cells already, the immune system would finish the job off," de Swart says. "We could literally see it happening under our hands."

The team later confirmed that a similar mechanism is likely at play in humans. But it's unclear exactly how much immune memory vanished; that probably varies from person to person, de Swart notes. Still, the process emphasizes why secondary disease is so common with measles: Not only does the virus assault the immune system's first line of defense and damage your skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tract, it also erases your other hard-won resistances.

Because the virus attacks the immune system, the severity of infections depends on the general health of the population. In essence, measles acts like an infection amplifier, turning up the volume of background disease. This means that in resource-limited areas, the virus will cause higher overall death rates.

"In lots of developing countries still today, we see one in 50 or one in a hundred kids still dying from measles, primarily due to these sort of immune effects," Mina says

http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6235/694.long

"Vaccination against measles has many benefits, not only lifelong protection against this potentially serious virus. Mina et al. analyzed data collected since mass vaccination began in high-income countries when measles was common. Measles vaccination is associated with less mortality from other childhood infections. Measles is known to cause transient immunosuppression, but close inspection of the mortality data suggests that it disables immune memory for 2 to 3 years. Vaccination thus does more than safeguard children against measles; it also stops other infections taking advantage of measles-induced immune damage."

Children affected by measles may live with suppressed immune systems for up to 3 years, not just 1 or 2 months as earlier thought, this research has revealed. - Mod.LK]
