The following are our follow-up data on 292 patients treated for
influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection in South Viet Nam. In
previous ProMED-mail posts (see: Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (27):
Viet Nam, patient data update 20090809.2819, and Influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009: Viet Nam, patient data 20090708.2450), we reported
clinical, RT-PCR and viral culture data from 44 patients.

Viet Nam had a policy of screening at airports and quarantining of
patients that were found positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
infection until PCR negative, providing an opportunity to study viral
dynamics in a population of patients that would normally not be
hospitalized or followed-up on as frequently as was done now.

We believe these data are important and should be shared with the
infectious diseases community as soon as possible, as systematic
viral clearance data are lacking from the present literature but are
of importance both for healthcare workers and quarantine/containment
policy makers.

In addition, we present the 1st 3 cases of selection of H274Y
oseltamivir-resistant virus during treatment in Viet Nam.

We previously (20090708.2450 and 20090809.2819) reported on 44
patients with pandemic influenza virus A(H1N1)v infection. We report
now what we believe to be the 1st systematic viral clearance data in
a large group of patients with A(H1N1)v infection.

Our hospital was the primary site for quarantine and treatment of
patients in southern Viet Nam, either admitted through temperature
checks at the airport and subsequent RT-PCR or through outpatient
clinics. Patients were quarantined, treated with oseltamivir 75 mg
twice per day for at least 5 days and were sampled frequently
(initially daily, later after 0-3-5 days of treatment) by nose/throat
swabs. Patients were discharged when the RT-PCR was negative.

We now present data for the 1st 292 consecutive patients hospitalized
between 29 May and 28 Jul 2009. The average age of the patients was
26.4 years (1-69), 110 female and 182 male (includes a large outbreak
[n=50] in a secondary school for boys). 116 patients were Vietnamese
residents, and 176 were travellers arriving from foreign countries
(67 Australia, 43 USA, 15 Singapore, 14 Thailand, 5 Canada, 5
Germany, 37 other).

Fever was present in 96 percent (281/292), cough in 59 percent
(171/292), runny nose in 17 percent (49/292), sore throat in 23
percent (68/292), and diarrhoea in 2 percent (5/292). 27 rectal swabs
taken from patients with and without diarrhoea were all PCR negative

After 24 hours of admission, 78 percent (228/292) of patients had a
normal temperature. All patients had a mild illness course. Only one
patient had infiltrative lesions on chest X-ray.

Viral PCR was positive for all patients on admission. RT-PCR was
positive for the following percentage (n/total n) of patients:

Day of Treatment (DOT) 1: 86 percent (165/192), DOT2: 59 percent
(45/76), DOT3: 38 percent (27/72), DOT4: 25 percent (34/138), DOT5:
14 percent (11/76). After 5 days of treatment, 7 percent (12/179)
still had a positive RT-PCR. One patient remained RT-PCR positive on
day 8 and one patient on day 14. We could not isolate a virus after
days 5 of treatment in any patient, including those who were RT-PCR
positive (n=12).

In this series of 292 patients, the H274Y neuraminidase mutation,
associated with oseltamivir resistance was not detected. We have,
however, detected the H274Y mutation in 3 samples from more recent
patients. These 3 patients shed virus for 5, 6 and 11 days after
onset of treatment initiation. The mutation was acquired [selected?]
during treatment. The clinical course of illness in 2 patients was
unremarkable. One patient, a 3-year-old child, required admission to
Intensive Care but made a full recovery within 10 days.

Our results suggest that most patients infected with the pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus become RT-PCR negative within 5 days of starting 75
mg twice per day of oseltamivir. RT-PCR can remain positive for
longer, but viral culture was negative in all samples from patients
still RT-PCR positive after 5 days of treatment. We found the H274Y
mutation present in samples from 3 patients (around 50 patients,
RT-PCR positive after 5 days of treatment, [who] were screened from
over 600 patients).

We believe this to be the largest systematic assessment of viral
clearance dynamics and presence of the H274Y mutation in A(H1N1)v
infected patients.
