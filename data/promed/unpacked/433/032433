YELLOW FEVER IN ASIA (9):
========================
In regard to infection with dengue viruses and their ability to cross-protect
against yellow fever virus infection-- there are a mountain of data, from
experimental and natural studies.
Antibody to the dengue viruses does not prove solid protection against YF
virus infection. However, it might be possible to hasten the end of a dengue
outbreak by giving at-risk people YF vaccine. Those who then became infected
with one of the dengue viruses might well become ill but their viremia levels
might not be of sufficient titer to sustain the cycle (infected human-
mosquito-infected human). Just a thought.
YF and dengue viruses all are members of the same genus |Flavivirus| (family
|Flaviviridae|) and share common antigens. However, they are not at all
closely related and do not provide cross-protection. Then again, the dengue
viruses themselves are closely related and they do not provide cross-
protection one for another. Not likely that infection with one of these
little beasts would provide protective immunity against as distantly
related a virus as YF.
