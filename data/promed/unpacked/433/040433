Iraq: large numbers of rabies cases reported in several Governorates
-----------------------------------------------
A number of rabies (hydrophobia) cases [have been reported] in some Iraqi
Governorates, especially in Anbar, west of Baghdad, Al Sabah newspaper
stated on Wed 6 Oct 2004, quoting Iraqi medical sources. "There are a lot
of rabies infections in Iraqi cities, and more than 60 cases have been
recorded in the western Governorate of Anbar, especially among children,"
Dr. Imad Al Deen Al Naqash, Director of Health Monitoring in the Iraqi
Ministry of Health was quoted as saying. He said the spread of the disease
in these areas was due to the shortage of vaccine, the shortage of
necessary treatments [post-exposure immunoglobulin and vaccination] for
those who have been infected, the abundance of stray dogs, and a low level
of awareness among citizens.
Al Naqash stated that the Ministry has implemented a campaign of
vaccinating children in Fallujah, Ramadi, and in 2 districts of Anbar
Governorate. More than 145 000 children will be vaccinated despite the
on-going military operations in these areas.

[The severity of the situation is reflected in the decision to protect this
number of children through vaccination. Normally, this situation would have
been headed off by an active program of stray dog removal and domestic dog
annual vaccination. Clearly and unfortunately, the veterinary public health
service is effectively inoperative at this time. - Mod.MHJ]
