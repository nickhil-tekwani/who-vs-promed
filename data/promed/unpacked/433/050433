WHIRLING DISEASE, TROUT - USA (MONTANA)

State wildlife officials said the state's latest occurrence of whirling
disease was found in brook and rainbow trout in northwest Montana's
Whitepine Creek, the farthest down the Clark Fork drainage the disease has
been seen.
Wildlife officials said the parasite that causes the disease was found
during a survey in August 2002. They said the average angler would not have
known the fish were infected.
Whirling disease was first discovered in the state in 1994 in the Madison
River. Since then, the parasite causing the disease has spread to more than
100 bodies of water, the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said.

[The microscopic spore parasite _Myxobolus cerebralis_ poses no threat to
human health. It attacks the bone structure of fish fry. While it may not
kill the fish, the resulting whirling behavior makes the fish unable to feed
normally and more vulnerable to predators.
The parasite is almost indestructible. The microscopic spores, about the
size of a human red blood cell, can freeze and thaw with perfect impunity,
and are very difficult to kill. Once released from tubifex worms [the
intermediate host], the triactinomyxons (TAMs) float in the river, waiting
for vulnerable, newborn trout to appear. As the fry hatch from their eggs on
the bottom, the parasites shoot hooks, attached to coiled filaments, into
the trout and latch on, often around the fins and mouth. Up to 64 infective
cells from the TAMs burrow between the cells of the fish's skin. Within 2
hours, they have begun to multiply copiously. Then they burrow through the
skin and into nerve endings.
Day 4: The parasites have begun entering the central nervous system, which
they use to reach the fry's cartilage, especially the large deposits in the
spinal column and skull.
Day 20: By now, depending on water temperature, the parasites have reached
cartilage and have begun to devour it, destroying the fish's structural
framework. The eyes start to protrude. The skull becomes misshapen. The
spine looks like a roller coaster.
Day 45: As its brain stem and neural system collapse, the trout's tail turns
black and the fish begins to whirl.
Day 90: The hard-shelled spores have begun to form inside the trout's
cartilage, encased in bone.
Death: The trout are often tough enough to withstand the attack itself.
However, they eventually starve to death, or are eaten because they can't
swim well enough to escape.
Postmortem: A fish that lives for 5 months may carry as many as 2 million
spores. They are released after it dies and begins to decay. - Mod.TG]
