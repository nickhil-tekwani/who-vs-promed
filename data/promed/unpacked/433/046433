The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday [6 Jan 2015] announced that it has granted the 1st waiver to allow a nucleic acid-based test to be used in a broader selection of clinical settings. Before the FDA's waiver, the Alere i influenza A & B test was allowed only for use in certain laboratories.

FDA's waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) means the test can be used in, for example, physicians' offices, emergency departments, and health department clinics. It added that the waiver was granted after the company submitted data showing the test's ease of use and low risk of false results when used by untrained operators.

Alberto Gutierrrez, PhD, with the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in the statement that other simple and accurate diagnostics using nucleic acid-based tests are expected in the future, and the newer method allows healthcare workers to receive results more quickly to help guide diagnosis and treatment decisions. Alere's test uses a nasal swab sample and produces results in as little as 15 minutes, allowing the patient to remain present during testing.

In a statement today [7 Jan 2015], Alere's global president of infectious disease, Avi Pelossof, said the FDA's action is a milestone that expands molecular testing availability to a wide range of health settings during this flu season. "By making lab-accurate, actionable results available at the point of care, Alere i empowers healthcare providers to quickly identify and treat people with influenza, improving patients' clinical outcomes, protecting their communities, and reducing healthcare costs."

[The Alere i Influenza A & B test detects influenza A and B viral RNA in nasal swab samples in under 15 minutes. The FDA granted a waiver under CLIA for use of the Alere i Influenza A & B test in point-of-care settings after the manufacturer submitted data demonstrating the test's ease of use and low risk of false results when used by untrained operators. According to the FDA, "Compared to the FDA-cleared comparator method, the Alere i Influenza A & B test demonstrated high accuracy when identifying patients with or without influenza A and influenza B by users untrained in laboratory procedures" (http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm429127.htm). - Mod.ML]
