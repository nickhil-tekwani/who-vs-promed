A VARIANT STRAIN OF FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE VIRUS SEROTYPE A HAS SPREAD IN
ASIA AND IS A THREAT TO OTHER PARTS OF ASIA AND EUROPE
In the December 1997 issue of The EMPRES Bulletin the FAO/OIE World
Reference Laboratory (WRL) for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) reported that
isolates of FMD virus, serotype A, received from Iran during 1996-97, were
genetically and antigenically distinct from any other type A isolates in the
WRL database.
In March of this year the WRL identified a series of type A strains among
samples from suspected cases of FMD in Turkey during 1997 and 1998. When a
comparison was made between four Turkey A isolates from 1997-98 and four
isolates of the type A/Iran variant from 1996-98 both sets of viruses were
found to be almost identical in the 1D (VP1) gene coding region (nucleotides
475-639). Furthermore, the Turkey type A isolates, like the type A/Iran
variant, were found to be genetically different by almost 20% from any other
type A isolates in the WRL database.
The Turkey type A isolates were collected from the provinces of Malatya in
Eastern Anatolia and Kutayha in Western Anatolia indicating that the strain
is widely distributed in that country.
Antigenic analyses have shown that the type A isolates from Iran and Turkey
are distinct from all of the FMD virus strains which are commonly included
in FMD vaccines. This indicates that current vaccines are not likely to
protect against challenge by the variant.
This conclusion is supported by observations in Turkey where disease has
been seen in animals vaccinated with bivalent O/A vaccine in which the A
component was strain A22Mahmatli.
It can be concluded that the type A variant, first identified in Iran, has
extended its geographical distribution into Asiatic Turkey and is now a
threat to other countries in Asia and to Europe, especially those countries
which are linked to Iran and Turkey by trade in livestock. In this regard
small ruminants pose a particularly high risk since FMD in them is often
clinically mild or even inapparent.
There is an urgent need for the development of vaccines incorporating
antigenically suitable strains to control disease in countries where the
type A variant is present and to prevent further spread. In this context the
vaccine strains used in the FMD Buffer Zone in European Turkey should be
reassessed and the strains stored in vaccine banks should be reviewed in the
light of the emerging disease situation.
