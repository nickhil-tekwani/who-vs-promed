Livestock was repeatedly vaccinated against anthrax in the villages of Kara-Suu district where anthrax was registered earlier, the local veterinary inspectorate said.

Anthrax vaccination was carried out in 3 villages: 447 heads of cattle, 428 sheep and goats, 61 horses, and 14 donkeys were vaccinated in Toguz-Bulak, Kara-Sogot and Nariman villages.

Turmush reported earlier residents of Toguz-Bulak village, Kara-Suu district, were taken to hospital with suspected anthrax after they consumed the infected calf. Only one anthrax case was confirmed eventually; the rest of the villagers tested negative for anthrax.

[A wise thorough response by the local veterinary inspectorate for an area under constant risk of this disease. Let us hope and expect that they will repeat this for the next 3 years to guarantee livestock, and human, protection.

To use an Aussie phrase, it is beyond the black stump, which makes the local veterinary decision even more impressive. - Mod.MHJ
