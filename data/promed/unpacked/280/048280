ASF outbreak in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast [region]
---------------------------------------------------
A new outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) was reported out of the
permanently affected area (the Southern Federal District and the North
Caucasian Federal District) in the Nizhny Novgorod [Nizhegorod]
Oblast. The outbreak was reported at 7:45 on 18 Feb 2011 in [a
backyard in] the city of Dzershinsk.

Preliminary diagnosis was made in the regional veterinary laboratory
on the same day and some hours later it was confirmed by the National
Reference Laboratory for ASF -- All-Russia Research Institute of
Virology and Microbiology (Pokrov, Vladimir Oblast).

Commission attached to the governor of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast held
a meeting to determine urgent measures aimed at eradication of ASF in
accordance with the contingency plan approved by the regulation of the
local government.

It is assumed that the virus was introduced into the backyard with
catering wastes from a military unit located nearby. The outbreak in
the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and the recent outbreak in St. Petersburg
are like 2 peas in a pod.

Commission on emergency situations held a meeting in Dzershinsk where
an action plan was developed to eradicate the ASF outbreak.

Measures were taken to contain the outbreak in the affected area. The
pigs from the backyard were destroyed. Measures are being prepared to
destroy the dead animals and materials contaminated with the virus.

[The outbreak described above, in a region hitherto not found
ASF-infected which is situated in the centre of European Russia, has
been officially reported to the OIE on 22 Feb 2011 (follow-up report
no 51). The affected village is Chernoye, near Dzershinsk in the
Nizhegorod region, where 6 out of 20 susceptible pigs were found
infected. The report includes data on 5 additional outbreaks, all in
already infected southern Russian territories where the disease had
already been present, one in domestic pigs and 4 in wild boars; see,
with an interactive map, at
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10279>.

Since the start of the ASF epizootic in Russia, reportedly on 11 Sep
2009 when it spread from Georgia, 124 outbreaks have been reported; an
interactive map showing all accumulated outbreaks is available at
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8462>.

This seems the appropriate opportunity to congratulate the OIE for its
new web interface, from where the ASF reports and maps above have been
derived. Browsing is now more user-friendly. The website includes 9
main headings: Home, About us, Our scientific expertise, Support to
OIE members, Animal health in the world, International standard
Setting, Animal welfare, Food safety, publications and documentation.
The publications and documents database includes more than 5000
classified documents available in digital form, some of them dating
back to the 1st half of the 20th century. Media resources, latest
alerts, and additional information pertaining to the international
arena as well as to each of the 176 OIE member countries, are updated
and readily available. For the said and more, subscribers are
encouraged to take a look at <http://www.oie.int/>. - Mod.AS]
