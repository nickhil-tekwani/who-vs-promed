Mexican poultry farmers in the Lagunera region lost between 50 and 60
million pesos due to the outbreak of the Newcastle [disease last week.
Dealing with the outbreak required terminating of 6.5 million birds in the
states of Durango and Coahuila. Although the Newcastle [disease virus is
not transmissible to humans it causes high fatality in chickens. The virus,
as well as causing losses for farmers, created shortages in the northern
region of the country. It was believed to have been brought into the
country from the United States with contraband imports.

[Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an avian virus that is closely related to
human parainfluenza viruses, and NDV has been reported to cause occasional
human infections. A bit more information would be helpful in order to
evaluate the notion of importation from the USA to Mexico via contraband.
There are prior reports of contraband exotic birds moving from Mexico to
the USA (see references above). - Mod.ES
