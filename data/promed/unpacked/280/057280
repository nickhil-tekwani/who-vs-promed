CDC is collaborating with public health and agriculture officials in many states and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, National Poultry Improvement Plan, and Veterinary Services to investigate an outbreak of human _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Montevideo infections linked to chicks and ducklings from Estes Hatchery in Springfield, Missouri. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. In PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA "fingerprints" of _Salmonella_ bacteria are obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.

Contact with live poultry can be a source of human salmonellosis. You should always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching live poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam. Adults should supervise hand washing for young children. Additional recommendations are available.

Mail-order hatcheries, agricultural feed stores, and others who sell or display chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry should provide health-related information (http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/resources/salmonella-baby-poultry.pdf) to owners and potential purchasers of these birds prior to the point of purchase. This should include information about the risk of acquiring a salmonellosis from contact with live poultry.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
As of 21 Jun 2012, a total of 66 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Montevideo have been reported from 20 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alaska (1), California (2), Colorado (1), Georgia (1), Illinois (1), Indiana (8), Iowa (2), Kansas (10), Kentucky (1), Massachusetts (1), Missouri (22), Nebraska (5), Nevada (1), New York (1), North Carolina (1), Ohio (1), Oklahoma (4), South Dakota (1), Vermont (1), and Wyoming (1).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 28 Feb 2012 and 6 Jun 2012. Infected individuals range in age from less than 1 year old to 83 years old, and 35 percent of ill persons are 10 years of age or younger. 46 percent of ill persons are female. Among 43 ill persons with available information, 16 (37 percent) have been hospitalized. One death was reported in Missouri, but salmonellosis was not considered a contributing factor in this person's death.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 39 (85 percent) of 46 ill persons interviewed reported contact with live poultry (such as, chicks, chickens, ducks, ducklings, turkeys) before becoming ill. Of ill persons with live poultry contact, 38 (97 percent) reported contact with chicks or ducklings or both. 30 (83 percent) of 36 ill persons with available purchase information reported purchasing live baby poultry from various locations of 13 different agricultural feed store companies in multiple states. Additionally, 5 (14 percent) reported purchasing baby poultry directly from mail-order hatcheries. Because the potential for salmonellosis exists wherever these live baby poultry are sold, and not just at one feed store, CDC's recommendations apply wherever these poultry are sold. Ill persons reported purchasing live poultry for backyard flocks to produce eggs or meat, or to keep as pets.

State health departments have tested chick samples collected from ill persons' homes. 4 samples from different homes in California, Kentucky, Missouri, and Vermont yielded the outbreak strain of _S._ Montevideo.

Findings of multiple traceback investigations of live baby poultry from homes of ill persons have identified Estes Hatchery in Springfield, Missouri as the source of chicks and ducklings. The owners of the mail-order hatchery are cooperating with public health and agriculture officials.

[Small animals such as chicks, ducklings, mice, and baby turtles are not uncommon vehicles for salmonellosis for 2 reasons: they are small enough to handle and they carry salmonellae. Two ways to minimize the risk: aggressive hand washing after contact and choose other pets such as dogs or cats. - Mod.LL
