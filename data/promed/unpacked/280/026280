Showing early symptoms of hemorrhagic fever, the patient sits quietly on her bed, wrangling 2 toddlers desperate to flee the cell-like hospital room in Ingende, a remote town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). They are waiting for the results of a test for Ebola.

The patient can only communicate with her relatives through a clear plastic observation window. Her identity is secret, to protect her from being ostracized by locals fearful of Ebola infection. Her children have also been tested but, for now, show no symptoms.

There is a vaccine and a treatment for Ebola, which have brought down the rate at which it kills.

But the question at the back of everyone's mind is, What if this woman doesn't have Ebola? What if, instead, she is patient zero of "Disease X," the 1st known infection of a new pathogen that could sweep the world as fast as COVID-19, but one that has Ebola's 50%-90% fatality rate? "Disease X" is hypothetical for now, an outbreak that scientists and public health experts fear could lead to serious disease around the world if and when it occurs, according to WHO. "X" stands for unexpected. [The report continues on with an interesting extended general discussion of emerging but previously undescribed disease X that is not included here since it does not relate directly to this case. - Mod.TY]

This isn't the stuff of science fiction. It's a scientific fear, based on scientific facts. "We've all got to be frightened," the patient's physician, Dr. Dadin Bonkole, said. "Ebola was unknown. COVID was unknown. We have to be afraid of new diseases."

Back in Ingende Hospital, the doctors are wearing as much protective gear as can be found: goggles, yellow biohazard overalls, double gloves taped shut, hoods over their heads and shoulders, galoshes over their shoes, and complex face masks.

They are still worried that the female patient may be showing symptoms of an Ebola-like illness that is not, in fact, Ebola. It may be a new virus; it may also be one of the many diseases that afflict people here that are already known to science, but none of the tests done here have explained her high fever and diarrhea.

"We get cases which look very much like Ebola, but then when we do the tests, they are negative," said the head of medical services in Ingende, Dr. Christian Bompalanga. "We have to carry out additional examinations in order to see what is really going on . . . at the moment, there are a couple of suspected cases over there," he added, pointing to the isolation ward where the young woman and her kids are being treated. And weeks later, there remains no clear diagnosis for her illness.

Once a new virus begins circulating among humans, the consequences of a brief encounter at the edge of a forest or at a wet market could be devastating. COVID-19 has shown that. Ebola has proved it. And in most of the scientific publications, there is an assumption that there will be more contagions coming as humans continue to destroy wilderness habitats. It's not an "if"; it's a "when."

The solution is clear. Protect the forests to protect humanity, because Mother Nature has deadly weapons in her armory.

[The only information that we have about this patient is that she has symptoms of hemorrhagic fever but without specific details. She is being tested for Ebola virus infection, but the results are not yet available. There was a significant outbreak of Ebola virus infections in Equateur province that was declared ended in mid-November 2020. No mention is made of tests for other pathogens such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, or Lassa fever viruses, which, although not previously detected in Equateur province, might cause symptoms similar to those of the patient. Fortunately, personal protective equipment is in use in the hospital, which should prevent nosocomial transmission to patient care staff. Results of laboratory tests are awaited with interest. - Mod.TY
