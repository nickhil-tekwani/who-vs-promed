Banana disease in Oman
----------------------
A correspondent in Oman has written about a serious problem which has
developed this year [2010] in his banana plantation. He has been
cultivating banana in about 300 acres [121 ha] for the last 10 years
without pest or disease problems.

He then planted G9 TC [tissue cultured] bananas during December 2009 and
early growth was normal. After 3 months, new leaves started drying and
there was also tissue damage at the pseudo-stem in contact with the soil.
The plants started withering. He seeks advice about control and
preventative action in order to avoid future damage. 3 of the photographs
are shown [at the source URL above].

[G9 is a tissue culture line of the Cavendish type banana cultivar Grand
Naine ("giant dwarf", referring to relative plant height). Tissue culture
is used widely today to produce large numbers of plants for a number of
crops. However, freedom from intracellular pathogens (including viruses and
viroids) of plantlets needs to be verified by molecular diagnostic methods,
or possible latent pathogens may be spread with the plants (for example,
_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ in Russia). The status of certification of
the cultures is not mentioned above, and thus the presence of a pathogen in
the planting material cannot be excluded.

Tissue culture derived plantlets may also become infected during or after
transfer to the field. Since banana cultivars may vary in their sensitivity
to different pathogens, it is possible that the newly planted G9 cultivar
has been affected by an endemic pathogen to which the previously used,
presumably local Omani, varieties were resistant or tolerant. The damage at
soil level reported above may also support such a hypothesis.
