A mom used social media to warn parents about La Crosse encephalitis. "It's breaking all of our hearts to see the spunkiest one out of 5 brothers down," LAS said, reading the post no parent wants to write. The heartfelt words about her son have been shared more than 1400 times on Facebook.

Her 6 year old was hospitalized last weekend. Saturday [4 Aug 2018]; he complained of a headache and eventually had a seizure. "I've got 5 kids, and this is absolutely the scariest thing I've ever been through in my life," she said. "I literally thought my kid was gone when I saw him."

Before this past weekend, LAS said she'd never heard of the disease, which is transmitted by a bite from an infected mosquito. According to the CDC, there are about 63 cases each year.

La Crosse encephalitis often involves inflammation of the brain, and, along with seizures, it can cause coma and paralysis.

"This is something no parent should have to go through over a mosquito bite," LAS said. She said doctors are hopeful antibiotics and seizure medication will help. The boy is mostly asleep in his hospital room as he recovers. He will likely spend at least 5 more days in the hospital. He screams out in pain from the headaches, and he's really just like a zombie," LAS said. "It's scary; it's really scary. I don't want any parent to have to go through this."

LAS hopes her 768 heartbreaking words on Facebook encourage other parents to watch for symptoms, including fever, headache and nausea. "I've lived here my whole life. They say it's known and common, but I've never heard of it, and I want people to know that this can happen." LAS said she and her husband took every precaution they could to prevent mosquito bites. She's been encouraged by the outpouring of love on social media.

[Waynesville North Carolina is in a wooded, hilly area, no doubt one that supports breeding sites of the La Crosse virus mosquito vector, _Ochlerotatus [_Aedes_] triseriatus_.

LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas: (1) in the unglaciated areas of south eastern Minnesota/south western Wisconsin/north western Illinois, (2) Ohio, and (3) the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee (see the CDC map at http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html), where this case occurred. Severe neurological cases occur, mainly in pre-school age children. They are seldom fatal, but prolonged hospitalization and sequelae including personality changes, may occur.

Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal. Eliminating fresh water catchments that are breeding sites of _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, the La Crosse virus vector mosquito, is wise. The Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ can also transmit the virus.

The CDC has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution, and clinical characteristics at https://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html.
