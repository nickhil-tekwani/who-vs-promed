A two-and-a-half-year-old baby died in Avarli village in Joida taluk,
supposedly due to monkey fever [Kyasanur Forest disease. With this, the
total number of deaths due to the monkey fever has risen to four this year.
Party workers from cross spectrum of political parties had threatened going
on agitation earlier this month as [they claimed the authorities had
failed to provide proper medication [for the disease. But, they had
withdrawn the call after the District Health Officer Dr. V R Raikar had
assured of assistance. Meanwhile, leaders of various political parties have
said they will be launching hunger strike from next week in front of Joida
taluk tahsildar`s [? office.
[KFD often has biphasic course following a 2 - 7 day incubation period.
Initially there is fever, then a week or two later fever with headache and
encephalitic signs, sometimes with hemorrhagic manifestations. Death occurs
in roughly 8% of cases, usually due to pulmonary edema.

[KFD virus is a tick-borne (usually ticks of the genus _Haemaphysalis_,
most often of the species _spinigera_) flavivirus. The first isolate was
from a monkey, _Presbytis entellus_, in Mysore, India, 1957. The more
severe manifestations appearing in the second of the biphasic stages are
thought to be due to antigen-antibody complexing on neurons. There is no
specific treatment for the disease. - Mod. CHC
