Reports say an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis has occurred in
Harare, Zimbabwe, and that out of 14 cases, 2 have died.
As yet no details as regards serotyping available, as well as no
record of in what circumstances the cases have occurred.
A health correspondent has mentioned that "some cases" have
also been reported from the town of Mutare.
