Ningxia has destroyed 7000 grapevines after they were found to be infected with leafroll virus types 1 and 3. [Amongst] samples from 22 varieties and 612 rootstocks and nursery vines submitted by local companies, 2 batches of nursery vines were [found to be] infected.

This disease is more commonly associated with red wine varieties. According to Professor Gui Pei Wen from Ningxia University, [it was] identified as one of the main viruses affecting vines in Ningxia.

Based on figures released from the Ningxia Wine Industry Development bureau, in the past 4 years, it has destroyed 547 000 vines affected by various diseases.

[Grapevine leafroll is one of the most important viral diseases in grapevines and occurs wherever grapevines are grown. At least 9 different grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaVs) belonging to different genera within the family Closteroviridae have been reported. Typical leafroll symptoms include downward rolling and interveinal reddening or yellowing of leaves, as well as reduced fruit size, sugar content and yield. Several species of mealy bugs and soft scales (families Pseudococcidae and Coccidae, respectively) have been reported as vectors for GLRaV 3. Similar vectors are thought to be involved in the spread of some of the other GLRaVs. All of the GLRaVs are also spread by grafting and have been widely distributed and accumulated in their long-lived host over time by human activities.

Symptoms of viral leafroll disease vary on different grape varieties resulting in very serious disease in some varieties and no symptoms at all in others. These latter 'latent' infections are a particular threat as a source of diseased grafting material. Generic molecular diagnostic methods for Closteroviridae have been developed and can be used to ensure virus-free rootstocks and budwood.

Disease management of grapevine viruses may include vector control and phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified virus free planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks, and scions for grafting) is essential.

Ningxia is being established as a new wine growing region by China. Apparently, in the 1990's large numbers of vines were introduced without attention to their phytosanitary status (see link below). As a result, a high level of virus infection has been found in the newly set up vineyards. The region is now trying to remedy the situation by replacing infected planting stock with virus free material.
