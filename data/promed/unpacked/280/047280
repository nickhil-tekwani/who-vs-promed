4 new cases of suspected haemorrhagic fever were reported in the Prizren
region today [22 Jun 2004]. Officials of the Regional Institute of Public
Health said that the overall number of persons suspected of having
contracted this disease has reached 19 -- 3 of whom were confirmed
officially in Ljubljana. The coordinator of the Regional Institute of
Public Health in Prizren, Dr Nurishahe Hulaj, said that she had received a
report on 4 new cases of Crimean-Congo [haemorrhagic fever] in the
Malisheve [Malisevo] municipality . 2 of these cases occurred in the
village of Caralluke [Crna Luka], one in Lladrovc [Ladrovac] and one in
Gollubovc [Golubovac]. She said that those suspected of having contracted
this disease first went to the Family Medicine Centre in Malisheve, and
were then sent for medical treatment at the infectious disease clinic in
Prishtina [Pristina].
According to experts, the region of Prizren, particularly the
municipalities of Malisheve, Rahovec [Orahovac] and Suhareke [Suva Reka],
are considered endemic-epidemic zones.
Hulaj said that as of the end of April 2004, there was evidence of 19
suspicious cases in the region of Prizren. 3 of these have already been
confirmed through laboratory tests, at the corresponding institute in
Ljubljana, Slovenia. 2 of the confirmed cases, according to officials, are
infected with hemorrhagic fever [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever?], and
they are from the villages of Caralluke and Qifllak, while a person from
the village of Gajrak was infected with adrenal syndrome [hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome?].
The Institute of Ljubljana has also confirmed that a child from the village
of Caralluke, who died 2 weeks ago, was infected with Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus. According to Hulaj, an awareness campaign is being
conducted in the villages that are most exposed to this threat, by the
distribution of booklets and other materials. According to the Institute of
Public Health in Prizren, during 2003, 3 persons from this region died as a
result of this kind of infection, while others infected with the same
disease recovered.

[This report was titled, "4 new cases of Lyme disease (presumed to be a
mistranslation)," whereas the text concerns 4 cases of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever, a severe tick-borne acute hemorrhagic fever, with
mortality rates in the 15-30 percent range. The causative agent is a
bunyavirus belonging to the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family
_Bunyaviridae_. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the cause
of an important zoonotic disease affecting cattle, sheep and goats
throughout Central Asia, the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa.
Human disease is found mainly in people tending animals or working in rural
areas infested with CCHFV-infected ticks. However, the virus can also be
transmitted from person to person, and nosocomial infection can occur in
hospitals. No vaccine is available at present. - Mod.CP]
