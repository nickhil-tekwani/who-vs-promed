[1] Cholera - Ghana (Upper East Region)

The Bolgatanga [Upper East Region of north Ghana] Regional Hospital has recorded 35 cholera cases in less than 2 weeks. No deaths have been recorded so far, even though some of the patients went through critical stages of the disease. All the patients were brought into the regional hospital, which serves as a referral centre from health facilities in the Kassena-Nankana Municipal and Kassena-Nankana West District.

Dr Kojo Opare Larbi, Deputy Upper East Regional Director in charge of Public Health made this known in an interview with Ghana News Agency in Bolgatanga. He said open defecation, which is common in the region could be the cause of the epidemic.

Dr Larbi said the infection could also be transmitted through contaminated foods. He advised the public to drink clean water, avoid eating cold foods and wash their hands thoroughly before eating, and after visiting the toilet. He advocated the construction of public toilet facilities to discourage open defecation.

Dr Larbi said the Regional Health Directorate is collaborating with Regional Environmental Health Department to begin a chlorination exercise in the affected communities to clean drinking water sources, which are mostly wells.

[The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluids and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. .

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally than through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.
