Enterovirus 71 Identified in Samples from Deceased HFMD Patient
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, has identified
Enterovirus 71 (EV71), one of the several viruses associated with Hand,
Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD), in postmortem samples taken from the 4-year
old boy who died on Wed 3 Jan 2001. Full postmortem investigations are
underway.
The HFMD Taskforce's investigations revealed that 3 families had travelled
together to Pontian, Johor [Malaysia, to visit the deceased's grandmother,
between Sat 23 and Tue 26 Dec 2000. One of the children developed HFMD-like
illness on Tue 26 Dec upon return to Singapore. At the same time, a baby
who was in the care of the grandmother in Pontian also developed a viral
illness. The boy who would later die on 3 Jan 2001 developed symptoms on
Sun 31 Dec 2000. Subsequently, 4 other children, including one who is
resident in Pontian, also developed HFMD-like illness.
The HFMD Taskforce considered the following 2 scenarios in tracing the
source of possible infection: (a) The children went to Pontian in good
health and were exposed to the virus there; or (b) some of the children in
the Singapore group were already infected before they went to Pontian,
infected the children there, and came back and fell ill.
Based on the pattern of the incubation period of HFMD, the Taskforce is of
the opinion that either of these 2 scenarios is possible. As part of our
close cooperation with the regional health authorities, Singapore's public
health authorities have advised their counterparts in Johor Bahru of the
situation.
Update on the cases in hospital: Altogether, 8 children ranging from 3
months to 7 years old were admitted to the KK Women's and Children's
Hospital on Wed 3 Jan 2001. Of these, 2 were residents of Pontian who
sought medical treatment here after attending the funeral of the deceased
child. Including the 2 children from Pontian, 6 of the children have since
been discharged from hospital. The remaining 2 continue to be in stable
condition. As a precautionary measure, the children's parents have been
advised to keep them at home for another week.
HFMD Situation in Singapore: There has been no sudden increase in the
number of HFMD cases in Singapore. Over the last 8 weeks, there was an
average of 50 cases a week. In the last 2 weeks of Dec 2000, there were 45
and 29 cases respectively. In the first 3 days of this year, there was an
average of 10 cases a day. Officers from the Quarantine and Epidemiology
Department, Ministry of the Environment, have visited the pre-school
centers that the children attend. All observe good hygiene and no children
were found to show any signs of possible HFMD infection.
The Taskforce would like to remind all pre-school centers to observe proper
hygiene and sanitation in their premises and isolate any child who is
unwell. Parents are reminded not to send an unwell child to school, but to
seek medical attention and let the child rest at home.
