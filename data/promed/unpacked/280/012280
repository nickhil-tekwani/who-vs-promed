[This is an interesting report in that it claims that the outbreak is
resolved and there will be no more reports. This claim is based on
the fact that no new cases have been reported since the outbreaks at
the end of May 2009 which are referenced below as Avian influenza
(40): Mongolia, China, wild birds 20090529.1998. This report
indicates 121 wild birds died and more than 23 000 susceptible
domestic poultry which were destroyed as a precaution.

Obviously, the claim that the event is over is based on the lack of
new cases in Quinhai in either wild birds or domestic poultry over
the last 6 or 7 weeks. We have no indication there has been active
surveillance attempts to find cases. Active surveillance in this area
of China is particularly important because Quinhai has historically
been one of the stops along the route that H5N1 moved out of
Southeast China to Eurasia (see Avian influenza (40): Mongolia,
China, wild birds 20090529.1998 and 2005 references below). In fact,
Mongolia, which was another stop on the route to Eurasia, reported
the disease in May of this year [2009] and has not yet claimed that
the event has been resolved -- see Avian influenza (42): Mongolia
(AR) wild birds, OIE 20090603.2057. ProMED-mail will be interested
in details of any studies of the distribution of H5N1 this year as it
travels out of China into Eurasia and how this pattern compares to
the events of 2005.
