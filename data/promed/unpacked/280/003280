At least 29 cases of sleeping sickness were recorded over the last 20
days in the Northern Uige Province by health technicians, Angop has
learnt from the Institute for the Fight Against this disease.
According to the source, 15 patients were recorded at Uige District
and 14 at Songo, due to the stoppage of activities in 2 centres, as
well as the situation of Marburg haemorrhagic fever hitting the
region.

He added that out of the 15 individuals recorded at Uige, 11 others
are interned at the Institute. The Districts of Songo, Ambuila,
Bembe, Mucaba and Quitexe are hardest hit by the illness.
