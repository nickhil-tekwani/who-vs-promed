[An H5N1 outbreak in wild birds occurred initially in Mongolia in
August 2005. It was reported to the OIE as affecting "wild ducks,
geese and swans" in the lakes Erhel and Khunt. Whooper swans were one
of the main affected species. This migratory bird was later found
clinically infected by HPAI H5N1, with mortalities, in other parts of
the eastern hemisphere, such as Germany (Ruegen island, February
2006), Denmark (March-April 2006) and Japan (April-May 2006).
Mongolia reported again Whooper swan cases in May 2009, in the
Arkhangai region (see 20090811.2866). Similarly to 2005, this was an
area largely devoid of poultry.

The following abstract, derived from the paper "Whooper Swans and
Outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 Virus in Eastern
Asia" by Newman SH, Iverson SA, Takekawa JY, et al, published in PLoS
ONE 4(5): e5729 on 28 May 2009, may help in assessing the
significance of HPAI H5N1 in whooper swans.

Abstract:
Evaluating the potential involvement of wild avifauna in the
emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (hereafter H5N1)
requires detailed analyses of temporal and spatial relationships
between wild bird movements and disease emergence. The deaths of wild
swans (_Cygnus_ spp.) has been the 1st indicator of the presence of
H5N1 in various Asian and European countries; however their role in
the geographic spread of the disease remains poorly understood. We
marked 10 whooper swans (_Cygnus cygnus_) with GPS transmitters in
northeastern Mongolia during autumn 2006 and tracked their migratory
movements in relation to H5N1 outbreaks. The prevalence of H5N1
outbreaks among poultry in eastern Asia during 2003-2007 peaked
during winter, concurrent with whooper swan movements into regions of
high poultry density. However, outbreaks involving poultry were
detected year round, indicating disease perpetuation independent of
migratory water bird presence. In contrast, H5N1 outbreak!
s involving whooper swans, as well as other migratory water birds
that succumbed to the disease in eastern Asia, tended to occur during
seasons (late spring and summer) and in habitats (areas of natural
vegetation) where their potential for contact with poultry is very
low to nonexistent. Given what is known about the susceptibility of
swans to H5N1, and on the basis of the chronology and rates of
whooper swan migration movements, we conclude that although there is
broad spatial overlap between whooper swan distributions and H5N1
outbreak locations in eastern Asia, the likelihood of direct
transmission between these groups is extremely low. Thus, our data
support the hypothesis that swans are best viewed as sentinel
species, and moreover, that in eastern Asia, it is most likely that
their infections occurred through contact with asymptomatic migratory
hosts (e.g., wild ducks) at or near their breeding grounds.

A final definition of the H5 strain (N component) of the current
Mongolian isolate is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
