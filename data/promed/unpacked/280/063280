Incidents of rabies among people caused by animals' bites have been growing
in Russia. Currently, this year, the death toll caused by rabies is at 16.
Last year, 22 people died of rabies in Russia.
The highest number of rabies cases have been reported in the North
Caucasus, according to the Russian Sanitary-Surveillance Inspectorate. The
infection is mostly spread by abandoned dogs that grow wild, mix with
wolves, and get infected. [There are other sources of rabies in the wild
besides wolves. Raccoons, skunks, and bats can spread rabies as well. It is
inappropriate to make the assumption that the rabies comes from the wolves,
just because the dogs may mate with the wolves. - Mod.TG Subsequently,
wild dogs might bite people. Rabies is a fatal disease, and unless a victim
is quickly vaccinated he inevitably dies. [By "vaccinated," one believes
they mean post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). - Mod.TG
This year, 5 people died of rabies in North Ossetia. Lethal cases have been
registered in Ingushetia and Dagestan. Wild animals infected with rabies
can be found in Central Russia as well. Several deaths caused by rabies
have been registered this year in the Bryansk, Smolensk, and Moscow regions.
