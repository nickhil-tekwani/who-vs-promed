[Please note that publications presented in these updates that come from bioRxiv are pre-peer review manuscripts and final publications may be significantly different.

Also, it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins' website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]

Update on the epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia as of 24:00 on [12 Feb 2020]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
At 04:00 on [12 Feb 2020], 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 15 152 newly confirmed cases (including 13 332 clinical diagnosis cases in Hubei), 174 cases of severe cases were reduced, and 254 death cases were newly added. [Fatalities] (242 in Hubei, 2 in Henan, 1 each in Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps), and 2807 suspected cases were added.

1171 new cases were cured and discharged on the same day, and 29 429 close contacts were lifted from medical observation.

As of 24:00 on [12 Feb 2020], according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 52 526 confirmed cases (of which 8030 were severe cases), 5911 were cured and discharged, and 1367 [had died]. A total of 59 804 confirmed cases have been reported, with 13 435 suspected cases. A total of 471 531 close contacts were traced, and 181,386 close contacts were still in medical observation.

There were 14 840 newly confirmed cases in Hubei (13 436 in Wuhan), 802 cured cases (538 in Wuhan), 242 death cases (216 in Wuhan), and 43 455 confirmed cases (30 043 in Wuhan). Among them, 7084 cases were severe cases (5426 cases in Wuhan). A total of 3441 discharged patients (1915 in Wuhan) were cured, a total of 1310 deaths (1036 in Wuhan), and a total of 48 206 confirmed cases (32 994 in Wuhan). There were 1377 new suspected cases (620 in Wuhan) and 9028 suspected cases (4904 in Wuhan).

In order to do a good job of early diagnosis and early treatment of patients with new type of coronavirus pneumonia, and to implement the work of receivables and treatments of patients in Hubei, according to the "New Coronary Virus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program (Trial 5th Revised Edition)", the diagnostic criteria for cases in other provinces other than Hubei Province have been differentiated. Hubei Province has added a "clinical diagnosis case" classification to identify suspected cases with pneumonia imaging features as clinical diagnosis cases so that patients can be accepted as soon as possible, in accordance with the relevant requirements of confirmed cases, standardize treatment, and further improve the success rate of treatment. At present, 13 332 clinically diagnosed cases reported by Hubei Province are included in the statistics of confirmed cases, and case treatment is being strengthened to reduce severe illness and mortality.

A total of 78 confirmed cases were reported in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan: 50 cases in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (1 death and 1 discharge), 10 cases in the Macau Special Administrative Region (2 discharges), and 18 cases in Taiwan (1 discharge).

[Yesterday's report of approximately 16 000 newly confirmed cases was eye opening, to say the least, and strongly suggested a change in reporting criteria. Unfortunately, this report was not available at the time of preparation of the ProMED-mail update to clarify what was transpiring. It appears as though to fast track individuals with pneumonia into treatment protocols aimed at preventing more serious disease, Hubei has moved to a clinical definition of pneumonia and these cases are being reported as clinical cases of COVID-19 in lieu of waiting for positive laboratory tests. Recognizing this change may result in false positive reports. From a clinical management standpoint, it will hopefully impact on outcomes, especially for those with false negative tests early on in the course of their illnesses. Somewhat ironic that the day I chose to present the change in diagnostic criteria of the government not to report asymptomatic infections as cases of COVID-19, is the day there is a change in reporting criteria to use a clinical definition, resulting in a major increase in reported cases in Wuhan. - Mod.MPP]

Japan's health ministry has confirmed that a woman infected with the new coronavirus has died. She was in her 80s and lived in Kanagawa prefecture, located just outside Tokyo. Her death marks the 1st virus-related death in the country.

Health minister Katsunobu Kato said: "She exhibited symptoms on [22 Jan 2020] and was admitted to a hospital in Kanagawa on [1 Feb 2020]. She was declared dead today [13 Feb 2020]. After that, tests confirmed that she had contracted the new coronavirus."

The health ministry added that the woman reportedly never traveled abroad. Her son-in-law, who is a taxi driver, was also found to be infected with the virus. Health ministry officials say the man says he didn't visit the Chinese provinces of Hubei or Zhejiang during the 2 weeks before he began exhibiting symptoms. They also say he denies driving any foreign customers during this period. [Although another media report mentions he may have had passengers from China [https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20200213/k10012284011000.html; in Japanese]

Another new case in Japan is a doctor in his 50s. He works at a hospital in western Japan. [Information from another media report: The doctor was hospitalized on 10 Feb 2020 and tested positive on 13 Feb 2020 for symptoms of pneumonia following fever and general malaise beginning on 31 Jan 2020. He continued working at the hospital while symptomatic until 5 Feb 2020. The physician is currently hospitalized in another medical facility, but has not traveled to China in the 14 days prior to onset and did not have any apparent contact with people from China. https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20200213/k10012284301000.html; in Japanese.]

A man in his 20s, who lives just outside Tokyo has also been infected. Health ministry officials are still investigating how they contracted the virus.

[If these individuals did not have any known contact with high risk individuals (contact with individuals coming from areas with known local transmission such as China or Singapore), then this is most likely due to local transmission ongoing in Japan, quite possibly "under the radarscope" -- mild cases, many of whom are not seeking help from the formal health sector. In contrast, a case in a doctor is disconcerting as he may have had contact with a case during his practice, and may have in turn transmitted the virus to other patients and hospital staff. - Mod.MPP]

A man in his 70s has tested positive for the new coronavirus after contact with a doctor at a hospital in western Japan, a local government said [Fri 14 Feb 2020].

The surgeon in his 50s was confirmed [Thu 13 Feb 2020] to have become the 1st doctor in Japan to be infected with the new virus, which originated in China.

The man in his 70s has developed severe pneumonia, the Wakayama prefectural government said.

Texas' 1st case of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed [Thu 13 Feb 2020] at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio [Texas]. The infection was confirmed by laboratory testing Wednesday [12 Feb 2020] night. The individual was a United States evacuee that had come from China. The patient is said to be in stable condition and is being quarantined in isolation at a nearby hospital.
The case marked the 15th known case in the United States. 2 other cases found in evacuees from Wuhan, China, tested positive last week at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California.

In a statement released Thursday [13 Feb 2020] morning, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said:
"CDC today confirmed another infection with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the United States. The patient is among a group of people under a federal quarantine order at JBSA-Lackland in Texas because of their recent return to the U.S. on a State Department-chartered flight that arrived on [7 Feb 2020].

All people who lived or traveled in Hubei Province, China, are considered at high risk of having been exposed to this virus and are subject to a temporary 14-day quarantine upon entry into the United States. This is the 1st person under quarantine at JBSA-Lackland who had symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19. The individual is currently isolated and receiving medical care at a designated hospital nearby.

This brings the total number of COVID-19 cases in the United States to 15. There will likely be additional cases in the coming days and weeks, including among other people recently returned from Wuhan. While 195 people were discharged from quarantine on Tuesday [11 Feb 2020], more than 600 people who returned on chartered flights from Wuhan remain under federal quarantine and are being closely monitored to contain the spread of the virus."

- No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- WHO has developed a database to collect the latest scientific findings and knowledge on Coronavirus disease. For more information, please see here.

- The 2-day global research and innovation forum regarding COVID-19 was convened in line with the WHO R&D Blueprint this week. Leading health experts from around the world met at WHO to assess the current level of knowledge about the new COVID-19 disease, identify gaps and work together to accelerate and fund priority research needed to help stop this outbreak and prepare for any future outbreaks. For more details, please see https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/12-02-2020-world-experts-and-funders-set-priorities-for-covid-19-research.

- Overnight 14 840 cases, including 13 332 clinically diagnosed cases were reported from Hubei. This is the 1st time China has reported clinically diagnosed cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases. For consistency, we report here only the number of laboratory-confirmed cases. WHO has formally requested additional information on the clinically diagnosed cases, in particular when these have occurred in the course of the outbreak and whether suspect cases were reclassified as clinically diagnosed cases.

Technical focus: investigation of COVID-19 cases outside of China
-----------------------------------------------------------------
As of 10am CET 13 Feb 2020, a total of 170 cases of COVID-19 who had a travel history to China have been reported outside of China. The vast majority of these (151, 89%) do not appear to lead to further transmission of the virus, while the remaining 19 have been associated with onward transmission within 12 distinct groups of epidemiologically linked cases (Fig 2 [at source URL]).

Among these, 4 groups have involved at least 9 individuals. The largest involves 20 individuals in 6 countries thus far -- United Kingdom (6), France (5), Malaysia (3), Singapore (3), Republic of Korea (2), Spain (1) -- and has been linked to a conference held in Singapore between [20 and 22 Jan 2020] and a subsequent ski trip to the French Alps (Table 1, Figure 2 [at source URL).

The next largest involves 15 cases and was linked to a conference in Bavaria, Germany. Among the attendees was an individual with an epidemiological link to confirmed cases in Wuhan, China. Additionally, one of the 15 cases was detected in, but did not involve transmission within, Spain.

16 cases have been reported in 4 countries for which there are no clearly established epidemiological links. For all these individuals, investigations are ongoing to establish the mechanism by which they were infected.
