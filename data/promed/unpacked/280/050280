[1] Resumption of COVID-19 Vaccine Trials
Date: 23 Oct 2020

AstraZeneca Plc, the U.K. drug maker developing a coronavirus vaccine with the University of Oxford, has been cleared by U.S. regulators to restart a trial halted in the country for more than a month on concerns about a volunteer who became ill, according to a person familiar with the decision.

The person asked not to be identified because the information isn't public. A decision to allow the study to resume would remove a significant impediment for AstraZeneca and Oxford as they try to get their coronavirus shot across the line. They are among the front-runners in the global quest for a vaccine, along with developers such as Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc.

AstraZeneca declined to comment. A representative for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Operation Warp Speed head Moncef Slaoui said in an interview earlier this week that the AstraZeneca trial and another study of a Johnson & Johnson vaccine candidate that had also been paused could resume in the coming days.

Questions have swirled around the AstraZeneca trials since an announcement in September 2020 that a participant in a U.K. study had developed an unexplained illness, and the partners have faced pressure to disclose more information about the episode. Although temporary halts are common, the interruption raised concerns about the prospects of one of the fastest-moving shots and highlighted the hurdles researchers face when developing a vaccine.

[When a potential adverse event occurs during a clinical trial, the testing is typically stopped so that an independent data and safety monitoring board can thoroughly investigate and determine whether the problem was likely related to the vaccine. Rules around clinical trials and patient privacy usually restrict details from being released, but the tremendous scrutiny of the coronavirus vaccine trials has led many experts to call for greater transparency in disclosing and explaining the reasons for such halts.

Some additional information in the Washington Post was reported: In the Johnson & Johnson trial, which was paused on 12 Oct 2020, a man who received a vaccination suffered a stroke that may have been triggered by an infection. To conclude that it was not likely to be related to the shot, investigators probed not only the medical details of the event but also examined a safety database of 100 000 people who have received vaccines that use the same underlying technology.

The vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford was halted on 6 Sep 2020 after a British participant developed a neurological problem. While the AstraZeneca study had resumed in the rest of the world, its clearance to restart in the U.S. came Friday [23 Oct 2020] and was 1st reported by the Wall Street Journal.

AstraZeneca spokeswoman Michele Meixell did not provide further information on the illness, but said the FDA reviewed data from the trials running around the world before concluding it was safe to restart. She said the company was adding a new expert panel "to provide advice on diagnosis and causality assessment of neurological events," in addition to continuing standard company oversight and the independent data and safety committee [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/10/23/jj-vaccine-trial-to-resume/], and, more importantly, this is not new for vaccine trails studies. "Pausing and unpausing clinical trials happens routinely, and experts have said that the public should be confident the process worked as intended to protect the health and safety of participants."

The important consideration is that the participants and the public do not lose confidence in the process and transparency with appropriate/relevant data sharing. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Herd Immunity and Implications for SARS-CoV-2 Control
Date: 19 Oct 2020

Herd immunity, also known as indirect protection, community immunity, or community protection, refers to the protection of susceptible individuals against an infection when a sufficiently large proportion of immune individuals exist in a population. In other words, herd immunity is the inability of infected individuals to propagate an epidemic outbreak due to lack of contact with sufficient numbers of susceptible individuals. It stems from the individual immunity that may be gained through natural infection or through vaccination. The term herd immunity was initially introduced more than a century ago. In the latter half of the 20th century, the use of the term became more prevalent with the expansion of immunization programs and the need for describing targets for immunization coverage, discussions on disease eradication, and cost-effectiveness analyses of vaccination programs.

Eradication of smallpox and sustained reductions in disease incidence in adults and those who are not vaccinated following routine childhood immunization with conjugated Haemophilus influenzae type B and pneumococcal vaccines are successful examples of the effects of vaccine-induced herd immunity.

The herd immunity threshold is defined as the proportion of individuals in a population who, having acquired immunity, can no longer participate in the chain of transmission. If the proportion of immune individuals in a population is above this threshold, current outbreaks will be extinguished, and endemic transmission of the pathogen will be interrupted. In the simplest model, the herd immunity threshold depends on the basic reproduction number (R0; the average number of persons infected by an infected person in a fully susceptible population) and is calculated as 1/R0 (Figure). The effective reproduction number incorporates partially immune populations and accounts for dynamic changes in the proportion of susceptible individuals in a population, such as seen during an outbreak or following mass immunizations. A highly communicable pathogen, such as measles, will have a high R0 (12-18) and a high proportion of the population must be immune to decrease sustained transmission. Since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, most of the studies estimated the SARS-CoV-2 R0 to be in the range of 2 to 3.2 Assuming no population immunity and that all individuals are equally susceptible and equally infectious, the herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 would be expected to range between 50% and 67% in the absence of any interventions.

The locations included are the locations in which the threshold was measured.

For both naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity, the durability of immune memory is a critical factor in determining population-level protection and sustaining herd immunity. In the case of measles, varicella, and rubella, long-term immunity has been achieved both with infection as well as vaccination. With seasonal coronaviruses, durable immunity has not been observed or has been short lived. For infections that produce transient immunity, the pool of susceptible individuals soon increases in the absence of a vaccine and outbreaks reappear. With an effective vaccine and vaccine program, herd immunity can be sustained (even if periodic vaccination is required to do so) and outbreaks can be curtailed as long as the community maintains the necessary levels.

Nominal herd immunity thresholds assume random mixing between individuals in a population. However, daily life is more complicated; individuals mix nonrandomly and some individuals have higher numbers of interactions than others. Empirically validated network models have shown that individuals who have higher numbers of interactions get infected earlier in outbreaks. This may contribute to slowing of community spread of an infection before reaching the nominal herd immunity threshold. However, there is uncertainty regarding the precise effect of heterogeneity in social mixing on herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

T-cells are important mediators of immunity. Recent reports have suggested that cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses may confer relative protection of the population from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is less clear that T-cell cross-reactivity could provide sterilizing immunity (ie, that the host could not carry nor transmit infection) as opposed to reducing the severity of illness.

An infection-based herd immunity approach (i.e. letting the low-risk groups become infected while "sequestering" the susceptible groups) has been proposed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, such a strategy is fraught with risks. For example, even with modest infection fatality ratios, a new pathogen will result in substantial mortality because most, if not all, of the population would not have immunity to the pathogen. Sequestering the high-risk populations is impractical because infections that initially transmit in low-mortality populations can spread to high-mortality populations. Moreover, so far, there is no example of a large-scale successful intentional infection-based herd immunity strategy.

There are only rare instances of seemingly sustained herd immunity being achieved through infection. The most recent and well-documented example relates to Zika in Salvador, Brazil. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, as other countries in Europe were locking down in late February and early March of 2020, Sweden made a decision against lockdown. Initially, some local authorities and journalists described this as the herd immunity strategy: Sweden would do its best to protect the most vulnerable, but otherwise aim to see sufficient numbers of citizens become infected with the goal of achieving true infection-based herd immunity. By late March 2020, Sweden abandoned this strategy in favor of active interventions; most universities and high schools were closed to students, travel restrictions were put in place, work from home was encouraged, and bans on groups of more than 50 individuals were enacted. Far from achieving herd immunity, the seroprevalence in Stockholm, Sweden, was reported to be less than 8% in April 2020, which is comparable to several other cities (i.e. Geneva, Switzerland, and Barcelona, Spain).

The population of the United States is about 330 million. Based on World Health Organization estimates of an infection fatality rate of 0.5%, about 198 million individuals in the United States are needed to be immune to reach a herd immunity threshold of approximately 60%, which would lead to several hundred thousand additional deaths. Assuming that less than 10% of the population has been infected so far, with an infection-induced immunity lasting 2 to 3 years (duration unknown), infection-induced herd immunity is not realistic at this point to control the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will help to reach the herd immunity threshold, but the effectiveness of the vaccine(s) and the vaccine coverage are to be seen.

Herd immunity is an important defense against outbreaks and has shown success in regions with satisfactory vaccination rates. Importantly, even small deviations from protective levels can allow for significant outbreaks due to local clusters of susceptible individuals, as has been seen with measles over the past few years. Therefore, vaccines must not only be effective, but vaccination programs must be efficient and broadly adopted to ensure that those who cannot be directly protected will nonetheless derive relative protections.

[3] Brazil: Investigating Reinfections
Date: 19 Oct 2020
Source: CNN [edited]
https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/saude/2020/10/19/brasil-investiga-pelo-menos-247-casos-de-possiveis-reinfeccoes-por-covid-19


Brazil is investigating at least 247 cases of possible Covid-19 reinfections. The information is from a survey carried out by CNN's production with state governments and city halls.

Sao Paulo and Ceara are the states with the most suspicions of reinfection. In the Hospital das Clanicas, in Sao Paulo alone, 28 possible cases are being investigated. In Ceara, at least 160 are under analysis.

The survey considered people who had a positive diagnosis for the new coronavirus, had a negative result after recovering, and tested positive sometime later via PCR examination.

The investigation takes into account whether it is a contamination by the same virus or whether a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 is already circulating in the country.

So far, the Ministry of Health has not confirmed any cases of reinfection in Brazil.

According to the folder, being infected again by the new coronavirus is considered very rare and needs to be investigated with utmost caution.

[Initially, the information on random cases of SARS-CoV2 reinfections were considered to be incidental, prolonged shedding events or "continuation of the 1st infection." However, with more recent reports from Hong Kong and Nevada, as mentioned above, reinfections with the virus are likely an actual phenomenon, with the added twist that the severity of COVID-19 varies enormously from person to person, and might vary from infection to infection in the same person. Variables such as the initial dose of virus, possible differences between variants of SARS-CoV-2, and changes in a person's overall health could all affect the severity of a reinfection [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02506-y].

In view of the multiple vaccine candidates ready to be rolled out as soon as they are deemed safe via phase 3 trials, it is crucial to sort out whether "immunological memory" affects symptoms during a 2nd infection. If symptoms are generally reduced the 2nd time, as in the Hong Kong case reported in late August 2020, this suggests the immune system is responding to a re-exposure with the virus as expected. But if the symptoms are consistently worse during a 2nd bout of COVID-19, as they were seen in a 2nd case from Nevada, USA, the immune responses may in fact be enhancing the virus impact, resulting in tissue damage.

The number of possible reinfections mentioned in the above report is possibly the largest cohort to date, and a systematic review could provide important insights into the reinfection phenomenon. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 217.

Data by country, area, or territory for 24 Oct 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesOct24_1603633884.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 30.7% of daily case numbers and 43.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 19.3 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Costa Rica, Puerto Rico and Chile.

- The European region reported 47.6% of daily case numbers and 31.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 9.0 million. Countries not reporting cases today (24 Oct 2020) include Israel, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kazakhstan and Sweden. France is dominant (41 825), followed by the UK, Spain, Russia, Italy, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Ukraine, Switzerland, Romania, Portugal, Austria, Armenia, Turkey, and Hungary. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Georgia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Ireland.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.2% of daily case numbers and 9.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.8 million cases. Iran is dominant, followed by Iraq, Morocco, Jordan, UAE, and Lebanon. Libya, Kuwait, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Oman, Sudan, and Somalia did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.28 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Algeria, Angola, Mozambique, Botswana, Nigeria, Reunion, Mayotte and Uganda.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.98% of daily case numbers and 1.38% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.70 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 14.2% of the daily newly reported cases and 12.6% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.8 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: There are now 25 countries in the European reporting more than 1000 new cases in 24 hours and 8 countries reporting more than 10 000 cases. The Americas region combined with the European region account for more than 75% of daily reported cases and 75% of the global reported deaths in the past 24 hours.

[The USA and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, the USA (79 449) and India (50 224) have maintained their dominance. A global total of 5599 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (23-24 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (19 countries) include the USA, India, France (45 422), Brazil (25 574), UK (23 012), Spain (not reported in last 24 hours), Italy (19 644), Russia (16 521), Belgium (17 568), Poland (13 628), Czech Republic (12 424), Argentina (11 968),Germany (10 458), Netherlands (8651), Colombia (8769), Ukraine (7014), Switzerland (not reported in last 24 hours), Mexico (6604), and Iran (5814). A total of 12 countries reported more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours, 8 of which were in the European region. A total of 49 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 23 of the 46 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 were from the Americas region, 7 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region, and 5 were from the South East Asia region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 19.9%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 8.5%.

Impression: Global 7-day averages continue to increase with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. Note that the daily case count for today [24 Oct 2020] was close to half a million cases, and the cumulative total will surpass 43 million in the next 24 hours. - Mod.UBA]
