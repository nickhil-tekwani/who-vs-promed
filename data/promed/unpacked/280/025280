World Health Organization (WHO) reports one new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus in China during the 1st week of 2021.

The case was a 1-year-and 4-month-old male from Yunfu, Guangdong Province, China, who had exposure to domestic poultry prior to the onset of illness. He developed mild symptoms on [28 Dec 2020] and was admitted to a hospital on [29 Dec 2020]. As of [4 Jan 2021], no family cluster was reported. This is the 1st case to be reported from China in 2021.

In addition, 6 new cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus were reported on [9 Dec 2020].

The cases were retrospectively detected through influenza-like illness surveillance (ILI) between July 2019 and December 2020. No deaths were reported among the reported cases and all 6 reported mild symptoms. 5 of the cases had exposure to poultry and one case had no clear poultry exposure. No family clusters were reported from any of the 6 cases.

In 2020, there were 13 cases reported from China. A total of 42 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015.

[The WHO weekly avian influenza update no 774 further notes:
"Additionally, on [9 Dec 2020], 6 new cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus were reported in the Western Pacific Region. The cases were retrospectively detected through influenza-like illness surveillance (ILI) between July 2019 and December 2020. No deaths were reported among the reported cases and all 6 reported mild symptoms. 5 of the cases had exposure to poultry and one case had no clear poultry exposure. No family clusters were reported from any of the 6 cases. In 2020, there were 13 cases reported from China. A total of 42 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015." (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20210108.pdf).

"H9N2 avian influenza viruses have become globally widespread in poultry over the last 2 decades and represent a genuine threat both to the global poultry industry but also humans through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. H9N2 viruses are generally hyperendemic in affected countries and have been found in poultry in many new regions in recent years."

Studies have reported how "reassortants between H9N2 viruses and human seasonal influenza viruses are able to efficiently transmit between ferrets and there is, therefore, a real danger eventually such a reassortant could emerge in the field."

"Several H9N2 viruses have human receptor binding, pH stable HA proteins that could potentially allow efficient transmission between humans whilst other H9N2 viruses contain internal gene cassettes that allow extremely efficient replication in humans (i.e., genotype 57). Overall there is a clear risk of both intersubtypic H9N2/human influenza virus reassortant emergence as well as an intrasubtyptic human binding HA/efficient mammalian polymerase reassortant emergence, either of which could potentially pose a high zoonotic and pandemic threat."
