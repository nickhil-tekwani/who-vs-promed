Hezhou City [Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region] reported its 1st human case of severe acute respiratory infection on 28 Jan 2014. On 29 Jan 2014 at 21:30, the Guangxi Autonomous Regional Center for Disease Control (CDC), and the Chinese CDC [in Beijing], reviewed the test results and confirmed they were positive for H7N9 nucleic acid. The regional health department expert group, based on patient's epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results declared the case to be the result of H7N9 avian influenza human infection, which is the 1st confirmed case of human infection with the H7N9 avian influenza in Guangxi province.

The patient is a 56-year-old farmer, living in Lingfengzhen, Babu District, Hezhou City. The patient had fever [and] cough for 6 days, followed by increasing shortness of breath for a day. The patient then attended 2 private clinics for treatment without improvement. On 27 Jan 2014 the patient was admitted to Lin Feng hospital for treatment. The doctor at the hospital considered that the patient's condition was serious and immediately transferred her to the People's Hospital in Hezhou City. Currently, the patient is in the ICU in Hezhou People's Hospital, in a critical condition.

The Autonomous region's expert medical expert group is trying their best to restore the patient to health. An epidemiological investigation revealed that the patient [had been exposed to live poultry] before the onset of illness. A total of 19 close contacts are under medical observation and so far have shown no symptoms of illness, no abnormalities.

This case is the 1st human case of avian H7N9 influenza virus infection confirmed so far in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region which borders Viet Nam. The virus has been demonstrated recently in a live poultry market in Guangxi. - Mod.CP

Viet Nam's sharing a border with Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was mentioned to draw the Vietnamese attention to the fact that H7N9, spreading in China, has entered a province neighbouring them. Hezhou City, the location of the outbreak, is in the north east of Guangxi (see map at http://www.thechinaperspective.com/images/provinces/guangxi.jpg). - Mod.AS]
