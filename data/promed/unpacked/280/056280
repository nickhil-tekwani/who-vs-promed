In Uruguay, anthrax outbreaks occur in the summer months, with a peak in February. Anthrax spores are very resistant, being able to survive for years or decades in the soil, which is why the disease tends to be localized in certain high-risk areas called "cursed fields." To date, official services have detected confirmed outbreaks of anthrax in cattle, horses, and possibly humans, in the department of Rocha. The historical records in our country, from the DILAVE laboratory of MGAP, which is the most complete and longest existing casuistry, show that the high-risk areas are located in the low floodplains, along the large rivers (mainly Arapey, Río Negro, Tacuarembó and Cebollatí), in the wetlands and along the water channels (see map [at source URL above]).

In situations of drought and food crisis such as this year, increased contact with the soil can cause contamination and spore intake of this telluric disease to occur to a greater degree and cause epizootics. In some properties of Rocha, the presence of deaths due to _Clostridium haemolyticum_ has also been confirmed, which is the cause of bacillary hemoglobinuria, an endemic disease that occurs annually in the Rocha wetlands and that causes an indistinguishable clinical picture of anthrax. Bacillary hemoglobinuria is not a zoonosis and can also be prevented with vaccines.

The veterinarian should be consulted, and suspected anthrax cases should be reported to the MGAP regional services to confirm or rule out cases at the Dilave Laboratory. To prevent sporulation, dead animals should not be opened. It is important not to burn the corpses (due to the risk of fire), not to hide or move the dead animals, and to prevent dogs and scavengers from having access to the carcasses. Nor should carcasses be thrown into rivers or canals. Measures must also be taken to avoid the presence of scavengers and ensure proper disposal of dead animals. Remember to take extreme personal protection measures and wear gloves.

As part of these measures, it is recommended to incorporate adequate annual vaccination plans to prevent the most common infectious diseases. The main recommendation is to vaccinate animals against anthrax. After vaccinating the cattle, remember that deaths can continue to occur for a few more days until it begins to take effect, so it is recommended not to change paddocks or move the animals until the outbreak stops. It is essential that young animals that are vaccinated for the 1st time are revaccinated after 15 to 20 days to achieve correct immunity.

Anthrax is a disease of livestock caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. The disease is hyperacute and lethal and affects mainly cattle, swine and horses, but it can also occur in sheep, goats and wild species. Cattle are generally found dead (sudden death), with bloody runs from the mouth, nose and anus. In pigs and horses, and occasionally also in cattle, swelling of the throat and neck can be observed prior to death. It should be remembered that this disease is a zoonosis, that is, a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Anthrax is an occupational disease that humans spread by contact with dead animals, causing the skin form known as "bad grain", which has a good prognosis if it is treated in time.

The map shows areas with their corresponding risk of anthrax for the entire country and for Rocha, according to historical data from the MGAP/Dilave Diagnostic Unit [see source URL for map].

Livestock anthrax is sporadic in Uruguay and thus under-reported. Anthrax has been reported in the departments of Artigas, Cerro Largo, Durazno, Florida, Lavalleja, Paysandu, Rio Negro, Rivera, Rocha, Salto, Soriano, Tacuarembo, and Treinta y Tres. It is essentially a bovine problem, with 7 to 17 outbreaks each year and with occasional outbreaks in horses and swine. Human cases are not infrequent: The frequency of human cases suggests that the disease is significantly under-diagnosed -- why else would a gaucho skin the animal? -- and that vaccination is erratic. The true incidence could well be twice the reported frequency because of being unsuspected and thus under-diagnosed.

While the authorities discourage burning the carcasses, which is the optimum procedure, burial is effective, though subsequent outbreaks can be associated with contaminated gravesites.

Carcass burning can be done safely. For advice and guidance, contact the "Hot Shot" fire control folk in Yellowknife, in Canada's Northwest Territory. They are expert in burning wood bison. For a more effective control and surveillance program, contact the veterinary service staff in either or both North and South Dakota. They will soon have eradicated anthrax in those states.

The persistence of this disease can probably be blamed on its sporadic incidence, poor recognition and reporting, inadequate site disinfection, and ineffective vaccination. When there is good surveillance paired with area annual herd vaccination, the disease disappears. It is eradicable. - Mod.MHJ
