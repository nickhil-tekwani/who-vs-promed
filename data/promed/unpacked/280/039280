Cuban agricultural specialists warn about the presence of anthracnose disease in beans in the western province of Pinar del Rio. The regional Department of Plant Health reports that, so far, minor foci of the disease have been detected in some locations. For these, together with the alert, recommendations were issued to producers and agricultural managers on how to reduce the further spread of the disease. They were reminded that the disease is favoured by a poor health status of bean plantings and that untested seeds may be infected.

[Anthracnose of common (_Phaseolus vulgaris_), mung (_Vigna radiata_), and broad (_Vicia faba_) beans is caused by the fungus _Colletotrichum lindemuthianum_. The pathogen has a wide host range including a range of other leguminous crops, as well as weeds. The disease has been reported to cause serious crop losses in temperate and subtropical areas. Symptoms may include irregular dark spots on leaves and stems, as well as sunken necrotic lesions with fungal growth on seed pods and seeds; they may continue to develop in postharvest storage. Disease development is favoured by cool, moist conditions.

There are several races of the fungus. Fungal spores are mainly spread with seeds and other plant material (crop debris) and by mechanical means. Infected leguminous weeds and volunteer crops can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management usually includes fungicide sprays, use of certified disease-free seeds, cultural (2-3 years crop rotation, weed control), and phytosanitary measures. Some commercial bean varieties are available with resistance to the main pathogen strain but can still be affected by other fungal races.

Some other _Colletotrichum_ species can cause similar but less severe symptoms in beans. Fungi in the genus _Colletotrichum_ have been reported to cause anthracnose-like diseases in many crops.
