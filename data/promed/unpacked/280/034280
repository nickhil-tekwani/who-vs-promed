AVIAN INFLUENZA (90) - UK (WALES): LPAI H7N2, EPIDEMIC CONTROL ISSUES
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the

Date: Sun 27 May 2007
From: John Morgan <davidjohnmorgan@gmail.com>

The latest BBC bulletin (Sun 27 May 2007) reports that 11 people out
of 26 possible contacts with H7N2 infected chickens have shown
flu-like symptoms, but none has become seriously ill.
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6696035.stm>.
There have been no official updates to the Welsh Assembly Government,
DEFRA or Health Protection Agency Websites in the last 24 hours.
Meanwhile, the restrictions at the 1st site are still in place, and a
map of the restriction zone and the regulations are available at
<http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/ahw/disease_surveillance_control/avianflu/avianfludeclaration/?lang=en>.
ProMED-mail's archived posting 20070526.1692 states: "From a
subscriber in the UK, we have received the following comment: 'The
infected birds which died were bought at Chelford Market from a
private dealer, and there is no traceable paperwork. I find it quite
incredible that after everything that has happened with regard to
avian notifiable diseases in the past few years, auctioneers allow
private sales out of the back of a van to go on at their premises on
a sale day without any formal identification or inspection.'"
My comment:
At this point, there has been no official statement as to whether the
sale was out of the back of a van or through the official livestock
auctions that occurred at Chelford Market on that day. A sobering
report from the Farmers Guardian of 9 Jun 2006 starts with the line:
"There is seemingly little in the world of agriculture that can't be
bought or sold at Chelford Market in Cheshire." [See "Chelford market
profile" by Nick Yates at
<http://www.farmersguardian.com/story.asp?sectioncode=49&storycode=2360>.].
As this article goes on to say: "It has made a success of diversity,"
no doubt this statement was in praise of the entrepreneurial spirit
of the operation but seems to have acquired a quite different meaning
in the light of recent events.
It is worth stating that it would not be in the interest of
auctioneers to "allow private sales out the back of a van," as they
would not be in receipt of any buyer or seller commission, and this
would be anti-entrepreneurial.
I suspect that it is impossible for them to police all areas, parking
areas and attendees and to prevent private deals being struck.
Chelford market is under the jurisdiction of Macclesfield Borough
Council, which has released the following statement:
<http://www.macclesfield.gov.uk/news_item.asp?id=1529>.
The auctioneers that run the market have not placed any notice on
their website [<http://www.frmauctions.co.uk/index.html>] which might
encourage anyone attending the market either as a seller or purchaser
to contact the authorities. There are 2 links under the poultry
section. One link leads to a report of the total livestock sales for
Mon 7 May 2007, which included 1400 head of poultry. The other is a
notice that poultry sales will be reconvened after a suspension of
sales following the Bernard Mathewes - Hungarian H5N1 outbreak, dated
16 Feb 2007. [It says: "We have been informed by DEFRA that sales can
recommence with immediate effect. We will therefore be open on Mon 19
Feb 2007, although numbers forward are likely to be minimal due to
lack of time to advertise re-opening. Full poultry sales service will
recommence on Mon 26 Feb 2007." - Mod.AS]
There is no statutory regulation for small keepers or breeders of
poultry to be registered with DEFRA; there is a voluntary
registration scheme. Prior to this outbreak, there was guidance
available to poultry keepers on the Welsh Assembly Government website:
<http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/ahw/disease_surveillance_control/avianflu/?lang=en>.
Readers of the website are reminded that there is a General license
on poultry and other bird livestock movements in force under European law.
We should not prejudge any official enquiry or further statements.
However, there seems to have been some unrecorded movement of
livestock that has created a great deal of additional work for DEFRA
and the police and at the same time caused delay in containing the
outbreak. This is very reminiscent of the 2001 FMD outbreak. Since
that time, movement restrictions and documenting animal movements
have become an extremely time consuming and bureaucratic exercise as
an UK farmer will confirm. Other than the price they are paid for
their produce, this is one thing I hear constantly bemoaned by local
farmer friends.
Over the last 30 years or so, many people have moved into the area to
live an alternative lifestyle. Keeping a few chickens and selling
them and their eggs has been a popular source of income in the area
for longer than anyone or any records can tell; the proceeds are not
always declared for taxation purposes (reference: My father, a
retired chartered accountant who practiced for 50 years in the region).
It is unlikely that "grey marketers" with their few chickens will
suffer any great financial consequences from the inability of the
authorities to rapidly shut down the outbreak, an inability that is
due to the grey marketers' lack of records and unwillingness to come
forward with information. It could not have come at a worse time for
the game farmers of the region who will be selling poults to the
commercial shoots of this region and further afield. Over the next
few weeks, both game farmers and the shoots will be wanting to move
hundreds of thousands of pheasant and partridge poults to woods and
game crops in preparation for the beginning of the shooting season in
September. This industry is one of the economic lynch pins of the
winter economy in Wales.

[We are grateful to Dr Morgan for shedding local light, based upon
firsthand observations, on the Welsh feathered situation behind
curtains and official news.
ProMED-mail's Rapporteur Mary Marshall adds the following
complementary information: "Traded birds aren't only pet or hobby
birds. They can be small-scale commercial to be traded on or kept for
poultry, eggs or poultry products to be sold locally at farmers
markets, or they can be part of a much wider trade. I am told that
Chelmsford Market is huge and takes place every week and that it
draws people from at least 50 miles away."
Readers might be reminded of a rather similar situation which
unfolded during the HPAI H7N7 outbreak in the Netherlands in 2003,
when "Hobby birds" and commercial as well as non-commercial
small-holdings became a major factor, sometimes obstacle, in the
authorities' efforts to control the epizootic. - Mod.AS]
