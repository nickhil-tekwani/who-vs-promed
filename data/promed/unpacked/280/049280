To clarify recent postings on influenza, there is no licensed vaccine
against the H5N1 influenza A virus that caused the cluster of severe and
fatal "avian flu" cases in Hong Kong last year. The virus is not known to
be infecting humans at this time (15 March 1999).
Vaccine formulae may vary form place to place, but the World Health
Organization recommends two basic formulations, one for each of the two
hemispheres (where "opposite" seasons create differing patterns of influenza
circulation).
CDC notes that the influenza vaccine recommended for the 1998-99 season in
the United States contains 3 influenza virus strains: H3N2 and H1N1 strains
of influenza A, and an influenza B strain. There are 4 licensed
manufacturers in the US this season (Wyeth, Connaught, Evans, Parkdale).
Further information about the viral strains contained in the vaccines can
found in an MMWR publication [CDC. Prevention and Control of Influenza.
Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).
MMWR 1998;47:RR-6:1-27. Updated recommendations are expected around the
end of April 1999, and will be accessible through CDC's web page
(www.cdc.gov, and click on MMWR).
CDC also finds that all recent circulating influenza A and B strains studied
to date are "covered" by the current vaccine, unlike the U. S. situation in
1997-98 (CDC. Update: Influenza Activity - United States,1998-99 Season.
MMWR 1999;48:9:177-181).
