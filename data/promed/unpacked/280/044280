Anthrax outbreak in wild life in Maruleng
-----------------------------------------
The veterinary services within the Limpopo Department of Agriculture
(LDA) report that anthrax was diagnosed in wildlife in the Maruleng
Municipality under Mopani District Municipality. This is an acute
disease caused by a bacterium, _Bacillus anthracis_. It affects all
terrestrial (land) animals and is mostly lethal. The organism forms
spores which can be taken in by inhalation, ingestion or through the
skin. Ingestion is the most common route of infection.

It can also spread to humans by direct contact with infected material
when handling carcasses. Anthrax should always be suspected where an
animal dies suddenly showing dark, non-clotting blood from its
natural openings. Most bacteria inside the body of a dead animal are
destroyed upon the death of the animal, but will sporulate and form
spores which are hard to destroy if the animal is opened up and the
bacteria are exposed to the air. Dead animals should thus not be cut
open. For any suspicious cases, call a local veterinarian or any
veterinary official who will then handle the case appropriately.

Livestock should be vaccinated on a regular basis and meat from dead
animals should not be consumed. Game species should also be
considered for vaccination. Livestock in communal areas is being
vaccinated for free by veterinary officials. Commercial farmers
should vaccinate at their own expense, and should also contact the
local veterinary offices if they experience challenges.

The LDA is optimistic that with the cooperation of all stakeholders,
the community and farmers, this disease should be brought under
control.

[Maruleng is on the western boundary of the Kruger National Park and
the province has a number of smaller parks. Wildlife anthrax is a
problem of millenia in Southern Africa and until a cheap oral vaccine
can be found, it will remain so. A constant problem is that owners of
marginal herds around parks will take their animals into the parks,
against official instructions to the contrary, to make use of the
grazing. They will be brought out at night bringing infections with
them.

An additional 2 local papers are carrying reports:
