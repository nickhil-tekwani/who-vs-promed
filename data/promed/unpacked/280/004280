[As can be deduced from the information provided, the virus had already been circulating in Kos (one of Greece's Dodecanese islands, adjacent to continental Turkey) during September 2017. In 3 of the 4 affected farms, it was identified by serological tests in non-clinical cattle. The 4th, most recent case, in early November, involved a clinically affected cow which, reportedly, seroconverted on 2 Nov 2017 and "in which, subsequently, the serotype BTV 16 was detected on 6 Nov 2017."

All 4 farms are situated in north east Kos, the island's part closest to Turkey's shores (less than 6 km/4 km, beeline). Most likely, the same virus has been circulating within Turkey's continental territory during the said period.

Of the 4 affected farms, 3 included cattle and one included sheep as well. The absence of any clinical case among these 45 sheep (outbreak 3) deserves clarification, in view of the known high susceptibility of this species to BT, including BTV-16. Information on the vaccination history of these sheep, will be useful. - Mod.AS
