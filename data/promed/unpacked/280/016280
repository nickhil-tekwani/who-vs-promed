[According to Belgium's annual reports sent to the OIE for 2015, in addition to the 3 outbreaks detected in Limburg where bovines were affected, tuberculosis was also found in the province of Namur, where the affected animals were camelids; see report at http://tinyurl.com/goh4alv. This event involved, according to a detailed annual report on Belgium's FAVV-AFSCA (Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain) website (http://www.favv-afsca.be/activiteitenverslag/2015/), an alpaca (_Vicugna pacos_) imported from the UK. The animal became sick and died. Its necropsy discovered typical tuberculosis lesions which were confirmed bTB by laboratory tests on 3 Aug 2015. The entire holding was declared infected and put under quarantine. All animals were tested, one of them found suspected, and, in view of the risk to humans and as agreed with the owner, it was decided to euthanize the entire holding. Further epidemiological investigations discovered that the animal originated in Devon, southwest England, where bovine tuberculosis is known to be active in livestock and wildlife. Consequent to the event, 41 alpacas in 11 holdings suspected as possible contacts were tested. One animal was found suspected and put under isolation for follow-up. - Mods.AS/CRD
