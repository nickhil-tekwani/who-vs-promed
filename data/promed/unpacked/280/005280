Description of cases
--------------------
In mid-October 2011, the National Institute for Health and Welfare
(THL) in Finland was informed of a suspected case of foodborne
botulism. This was an elderly person who had been admitted to the
Helsinki University Central Hospital 3 days earlier due to acute onset
of dizziness, blurred vision, dysphagia, and dysarthria not preceded
by gastrointestinal symptoms. One day after hospital admission, the
patient’s condition deteriorated and foodborne botulism was
suspected based on clinical symptoms a day later. The suspected case
had no history of travel, and wound botulism was ruled out because of
intact skin. During days 1 and 2 of hospitalization, descending
paralysis progressed rapidly to nearly total tetraparesis and
respiratory muscle failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Clinical
presentation and no abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid were
suggestive of botulism. Electroneuromyography (ENMG) did not
definitely distinguish botulism from other neuromuscular diseases. The
index case developed multi-organ failure and died in hospital 14 days
after admission.

4 days after the index case was hospitalized, a young adult person in
the same household also presented with impaired (double) vision,
dysphagia, and dysarthria. During interviews with the 2 cases and 2
other household members, it was found that both cases had eaten
conserved olives stuffed with almonds from a previously unopened glass
jar in mid-October 2011 at an interval of 3 days between each other.
As this food item was the most plausible vehicle, it was tested before
any other food item collected from the household. Of the 2 other
household members, 1 had diarrhea but none had any neurological
symptoms. One of these 2 persons had tasted the implicated olives
while the other had not eaten any.

Laboratory investigation
------------------------
Serum, gastric content, and faecal samples were taken from both
suspected cases and sent to the Department of Food Hygiene and
Environmental Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of
Helsinki for analysis of botulinum neurotoxin and _Clostridium
botulinum_. The index case was sampled 3 days after the onset of
symptoms, and samples from the 2nd case were taken on the day of
hospital admission, after the administration of a trivalent antitoxin.
The serum and gastric content samples were tested in the standard
mouse bioassay [1] and the gastric content and fecal samples were also
tested with multiplex-PCR [2,3]. Various food samples (of 20 food
items among which sun dried tomatoes, black olives, various fish
products) obtained from the household refrigerator were tested by PCR,
and the jar of olives from which the 2 cases had eaten the olives was
also subjected to the mouse bioassay.

The serum sample of the index case showed a weak positive result in
the mouse assay, suggesting the presence of borderline amount of
botulinum neurotoxin in the patient’s serum. However, all the other
clinical samples from both patients were negative for the neurotoxin.
Botulinum neurotoxin type B gene was detected in the gastric content
and fecal samples from both patients and in the implicated jar of
olives, indicating the presence of _C. botulinum_ type B organisms in
these samples. The olives were strongly positive for botulinum
neurotoxin type B. A PCR typing assay [4] showed the olive isolate to
be fldB positive, suggesting the isolate to be proteolytic and thus
belong to _C. botulinum_ Group I.

Product trace-back investigation
--------------------------------
The pasteurized olives stuffed with almonds had been manufactured and
packed in Italy. A consignment of 900 glass jars of 314 ml had been
imported to Finland in 2010. 2 different batches were identified,
labeled with best before dates of August 2012 and September 2012,
respectively. They had been sold in 3 supermarkets in 3 cities, 2 in
the metropolitan area (Espoo and Vantaa) and 1 in northern Finland
(Rovaniemi), and in 5 restaurants in central Helsinki and Vantaa. The
olives had also been delivered by the restaurants to clients and
business associates. The 2 cases described above had received the
olives as a gift. All the products that were still in store were
withdrawn by the local authorities and importing company one day after
notification. Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) and Early
Warning and Response System (EWRS) notifications were issued on 21 Oct
2011. The restaurants helped in identifying clients to whom they had
delivered olives. The supermarket chain used its records of loyalty
cards to identify customers who had purchased olives. The jar found at
the home of the cases was from the batch with expiry date September
2012. It was noted that some of the glass jars of both olive batches
were leaking. By visual inspection it was established that the content
in some of the leaking jars was spoiled. However, laboratory
investigations did not reveal botulinum neurotoxin or _C. botulinum_
in these jars. The Italian RASFF authorities identified that the
product had been exported to at least the following countries in the
European Union (EU): the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, the
Netherlands, Spain and the UK as well as to some non-EU countries:
Armenia, Barbados, Brazil, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland,
Taiwan and the USA. No human cases of botulism associated with this
batch of olives have been reported to date through the EWRS from other
EU or non-EU countries.

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
Foodborne botulism remains a serious threat and may be caused by
products distributed internationally. In Finland, foodborne botulism
is rare and most domestic cases have been associated with fish
products caused by _C. botulinum_ type E toxin [5,6]. In 2009, 2 cases
of foodborne botulism were detected among French tourists who
purchased fish from Finland which was stored inappropriately and
consumed after having returned home [7]. In 2006, 2 people in Finland
were diagnosed with foodborne botulism after having eaten
vacuum-packed smoked whitefish [8]. Previously in Italy, conserved
olives have also been implicated as a vehicle for foodborne botulism
[9].

The immediate concern in respect to the incident described here is
that jars of olives of the implicated batch may still be present in
households in different countries. The assumption of severe failure in
the processing, packaging and transportation of the implicated product
is supported by the fact that several jars had cap leakage and the
content was spoiled. The jar from which the 2 cases ate olives had
been unopened prior to consumption and the product was within the
given shelf life. However, as no other cases have been reported, it
appears that only a single jar supported _C. botulinum_ growth and
botulinum neurotoxin production. It may also be that spoilage
bacteria, as detected in some of the other jars, inhibited the growth
of _C. botulinum_. The response to the cases described above was
timely. However, continuous vigilance of clinicians for suspected
cases of foodborne botulism is needed.

[Of the 3 outbreaks of botulism reported from Europe and summarized in
this week's issue of Eurosurveillance, 2 of the 3 involved olives, 2
of the 3 were commercial products, and 2 of the 3 were due to type A.
This outbreak was due to type B botulinum toxin from commercially
produced olives.

When the motoneuron action potential depolarises the axon terminal,
acetylcholine is released from the cytosol into the synaptic cleft.
When botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the
heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein
structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This
specific docking is the reason for BT high selectivity for cholinergic
synapses.

After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin
binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target
proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT- A cleaves
synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves
vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as
synaptobrevin II. - Mod.LL]
