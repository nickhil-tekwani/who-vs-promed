ref: Troeltzsch M, Berndt R, Troeltzsch M. Is the oral cavity a reservoir for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding? Medical Hypotheses. 2020; 110419; ISSN 0306-9877
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Limited knowledge about the contagiosity and case fatality rate of COVID-19 as well as the still enigmatic route of transmission have led to strict limitations of non-emergency health care especially in head and neck medicine and dentistry. There are theories that the oral cavity provides a favorable environment for SARS-CoV-2 entry and persistence which may be a risk for prolonged virus shedding. However, intraoral innate immune mechanisms provide antiviral effects against a myriad of pathogenic viruses. Initial hints of their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 are surfacing. It is hypothesized that intraoral immune system activity modulates the invasion pattern of SARS-CoV-2 into oral cells. Thus, the significance of intraoral tissues for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and persistence cannot be assessed.

The underlying concept for this hypothesis was developed by the critical observation of a clinically asymptomatic COVID-19 patient. Despite a positive throat swab for SARS-CoV-2, molecular pathologic analysis of an oral perisulcular tissue specimen failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. More research effort is necessary to define the true origin of the contagiosity of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.

[According to the authors of the study above, the actual duration of shedding for potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles from the upper respiratory tract and the oral cavity by acutely or formerly infected patients is still not clear and appears to be variable [1]. There is also reported data that suggest that oral epithelial cells may be extremely prone to SARS-Cov-2 infection as they have a high percentage of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) receptors that have been shown to facilitate the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 [2]. Additionally, the environment in the oral cavity with the periodontal pockets and the gingival tissue may be favorable for virus replication and maintenance [3]. One may theorize that these synergistic effects could potentially promote early and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 colonization of the oral cavity.

On the other hand, the oral mucosa produces high levels of defensins [4], cathelicidins and other antiviral agents which have been shown to be protective against SARS-CoV-2. The authors have hypothesized that, since a variety of immunologic mechanisms ensure a powerful barrier function of the oral cavity against invading pathogens, the importance of oral tissues for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and prolonged shedding cannot be predicted. A case report is presented of a clinically symptomatic SARS CoV2 positive case who underwent a dental extraction procedure and oral epithelial cells and underlying connective tissue were free of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA despite a positive throat swab, as evidence by molecular testing. This data supported the protective role of oral environment to prevent local cell invasion by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The authors conclude, "This knowledge would be vital to estimate at what time formerly SARS-CoV-2 positive infected patients can return to dental and head and neck physicians' offices safely to get vital but non-emergency treatment." -Mod.UBA]

[2] South Korea: experience with infections in prison inmates
Date: Thu 26 Nov 2020 6:29 PM

When 3 prison inmates were infected with the coronavirus in South Korea early last spring [2020], corrections officers responded swiftly. "Walk-thru" testing booths were installed in each of the country's 54 prison compounds, masks were universally distributed, and prisoners had visitations curtailed. Use of common areas was also restricted. 9 months later, the Asian nation -- which has won plaudits globally for its effective and focused virus approach -- has reported only one other COVID-19 cluster in a jail system that's home to some 55 000 detainees: an outbreak of 11 cases.

Contrast that with the US, where the virus spread to 2200 people at California's San Quentin State Prison over summer, killing 28. On New York's Rikers Island, more than 1400 corrections officers were infected during an outbreak last spring in which 3 inmates died. After 90 of the 100 largest cluster outbreaks in the US occurred in prisons and jails, doctors and researchers are now pushing for urgent changes in the criminal justice system -- including drawing on the successes of South Korea and elsewhere -- to arrest what is becoming a deadly, fresh pandemic wave. "Correctional systems have become this hotbed for the transmission of the novel coronavirus," said Emily Wang, an associate professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, and director of the university's Center for Health and Justice.

Averting deaths
---------------
American prisons are often overcrowded and understaffed, Wang and Bruce Western, co-director of the Justice Lab at New York's Columbia University, and another colleague wrote in an editorial last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, US jails and prisons held some 2.3 million people -- almost a quarter of the global incarcerated population. Reducing the number of inmates, housing them in single cells, and testing those without symptoms for the SARS-CoV-2 virus can mitigate transmission in addition to the use of face masks and other standard public health measures, Wang and colleagues showed in a study released ahead of publication in June [2020]. Such strategies may reduce potential new cases by about 83% within 12 weeks, and avert 450 hospitalizations and 30 deaths among those who work and live in jails, they estimated. As of [24 Nov 2020], there have been 207 438 COVID-19 cases among people incarcerated in US prisons, including 1438 deaths, according to the COVID Prison Project, which tracks data and policy to monitor the pandemic in correctional facilities. Among staff, 44 598 infections have occurred with 75 deaths.

Inherent risk
-------------
New cases have been increasing by more than 13 600 a week in November [2020] -- the most since the pandemic began, according to the Marshall Project, which has been tracking these numbers since March [2020]. The death rate from COVID-19 is also 3 times higher among prisoners than in the general population, mapping closely the demographic pattern of severe disease and high rates of incarceration among Black, Latino, and indigenous communities. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in prisons is more than 5 times higher. That reflects the inherent risk with an airborne virus in "congregate settings with poor ventilation," said Stuart Kinner, head of the Justice Health Unit at the University of Melbourne. "Places like prisons are the riskiest places to be."

Judges released about 100 000 prisoners during the year to try to limit the virus's spread. Some had active infections that spilled outside correctional facilities, highlighting the potential for ex-prisoners to become "disastrous vectors for transmission in the broader community," said Kinner, who also chairs the World Health Organization's Health in Prison Programme Technical Expert Group.

'Disease pump'
--------------
"Prisons have been characterized as a disease pump," he said. "You put people with those infections in, it spreads, and then you pump it out into the community."

The consequence is costly for the whole of society, according to Kinner. "Containing COVID-19 in prison settings, you improve the health of some of our most vulnerable, you reduce a vector for transmission in poor communities, and you reduce the risk of overwhelming health services, which is obviously bad for everybody," he said.

California to release some inmates with virus ravaging prisons
--------------------------------------------------------------
A botched transfer of inmates to San Quentin led to a massive outbreak at California's oldest prison, where inmates share cells that have open bars and no doors, and ventilation is poor. The 168-year-old facility installed a large air-conditioned tent structure to treat prisoners on the grounds but has come under fire for not heeding the early warnings of local public health officials and experts at University of California, San Francisco. A state appeals court faulted corrections officials last month [October 2020] for "deliberate indifference" to the health of inmates and ordered the state to release or transfer half of the San Quentin prisoners.

Korean approach
---------------
In South Korea, a far different scenario has played out. Prisons, under the guidance of health officials, impose significant restrictions on what is already a highly restrictive environment. Inmates with COVID-19 symptoms are tested and quarantined if found to have the virus. Likewise, all new prisoners are quarantined for 14 days before being allowed into the general population and are tested if symptoms develop. Masks must be worn at all times and group gatherings, including classes and counseling sessions, are restricted. In-person visitations have also been limited, with prison officials expanding the ability for inmates to conduct virtual meet-ups instead. In South Korea, glass partitions separate prisoners and their visitors, who are required to talk using microphones, a standard feature that likely also helped mitigate spread. The system isn't failsafe. In the past week, a prison guard in the southwest city of Gwangju was infected by a new inmate who tested positive on [22 Nov 2020]. Additional screening Tuesday [24 Nov 2020] turned up 9 more cases among inmates and prison staff. But universal masking, abundant testing, and the other measures that have helped South Korea respond rapidly to COVID-19 cases in its prisons aren't standard in the US, Yale's Wang said. "There are correctional facilities in the US that have taken on really smart, thoughtful approaches to testing, and smart, thoughtful approaches to population management," she said. "I just haven't seen them 'en masse' and in large scale."

[The same non-pharmaceutical measures (NPIs) that are being promoted for all public places, that is, wearing masks, keeping social distance, and having measures in place to isolate new or symptomatic individuals can help contain potential outbreaks, as evidenced by the examples from South Korea. No rocket science here... ensure that what has worked is consistently implemented. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet).

Data by country, area, or territory for 26 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov26_1606436536.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 41.0% of daily case numbers and 37.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 25.4 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Peru, Panama, and Chile. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Costa Rica, Paraguay, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Dominican Republic.

- The European region reported 40.6% of daily case numbers and 46.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 17.7 million. Countries not reporting cases today (25 Nov 2020) include Israel, Sweden, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Russia, Germany, UK, France, Poland, and Ukraine. There are 23 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.5% of daily case numbers and 7.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.93 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Iraq, Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, UAE, and Tunisia. Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Oman, Somalia, and Yemen have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.3% of daily case numbers and 1.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.47 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Algeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Mali, Reunion, Cabo Verde, Zimbabwe, and Cameroon.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.88% of daily case numbers and 0.52% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.85 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Philippines, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, French Polynesia, China Guam, Mongolia, and Papua New Guinea. South Korea almost doubled its daily case count approaching 600 cases with all provinces reporting locally acquired infection (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/bdBoardList.do?brdId=16&brdGubun=162&dataGubun&ncvContSeq&contSeq&board_id&gubun) Press release 643 at http://www.kdca.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030 has a table listing all of the clusters that did not observe social distancing.

- The South East Asia region reported 9.7% of the daily newly reported cases and 6.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.5 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis as transmission continues uncontrolled, expected to increase following the Thanksgiving holiday weekend (26 Nov 2020 is Thanksgiving Day).

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (110 714), India (43 174), Brazil (37 672), and Turkey (36 008) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 10 901 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (25-26 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include the USA, India, Brazil, Turkey, Italy (29 001), Russia (25 487), Germany (21 576), UK (17 555), Poland (16 690), Ukraine (15 331), Spain (15 212), Iran (13 961), and France (13 563). A total of 64 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 34 of the 64 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 1.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 9.0%. Recognizing that 26 Nov 2020 was a national holiday in the USA, with a 4-day weekend usually observed and inherent in this a decrease in reporting -- 23 of 62 reporting units reported 0 cases today (26 Nov 2020), the 7-day averages for newly confirmed cases are decreased by 1.6% and the daily reported deaths are increased by 15.1%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases seem to be leveling off although the absolute case counts continue to be high on a daily basis. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. South Korea continues to report more than 500 cases per day. Germany has crossed the 1 million cumulative case mark, with 12 countries reporting more than 1 million cases. - Mod.MPP]
