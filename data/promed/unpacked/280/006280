[According to the report above, a total of 82 971 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4634 deaths -- no change from the previous 24 hours (22 May 2020) -- no new cases, no new deaths. There are 2 suspected cases: 1 imported in Shanghai and the other locally acquired in Jilin.

In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were 2 newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macao has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1711 imported cases reported (unchanged from yesterday 21 May 2020).

There were 28 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours; 2 were imported cases, and the remaining 26 cases were locally acquired. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 370, and 26 of these are importations from abroad. I realize mentioning this on a daily basis is repetitious, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and then ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 23 cases with 4 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (20 to 21 May 2020) when there were 20 newly confirmed cases and 0 death. A total of 11 165 confirmed cases and 266 deaths were reported today (22 May 2020), up from 11 142 cases and 264 deaths yesterday (21 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 49 consecutive days and below 50 for 42 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 14 days. In today's (22 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 19 of the cases were locally transmitted, and 4 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Gyeonggi (13) cases, Seoul (4) and 1 each in Daegu and Gyeongnam. Imported cases were in Quarantine (3) and 1 in Daejeon.

On the English language page, Notice: 329 of 22 May 2020 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) are graphs and tables showing the demographics of the cases and province-specific population-based rates. There is mention there has been a total of 1202 imported cases.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be the main problem, but the Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of the next steps. All individuals with a history of club attendance or other crowded locations are now being encouraged to get tested, even if asymptomatic, recognizing the potential role of asymptomatically infected individuals in transmission of the virus. And the Korean CDC is encouraging no club, bars or karaoke visits.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 228 658 cases, including 32 616 deaths, up from 228 006 cases and 32 486 deaths reported on 21 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 21 and 22 May 2020 was 652 newly confirmed cases, compared with 642 newly confirmed cases between 20 and 21 May 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 69.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 44.9% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the only province reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Ten provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (Sardinia, Basilicata and Umbria provinces reported no new cases), and another 8 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna were the only provinces reporting 50 or more cases (but fewer than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of nonessential businesses. It is now 66 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 65 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 131 652 total cases, 7300 deaths
Date: Fri 22 May 2020 20:58 PHT
Source: Manila Bulletin / AFP report [edited]
https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/05/22/iran-counts-51-new-virus-deaths/


Iran said on Friday [22 May 2020] it had detected another 51 deaths from its novel coronavirus outbreak, bringing the country's overall fatalities to 7300. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 2311 new positive tests for COVID-19 took the country's caseload to 131 652. Fourteen provinces reported no deaths in the past 24-hour period, while 6 reported just one fatality.

Iraj Harirchi, deputy minister of health, renewed an appeal for Iranians to avoid unnecessary travel during the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Iranians usually travel between provinces to visit their family and friends during Eid al-Fitr, which will be held on Sunday [24 May 2020] and Monday [25 May 2020] in the Islamic republic.

"Moving in the red zones puts us in danger and moving in the white zones puts the inhabitants of these zones in danger," Harirchi was quoted as saying by Mehr news agency on Friday [22 May 2020].

Iran reported its 1st cases of coronavirus on [19 Feb 2020] -- 2 deaths in the Shiite holy city of Qom. The government of President Hassan Rouhani was criticised for being slow to react as the virus spread rapidly across the Islamic republic. It shut schools and places of worship and banned intercity travel for the Persian New Year holidays in March [2020], but since last month [April 2020] it has gradually eased restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the virus.

[In the 24 hours from 21 to 22 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 129 341 to 131 652 total cases, an increase of 2311 compared with 2392 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (21 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 7249 to 7300, an increase of 51 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Russia, Brazil, Spain, the UK, Italy, France, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 22 May 2020 22:57 EDT [GMT-4]).

As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature because daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution is that there is usually a 2- to 3-week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. If there is heavy travel, there may be a significant increase of COVID-19 cases in the coming 2-4 weeks. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR-positive confirmations, and not antibody-based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The cumulative antibody-confirmed cases are available just above Figure 3 and I am adding it to the PCR cases. There were 446 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with 344 in the preceding 24-hour period (from 20 to 21 May 2020), bringing the PCR-confirmed (plus number confirmed including all tests) cumulative total to 234 824 (281 904) cases as compared with 233 037 (280 117) confirmed cases on 21 May 2020. Total death reports note 28 628 deaths reported as of today (22 May 2020) and 27 940 deaths reported as of 21 May 2020, an increase of 688 deaths in 24 hours. This is a major change from yesterday's report, and I wonder if there is some reporting artifact in cumulative case counts.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 15.56, a continual slow decrease over the past 28 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 15.56 today (22 May 2020). Spain has the 2nd highest case count in Europe and is 4th globally behind the USA, Russia, and Brazil in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. According to Table 2, of the 234 824 [281 904] cases, an additional 140 cases have been hospitalized (PCR positive), and an additional 20 cases were admitted to ICU (PCR positive). Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
