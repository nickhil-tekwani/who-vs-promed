Introduced in 1960 by the colonial government, the napier grass forms
almost 80 percent of fodder for smallholder livestock farmers in
Uganda. But the disease, the napier smut, causes stunting and
sometimes rotting of this grass. It has been recorded to cause up to
100 percent loss of vegetative cover.

According to Dr Dennis Kyetere, the Director General of the National
Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO), the disease has now spread
to 30 districts around the country. "What's worrying is that many
farmers are not aware it is a disease. They associate it with
dwindling soil fertility," he said. The disease was 1st observed in
Masaka and Mukono districts in 2001.

According to Dr Kyetere, "Small holder farmers own over 90 percent of
the dairy cattle and goats." And they are now facing a grave risk. To
confront the looming disaster, Dr Titus Alicai, National Crop
Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI), said they have started a
campaign to raise awareness about the disease amongst farmers.

He said Uganda is partnering with regional countries. As part of this
initiative, "we are developing a genetic diversity study of various
napier clones in the region to identify those which are resistant. So
far, we have 960 such clones," Dr Janice Proud, a researcher from the
International Livestock Research Institute, Ethiopia, said.

Some experts have estimated that napier [smut] causes between 20 and
40 percent reduction in herbage yield, lack of clean planting
materials, and a decline in animal productivity, thus low income.
Resource-poor and landless farmers -- meaning they can't free-range
graze their animals -- are particularly affected by the elephant
grass yield reductions.

[Napier or elephant grass (_Pennisetum purpureum_) is an important
fodder crop in East Africa that is often used in a cut-and-carry
system. Head smut caused by the fungus _Ustilago kamerunensis_ has a
devastating impact on this crop causing serious reduction in biomass
or complete yield loss. Symptoms include stunting of plants,
premature flowering and the replacement of seeds by a black mass of
spores. The existence of disease hot spots suggests that the main
means of spread is through transport of infected planting material.

Disease management may include fungicides (mostly too expensive for
smallholders), use of clean planting material, phytosanitary measures
to prevent pathogen introduction, and planting of alternative fodder
grasses not susceptible to the fungus (for example _Panicum_ or
_Setaria_ species). While some resistant crop lines are available,
the varieties most preferred by the farmers are generally more
susceptible. Further development of resistant cultivars from local
germplasm, as reported above, is important for large scale control of
the disease in East Africa.
