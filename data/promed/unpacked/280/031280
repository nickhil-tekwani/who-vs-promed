A Case of rabies Was Detected and Massive Vaccination was Implemented
---------------------------------------------------------------------
At least 7 persons are under close observation after reporting they
had a risky contact with a puppy in which rabies had been detected.
It is the very 1st case reported in the past 6 years in this
province, and this led sanitary authorities to carry out a wide dog
and cat vaccination campaign in the community where the animal lived.

The puppy had initially bitten its master and its master's son, as
well as 3 veterinarians who took care of the animal. All these people
received rabies vaccination, [post exposure prophylaxis - Mod.TG] in
order to prevent the occurrence of the disease.

According to a report from the Province Epidemiology Direction, the
animal died last Friday [11 Apr 2008] and the diagnosis of rabies was
confirmed. Samples were sent to Pasteur Institute in Buenos Aires in
order to further identify the involved virus.

According to the preliminary report, the puppy was bought in a street
pet fair, located in Fructuoso Rivera and Velez Sarsfield Avenue, in
Nueva Cordoba community. Apparently the original master also sold 2
other puppies, which are currently being sought for in order to
perform controls.

Sanitary authorities implemented a wide vaccination campaigns in the
aforementioned community. Gabriel Pedetta, Health Secretary of the
Province, confirmed that technical personnel will carry out household
visits, verifying the condition of the pets, particularly dogs and
cats.

Within this context, the officer requested collaboration from Cordoba
Municipality, in order to assess the situation of homeless animals
that walk around the city.

[This appears to be a rapid and excellent response to an exposure.
They are to be commended for their efforts and we certainly wish them
luck at finding the other puppies as they continue to work through
this situation.

The article does not indicate the strain of rabies or if there is any
investigation to determine where the rabies originated. If there is
additional information, we would be grateful for communication from
an authoritative source. - Mod.TG]
