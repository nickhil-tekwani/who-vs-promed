Chronic wasting disease has been confirmed in deer in 4 more Arkansas counties, according to the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.

Deer harvested in Randolph, Crawford, Franklin, and Van Buren counties have been confirmed with the disease, the commission said Friday [31 Dec 2021].

The fatal disease affects deer, elk, caribou, and moose and has been found in at least 27 states nationwide.

The case in Randolph County in northeastern Arkansas is about 25 mi (40 km) from the nearest confirmed case, in southern Missouri, but no confirmed cases have been reported in adjoining Arkansas counties.

"We held public meetings along the Missouri border this summer," AG&FC Director Austin Booth said. "We'll make sure we hold public meetings about our findings at the conclusion of deer season."

Crawford, Franklin, and Van Buren counties in western Arkansas all are adjacent to counties where the disease has previously been found and are within the state's chronic wasting management zone.

There are no reported cases of the disease in humans, but it is recommended that meat from infected animals not be eaten.

Hunters are encouraged to take the heads of harvested deer to free testing facilities located in each of Arkansas' 75 counties.

[2] Idaho (Idaho County): mule deer

Idaho Fish and Game officials said Thursday [30 Dec 2021] that testing has detected 2 additional cases of chronic wasting disease in deer near Lucile in the Slate Creek drainage.

The new detections, from 2 whitetail bucks, mark the 3rd and 4th known cases of the fatal neurological illness ever detected in the state and follow 2 cases from a pair of mule deer bucks detected in October [2021]. [See ProMED post 20211120.8699783. - Mod.TG]

"While unfortunate, these latest CWD detections show our surveillance efforts are working, and we greatly appreciate the assistance we've received from hunters and landowners to help us learn how widespread CWD may be, and what percentage of the deer population may be affected," Fish and Game State Wildlife Manager Rick Ward said in a news release.

Following the 1st 2 cases, the Idaho Fish and Game Commission established a chronic disease management zone in game management Unit 14, which stretches from Cottonwood to Riggins, and Unit 15, to the east along the South Fork of the Clearwater River, and a CWD surveillance zone that includes all or parts of adjacent units. The commission also gave Idaho Fish and Game Director Ed Schriever authority to establish emergency deer hunts designed to increase sampling for the disease, present in 27 other states, including Montana, Wyoming, and Utah and in 4 Canadian provinces.

Those hunts, and samples collected at game check stations during the tail end of the regular deer hunting season, produced hundreds of additional samples.

In addition to the 4 positive test results, 448 samples taken in the surveillance zone tested negative, and 72 samples are still pending. Statewide, the agency tested more than 2500 animals for the disease [in 2021].

"We still have test results pending from deer harvested within the surveillance zone," Ward said. "When we get the results of all tests, we will then assess our management options. Hunters and the general public will be involved in this process as the Fish and Game Commission deliberates future CWD management actions."

Rules within the CWD management zone prohibit people from feeding deer and elk and prohibit those who salvage road-killed animals from removing the head or spinal column. There is an exception for those who are bringing the parts to Fish and Game offices for testing.

The disease has never been documented to jump from wild animals to humans. Even so, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions recommends against consuming the meat of animals that test positive for CWD.

A deer killed in northwest Alabama was infected with chronic wasting disease in the 1st confirmed case of the illness in the state, game officials said Friday [7 Jan 2022].

The disease, which is fatal and affects the behavior of deer because of microscopic changes in the brain, previously was detected in neighboring Tennessee and Mississippi in 2018 and has been advancing toward the state's borders, said a statement from Chris Blankenship, commissioner of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.

The whitetail deer testing positive was killed in Lauderdale County, located in the state's northwest corner, the announcement said.

Hunters will be able to kill all the deer they want in Lauderdale and Colbert counties on private or public properties in the area through the end of the season to help eradicate the disease, but they must submit animals' heads for testing in the highest-risk areas.

A deer can carry the disease for years without signs, the department said. In its latter stages, the illness may cause listlessness, lowering of the head, weight loss, repetitive walking in patterns and a lack of responsiveness.

The State's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has revealed reports of a deer in the Town of Underhill tested positive for CWD [chronic wasting disease].

This is the 1st deer in Oconto County to confirm to have CWD, according to the release.

The deer was a one-year-old hunter-harvested buck taken during the 2021 gun deer season. The information was released on Tue 11 Jan [2022] and detail what the DNR will be doing to protect the area.

According to state law, a 3-year baiting and feeding ban will be placed in Oconto County. There will also be a 2-year ban in Menominee County, as the deer with CWD was collected within 10 mi [16.1 km] of the county line.

Shawano County would have had a 2-year ban, as it is within 10 mi [16.1 km] of the county line, but the county already has a 2-year baiting and feeding ban following the discovery of a deer with CWD as well.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources reports 36 positive chronic wasting disease tests from some 5000 deer samples this hunting season.

The DNR's Tyler Harms oversees the deer management program. "We did add 2 new counties to our list of counties in which CWD has been detected in the wild. Those counties are Greene County in central Iowa, and then also Fremont County in southwest Iowa. So that brings our total number of counties to 12," Harms says.

He says they will now do additional sample testing in Greene and Fremont County moving forward. Harms says they do this with other counties having had positive deer, and those tests give them an idea of the level of CWD.

"If you start looking at individual counties where we've had it -- like Allamakee County, for example, where it was first detected in 2013 -- we are looking at about a 2% prevalence rate, which is not unexpected; it's about right where we would expect," Harms said. "Our goal is just to continue to do what we can to keep the prevalence as low as possible."

Harms says Iowa's efforts to try and keep the disease in check are working. "What we're seeing is that we are really holding our own. We know this disease is going to continue to expand in counties where we have it. There's still a lot to be learned about how to effectively manage the disease," he says. "Based on what we can tell thus far, and what we are seeing in the counties, where we have the disease is not outside what we would expect to see in our review of counties in other states having had the disease for much longer."

Harms says the best thing you can do is to keep hunting and keep submitting samples for testing.

"If you are hunting in counties where we have detected the disease, those voluntary samples from harvested animals are a huge, huge benefit to our monitoring effort," Harms says. "Consider submitting a sample from your harvested animal. Certainly, in these new counties like Greene and Fremont, these hunter-submitted samples are going to be very important for our surveillance efforts moving forward."

He says everyone can help by not putting out feed for deer. "Chronic wasting disease is spread via direct contact between individual animals, so we know artificial congregation of animals in small areas around these bait sources is going to increase the risk," he says. Harms says hunters should properly dispose of the deer carcasses to help prevent the spread of the disease.

Counties with positive deer and year detected
Allamakee: 72 (2013); Appanoose: 3 (2020); Clayton: 29 (2016); Decatur: 1 (2019); Dubuque: 3 (2018); Fayette: 2 (2019); Fremont: 1 (2021); Greene: 1 (2021); Jackson: 2 (2020); Wayne: 22 (2017); Winneshiek: 10 (2019); Woodbury: 2 (2019)

["Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, neurological illness occurring in North American cervids (members of the deer family), including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Since its discovery in 1967, CWD has spread geographically and increased in prevalence locally. CWD is contagious; it can be transmitted freely within and among cervid populations. No treatments or vaccines are currently available.

"Chronic wasting disease is of great concern to wildlife managers. It has been detected in at least 23 states, 2 Canadian provinces, and South Korea. CWD is not known to infect livestock or humans.

"CWD is transmitted directly through animal-to-animal contact, and indirectly through contact with objects or environment contaminated with infectious material (including saliva, urine, feces, and carcasses of CWD-infected animals)." - Mod.TG
