Department of Health Announces 3rd NM Hantavirus Case This Year [2007]
-------------------
The New Mexico Department of Health announced today that a
34-year-old man from McKinley County was diagnosed with the state's
3rd case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome this year. The man was
hospitalized and is now recovering at home.

"People are usually exposed to hantavirus[es] around their homes,
especially when they clean out enclosed areas that have lots of mouse
droppings," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, the Department of Healths state
public health veterinarian. "With the cold weather, mice may try to
enter buildings for shelter so it is important to seal up homes and
other structures that are used by people. Mice can squeeze through
holes the size of a dime."

Hantavirus [causes] a deadly disease transmitted by infected rodents
through urine, droppings or saliva. People can contract the disease
when they breathe in aerosolized virus. The deer mouse is the main
reservoir for hantavirus in New Mexico. The Department urges health
care workers and the general public to familiarize themselves with
the symptoms of hantavirus [infection].

Early symptoms of hantavirus [infection] are fever and muscle aches,
possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal
pain and cough. Symptoms develop one to 5 weeks after rodent
exposure. Although there is no specific treatment for hantavirus
[infection], chances for recovery are better if medical attention is
sought early.

To protect yourself, avoid contact with mice and other rodents. Other
important steps are:
- Air out closed up buildings before entering.
- Seal up homes and cabins so mice can't enter.
- Trap mice until they are all gone.
- Clean up nests and droppings using a disinfectant.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Get rid of trash and junk piles.
- Don't leave your pet food and water where mice can get to it.

Earlier cases this year [2007] were in a man from San Miguel County
and a fatal case in a woman from Taos County. In 2006, New Mexico had
8 cases of hantavirus in Santa Fe, McKinley, Taos, Rio Arriba and
Otero counties. That year 3 men from Taos, McKinley and Cibola
counties died. Since hantavirus was discovered in the Four Corners
area in 1993, there have been 76 cases and 31 deaths in New Mexico.

[The hantavirus involved in this and the previous New Mexico 2007
cases is doubtless Sin Nombre virus.
