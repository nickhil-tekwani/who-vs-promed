Ostrich farmers in the Western Cape are expected to meet with
government today [28 Jun 2011] to discuss whether the avian flu
outbreak in the Klein Karoo could be declared a national disaster.
About 300 ostrich farmers will know later today whether there will be
any further cullings in the region. So far, more than 23 000 birds
have been culled due to the outbreak in April 2011.

Agriklein Karoo CEO Pieter Lodder says the State Vet and police are
helping them to further assess the situation on the ground. "There's a
2nd round of testing underway at the moment which should be completed
by today [28 Jun 2011]; we are hoping that it will be finished by
today, then we will establish, when we have our meeting this
afternoon, how far the 2nd round of testing has gone," says Lodder.

The recent ban on ostrich meat from the Klein Karoo has left the
industry in the Eastern Cape on its knees. A total shutdown of the
industry in the Grahamstown area has left scores jobless, and although
no birds have tested positive for the flu in the region, ostrich
farmers have been left without a market.

South Africa accounts for about 80 percent of the world's ostrich
production, and 15 percent comes from the Eastern Cape.

[South Africa has submitted an immediate report and 3 follow-up
reports to the OIE concerning this ongoing event; the most recent
follow-up report was submitted on 10 Jun 2011, including the following
epidemiological commentary:

"Commercial ostrich farms: Farms tested positive on serology during
routine surveillance but tested negative on PCR, and no virus could be
found; diagnosis was only confirmed after several follow-up PCR tests.
South Africa only reports outbreaks on confirmation of PCR tests.
Initially, no clinical signs or mortalities were seen."

>From this commentary, it is not clear whether any clinical cases have
been recorded or whether the diagnosis is based upon PCR without
clinical manifestation of the infection. - Mod.AS]
