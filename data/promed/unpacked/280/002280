Warning over mumps outbreak in Plymouth [Devon]
-----------------------------------------------
Health protection bosses are warning students of mumps outbreaks following
a rise in cases among Plymouth young people. New figures from the Health
Protection Agency (HPA) show that there were 39 cases of the infection
across the city in 2008 -- many among people in their late teens and 20s.

The authority has identified people born between 1980 and 1990 as at the
greatest risk. Anyone in this age range may have missed out on a
mumps-containing vaccine or getting natural immunity through a previous
bout of the illness. Prior to the mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR)
injection being introduced in 1988, vaccines were only available for
measles and rubella.

Mumps can spread rapidly in environments such as colleges and universities,
where it is passed on by coughing, sneezing, and kissing.

Dr Mark Kealy, of the South West Peninsula Health Protection Unit, said:
"Mumps is a viral illness which can lead to serious complications. At the
very best, it takes students out of studies -- and socialising -- for 2
weeks as they recover. "We've seen a 40 per cent increase in mumps cases
over the last 6 months in Devon and Cornwall, and in most cases it is an
entirely avoidable illness." The HPA is urging all students born in that
decade to check their vaccination history with their GP [general
practitioner]. Two doses of MMR are required to give the fullest protection
against mumps. The injection is free and there is no upper age limit. The
number of cases across Devon and Cornwall rose from 19 in the 1st half of
last year [2008] to 27 cases in the 2nd half. Colleges and universities
across the 2 counties are sending out the advice direct to students on
email, or placing it on intranet home pages and including it in student
bulletins. Young people who suspect they have the infection are advised to
contact their GP or student health service.

General practices in the Devon and Cornwall area have been alerted to the
symptoms, which may include: fever, headaches, aches and pains, and swollen
glands along the jaw line. There is no specific treatment for mumps, so for
most people it will clear up by itself. However, complications may include
swelling of the ovaries, swelling of the testes, aseptic meningitis, and
deafness.

Service) MMR website at <http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Vaccines/MMR>.
