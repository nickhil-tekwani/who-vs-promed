China reported 2 fresh outbreaks of foot and mouth disease [FMD] but
said the situations were under control.
On 22 May 2006, 7 cows began showing symptoms of the disease in
Changyang county of central China's Hubei province, the ministry of
agriculture said on its website.
3 cows had similar symptoms in Jiaguguan prefecture of northwestern
China's Gansu province, the ministry said.
Both outbreaks were confirmed as FMD [serotype] Asia-1 by the
national-level veterinary laboratory on Monday [29 May 2006], it said.
The ministry said the 2 outbreaks were under control following
quarantine, disinfection and culling measures.
In Hubei, 13 cows, 32 pigs and 7 sheep were culled, while 35 head of
livestock were culled in Gansu, it said.
The outbreaks were the 6th and 7th in China this year, based on
previously published data from the ministry [see commentary].

[On 16 Nov 2005, China sent a final report to the OIE, notifying that
2 FMD outbreaks, caused by serotype Asia-1 in May 2005 in Shandong
and Jiangsu provinces, were considered to be effectively eradicated
-- as, reportedly, supported by the results of serological
surveillance conducted for all susceptible animals in the affected
and threatened areas. Consequently, all quarantines in the affected
areas were lifted by the veterinary administrative departments of
Shandong and Jiangsu provinces. In addition, this final report stated
that surveillance by the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's
Republic of China during the 6 months since the last case was stamped
out has shown no evidence of new cases in the 2 affected areas. See
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_44.HTM#Sec7>.
Since then, the Chinese authorities have officially notified 6 new
outbreaks of FMDV Asia-1, as follows:
30 Dec 2005, one outbreak affecting cattle, ShanDong province.
16 Jan 2006, 2 outbreaks affecting cattle: one in Ningxia province,
the other one in Jiangxi province.
8 Mar 2006, one outbreak affecting cattle, Gansu province.
28 Mar 2006, one outbreak affecting cattle, Gansu province.
30 Apr 2006, one outbreak affecting cattle, Qinghai province.
The information in the current newswire, if confirmed, adds Hubei to
the list of affected provinces. The detection of single outbreaks in
6 provinces is a cause for concern; the singularity of such outbreaks
is exceptional in terms of the high infectivity of FMD virus. Absence
of cases in pigs deserves to be confirmed as well. - Mod.AS]
