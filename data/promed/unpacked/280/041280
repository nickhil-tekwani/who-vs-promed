The World Health Organization (WHO) said on [12 Sep 2019] that it had deployed a technical team to the country to cooperate with the health ministry [see Archive Undiagnosed illness - Tanzania: fatal, WHO team deployment, RFI 20190913.6672971].

The government of Tanzania said on Saturday [14 Sep 2019] that there has been no confirmed case of Ebola in the country. This comes [2 days] after WHO said it was investigating "as a matter of urgency" a "rumor" of death from an unknown illness in Tanzania.

Speaking at a press conference in Dar es Salaam, the Minister of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Ms. Ummy Mwalimu said there were [rumours] about 2 cases of people who were believed to have contracted Ebola.

"We (as the ministry) took samples of those cases and I can confirm that they didn't have Ebola," said Ms. Mwalimu, emphasizing that the only authority that can announce an outbreak of a disease such as Ebola is the country's minister responsible for health.

The patient who died was buried by the authorities in Temeke, Dar es Salaam, unofficial reports indicate.

But this is not the 1st time that health authorities in Tanzania have buried patients with Ebola-like symptoms. In 2016, The Citizen witnessed health workers at Muhimbili National Hospital, wearing personal protective gear aboard a special vehicle carrying 2 caskets bearing the bodies of the deceased, headed for burial in Kinondoni.

Authorities said the patients had been diagnosed with viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome, which includes diseases like severe dengue fever, Ebola and Zika fever.

In Tanzania and across East Africa, there is heightened vigilance because of an outbreak of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and a few reported cases in Western Uganda at the border with DRC.

A recent death that sparked controversy on social media is that of a Tanzanian medical doctor who was a student at Makerere University in Uganda. Reports that went viral on social media (especially on WhatsApp) on Friday [13 Sep 2019] said that the deceased had traveled from Uganda to her country, Tanzania, where she was carrying out her field study for post-graduate studies.

She travelled to Mwanza (in the northwest of the country), then she went to Dar es Salaam (in the east of the country) and subsequently travelled to the southeast of the country (Mtwara or Songea). Details showed that she developed headache, fever, rash, [and] bloody diarrhoea on [28 Aug 2019] and sought medical attention at a private clinic where she was 1st diagnosed with malaria.

She travelled back to Dar es Salaam, where she was hospitalized on [7 Sep 2019] at one of the regional referral hospitals. Following a suspicion of viral hemorrhagic fever, she was transferred to an isolation unit in another referral hospital --Temeke Ebola Treatment Unit -- where she died. Her burial was supervised, reports further indicate.

Reuters quoted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday [13 Sep 2019] saying it was unlikely the death was caused by Ebola. The woman who died in Dar es Salaam on [8 Sep 2019] presented symptoms common to several diseases, including dengue or malaria, both endemic in East Africa, Justin Williams, the director for communication and policy at the Nairobi office of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Reuters.

[The early symptoms of Ebola can closely mimic other diseases like the flu, malaria, and typhoid fever, or other viral hemorrhagic fever viruses present in Africa, such as Lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg viruses, as well as severe dengue virus. These agents can be easily separated with laboratory assays. But until the etiologic agent is determined, healthcare workers and lab technicians must practice precautions. This includes isolating a patient who may be infected with Ebola virus and wearing protective gowns, gloves, masks, and eye shields when coming in contact with the individual or their belongings. Careful protocol and disposal of these protective materials is also vital for infection prevention. Cleaning crews should use a bleach solution to clean floors and surfaces that may have come in contact with the Ebola virus.

HealthMap has sent out an EpiCore request for further information on this case. It would be good to know exactly what is the etiologic agent if not Ebola. But it is certainly a relief that Ebola has not been identified in Tanzania. While the world escaped what would have been a major change in Ebola spread in Africa, as long as infected people are dying in community care centers, the risk remains high the virus may spread further beyond the borders of the DRC. But the incident also reminds us that other diseases that afflict the people in this region need attention. ProMED thanks everyone who responded with what they know. - Mod.LK
