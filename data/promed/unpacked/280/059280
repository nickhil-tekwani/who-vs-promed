An outbreak of salmonella in Germany has infected more than 250
people and killed 2, authorities said on Sunday [20 May 2007]. The
Klinikum Fulda, a 924-bed hospital in the town of Fulda, [Hesse], in
central Germany, said 233 patients and staff had been infected by the
outbreak, along with a further 23 people in a nursing home attached
to the institution.
Achim Hellinger, the hospital's medical director, said the precise
cause of the outbreak had not yet been identified, but that the risk
of it reaching the general public was negligible. "The risk of the
salmonella infection being spread from person to person is extremely
small," he said, adding that measures to contain the bacteria had
been put in place.
Most of those infected were not seriously affected by the bacteria,
which usually stems from infected food, he added. The hospital said 2
women over the age of 80 had died as a direct result of infection,
one of them in the nursing home. The death of another woman in her
70s was indirectly linked to the salmonella, it added.
Of those infected at the hospital, 145 were patients and 88 were
employees, the Klinikum Fulda said in a statement. An outbreak was
1st logged at the hospital in late April [2007]; since then, the
number of reported infections has risen steadily.
Salmonella bacteria are frequently responsible for foodborne
illnesses and may cause vomiting, abdominal pain, and bouts of fever.

[Outbreaks of salmonellosis in hospitals and long-term care
facilities are not uncommon. The spread is usually by food from
animal sources, which is prepared in bulk. Egg products are often the
cause. The elderly and those with serious underlying diseases are
more likely to become severely ill. The use of antacids, H2 blockers,
and proton pump inhibitors are known to increase susceptibility to
salmonellosis by decreasing gastric acidity, thus increasing the
effective inoculum reaching the small intestine. Use of antibiotics
has also been demonstrated to increase susceptibility. All of these
factors are operative in hospitals and long-term care facilities.
It would be of interest to know the serotype of the infecting strain. - Mod.DK]
