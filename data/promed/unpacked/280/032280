There have been 2 ProMED reports of "community-acquired" MRSA
outbreaks in jails in California over the past year (1,2). The
Hamilton (Ontario, Canada) Public Health and Community Services
Department has investigated 5 cases of soft-tissue infection with
MRSA between May and Oct 2002 at a correctional facility in southern
Ontario.
All 5 affected individuals presented with abscesses and cellulitis in
the lower extremities. All MRSA isolates were identical by pulsed
field gel electrophoresis and PFGE patterns did not match those of
local nosocomial MRSA strains. The isolates were susceptible to
tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, and
clindamycin, and resistant to erythromycin and beta-lactams, which
again differs from local nosocomial MRSA strains, which tend to be
resistant to all the above antibiotics.
No risk factors for acquiring MRSA were identified and the 5 cases
were otherwise healthy. We were unable to identify a single mode of
transmission, though 3 of the 5 individuals had spent time in an
individual cell block.
These strains are in the process of being forwarded to Health Canada
for further investigation of their phylogeny relative to other
Canadian MRSA isolates. Current efforts are being aimed at
evaluating the prevalence of carriage of this strain among inmates
and guards.
