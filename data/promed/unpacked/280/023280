A foodborne outbreak that affected hundreds of people in Newcastle was spread by uncooked curry leaves, an investigation has found. More than 400 visitors to the 3-day Street Spice event reported symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting, with 29 confirmed as having salmonellosis.

Health experts found curry leaves used raw in chutney were contaminated by several different bacteria. Public Health England (PHE) said it was one of the UK's largest outbreaks.

PHE said it was the 1st time one of the strains of _Salmonella_ had been detected in the UK.

Stephen Savage, director of regulation and public protection, said: "This decision, based on our enforcement policy, takes into account the lack of clear, official advice about the use of curry leaves and the overall good standards of food hygiene at the festival. We have recommended to the Food Standards Agency that they should develop information to be circulated nationally about the preparation of curry leaves and other herbs. We will ensure that this advice is given to the local restaurant trade."

An estimated 12 000 people attended the event at the Centre for Life in Newcastle between 28 Feb and 2 Mar 2013.

[The curry tree, _Murraya koenigii_, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry_tree) is a tropical to sub-tropical tree in the family Rutaceae, which is native to India and Sri Lanka. Its leaves are used in many dishes in India and neighbouring countries. Often used in curries, the leaves are generally called by the name "curry leaves," though they are also translated as "sweet neem leaves" in most Indian languages (as opposed to ordinary neem leaves, which are bitter). This moderator often has 1-2 curry leaf plants growing in pots in his backyard for use in East Indian cooking but has only used them in cooked dishes as seasoning. One or another form of basil leaf has been recommended as an alternative, but the flavor profile is not the same.

The serotype(s) of _Salmonella enterica_ involved in this large outbreak are not stated, and it is certainly possible that the contamination of the curry leaves could have been multi-bacterial. Contamination of the curry leaves could have occurred while the plant/tree was still growing or after harvesting. - Mod.LL
