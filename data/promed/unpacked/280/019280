First Report of Potato mop-top virus on Potato from the United States.

D-2003-0430-02N, 2003. Accepted for publication 15 Apr 2003.
Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) is a tripartite pomovirus vectored by the
powdery scab plasmodiophoromycete _Spongospora subterranea_ pv.
_subterranea_ (1). PMTV occurs on potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) in Europe,
the Andes, Asia, and Canada. Internal necrotic arc and fleck tuber symptoms
("spraing") may reduce commercial acceptance of some cultivars (3).
PMTV symptoms were discovered in 'Shepody' tubers at the Aroostook Research
Farm, Presque Isle, ME in May 2002 and subsequently in 'Russet Burbank'
tubers in commercial storage from the 2001 Maine crop. Symptomatic tubers
exhibited single or multiple concentric necrotic arcs that were partial or
complete, but exhibited no distinct external symptoms. The presence of PMTV
in eight 'Shepody' tubers was indicated by positive enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Adgen, Ltd., Auchincruive, Ayr, Scotland) and
confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
'Russet Burbank' potatoes were visually diagnosed, and the corresponding
halves of 128 symptomatic tubers were forwarded to the University of Maine
and APHIS (Beltsville, MD). Of these, ELISA readings in Maine were strongly
positive (>3 x background) for 88, ambiguous (1.5-3 x back-ground) for 13,
and negative for 27. Subsamples from these three categories were positive
by PCR in 17 of 17, 9 of 9, and 12 of 14 cases, respectively. A similar
rating, positive or ambiguous, in ELISA testing was identical for all but
one case at Beltsville.
Confirmation of PMTV required PCR testing, resulting in a characteristic
PCR product of 401 bp that was generated from the coat protein coding
region on RNA 2 (2) using the primer pair PMTV 1 5'-GCAGCCGTCGAGAATAGATA-3'
(RNA nucleotides 316-335) and PMTV 4 5'-GCGAGTTGATGTGCCACATT-3'
(complementary to RNA 2 nucleotides 716-697). An immunocapture RT-PCR using
this primer set and the coating antibody from the Adgen ELISA kit was also
successful in detecting PMTV.
In separate reactions, a second product of 646 bp was generated from the
triple gene block on RNA 3 (4) using the primer pair PMTV 5
5'-GGTGAAGAGGACAAGGT-3' (RNA molecules 1417-1436) and PMTV 7
5'-AACAGTCCGGTCTTGTGAAC-3' (complementary to RNA 3 nucleotides 2063-2044).
The sequence of these products was 98 to 100% identical to PMTV published
sequences.
The discovery of this virus will result in adjustments to U.S. and Canadian
seed potato certification standards and symptom characterization for common
North American cultivars.

[This is the first report of PMTV in Plant Disease, but it is not the first
report of the disease in the USA. The first report was on 8 Aug 2002
followed by several others in the same year. PMTV was found earlier in 2003
in Nova Scotia. - Mod.DH]
