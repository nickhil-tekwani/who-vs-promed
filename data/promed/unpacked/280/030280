Robert,
Please explain how rendering a small fee to the Victoria government is going
to save wildlife given the following:
1. Cats have an approximately 300 metre X 300 metre territory, covering many
domestic dwellings
2. If an owner refuses to put a collar on a cat containing a registration
disk, How is ownership established?
3. What is being done about the vast numbers of feral cats?
4. Perhaps the imminence of a state election in Victoria has something to do
with the announcement. Given that may be the case, what reassurances do we
have about the policing of registrations ie. commitment?
5. Is a registered cat going to stop killing wildlife?
6. How is this going to increase the sense of responsibility of pet owners?
7. Are the funds from registration earmarked for animal conservtion, or will
they disappear into general revenue?
Many people who live in Victoria, probably won't bother to register their
cats as there would appear to be no way to establish ownership
I don't believe this scheme has any chance of working and would welcome a
fuller explanation of how the state government plans to implement it,
especially given that it is normally a local governmant matter.

came in to explain existing British law cocerning animal care & welfare.
One thing that has stuck in my mind is that under British Common Law (with
roots right back to Saxon times & earlier) no one, under law, actually
owned and was responsible for a cat. They were regarded as wild animals that
lived with people, and therefore the "owners" were not responsible if "their"
pet cat killed and ate your chickens. The regular political demands to bell
cats goes back to the Middle Ages and thus the proverb. MH-J ProMED-AHEAD
