Georgia is banning the import of potatoes from Turkey for a 3-month period. Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili has already signed the order, which states that the purpose of the ban is to avoid the spread of potato cancer in Georgia.

[2] Brown rot - Russia ex Egypt

Russia's authorities stopped 2 potato shipments from Egypt that were found to be contaminated with brown rot. The ban has been limited to 2 regions, including Beheira [Al Buhayrah governorate], where these shipments originated. The [Egyptian] Agriculture Ministry confirmed that it would investigate the farms where the shipments originated.

In 2011, the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance [Rosselkhoznadzor] imposed bans on potato shipments, as they were infected with brown rot. The ban was lifted in 2012 on the condition that Russia could check crops before shipment.

Jordan had imposed a ban on Egyptian potatoes in 2016 due to brown rot, this being lifted in October 2017. Egypt is making efforts to encourage farms and factories to adhere to strict observation and controls over vegetable and fruit production.

[Wart disease
------------
Potato wart disease (PW) is caused by the fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_, which is considered one of the most important pathogens of the crop. It is endemic in Europe and has also been reported from a number of locations in the Americas, Australasia, and Africa. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some solanaceous weeds.

On infected tubers, "eyes" develop into characteristic warty, cauliflower-like swellings. If infected early, the whole tuber can be replaced by a warty proliferation. Warts darken with age and eventually rot and disintegrate. Plant vigour is reduced, and both quantity and quality of harvested tubers are severely affected. Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation, as similar symptoms can be caused by other pathogens. The fungus goes through cycles of proliferation and re-infection as long as cool, wet conditions prevail and is, therefore, less damaging in warm, light, well drained soils.

The disease is spread with soil (for example on farm tools), by infected seed tubers and also in manure from animals fed on infected potatoes. The fungus can survive in soil for up to 40 years in the absence of a host. Disease management is based on pathogen exclusion by quarantine regulations and the control of local pathogen spread. Fungicides are ineffective, but some experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to kill resting sporangia (see link below).

There are several pathotypes defined by their virulence on different host cultivars. Potato varieties resistant to a number of them have been developed, but new pathogen strains are emerging, compromising the efficacy of host plant resistance.

In Turkey, potato wart was reported for the 1st time in 2005 (ProMED-mail post 20050406.0990).

Brown rot
---------
Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas). Yield losses are mostly caused by tuber rotting. The pathogen also causes bacterial wilt of tomato, a major disease of the crop, and it can also affect other solanaceous crops.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insect activities), contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed potatoes), soil, and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some weeds and unharvested potato plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation) and limited genetic resistance may be used.

Members of the _R. solanacearum_ complex affect more than 200 plant species including many important crops (for example, causing brown rot of potato). The various races and biovars are active under different climatic conditions and in different hosts.

Both the potato wart and brown rot pathogens have been included on the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).
