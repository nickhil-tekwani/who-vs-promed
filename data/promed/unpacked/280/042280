It is the time of potato planting in Thrimshing [sub-division of Trashigang
district] reputed for its potatoes and chillis. But a local farmer is
without any seed [tubers] to start his plantation after a potato blight and
tuber moth diseases last year [2008] destroyed his crop. "The diseases
hadn't spared much," he said, adding that the [moth] disease hollowed out
the tuber. Agriculture officials had instructed farmers to spray
insecticides before the disease struck but it got the better of most.
The diseases had affected over 250 households in several villages. Farmers
like this local farmer have never needed to buy potato seeds. But this year
they are looking for seeds in other villages unaffected by the diseases.
The villager's chilli crop was also affected in the same year [2008]. Their
chillis withered and fell off the plants before they were ready for
harvest. "We used to dry chillis for sale, but this year there's hardly
enough for ourselves," said another local farmer. "It's difficult to meet
expenses because our sources of income have dried up."
The district agriculture officer, Dendup Tshering, said that agriculture
officials have instructed farmers not to use the same seeds to prevent the
disease. "The disease is seed-borne and they shouldn't use them again.
We've distributed new seeds," he said. He added that the disease was
prevalent in other areas as well. According to him, the chilli disease that
struck was not a new disease and that researchers were working to find an
antidote to it. "Farmers don't follow proper farming methods, which
aggravates the spread of the disease," said the officer.

[Both major leaf blights of potato have been reported from the region.
Early blight (_Alternaria solani_) causes spotting and early senescence of
leaflets, as well as lesions on tubers and yield is reduced. Late blight
(_Phytophthora infestans_) affects both leaves and tubers and may cause
yield losses of up to 75 per cent. This pathogen also affects tomato. The
pathogens are spread with infected plant material (including seed tubers),
by mechanical means, wind, and rain. Management strategies include
fungicide treatments of seed tubers and crops, as well as use of cultivars
with reduced susceptibility. For more information see ProMED-mail post no.
20080107.0091 for early blight, and previous posts and links listed below
for late blight.
It is not specified which potato blight has been diagnosed and either
pathogen may be the disease referred to above. Potato tuber moth
(_Phthorimaea operculella_) and its larvae (tuberworm) are a serious pest
of potato and some other solanaceous species.
The symptoms on chilli (_Capsicum_ species) described above could be due to
a number of different pathogens and it is not clear which disease is
referred to. It appears that this chilli disease is also considered to be
seed-transmitted.
