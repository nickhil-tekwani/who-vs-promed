Fusarium widespread in Kentucky wheat crop
------------------------------------------
During the past week [beginning 25 May 2009], the disease fusarium
head blight [FHB] or "head scab" has appeared at significant levels in
many wheat fields across Kentucky. Depending on the severity, it could
pose potential problems
for many agricultural sectors, said Don Hershman, University of
Kentucky. "There could be more disease development over the next week
or so," he said.

FHB attacks wheat around flowering stage, which is where most of the
state's wheat was when wet weather hit end of April [2009] through
the first week in May. The wet, cloudy conditions likely favored
multiple infection periods, which has resulted in an extended window
for disease development.

FHB is present in Kentucky wheat every year to some extent, but some
years are more severe. The last statewide epidemic was in 1991, but
there have been several lesser epidemics since. This year [2009]
could rival what was seen 18 years ago. "FHB is not quite at 1991
levels, but it's definitely the worst it's been since," Hershman
said. Fungicides only have about a 50 percent FHB suppression rate,
so some treated fields still have a lot of disease. No [suitable]
fungicides were available in 1991.

FHB can cause lower yields and seed weights, but the larger concern
is that the fungus also produces the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON).
Fields with FHB almost always have DON, too. Grain products with DON
levels greater than accepted norms are not suitable for human or
animal consumption.

Wheat producers also are combating stagonospora leaf and glume
blotch, and leaf rust, among other diseases. "Their severity is
notable in many fields for the same reason we are seeing a lot of FHB
-- a wet May," Hershman said. "Even treated fields are showing
increased disease activity as fungicides applied in early May [2009]
begin to wear off."

US cash grain outlook
---------------------
In USDA's [United States Department of Agriculture] report, problems
with the fungal disease fusarium head blight, or head scab, were
reported again in soft red winter [SRW] wheat states because of wet
weather during the flowering stage. The soggy state of Illinois saw
its SRW wheat rating drop 11 percentage points from last week [week
of 25 May 2009] because of head scab.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also called scab) on wheat is caused by
several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_,
accounting for the common name of this disease. Current names of the
fungi are _Gibberella zeae_, _Fusarium poae_, _Monographella nivalis_
var. _nivalis_, and _Microdochium majus_. FHB causes yield losses of
up to 45 percent and reduces the grade of harvested grain. It may
also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins, for example DON (also
called vomitoxin), which can affect stock and may lead to reduced
feed consumption or feed refusal. The total crop may be lost if grain
is rejected because of toxin levels. Disease management includes
timely fungicide applications and crop varieties with reduced
susceptibility.

Stagonospora glume blotch is caused by 2 fungi now classified as
_Phaeosphaeria avenaria_ f.sp. _triticae_ and _Phaeosphaeria
nodorum_. Leaf rust (or brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia recondita_. For more information on all diseases please see
