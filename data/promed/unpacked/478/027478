Spread of Avian Influenza and Migratory Routes?
-----------------------------------------------
It is interesting to note the expansion of the range of avian influenza among
birds in Asia. After being more or less restricted to the Southeast Asian
countries though 2004 and early 2005, this summer has seen it move into avian
populations in northern Asian countries including northwestern China,
Kazakhstan and Siberia.ï¿½
It looks like AI appeared:
- in Quinghai province (China) in mid-April to mid-May 2005
- in neighbouring Xinjiang province (China) in mid-May to mid-June 2005
- in southwestern Siberia in mid-July (18 Jul 2005 1st reported onset)
- in Kazakhstan in mid-July (22 Jul 2005 1st reported onset).
Looking at a map of the region, it is telling that these areas are in a rather
direct north-west line from each other. Moreover, Qinghai province is also in
line with Thailand and Northern Vietnam.
Is it possible that a particular species of migratory bird travels this north-
west route in the spring/summer and could be spreading the virus? We would be
interested to know if there are (local?) experts with knowledge about specific
Asian avian migratory routes who might be able to help pinpoint one or more
avian species that could be spreading the virus. This would be interesting to
know and would contribute to our understanding -- and perhaps to our ability
to control -- these avian influenza outbreaks.

Bird-flu hunters take aim at far-ranging wildfowl
-------------------------------------------------
>From a remote corner of the Tibetan plateau in western China, park ranger He
Yubang finds himself thrust onto the front lines of the global battle against
avian influenza. More than 5000 migratory birds on his nature preserve in
Qinghai province have dropped dead this year in a highly unusual outbreak of
bird flu that has baffled scientists.
The World Health Organization sent a team to investigate in late June 2005,
and it warned that the tens of thousands of wild birds that use the preserve
as a breeding ground during the summer would begin to migrate in September,
potentially spreading the disease around the globe. To track the birds when
they leave, the WHO asked the Chinese government to begin tagging them.
International scientists and Chinese park rangers have only a vague sense of
where the birds go and what routes they fly to get there.
Mr. He says he is trying to comply with the WHO's request, but he and his team
haven't been able to catch a single bird. He has even stayed up until 5 a.m.,
lurking on the shores of the lake where the birds live, hoping to sneak up on
them while they sleep. Whenever he manages to get within a few dozen feet,
though, a bird acting as a sentry alerts the others and they all fly away. "It
seems we have to wait to do it until next year" when hatchlings are unable to
fly, says Mr. He, deputy chief of Qinghai Lake National Conservation Bureau.
But scientists warn that waiting would squander a critical opportunity to
learn more about the way the virus spreads. Though experts can't be sure
migratory birds are responsible for spreading the disease all over Asia, they
are prime suspects, mostly because migratory ducks and possibly other species
have long been suspected of harboring the virus without dying, and they often
mingle with domestic flocks along their migratory routes and may transmit the
virus then.
Hans Wagner, senior animal production and health officer in the Bangkok office
of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, considers migratory
birds one of the principal ways the disease is spread.
The role of migratory birds has come under renewed scrutiny since Russian
officials found bird flu near the Chinese border. Late in July 2005, Russian
health officials confirmed that the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus had
cropped up in the Siberian region of Novosibirsk, killing some 1300 farm birds
in a region about 2000 miles from China's Qinghai Lake. 4 other regions in
Russia also have had outbreaks of the virus, although it isn't clear which
strain was involved. Gennady Onishchenko, Russia's top epidemiologist, blamed
migratory birds for the arrival of avian flu in the country, and now other
Russian health officials are warning that migratory birds could spread the
disease further west.
In one affected part of Siberia, authorities say they will shoot wildfowl to
prevent the disease's spread. Authorities said 4061 wild and domestic fowl
have died of the disease in Russia. Last week the European Commission, the
European Union's executive arm, said it was imposing a ban on imported birds
from Russia and Kazakhstan.
In addition, a team of scientists writing recently in the journal Nature
warned that migratory birds in Qinghai have the potential to spread the
disease well beyond Asia.
The U.S. Agriculture Department, wary of the threat posed by birds migrating
from Asia, has set up an early-warning system in Alaska, testing ducks and
geese that cross the Bering Sea from Asia for bird flu.
Disease experts worry that many of the birds still alive at Qinghai Lake may
be harboring the virus but are asymptomatic, allowing them to continue with
their annual migration. The worst-case scenario is that these birds -- which
can travel thousands of miles, from Scandinavia to Senegal, for instance --
will become the epidemiologic equivalent of intercontinental ballistic
missiles, capable of eluding even the strictest quarantine measures on the
ground.
Still, other experts question how central a role migratory birds play in the
global spread of disease, and some worry that rare species may be slaughtered
unnecessarily. They point to the ground transport of domestic poultry as the
most likely means of spreading the virus.
Nonetheless, many experts agree that more needs to be learned about which
migratory species have a natural immunity to H5N1 and where they fly. "We need
to track these birds," says Jeffrey Gilbert, a WHO infectious-disease
specialist who traveled to Qinghai to see firsthand how local officials were
handling the outbreak.
Birds have been blamed for spreading other deadly diseases, including West
Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis, Nipah virus, salmonella and Lyme disease.
In 1999, for instance, illness in crows in New York and then bald eagles at
the Bronx Zoo presaged a human outbreak of West Nile virus that infected 60.
Birds -- including crows, jays and magpies -- were suspected of spreading that
mosquito-borne illness.
David Swayne, director of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Southeast Poultry
Research Lab, which has been working with scientists at the University of
Alaska in Fairbanks, says that so far none of the some 12 000 samples they
have collected since 1998 have tested positive for the H5N1 strain of the
virus, although low-pathogenic strains of bird flu have been detected.
But even as governments spend millions of dollars on preventive measures,
tracking the birds remains a problem. Back in 1983, when Chinese park rangers
tagged migratory birds that visited Qinghai Lake for a research project, they
used nets, Mr. He says. The tactic worked, but too many birds choked to death
as a result. More than 2 decades later, without nets, the task has proved far
more difficult. [Brazilian ornithologists have had no trouble catching and
banding hundreds of adult shore birds in nylon mist nets on their migration
routes. They do not choke to death as long as the nets are checked frequently
- Mod.JW]
Every year tens of thousands of birds -- mostly bar-headed geese, cormorants
and brown-headed gulls -- flock to one of the 5 islands in the middle of
Qinghai Lake at the heart of the nature preserve. By August, the island is
covered with bird eggs.
The State Forestry Bureau has ordered the team of about 20 rangers to tag some
of the birds and has supplied numbered tags to attach to the birds' feet,
according to Chu Guozhong, director of the bureau's National Bird Tagging
Center. The tagging approach is being used because, at USD 1.23 apiece, the
tags are relatively cheap. But even if the birds could be easily caught and
tagged, Chinese officials would have to rely on bird watchers or agriculture
officials in other countries to spot the tags and report the serial numbers
back to a central office.
Electronic tracking devices can be implanted into a bird's back, but they cost
thousands of dollars a bird, including the price of the receiving station
necessary to monitor the birds' movements. The forestry bureau has asked
China's Finance Ministry for more funding, and that request is pending. "If it
gets approved," Mr. Chu says, "we'll surely find a way to catch the birds."

[HPAI in migratory birds has been recently dealt with by 2 groups of
scientists (papers in June issues of Nature and Science, see 20050714.2006,
20050707.1922). It was indicated that the virus has the potential to be a
global threat, since "lake Qinghaihu is a breeding center for migrating birds
that congregate from Southeast Asia, Siberia, Australia and New Zealand".
However, the said papers concentrated on the virological aspects of the issue.
As Tweed and Galanis state above, the ornithological aspects, particularly
intra-Asian migration patterns of potentially infected wild birds, seem to
require further inquiry. - Mod.AS]
