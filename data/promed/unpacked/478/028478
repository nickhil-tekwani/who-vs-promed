Imported Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis -- United States, 2005
--------------------
Paralytic poliomyelitis is rare in the United States because of the
success of universal childhood immunization and the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative. Poliovirus vaccine was introduced in the
1950s. Since then, the United States has eliminated indigenous wild
poliovirus transmission, controlled imported wild poliovirus cases,
and, through a vaccine policy change (i.e., from live, attenuated
oral polio vaccine [OPV] to inactivated polio vaccine [IPV]),
eliminated vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) cases. The most
recent VAPP case occurred in 1999 (1). The primary risk for paralytic
polio for U.S. residents is through travel to countries where polio
remains endemic or where polio outbreaks are occurring. This report
describes the 1st known occurrence of imported VAPP in an
unvaccinated U.S. adult who traveled abroad, where she likely was
exposed through contact with an infant recently vaccinated with OPV.
This case highlights the previously unrecognized risk for paralytic
polio among unvaccinated persons exposed to OPV during travel abroad.
In March 2005, an Arizona woman aged 22 years contracted paralytic
polio while traveling in Central and South America. She arrived in
Costa Rica on 14 Jan 2005 to participate in a university-sponsored
study-abroad program. During her stay with a local family, she
visited several tourist locations along the Pacific coast in Costa
Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Her last trip before onset of
illness was to an island territory of Colombia during 25-28 Feb. On
March 2, after she returned to the host family's home, she had fever
and general malaise. During the next 24 hours, her symptoms worsened,
and she began to have headache and neck and back pain. On 6 Mar, she
experienced acute leg weakness and was hospitalized locally and soon
transferred to a hospital in San Jose, Costa Rica. On 9 Mar, she was
transported by air to Phoenix, Arizona, for further evaluation.
Upon admission to a hospital in Phoenix, the patient had bilateral
areflexic lower extremity weakness and respiratory failure requiring
intubation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies on 9 Mar revealed
lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein (89 mg/dL), and normal
glucose levels (53 mg/dL). The patient was initially treated for an
acute peripheral demyelinating process, such as Guillain-Barre
Syndrome (GBS), with corticosteroids and plasmapheresis.
Electrodiagnostic studies, however, displayed reduced compound muscle
action potentials, normal sensory nerve action potentials, and
widespread denervation, consistent with a severe, asymmetric process
involving anterior horn cells or motor axons. Magnetic resonance
imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine demonstrated signal
abnormality in the anterior cord, indicative of anterior horn-cell
involvement. Serologic results for antibodies specific for West Nile
and dengue viruses were negative. Stool specimens were collected on
20 Mar and sent to the CDC polio reference laboratory. The specimens
were positive for Sabin-strain poliovirus types 2 and 3; no other
enteroviruses were identified. The results of serologic tests for all
3 serotypes were greater than 1:10 for both acute and convalescent
specimens. During the course of hospitalization, the patient
recovered respiratory function, was transferred to a rehabilitation
center for physical and occupational therapy, and was eventually
discharged home for outpatient therapy. 60 days after the onset of
weakness, she had residual weakness in both legs.
The patient had never been vaccinated with either OPV or IPV because
of a religious exemption. The Costa Rican family with whom she lived
consisted of a mother, father, and daughter with no young children.
The host family's son and daughter-in-law lived next door with 2
children, aged 2 months and 3 years, who visited the host family
frequently. The infant received his first dose of OPV on 19 Jan 2005,
4 days after the woman arrived to live with the host family.
Vaccination records indicated that both children were up-to-date for
all other routine vaccinations. The patient had no known or reported
exposure to young children during her 3-day trip to Colombia. She had
no underlying medical or immune-compromising conditions.
MMWR Editorial Note:
This report describes the 1st case of paralytic poliomyelitis
identified in the United States since 1999 and the 1st imported VAPP
case ever documented in the United States (1). Although the patient
initially had a working diagnosis of an acute peripheral
demyelinating process, the clinical history, physical findings, and
laboratory studies are typical for paralytic polio and inconsistent
with GBS, transverse myelitis, or other forms of acute flaccid
paralysis (2). The patient's only known exposure to OPV was through
contact with the infant grandchild of her host family. The date of
the patient's onset of illness in relation to OPV vaccination and her
presumed contacts with the infant are within the expected ranges for
contact VAPP cases (4-75 days and less than 30 days, respectively)
(3). The poliovirus antibody titers, uniformly high on both acute and
convalescent serum specimens, are inconclusive. However, the
isolation of Sabin-strain polioviruses types 2 and 3 from a stool
specimen and absence of isolation or serologic evidence for infection
with another agent known to cause polio-like symptoms (e.g., West
Nile virus or enterovirus 71) is consistent with VAPP (2). A panel of
polio experts convened by CDC confirmed this case to be paralytic
polio on the basis of standard clinical evidence, and the case was
classified as imported VAPP with onset of illness within 30 days
before entry into the United States, in accordance with CDC protocol (3).
Cases of paralytic polio are now rare in the United States because of
the success of the U.S. childhood immunization program and the Global
Polio Eradication Initiative. In the United States, the most recent
cases of paralytic polio caused by indigenous and imported wild
polioviruses occurred in 1979 and 1993, respectively (1). From the
early 1960s, when trivalent OPV became the vaccine of choice for the
childhood immunization program, to the mid-1990s, approximately eight
to 10 VAPP cases occurred annually (1). Most VAPP cases occurred in
OPV recipients rather than among their contacts. In the United States
in the 1990s, cases of contact VAPP occurred at a rate of one case
per 13 million doses of OPV distributed (1). To reduce the risk for
VAPP, the United States changed to a sequential IPV/OPV schedule in
1997 and then to an all-IPV schedule in 2000 (4). This policy change
resulted in elimination of VAPP in the United States, with the most
recent case of VAPP, before this report, occurring in 1999 (1). High
coverage rates for poliovirus vaccination have been maintained among
children aged 19-35 months with the transition from OPV to IPV. In
2004, approximately 92 percent of children in this age group received
3 doses of IPV as part of the routine infant and child immunization
schedule (5). Coverage levels greater than 95 percent are reached
after school entry, although the majority of states allow
philosophical or religious exemptions (6).
Despite high vaccination coverage, another OPV-associated risk was
identified recently in the United States. In September 2005, an
unvaccinated, immunocompromised infant was found to be infected with
a vaccine-derived poliovirus, presumably originating outside the
United States in a country that uses OPV (7). Upon further
investigation, 4 other children in 2 other families in the same
small, rural community were found to be asymptomatic carriers of the
virus. No cases of paralysis have been associated with circulation of
this virus in the community.
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has successfully reduced the
burden of paralytic polio globally and the threat of imported polio
in the United States. In 1988, when the initiative began, 125
countries reported cases of paralytic polio (8). At the end of 2004,
6 countries had endemic polio (Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Niger,
Nigeria, and Pakistan) and transmission had been reestablished in 6
countries (Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote
d'Ivoire, Mali, and Sudan) (8). The Americas were certified polio
free in 1994, with the most recent reported case occurring in Peru in 1991 (9).
For protection against polio, all infants and children in the United
States, regardless of travel status, should receive 4 doses of IPV at
ages 2, 4, and 6-18 months and 4-6 years (4). If accelerated
protection is needed, the minimum interval between doses is 4 weeks,
although the preferred interval between the 2nd and 3rd dose is 2
months. The minimum age for IPV administration is 6 weeks. Infants
and children who have begun receiving the poliovirus vaccination
series with 1 or more doses of OPV should receive IPV to complete the
series (4).
Because of the minimal risk for exposure to polioviruses and because
most adults are immune as a result of vaccination during childhood,
routine poliovirus vaccination of adults (i.e., persons aged >18
years) residing in the United States is recommended only for certain
adult groups who are at increased risk for exposure to polioviruses
(4). Adults who are traveling to areas where polio is still epidemic
or endemic and who are unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or
whose vaccination status is unknown should receive IPV (4). 2 doses
of IPV should be administered at intervals of 4-8 weeks; a 3rd dose
should be administered 6-12 months after the 2nd. If 3 doses of IPV
cannot be administered within the recommended intervals before
protection is needed, the following alternatives are recommended:
- If more than 8 weeks are available before protection is needed, 3
doses of IPV should be administered at least 4 weeks apart.
- If fewer than 8 weeks but more than 4 weeks are available before
protection is needed, 2 doses of IPV should be administered at least
4 weeks apart.
- If fewer than 4 weeks are available before protection is needed, a
single dose of IPV is recommended (4).
Adults who are traveling to areas where polio cases are occurring and
who have received a primary series with either IPV or OPV should
receive another dose of IPV before departure. According to available
data, adults do not need more than a single lifetime booster dose with IPV (4).
In 2004, approximately 25 million U.S. residents traveled abroad to
OPV-using countries in Central and South America, Asia, Africa, and
Europe (10). Before the case described in this report, the risk for
VAPP in an unvaccinated traveler to an OPV-using country with no wild
poliovirus transmission was considered negligible. However, this case
indicates that the risk for VAPP, although low, is not zero. Overall,
the risk for paralytic disease in a traveler is much greater in a
polio-endemic country or outbreak country (e.g., Nigeria) than in an
OPV-using country that is free from wild poliovirus, although this
increase in risk is difficult to quantify.
Polio among travelers is preventable. Travelers to countries where
polio is endemic or where outbreaks are occurring should be made
aware of the risk for acquiring paralytic polio in those countries
and be vaccinated in accordance with current recommendations (4).
Health-care providers assessing vaccine needs for unvaccinated adults
traveling to countries that use OPV should be aware of the risk that
OPV might pose to such travelers and should consider offering them
polio vaccination. At least 4-6 weeks before departure, international
travelers should contact travel medicine providers to obtain
vaccinations and prophylactic medications. Providers should assess
the need for itinerary-specific vaccines and ensure that travelers
are up-to-date on all routine vaccinations, including polio
vaccination. Information on vaccination requirements for
international travelers is available from the CDC publication, Health
Information for International Travel, 2005--2006

[As stated in the MMWR editorial comment above, this is now the 2nd
documented occurrence of imported vaccine-associated poliovirus in
the USA. In the 1st occurrence (see ProMED-mail references below,
and as mentioned in the commentary above), while vaccine-associated
poliovirus infections were documented in children from a community
that refuses vaccination based on religious objections, these
infections were not associated with paralytic disease. However, they
were in children with no history of foreign travel, and in one infant
with an immunodeficiency, where a chronic infection with the vaccine
virus might ultimately result in a reversion in neurovirulence of the
vaccine virus involved in the infection.
In this 2nd occurrence, the outcome was unfortunately associated with
neurologic disease, reminiscent of the era when OPV was the vaccine
of choice in the USA, and when the only cases seen in the USA were
vaccine-associated cases.
It would be of interest to know if other countries that use IPV
exclusively have seen imported cases of vaccine-associated
poliomyelitis; this would help to further understand the order of
magnitude of risk in this environment, and understand if such cases
may be categorized as 'emerging infectious diseases' associated with
travel in the global village in which we all reside. - Mod.MPP]
