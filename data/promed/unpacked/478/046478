A deadly tick-borne disease has struck Xinyang City in central China's
Henan Province. The hospital is overcrowded with patients ... Media
workers have urged city authorities to disclose details of the
epidemic.

A tick-bitten villager from Shangcheng County died at China's No. 154
People's Liberation Army Hospital on 31 Jul 2012 after his family
borrowed more than 80 000 yuan (USD$12,500) for treatment. The
hospital is dedicated to tick-borne disease treatment, and has been
overcrowded with inpatients.

During Ye's hospitalization, relatives kept updating his condition on
the Internet with microblogs, such as: "Ye has been in a coma for
several days. High fever persists. His life signs keep weakening. The
accumulated medical expense is skyrocketing! Every day, there are
tick-bitten people arriving at the No. 154 People's Liberation Army
Hospital in Xinyang City..."

Another microblog reads: "In Qilichong Village alone, 7 people have
died. The hospital is now jam-packed with tick-bitten patients. The
situation is urgent. More people are likely to become victims...
Residents' health and lives are seriously threatened."

A physician interviewed by The Epoch Times admitted that the number of
tick-bitten patients has increased quite a bit. When asked about Ye's
case, he 1st tried to evade the question, but after repetitive
inquiries he said Ye "had a high fever for 5 days before being sent to
the hospital, and he died after being discharged from the hospital."

Amid grief and indignation, Ye's family said that villagers cannot
afford the treatment for tick bites, and they were forced to borrow
money for Ye's treatment after using up all their savings.

The outbreak has not been reported by any medical organizations or
government officials. The Epoch Times made several phone calls to the
Disease Control Center of Xinyang City and Shangcheng County, but
nobody answered. A clerk at the Wanggang Village Health Center said
his superiors wouldn't let him say too much.

Xinyang City has been hit by tick-borne disease in recent years. Last
year [2011], the No. 154 People's Liberation Army Hospital was also
overcrowded with patients who had contracted the disease. A physician
told The Epoch Times that there were 4 deaths among the patients of
one doctor alone. But the doctor in charge of the emergency room said
that the actual death toll was confidential and should not be revealed
to outsiders.

[The etiological agent in these cases may be Severe Fever with
Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) virus, a newly identified member of
the genus phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family (see ProMED-mail
archive no. 20110317.0853). SFTS virus has been isolated from blood of
2 patients and from _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ ticks collected from
dogs. The virus is present in Henan province and in at least 5 other
provinces; in 2010, the presence of the virus was confirmed in 171
patients from 6 provinces in China. It resulted in at least 36 deaths
by September 2010. Major clinical symptoms in these patients included
fever, thrombocytopenia [low blood platelet count causing slower
clotting], gastrointestinal symptoms, and leukocytopenia [decrease in
the number of white blood cells in the blood, placing individuals at
increased risk of infection], and there was a high initial case
fatality rate of 30 per cent. One hopes that there will be a
diagnosis of the etiological agent involved in the current cases, and
that it will become available publicly.
