The Deadly Chytrid Fungus: A Story of an Emerging Pathogen
----------------------------------------------------------
Emerging infectious diseases present a great
challenge for the health of both humans and
wildlife. The increasing prevalence of
drug-resistant fungal pathogens in humans [1] and
recent outbreaks of novel fungal pathogens in
wildlife populations [2] underscore the need to
better understand the origins and mechanisms of
fungal pathogenicity. One of the most dramatic
examples of fungal impacts on vertebrate
populations is the effect of the amphibian
disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the chytrid
fungus _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ (_Bd_).

Amphibians around the world are experiencing
unprecedented population losses and local
extinctions [3]. While there are multiple causes
of amphibian declines, many catastrophic die-offs
are attributed to _Bd_ [4],[5]. The chytrid
pathogen has been documented in hundreds of
amphibian species, and reports of __Bd__'s impact
on additional species and in additional
geographic regions are accumulating at an
alarming rate (e.g., see
<http://www.spatialepidemiology.net/bd>). _Bd_ is
a microbial, aquatic fungus with distinct life
stages. The motile stage, called a zoospore,
swims using a flagellum and initiates the colonization of frog skin.

Within the host epidermal cells, a zoospore forms
a spherical thallus, which matures and produces
new zoospores by dividing asexually, renewing the
cycle of infection when zoospores are released to
the skin surface [Figure 1 -- see the original
article at the Source URL for figures]. _Bd_ is
considered an emerging pathogen, discovered and
described only a decade ago [6],[7]. Despite
intensive ecological study of _Bd_ over the last
decade, a number of unanswered questions remain.
Here we summarize what has been recently learned about this lethal pathogen.

_Bd_ is a member of a basal group of fungi, the
Chytridiomycota, and is the only known member of
its order (the Rhizophydiales) to parasitize
vertebrates. _Bd_ is phylogenetically distant
from any of the other ~1000 chytrid species [8],
and the lack of close relatives capable of
parasitizing vertebrates suggests that _Bd_
pathogenicity evolved relatively recently.
Further, population genetic data on _Bd_ isolates
collected from different amphibian populations
around the world suggest that _Bd_ is a recently
spread pathogen rather than being endemic with
altered relationships with hosts due to environmental change [9],[10].

Africa was initially proposed as the geographic
origin because the earliest evidence of _Bd_ is
from skin samples from African clawed frogs
(_Xenopus laevis_) collected in 1938. African
clawed frogs were traded globally for decades
(from the 1930s-1960s) for pregnancy assays in
humans [11]. Although based on a small sample
size, recent population genetic work shows
reduced genetic diversity of isolates from
African clawed frogs and, instead, high allelic
diversity in North American isolates collected
from bullfrogs (_Rana catesbeiana_) [10],[12].
Although additional genetic work is needed, these
studies suggest that _Bd_'s origin may not be in Africa.

Anthropogenic spread of _Bd_ is a plausible
explanation for at least some introductions
[11],[13]. Some amphibian species that are traded
globally may serve as disease reservoirs because
they can carry _Bd_ infections without morbidity.
A number of mysteries remain about how _Bd_ has
dispersed to and persisted in remote pristine
environments where anthropogenic introduction is
unlikely. If _Bd_ can survive independently of
amphibian hosts, it must use non-amphibian
organic materials as nutrient resources. Although
_Bd_ DNA has been detected in water bodies [14]
and on rocks [15], conclusive evidence of _Bd_
persistence in the environment is lacking.

In infected amphibians, _Bd_ is found in the
cells of the epidermis and pathological
abnormalities include a thickening of the outer
layer of skin [6]. Cutaneous fungal infections in
other vertebrates are not typically lethal, but
amphibian skin is unique because it is
physiologically active, tightly regulating the
exchange of respiratory gases, water, and
electrolytes. Thus, the physiological importance
of the skin makes amphibians particularly
vulnerable to skin infections. It has been
hypothesized that _Bd_ disrupts normal regulatory
functioning of frog skin, and evidence suggests
that electrolyte depletion and osmotic imbalance
that occurs in amphibians with severe
chytridiomycosis are sufficient to cause mortality [16],[17].

The molecular factors influencing _Bd_
pathogenicity and virulence have yet to be
conclusively identified. Some evidence suggests
that _Bd_ enzymatic activity directly influences
pathogenesis. The initial penetration of _Bd_
into amphibian epidermal cells likely requires
digestive enzymes. In culture, _Bd_ secretes
extracellular proteases that degrade casein and
gelatin [18],[19]. At the molecular level,
genomic research into _Bd_ is revealing
intriguing expression patterns in genes such as
those for serine protease and fungalysin
metallopeptidase [20], 2 gene families involved
in pathogenesis in other fungal pathogens. Full
genomes of 2 _Bd_ isolates have recently been
sequenced, providing new resources for the study
of molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity [21].

Several studies have shown variation in virulence
among _Bd_ isolates. In experimental infections,
differences in frog survival have been observed
when exposed to different _Bd_ isolates (e.g.,
[22],[23]). Initial proteomic work suggests that
_Bd_ isolates differ in their proteome profiles
[23]. However, controlled infection experiments
with reciprocal host isolate treatments and
paired genomic and proteomic studies are
necessary to identify the functional determinants of _Bd_ virulence.

Species, populations, and individuals vary widely
in susceptibility to chytridiomycosis. Mortality
rates in laboratory infection experiments can
range from 0 percent to 100 percent, depending on
the species (e.g., [22],[24]), age of animals
[25], and temperature regime [26]. In the wild,
some species and populations are extirpated while
others, those that survive initial declines,
persist with various levels of infection (e.g., [27],[28]).

While the disease dynamics are undoubtedly
influenced by local environmental conditions,
particularly temperature, inherent differences in
host susceptibility and behavior are also
important. Colonization by _Bd_ and subsequent
disease development may be influenced by host
defense mechanisms, such as secretions of
antimicrobial peptides [29] or bacterial
commensals with anti-fungal properties [30]. Some
species-specific behavioral characteristics such
as microhabitat selection, basking, aggregating
in retreat sites, or association with water
bodies may also affect the likelihood of infection and disease [31],[32].

Despite many gaps in our understanding of
chytridiomycosis, we are beginning to unravel
important elements of this lethal disease and
make progress towards amphibian conservation.
Multiple conservation strategies have been
proposed and are currently being implemented to
mitigate the threat of chytridiomycosis. These
plans include efforts to limit the spread of the
disease, invest in captive breeding programs for
highly vulnerable amphibians, and advance basic disease research.

Continued research on the biology of both the
host and the pathogen is necessary, and efforts
to catalog and preserve the _Bd_ isolates for
ongoing research are particularly important (see
<http://www.spatialepidemiology.net/bd/> and
<http://www.bdbank.org/>, [33]). The conservation
challenges we face with chytridiomycosis -- and
other emerging pathogens -- are best confronted
by increasing our knowledge of disease processes
from both host and pathogen perspectives.
