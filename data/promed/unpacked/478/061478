NATIONAL DISEASE BULLETINS: SURVEY
*************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>

ProMED-mail is updating the links on the new website at the URL
above. We presently have links to the following national disease
bulletins:
Australia Communicable Diseases
Canada Communicable Disease Report - CCDR
Costa Rica: Reportes Vigilancia Epidemiologica Centroamerica
Denmark: EPI-News
Finland: National Public Health Institute Monthly Bulletin
France: Bulletin epidemiologique sanitaire
Mexico: Sistema Sectorial de Salud Epidemiologic bulletin
UK: Communicable Disease Report - CDR Weekly
US: CDC Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Reports
We are sure that there are many more, both online & off. For
example, Hungary has EpInfo (in Hungarian, paper edition only).
You will note that these are all bulletins on human diseases.
**********************************
We are also looking for bulletins on animal (livestock, wild &
captive) & plant diseases.
**********************************
We would be grateful for information about other national disease
bulletins, together with their URLs if online, or their contact
information if not online.
