Two Hemorrhagic Fever Deaths In Pakistan
-----------------------------------------
KARACHI: A patient from Baluchistan, and a male nursing assistant attending
the patient, died on Fri 3 Nov 2000 in the Aga Khan Private Hospital. The
disease was confirmed as Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) after blood
samples were sent to the Centers for Disease Control in the United States.
CCHF was first detected in Crimea in 1944 and again in Congo in 1956. [It
is classified in the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_ and is
unrelated to the virus currently responsible for the outbreak of
hemorrhagic fever in Uganda. CCHF virus is usually transmitted by ticks; it
is extremely contagious and can be passed on by contact with the blood and
other body fluids of a victim. Victims usually die within 2 weeks of
infection, with initial symptoms including headaches, fevers and vomiting.
In its advanced stages patients may suffer from massive internal
hemorrhaging, vomiting and defecating blood, bleeding into the skin and
from the nose, urinary tract and gums.
Provincial health department sources said government hospitals have been
asked to take extra care with patients coming from Baluchistan, which
borders Afghanistan and Iran. More than 15 people are believed to have died
from the disease in western Afghanistan since May, raising concern that it
could spread to the city of Herat. The WHO flew a special team to
Afghanistan in June to investigate the outbreak and help local hospitals
lower the risk of infection. CCHF has been found elsewhere in Asia and the
Middle East. Its last outbreaks were in Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1998,
according to the WHO.
