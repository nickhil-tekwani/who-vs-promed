As medical epidemiologist at the Institut de Veille Sanitaire, Paris,
France, I propose to post some information about the Chikungunya outbreak
on Reunion Island:
From 28 Mar to 19 May 2005, 465 cases of Chikungunya were registered on
Reunion, a French territory of 700 000 inhabitants in the Indian Ocean. 9
of the cases have been serologically confirmed. The virus has been
circulating in the area since January 2005 and more than 4000 cases had
been reported for Comoros islands at the time the outbreak started on Reunion.
Surveillance is based on a network of general practitioners. Once a case is
reported, active search for other cases is carried out in neighbouring
households. Most cases occurred in the main cities (Saint-Denis, Le Port
and Saint-Pierre). Reported symptoms included fever (99 percent),
arthralgia (98 percent), myalgia (97 percent), headache (81 percent), skin
rash (49 percent), digestive or respiratory signs, and moderate
haemorrhages (17 percent).
Measures are currently taken to control and prevent the spread of this
outbreak. Vector control activities have been strengthened, and information
[regarding the prevention of] mosquito bites has been [distributed] in the
population.

[This is indeed a valuable report from Dr Isabelle Quatresous for
confirmation of the outbreaks on Reunion. Chikungunya outbreaks have been
increasingly discovered in the offshore islands southeast of Africa and in
the close vicinity of Madagascar, including Comoros, Mauritius, and
Reunion. Since the beginning of 2003, Chikungunya epidemics have seemed to
move from Eastern Java towards the east coast of Africa. In particular, we
have seen a sudden surge of Chikungunya outbreaks in these islands since
January of 2005 or the end of 2004 -- after the tsunami of last 26 Dec
2004. However, this could be simply a coincidence.
ProMED would appreciate further information on the outbreaks of Chikungunya
or dengue-like or O'nyong-nyong-like fever around the Indian Ocean. - Mod.RY]
