The article [quoted states that there is no vaccine available to vaccinate
humans.
There is an EEE vaccine prepared by The Salk Institute, Govt. Services
Division, available through the CDC as an IND product for laboratory
workers, military and other [similarly at-risk personnel. The inventory is
stockpiled for USAMRIID (Ft. Detrick) at McKesson Bioservices, Rockville,
MD. Physicians need to request a supply on a case-by-case basis through
CDC.

[The original said, "No vaccine is available for humans, but horses and emus
can be immunized ...". As one who has had that vaccine and who considers
himself human, I thought to comment about this but hesitated because of the
word "available"; "...generally available" would have been a better term.
We are grateful to Ron Arndt for pointing out that there is such a
vaccine. - Mod CHC
