Pertussis in the Netherlands: an Outbreak Despite High Levels of
Immunization with Whole-Cell Vaccine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1996, a sudden increase in pertussis incidence was reported
in the Netherlands (2.1 per 100,000 in 1995, 18 per 100,000 in
1996). Although not all potential surveillance artifacts could
be excluded, it is highly probable that the data reflect a true
outbreak. However, the cause of this increase has not yet been
determined. Further research is directed to the severity of
disease and a possible mismatch between the vaccine and the
circulating Bordetella strains.
[Excerpts]
In 1996, 2,771 cases of pertussis were reported to the Inspectorate of
Health in the Netherlands (population 15 million), compared with 319 cases
in 1995. With epidemic cycles expected every 3 to 5 years and a recent
outbreak in 1994, this rise was unexpected (1). After the introduction of
pertussis immunization with a whole-cell vaccine in the National
Immunization Program (1952), the incidence of pertussis in the Netherlands
decreased significantly. Children are immunized at ages 3, 4, 5, and 11
months with a diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and inactivated polio vaccine
(DTP-IPV), and vaccine coverage for pertussis, for at least three
immunizations, is 96% at the age of 12 months. Until the 1980s, the
incidence of pertussis seemed very low, because only incidental cases were
reported. However, in the last two decades, pertussis has been endemic, and
epidemic peaks have appeared......
Although not all potential surveillance artifacts could be excluded, it is
highly probable that the surveillance data reflect a true pertussis
outbreak. The outbreak could have been caused by 1) decrease in vaccination
coverage, 2) decrease in vaccine quality, 3) interference with other
vaccines, 4) changes in circulating strains of B. pertussis that are not
covered by vaccine-induced immunity, or 5) a combination of these factors.
A decrease in vaccination coverage has not been observed in the (accurate)
reporting system. The whole-cell vaccine used was produced in the National
Institute of Public Health and the Environment and meets international
standards. There was no sign of a gradual deterioration of vaccine quality
as determined for product release by the mouse protection test......
Molecular typing of B. pertussis isolates collected since 1945 indicated a
shift in population structure, possibly due to the introduction of
whole-cell vaccine (5). Further, antigenic variants of B. pertussis
distinct from the strains incorporated in the vaccine appear to have
emerged (6). It might be possible that circulating strains of B. pertussis
have become less sensitive to vaccine-induced immunity. The abrupt increase
in the proportion of vaccinated patients reported in all age groups
suggests such a change.
Data from other countries in Europe indicate that the pertussis epidemic is
restricted to the Netherlands. However, a resurgence of pertussis has been
noted in the United States since the late 1980s and in Canada since 1991.
No single factor has been found to explain this resurgence (7-10).....
A prospective study is being considered to assess efficacy of the
whole-cell vaccine, including differentiation of severity of illness and
number of immunizations received, if the outbreak continues. Cooperative
studies to determine the distribution of restriction fragment length
polymorphism types and antigenic variants of B. pertussis in various
countries in Europe, Asia, and North America are under way. Also, the
immunogenicity of the Dutch whole-cell vaccine is being assessed: whether
it has changed over time and how it compares to published immunogenicity
data of whole-cell vaccines with known, prospectively determined, vaccine
efficacy (11).
In conclusion, in the Netherlands a sudden increase of pertussis
notification has been observed, which seems to reflect a true increase in
incidence. Nevertheless, the cause of this increase has not been
definitively determined. A possible mismatch between the vaccine and the
circulating Bordetella strains is being investigated.
