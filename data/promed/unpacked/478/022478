It is interesting to note that _Serratia marcescens_ (known to be
saprophytic, harmlessly epiphytic on, or endophytic in plants, used as a
plant disease biocontrol agent, sometimes even pathogenic on humans and
insects) has recently been implicated in a new / emerging plant disease,
cucurbit yellow vine disease. [Plant Disease 2001; 85: 1031, Phytopathology
2000; 90: S63].
In this disease, the bacterial pathogen resides in the plant's phloem, a
rather unusual place for phytopathogenic bacteria to lodge. For some time
after this disease was first described in Texas and Oklahoma in 1988, the
pathogen was thought to be a fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium related
to the citrus greening pathogen in the genus _Liberobacter_, which is
transmitted by the citrus psyllid _Diaphorina citri_.
Phloem-feeding insect vectors are suspected of being involved in cucurbit
yellow vine pathogen dispersal, but to my knowledge, no vector has been
proven to date.

[The squash bug (_Anasa tristis_) is the primary carrier (vector) of a
gamma-3 proteobacterium that is associated with cucurbit yellow vine
disease (CYVD) in canteloupe, squash, watermelon and pumpkin, according to
a press release by the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research
Service on 20 Sep 2001 that describes work by scientists at the South
Central Agricultural Research Laboratory, Lane, OK, Oklahoma State
University, Stillwater, and Texas A&M University, Stephenville. Notably,
the disease has not been observed in cucumber.
More than 20 plant diseases are associated with or known to be caused by
these bacteria-like organisms (BLOs), which range in size from 0.25 to 0.5
by 0.8 to 4.0 micrometers. Transmission electron microscopy showed bacteria
in 20 of 20 phloem sieve tubes of CYVD infected watermelon, but none was
observed in healthy plants. _Serratia marcescens_ and _S. plymuthica_ have
been reported as endophytic bacteria in the phloem of root and stem tissues
of sweet corn and cotton. Infected cucurbits express stunting and yellowing
at 7 to 10 days before harvest, which is followed by rapid collapse and
death of vines. Crop losses in cucurbits can reach 100 per cent.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using a primer pair based on sequences in
the citrus-greening BLO, amplified a 0.15-kb fragment from DNA of
symptomatic cucurbits but not from asymptomatic plants. Its nucleotide
sequence suggested that the amplified DNA was from a prokaryotic organism.
A primer pair, designed to amplify prokaryotic 16S rDNA, amplified a 1.5-kb
fragment in both symptomatic and asymptomatic plants. The one from
asymptomatic plants corresponded to chloroplast 16S rDNA while the band
from symptomatic plants was composed of 16S rDNAs from both chloroplasts
and a prokaryote. The nucleotide sequence of the prokaryotic DNA was
determined and used to design 3 primers (YV1, YV2, and YV3). Fragments of
0.64 and 1.43 kb were amplified with primers YV1-YV2 and YV1-YV3,
respectively, from symptomatic plants but not from fragments from
asymptomatic plants, unrelated bacteria or selected fungal pathogens of
cucurbits. The 16S rDNA associated with the prokaryote is closely related
to that of _S. marcescens_ but only distantly related to the
citrus-greening BLO. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the prokaryote is
a gamma-3 proteobacterium. The consistent association of the 0.64- and
1.43-kb fragments with symptomatic, but not asymptomatic, plants suggests
that the proteobacterium may be the causal agent of CYDV in cantaloupe,
squash, and watermelon.
CYVD, first observed in Oklahoma and Texas, has now been confirmed to be
present in Tennessee and Massachusetts. Because the disease is often
misdiagnosed, use of the more specific PCR assay may reveal additional
outbreaks in the United States and perhaps elsewhere. - Mod.DH]
