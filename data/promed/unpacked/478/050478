AIDS Pandemic Racing Faster Than Means To Stop It
-------------------------------------------------
Money available to fight AIDS has soared to an all-time high of US$8
billion but the pandemic is racing faster than the means to stop it,
especially among women and girls, says a report prepared for a high-level
U.N. forum on Thu 2 Jun 2005.
"AIDS unleashes a chain of events that threatens to cause entire societies
to unravel," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in the report. "In
short, AIDS is an exceptional problem which demands an exceptional
response." More than 120 delegates are scheduled to address the all-day
meeting, many of them ministers or their deputies, to assess progress since
a 2001 special U.N. General Assembly session on HIV/AIDS.
Programs have succeeded in Brazil, which has the most successful AIDS
program among developing nations. Cambodia and Thailand have shown
substantial progress and several African nations as well as the Bahamas
have slowed the rate of infection, says the report Annan submitted to
delegates.
But only 12 percent of those who need treatment are receiving it. Effective
prevention programs, counseling and testing services are the exception to
the rule and drugs still cost too much, the report said. And despite the
many programs and money spent, the epidemic has not been reversed. The 4.9
million infections and 3.1 million AIDS deaths in 2004 were the highest to
date, Annan said. Some of the worst predictions have come to pass. Nearly
half of the estimated 39.4 million people living with HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, are women and girls, whether married or single, promiscuous or
faithful.
"The trend is that more young women are being infected than young men,"
Thoraya Obeid, the head of the U.N. Population Fund, told a news conference
on Wed 1 Jun 2006. "If they are married, they can't abstain. They are
faithful but the husband is not faithful," Obeid said. Women, she said,
need information, including how to use a female condom to protect themselves.
Men and women between 15 and 24 years old are the hardest hit by the
pandemic. Obeid released a survey done by young people in a dozen
countries, most of whom said they had no voice in their nation's AIDS
policies. Others said programs needed to be comprehensive -- abstinence and
sex education, young people talking to other adolescents as well as to
intravenous drug users.
The world's largest donor for fighting AIDS is the United States, which
spent $2.4 billion last year. But it is being pressured by conservative
religious groups toward abstinence-only programs and away from vulnerable
groups like prostitutes, homosexuals and drug addicts. Included in the U.S.
contribution is some $450 million, or 1/3 of the budget of the Global Fund
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria -- a powerful independent
organization of governments, business and private groups, first proposed by
Annan 4 years ago. The new head of the group's policy and strategy
committee is Randall Tobias, who runs the Bush administration's AIDS
program. Some officials are worried that the fund will adopt U.S.
positions, but others say such fears are groundless.
Worldwide, the U.N. report says, some $8 billion will be available in 2005
to implement programs in 135 low- and middle-income countries, a dramatic
23 percent increase over the previous year. Of this amount, rich countries
have contributed some $6.7 billion, 6 times greater than the world spent in
2001

[ProMED-mail does not normally post reports on HIV and AIDS, nonetheless
occasionally it is necessary to put events and emerging diseases into
perspective. One consequence of the hysteria generated by the possibility
of a novel pandemic of human influenza arising in East Asia has been that 4
human fatal cases of avian influenza in Cambodia and 12 in Thailand have
featured repeatedly in reports from that region -- to the exclusion of
information that among developing countries both Cambodia and Thailand
(together with Brazil) have made significant progress in the control of
HIV/AIDS. - Mod.CP]
