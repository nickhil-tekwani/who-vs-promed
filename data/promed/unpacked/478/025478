An outbreak of anthrax has reportedly killed several animals in [Mamund] and Salarzai tehsils [sub districts] of Bajaur Agency [Federally Administered Tribal Areas, FATA], local people and officials said on [Tue 22 Aug 2017]. They said at least 26 cattle heads had been killed and several others infected by the disease in the 2 mountainous subdivisions. The locals said the disease had spread fear and panic among them.

Meanwhile, sources in the local livestock department confirmed the death of cattle due to the outbreak of anthrax. They said teams had been dispatched to the affected areas to administer anti-anthrax vaccines to animals.

For a description of Bajaur, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajaur_Agency Bajaur is on the NE border of Pakistan with Afghanistan. "Bajaur is inhabited almost exclusively by Tarkani (Tarkalani) Pashtuns, and there are their main sub-tribes in Bajaur: Utman Khel, Tarkalanri, Mamund (Kakazai, Wur, and Salarzai) as well as a small population of Safis. The Utman Khel are at the south east of Bajaur, while Mamund are at the south west, and the Tarkani are at the north of Bajaur. Its border with Afghanistan's Kunar province makes it of strategic importance to Pakistan and the region."

In June 2017, the veterinary service was vaccinating livestock in Toda Cheena area of central Kurram Agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, in response to a suspected outbreak of anthrax; see 11 Jun 2017 Anthrax - Pakistan (02): (TA) livestock vaccinated 20170611.5098784. This was well received by the locals and that experience will have aided the reporting of cattle deaths in the Mamond and Salarzai sub districts. Now that they are acquiring information on affected areas the veterinary service can start planning to proactively vaccinate cattle in these areas next year [2018], in advance of the "anthrax season". - Mod.MHJ]
