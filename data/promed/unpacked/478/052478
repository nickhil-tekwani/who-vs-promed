Growers and researchers in Yuma County are scrambling to find a way
to contain a virus that strikes melons and caused the loss of an
estimated 50 percent to 75 percent of the fall crop.
The virus -- _Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus_, or CYSDV --
first appeared in Yuma in the fall [2006]. It attacks all types of
melons, plus squash, gourds, and cucumbers.
CYSDV symptoms develop first on older leaves and the plant appears to
need water. The leaves then yellow, and as the plant's internal
transport liquid system breaks down, it tries to save itself by
dropping older leaves. But without enough leaves it can't support and
nourish the fruit.
"It's devastating to melons," said Kurt Nolte, agriculture agent with
the Yuma County Cooperative Extension.
Researchers at the University of Arizona and agriculture officials
from Yuma, Imperial County, California, and Sonora, Mexico, are
working on ways to limit the spread.
The virus also has attacked plants across the border in Sonora, Mexico
Yuma's fall melon crop is not very large, only about 800 acres, Nolte
said, but the spring crop now growing is estimated at 3000 acres.
Nolte said the source of the infection is unclear, but once
introduced it is spread from plant to plant by the whitefly.
"It's not a huge concern at the moment for the spring crop," he said,
because whitefly populations are low. But as temperatures rise,
insect activity picks up and the disease can spread.
Some commercial melon growers have volunteered to harvest early and
delay planting the fall crop to provide a "host-free" period.
"We hope to break the cycle of the virus spreading from melon to
melon plant," Nolte said. But even with the voluntary host-free
period, the virus could survive in home gardens, or even on wild
melon varieties in the desert.

[This is an attempt to control virus spread by limiting the host
plants of the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_. Unfortunately,
whiteflies have a very wide host range of over 500 plant species and
weed species can serve as reservoirs. Whiteflies cause crop damage by
themselves but are also important vectors for a range of serious
plant viruses, for example _Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus_,
_Tomato mottle begomovirus_, and _Bean golden mosaic begomovirus_.
Research into biological control of whiteflies is being carried out.
