Scientists with the Center for Vector Biology & Zoonotic Diseases, at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station have discovered that the common wood thrush, _Hylocichla mustelina_ plays a leading role in introduction and seasonal amplification of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, a deadly virus transmitted by mosquitoes.

The findings published in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases further identified the blood feeding behavior of the primary mosquito vector, _Culiseta melanura_ as the single most important factor affecting local maintenance and build-up of the virus in freshwater woodland swamp habitats in Connecticut.

"EEE virus is a highly pathogenic mosquito-borne zoonosis that is responsible for outbreaks of severe disease in humans and equines, resulting in high mortality and neurological impairment in most survivors," said Dr Theodore Andreadis, Center Director and one of the co-authors of the study. "In the past, human disease outbreaks in the northeastern US have occurred intermittently with no apparent pattern. However, during the last decade the region has witnessed recurring annual emergence and expansion into northern New England and southern Canada where the virus had been previously unknown." According to the CDC, 55 human cases have been documented in the northeast resulting in 23 fatalities since 2003. The underlying factors responsible for this sustained resurgence have eluded scientists and public health officials.

According to Dr Goudarz Molaei, lead author of the study, "in the northeastern US, EEE virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving a bird-biting mosquito, _Cs. melanura_, and wild perching birds in freshwater hardwood swamps. However, the identity of key bird species that may serve as superspreaders of the virus in these swamps leading to spill over into humans and equines, has not been established."

The team tackled this issue by analyzing the blood meal contents of more than 1100 _Cs. melanura_ mosquitoes collected from 4 EEE virus swamp foci in Connecticut using PCR-based molecular methods and direct sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Bird abundance in the swamps was also estimated through the use of avian point count surveys that were conducted from April through October for 2 years. In cooperation with scientists at Oregon State University, they developed an empirically informed mathematical model for EEE virus transmission, the 1st of its kind, based on the proportion of mosquito blood meals identified from individual bird species in relation to their observed frequency in the swamp.

The authors found that in these swamps, mosquitoes were exposed to a diverse community of birds, feeding on no fewer than 65 different species throughout the course of the season. However, mosquitoes exhibited larger feeding indices on wood thrush and a few other virus competent species including: American robin, tufted titmouse, common grackle, chipping sparrow, black-capped chickadee, northern cardinal, and warbling vireo, thus demonstrating that these birds play prominent roles in supporting EEE virus amplification.

Noted Molaei, "this research provides a basis to better understand the involvement of _Cs. melanura_ and key avian hosts in the transmission and ecology of EEE virus and the risk of human infection."

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus (_Togaviridae_, _Alphavirus_) is maintained in an enzootic transmission cycle involving ornithophagic mosquitoes, specifically _Culiseta melanura_ (Diptera: _Culicidae_), and passerine birds in freshwater swamp foci.

The main finding of this study is that _Cs. melanura_ is exposed to diverse avian communities but preferentially focused feeding on wood thrush (_Hylocichla mustelina_). The model suggests that this species may play a vital role in supporting EEE virus amplification, subject to confirmation that wood thrush is a competent host.

Wood thrushes are widely distributed across North America, and it winters in Central America and southern Mexico. For a picture go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hylocichla_mustelina_(cropped).jpg. - Mod.PMB
