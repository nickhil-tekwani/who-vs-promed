Malaysia has closed parks and alerted the public about the danger of
swimming and throwing garbage into rivers to prevent a disease
transmitted by rats that has apparently caused some 10 deaths.

A new death from leptospirosis occurred on Saturday [21 Aug 2010].
The victim was a 17-year-old from the northern state of Kedah who had
swum in a river and attended a picnic with friends at a recreation
park last month, newspapers reported the New Straits Times and The Star.

Several parks in the country have been closed since the 1st deaths
were reported last month. It is believed that some of the deaths were
caused by another condition, and a Health Ministry official could not
say immediately how many deaths were due to leptospirosis.

The website of the Ministry of Health warns people not swim in public
rivers when it rains and to avoid diving if they have wounds on the
body because it would facilitate infection.

The head of the agency, Liow Tiong Lai said, according to the
(Malaysian) Times the ministry would distribute flyers and posters to
give out information about the disease, according to the Times.

Leptospirosis is caused by exposure to water contaminated with urine
of infected animals and is absorbed through the skin. Rats are the
primary carriers, and the ministry campaign urges people not to throw
debris near water because it could attract the animals, he said.

The cases of the disease have increased in Malaysia. In 2004 there
were 263 infected and 20 deaths, while last year [2009] the figure
rose to 1400 infected and 62 deaths.

Symptoms include severe muscle pain, fever, vomiting and headache.
Leptospirosis is treatable if the person receives treatment in the 1st week.

[This news release of leptospirosis in the Malaysian state of Kedah
follows another news release of leptospirosis in the state of Pahang
that was reported in a recent ProMED post, Melioidosis, leptospirosis
- Malaysia: (PH) RFI 20100725.2495.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed
widely throughout the world in warm climates. The microorganism can
be found in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has
been contaminated by urine from chronically infected animals.
Leptospirosis affects humans and a variety of animals that include
dogs, cattle, pigs, and rodents. Leptospires enter the body through
open sores or wounds in the skin, or through mucous membranes
following exposure to contaminated water. Outbreaks frequently follow
large rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities, such as
camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing,
and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or
ponds contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/leptospirosis_g.htm>).

More than 90 percent of patients with leptospirosis have a mild,
self-limited illness, with fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, cough, pharyngitis, [red eyes], skin rash, and muscle pain,
especially in calves and lumbar region, which is rarely fatal. About
10 percent develop a more severe illness with myocardial, pulmonary,
renal, or hepatic involvement that may be fatal in 5-40 percent. In
recent studies of patients admitted to hospitals, about 20 percent die (see
<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/513767> and
<http://www.psmid.org.ph/vol31/vol31num4topic1.pdf>).

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical
presentation of many infections, the diagnosis of leptospirosis may
be incorrectly made in the absence of laboratory confirmation. See
prior ProMED posts: Leptospirosis, military personnel - Australia
(QLD): not* 20050329.0910 and Leptospirosis - Jamaica (02) 20071018.3409.
