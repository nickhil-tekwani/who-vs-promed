Authorities in Mbulu District, Manyara Region, are scrambling to
contain an outbreak of plague, an infectious disease spread by
rodents. Reports say at least 7 people have been admitted to a
special center set up specifically to treat people who have
contracted the disease. No deaths has been reported so far.

The district commissioner, Mr Anatory Choya, said that the outbreak
had so far only been reported in areas bordering the government
forest reserve at the edge of the Rift Valley, and that it should be
contained before spreading to other areas in the district. However,
Mr Choya hinted that the situation was worrying because he had been
notified that the disaster management unit in the PMO was short of funds.

"The outbreak could worsen with the coming of the rainy season," he
said, adding that areas where the disease outbreak has been reported
included Tumati in Dong'obesh Division, Murai (Mandisi) and Nandes
Ward near the district headquarters.

The acting district medical officer, Dr Elirehema Lakey, said plague
had been breaking out frequently in the district, adding that this
was a matter of "grave concern". He said experts from the Sokoine
University of Agriculture (SUA) had been involved in research on
rodents in the area where vermin numbers swell before the onset of rains.

Several people died in the last 2 plague outbreaks in the district
last year and 2007 (see prior ProMED-mail post Plague, bubonic, fatal
- Tanzania (Manyara) 20070328.1064).

[Although not specifically stated, it is likely that all the cases
are bubonic in nature, the most common form of _Yersinia pestis_
infection with the lowest mortality rates. - Mod. LL]

[More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources in the
region would be greatly appreciated.
