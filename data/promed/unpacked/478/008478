Officials said foot and mouth disease has affected 707 cattle in Siem Reap province, causing 34 deaths, and 1645 cattle in Pailin province. Siem Reap provincial Animal Health and Production office chief Prum Vich said 400 cattle were treated for the disease between [13 and 15 Nov 2020]. "The dead animals are calves of cows that have foot and mouth disease. The rest are being treated," he said.

Veterinary officers have been administering vaccines to cattle, but not all can be vaccinated as farmers often take them to graze in remote areas. "People in the lowlands bring their cattle to be vaccinated, but those living in the foothills rarely vaccinate their cattle, so it causes disease," he said. According to Vich, the disease mostly affects calves and is not fatal for adult cattle. Calves that contract the disease develop sores on their mouths and legs and lose their ability to eat properly.

Say Sophat, the director of the Pailin provincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said [that] over 1000 cattle in a flooded area in Sala Krao district have likely contracted the disease. They are being treated by veterinarians. "Some cattle have contracted an illness in the flooded area of Sala Krao district. These animals are weak. We've assigned veterinary officers to treat and take care of them. The next step is to vaccinate them," he said.

Khieu Sothon, the Pailin provincial Production and Veterinary Office head, said the recent surge in sick cattle did not represent an outbreak. "In Pailin, it spreads continuously. One got sick and spread to several other cattle. Then it increased to 4 and then 10. 4 among the sick cattle in Sala Krao district died. They were calves. The owner did not take care of them well and did not know the symptoms of the disease," he said.

[FMD is endemic in Cambodia, which belongs to the FMD pool 1 (South east Asia/Central Asia/East Asia), in which the following FMDV serotypes are known to circulate: O, A, and Asia-1. In this pool, serotypes O, A, and Asia-1 are known to circulate.

Cambodia reported during 2019 the circulation of FMD virus serotypes O and A in cattle and buffaloes. For Cambodia's monthly reports to the regional SEACFMD (South East Asia and China Foot and Mouth Disease) campaign, per serotype (and untyped), please go to http://www.arahis.oie.int/reports.php?site=seafmd.

According to recent EUFMD information, the circulating FMD viral lineages in Pool 1 (samples received from Viet Nam 11 Jun 2020), were:
O (ME-SA/Ind-2001/e): 22 samples
O (ME-SA/PanAsia): 2 samples
O (SEA/Mya-98): 6 samples

FMDV serotype Asia-1 was last detected in Cambodia in July 2015. - Mod.AS
