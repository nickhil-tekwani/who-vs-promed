In Rostov region sunflower seeds infected with phomopsis
--------------------------------------------------------
The upcoming spring sowing caused an increase of sunflower seed trade
in the Rostov region. Rosselkhoznadzor [Russian Federal Service for
Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] strongly recommends to
check for the availability of quarantine documents before seed
purchase. In 9 districts of Rostov region seeds infected with
phomopsis were found, and state inspectors have seized 500 tons of
infected seed out of 3000 tons screened.

Sowing of these 500 tons of seeds would have resulted in losses
equivalent to crops of about 100 medium-sized farms. The head of the
quarantine laboratory commented that the situation has improved this
year because of established screening practices. Rosselkhoznadzor
experts suggest that the wet weather was the cause of the spread of infection.

The infected seeds are being treated with chemicals and checked once
more before sowing. Sometimes a 2nd treatment is necessary after
which most of seeds are suitable for sowing. There is no 3rd
treatment attempt because seeds would not be viable any more. Farmers
have 2 options to process seeds not fit for sowing for oil
extraction: for edible oil, or for oil for technical uses. For the
1st option, the value of the seeds is one 10th of the original price,
and even less for the 2nd option.

[Brown stem canker (also called phomopsis, grey stem spot) of
sunflower is caused by the fungus _Diaporthe helianthi_ (previously
_Phomopsis helianthi_). It is a serious disease of the crop in many
temperate regions with yield losses of around 50 percent reported,
for example from some Russian areas. Symptoms include necrotic leaf
lesions extending towards the petiole leading to leaf necrosis,
followed by stem cankers which may girdle the stem and result in
collapse of the plant.

The disease is favoured by warm, humid conditions. The fungus
overwinters on plant debris left in the field and can be spread with
plant material including seed, by mechanical means and human
activities. Disease management includes phytosanitation to remove
inoculum (such as deep plowing of crop residues), cultural methods
(crop rotation, wide row spacing), fungicide treatments of crops and
seed and use of resistant sunflower varieties and hybrids.

In Russia, the disease was reported 1st in 1990 and is spreading.
Moldova, Ukraine and the Northern Caucasus are reported to be
currently the most seriously affected areas in the region.

Related _Diaporthe_ species and strains (for example _D.
phaseolorum_) are known to be associated with stem cankers and some
other diseases of soybean where they can cause high losses.
