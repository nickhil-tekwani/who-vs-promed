There are now 61 Bali rabies victims named by local media with
detailed descriptions of rabies symptoms, plus as many as 25 more who
have not been named and whose symptoms have not been described.

The latest death is described below [1], and below that is the most
complete body count I have been able to assemble [2].

Is there anyone outside of Bali who believes chikungunya virus
infection can be contracted from a dog bite and produces symptoms
resembling the terminal stages of rabies?

Suspected Rabies Death - Primary School (Translation from the Bali
Post provided by the Bali Animal Welfare Association)

An 8-year-old 3rd grade primary school student from Pangkung Jelati,
Yeh Sumbul, Medoyo, died after being referred to Sanglah Hospital on
Sunday (5 Jul 2010). His family indicated that he died of rabies.
However, district government and local villagers have denied the
boy's death was caused by rabies. The victim had been bitten by a mad
dog a month before he died. The village head mentioned that the boy
was taken immediately to Pekutatan Puskesmas [health center] and
referred to Negara General Hospital. However, the doctor said there
was no problem since they don't have rabies in Jembrana. Therefore,
the doctor gave him an anti-tetanus injection and periodical
treatment.

The victim managed to recover, and the bite wound healed. However, a
week ago, the victim fell ill, and his temperature reached 30-40 C.
He was paralyzed below the waist and talked to himself and fell
unconscious. The victim's parents didn't have any suspicions [since]
at the same time, some of the villagers suffered from an illness
similar to chikungunya fever.

On Friday afternoon, (2 Jul 2010), the boy was taken back to Negara
General Hospital. After a night in the hospital, he was referred to
Sanglah Hospital at 14.30 WITA [Central Indonesian Time]; however, he
died at 15.10 WITA. According to the family, the victim's mouth was
also foaming.

Meanwhile, the people shot the dog and buried it. The family is
convinced that it was a rabid dog because it had eaten a puppy and
was fierce. And it was also from outside the village, which bordered
the forest, and they never have [had dog] vaccination and/or stray
dog elimination. There were 2 other children who were bitten by a dog
on the leg and posterior. A day after the death, Head of Health
Division I Putu Suasta visited the location. However, there is still
no official confirmation from the regional government regarding the
cause of the illness.

I Komang Dentra, the Yeh Sumbul Village head, stated that they still
can't confirm whether or not it was rabies. According to him, the boy
had healed post dog bite. However, there was another patient, and the
patient was paralyzed. And also, there was no confirmation from
Sanglah Hospital that the victim died with rabies. In regards to VAR
[anti-rabies vaccine], his family doesn't know whether he got it or
not. From the doctor's explanation, not every person who gets bitten
by a dog needs VAR.
