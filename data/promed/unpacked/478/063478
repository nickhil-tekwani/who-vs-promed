[It should come as no surprise that FMD is now being reported in Zambia. Since mid-2014 and throughout 2015, the disease has been reported in Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Serotypes SAT 1 and SAT 2 are the serotypes that have been identified in that region.

The small town of Shangombo located in Shangombo District in the Western Province of Zambia is one of the most remote towns in the country. It lies on the eastern bank of the floodplain of the Cuando River, and the bank (rather than the river channel) forms the border with Angola https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shangombo.
