Bovine TB case traced to Indiana farm
-------------------------------------
Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) has identified bovine
tuberculosis (commonly called "bovine TB," or more formally known as
_Mycobacterium bovis_) in a beef cattle herd in Southeastern Indiana.
The disease was found in a cow that had under gone routine testing
during slaughter at a meat processing facility in Michigan.

BOAH veterinarians are in the process of conducting a thorough
investigation of the herd, including tracing the sources of the
TB-positive cows, as well as any animals that have been sold from the
herd. As information develops, BOAH will be notifying herd owners and
others who may be impacted by the investigation.

BOAH is also coordinating efforts with the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources to determine if the disease is present in
free-ranging deer in the area.

Indiana has held a bovine tuberculosis-free status since 1984 with
the US Department of Agriculture. Under federal guidelines, that
status remains. The last time a Hoosier cattle herd tested positive
for the disease was in the 1970s. In 2009, a cervid herd tested
positive for TB, and was ultimately depopulated.

Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease that affects
primarily cattle, but can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal.
TB is difficult to diagnose through clinical signs alone. In the early
stages of the disease, clinical signs are not [always] visible. Later,
signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade
fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node
enlargement may also be present. Cattle owners who notice these signs
in their livestock should contact their private veterinarian.

More information about the disease and the investigation, as it
develops, will be available on the BOAH website at
<http://www.boah.in.gov>.

[Officials with the Indiana Board of Animal Health (BOAH) and likely
their colleagues in the USDA located in Indianapolis will be involved
in tracing all animals that moved into the herd in the last 2 years
and tracing all animals that have moved out of the herd as well. Trace
in and trace out herds will likely be tested as well. It will be a
busy time for all involved. - Mod.TG]
