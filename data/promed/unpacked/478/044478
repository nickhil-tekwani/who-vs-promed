Two incidents of rabid skunks attacking dogs in Windsor [Maine] within a
month have the animal control officer for several area towns scared that
there is an outbreak of the disease among wild animals in the area. The
owners of the 2 dogs, which were attacked by the skunks, have their pets
under 45-day quarantines to make sure the animals have not contracted the
disease.

Animal control officer Howard Morang said one dog was bitten 3 or 4 weeks
ago. Another was attacked by a skunk Thursday [6 Nov 2008], but a
veterinarian said it did not appear the dog was actually bitten by the
rabid skunk. Both attacks occurred in Windsor, near the Windsor Fairgrounds
and Windsor four corners, said Morang, who is animal control officer for
Windsor, Vassalboro, Chelsea, Randolph, Pittston, Hallowell and Manchester.
He said both skunks were confirmed to be rabid, and he's received
complaints about other animals in the area, including a raccoon with a face
full of porcupine quills chasing animals and people near Oak Grove Road in
Vassalboro.

"We've got skunks going into dog pens and attacking the dogs, that's not
the way life should be," Morang said. "I hadn't seen any rabies cases for
quite some time, now it's 2 all of a sudden in that area of Windsor, so now
I'm scared. My guess is we've got a herd of skunks that are infected."
State and county data indicate the number of reported rabies cases so far
this year [2008] and last year is not beyond the norm.

"We're about in the range of what we typically see in Kennebec County,"
said Anne Sites of the state Department of Health and Human Services'
Infectious Disease Epidemiology Program. Kennebec County has had 7
confirmed rabies cases so far this year [2008], and also had 7 in 2007,
according to the state Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory.

But Sites said there are clearly more wild animals with rabies than that.
In general, rabies cases get reported when there is contact with a human or
domestic animal, she said. There are likely far more wild animals with
rabies than the number of confirmed cases. "We know rabies is endemic in
Maine," Sites said. "People need to be aware of animals acting strangely
and try to prevent encounters with them. Everything from a squirrel acting
strangely to a bat that enters the home in the summer months all the way to
house cats left to wander and not kept up-to-date on their vaccines. We
hear of numerous incidents each year. We encourage people to take every
opportunity to prevent exposure to wild animals."

Don Hoenig, state veterinarian, said Maine has had 49 confirmed rabies
cases so far this year [2008]. There were 86 last year and 127 in 2006. The
number of cases peaked in 1998, at 248 cases. Hoenig said rabies tends to
occur in geographical pockets, as wild animals spread the disease to other
animals in an area, which is what could be occurring in the Windsor area.

Pets that are current on their rabies vaccine and exposed to an animal with
rabies are subject to a 45-day quarantine period during which they may stay
with their owners, subject to the discretion of the animal control officer,
but must be kept in a restricted area and not exposed to other people or
animals.

Sites said pets that are not up to date on their rabies vaccine and are
exposed to a rabid animal are recommended for euthanasia. However, if an
owner refuses to have the pet killed, it may be placed in a 6-month quarantine.

During both quarantines, the animals are given a booster shot in an effort
to help prevent the disease. Morang suggested residents not feed their pets
outside or have bird feeders, because the food can attract wild animals. He
said if a person or pet is exposed to a potentially rabid animal, the wild
animal should be shot and kept, if possible, so it can be tested. However,
the animal should not be shot in the head, as the brain is needed for
rabies testing. And if a wild animal is acting strangely, stay away from
it. "If you drive in the yard and he's in the yard, wait till he goes
away," Morang said of wild animals. "You do not need to have a confrontation."

Two cases of rabies have been confirmed in stray cats found in rural Henry
County, officials said Friday [7 Nov 2008]. Since 18 Oct 2008, officials
have confirmed rabies in 2 stray cats found along Ga. 81 East near Bethany
Baptist Church, county spokeswoman Julie Hoover-Ernst said.

A 2-week trapping program has been initiated in the area to capture any
other wild cats, she said. Also, letters have been sent to nearby residents
alerting them to the confirmed rabies cases, she said. Hoover-Ernst said
all pet owners are required by law to keep their dogs and cats vaccinated
against rabies. Pet owners also should prevent their animals from roaming
to avoid exposure to infected wild animals.

Stray animals should be reported to Animal Control. Raccoons, foxes,
skunks, bats and coyotes are considered to be at high risk for rabies and
should not be approached or handled.

Rabies is a viral disease that is spread through the saliva of an infected
animal. Rabies symptoms include abnormal behavior, lethargy, lack of
coordination, convulsions and paralysis. Although the disease is fatal,
immediate First-Aid may prevent the virus from entering the body.

[Rabies is a disease that afflicts the nervous system of its victim. It is
a sad way for an animal to die and an even more tragic situation if a human
being becomes infected because of someone's negligence to vaccinate a pet.
Rabies is almost universally fatal.

I would take the approach that, until proven otherwise, most bats and
skunks have rabies as do many raccoons. Raccoons can get distemper, and
their actions are strange and can be confused with rabies.

Every US state has its own rabies laws regarding length of time of
quarantine of exposed animals and exposed vaccinated animals. Please check
with your particular state's animal control and public health departments.
