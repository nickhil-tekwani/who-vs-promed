At least 8 outbreak sites in Clark county or Portland [Washington] are, or have been, in Slavic churches or schools. In fact, Russian-speaking communities, according to a 2012 report -- the last of its kind -- have the lowest vaccination rates in Washington state.

The Department of Health (DOH) partnered with the Washington State Health Care Authority to better understand what is behind low immunization rates in Russian-speaking communities -- a pattern that's been consistent since 2008.

"Any medicine has potential risk and danger," said a focus group participant in the report. "My own life is one thing, but my child's life is a completely different thing."

Negative beliefs around vaccination centers around mistrust of healthcare, language and cultural barriers, strong dissatisfaction with healthcare providers based on pressure, lack of information about vaccination, and disrespect -- among other things.

"Many Slavic immigrants endured the harshness of the Soviet regime under a totalitarian government," said Stasyuk, who is a senior data analyst with the Washington Health Alliance. "This has led to a lot of anti-government sentiment and a distrust of the academy, science, and public health, which were sponsored by the government."

"Also, there is a general lack of science and health education, which has led some Slavics to prefer conspiracy theories," he added. "Humans are prone to exaggerate negative news -- stories of medical malpractice or vaccine side effects are more memorable than the story of a million saved lives."

The Soviet Union used coercive immunization campaigns to get its citizens to vaccinate and maintain a strong, healthy labor workforce, Washington State University history professor Steven L Hoch cites in his research paper [see comment below]. When it fell apart, soviet society lost its rational and financial means to support these campaigns, entrusting that responsibility to parents, who were becoming conscious of their rights.

"As far as I know, in the USSR vaccination was mandatory, so everyone I knew was vaccinated," said Stasyuk, who immigrated from the Ukraine when he was 7. "It was only when we came to America, acquired access to the internet with its plethora of opinions, and learned about the freedom to dissent that people came up with different opinions about vaccination."

Back home in Russia, this deep-rooted distrust in authority has caused parents not to vaccinate their kids as a form of expression. In 2018, legislation was passed that required parents' consent before any medical procedure, making it easier to oppose vaccination altogether.

Last year [2018] alone, there were over 23 000 measles cases in Ukrainian children and adults and over 1000 cases in Russia, according to the World Health Organization.

Misinformation online is adding to low vaccination rates. Scientists at George Washington University in DC discovered several accounts -- the same ones that belonged to Russian trolls who interfered in the US election -- skewing online debate about the safety of vaccines.

In Washington state, which boasts 26 000 Russian immigrants, the DOH report found that using personal social networks in faith communities to advocate for vaccines, offering community presentations on immunization, and providing Russian-language resources online, among other things, would help close the anti-vaccination gap.

"We try to make immunization education materials accessible to as many people in Washington as possible," said Liz Coleman with the DOH. "We publish as many immunization materials as we can in the top 4 languages spoken in Washington, one of which is Russian."

[2] Washington state (Clark county): danger of outbreak
Date: Wed 6 Feb 2019 8:42 PM PST

https://wapo.st/2SyYkki


[AG] is afraid to leave her house with her infant son because she lives at the epicenter of Washington state's worst measles outbreak in more than 2 decades. Born 8 weeks ago, [the baby] is too young to get his 1st measles shot, putting him at risk for the highly contagious respiratory virus, which can be fatal in small children.

[AG] also lives in a community where she said being anti-vaccine is as acceptable as being vegan or going gluten free. Almost a quarter of kids in Clark county, Washington, a suburb of Portland, Oregon, go to school without measles, mumps, and rubella immunizations, and Washington Gov Jay Inslee (D) recently declared a state of emergency amid concern that things could rapidly spin out of control.

Measles outbreaks have sprung up in 9 other states this winter [2018-19], but officials are particularly alarmed about the one in Clark county because of its potential to go very big, very quickly.

The Pacific Northwest is home to some of the nation's most vocal and organized anti-vaccination activists. That movement has helped drive down child immunizations in Washington, as well as in neighboring Oregon and Idaho, to some of the lowest rates in the country, with as many as 10.5â€‰percent of kindergartners statewide in Idaho unvaccinated for measles. That is almost double the median rate nationally.

Libertarian-leaning lawmakers, meanwhile, have bowed to public pressure to relax state laws to exempt virtually any child from state vaccination requirements whose parents object. 3 states allow only medical exemptions; most others also permit religious exemptions. And 17, including Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, allow what they call "philosophical" exemptions, meaning virtually anyone can opt out of the requirements.

All those elements combine into a dangerous mix, spurring concern about the resurgence of a deadly disease that once sent tens of thousands of Americans to hospitals each year and killed an estimated 400-500 people, many of them young children.

"You know what keeps me up at night?" said Clark County Public Health Director Alan Melnick. "Measles is exquisitely contagious. If you have an under-vaccinated population, and you introduce a measles case into that population, it will take off like a wildfire."

To date, at least 55 people in Washington and neighboring Oregon have gotten sick with the virus, with new cases tallied almost daily. All but 5 are in Clark county. King county, which includes Seattle, has one case; Multnomah county in Oregon, which includes Portland, has 4, including 3 cases reported [Wed 6 Feb 2019]. Most of those infected are unvaccinated children under 10, health officials said.

Measles, which remains endemic in many parts of the world, generally returns to the United States when infected travelers bring the disease back to pockets of the country where some parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children. When immunization rates fall below a certain threshold, outbreaks can occur; pregnant women, young children and people with compromised immune systems who can't get vaccinated are especially at risk. Last year, 349 cases were confirmed across 26 states and the District of Columbia, the second highest total since the disease was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since October [2018], an outbreak in New York's Orthodox Jewish community has sickened 209 people. In the 1st month of 2019, 10 states, including New York and Washington, have reported cases, all signs of a resurgence of a disease that is entirely preventable with a vaccine that authorities say is safe and effective.

In Washington, with late winter and spring generally the height of measles transmission, health officials say they are scrambling to stop the disease before it can spread further -- spending about USD 200 000 so far tracking down hundreds of unvaccinated people who may have been exposed.

Clark county officials are directing hundreds of susceptible families who may have been exposed to the virus at more than 3 dozen locations -- including a Portland Trailblazers basketball game, schools, churches and stores such as Costco and Walmart -- to keep their kids home from school for 21 days to avoid exposing others.

They're encouraging parents to vaccinate their kids if they haven't already, and are pushing back against rumors and misinformation, including that self-medicating with vitamin A will prevent measles.

Melnick said the county is also spending precious time and resources addressing false ideas being spread by anti-vaccine advocates, who he said posted "ridiculous" misinformation as comments on the county health department's Facebook page.

Critics claimed, for instance, that the measles vaccine can cause encephalitis, or brain inflammation, he said. That was documented once in a child who had an immune deficiency and should not have gotten a shot. More commonly, encephalitis is a severe but rare complication of the disease itself. The department has a three-person team countering those assertions and responding to questions.

"That's what we're up against," he said.

Anti-vaccination activists, for their part, contend that state officials are twisting facts to stoke public fear.

"It shouldn't be called an outbreak," Seattle-area mother Bernadette Pajer, a co-founder of the state's main anti-vaccine group, Informed Choice Washington, said of the measles cases, arguing that the illness has spread only within a small, self-contained group. "I would refer to it as an in-break, within a community."

Like many in her group, Pajer considers the risks from measles to be less dangerous than those posed by the vaccine itself -- a claim that can be traced back to a retracted and discredited 1998 paper that inspired the modern anti-vaccination movement.

Vaccine advocates are also trying to arrange for doctors to meet with parents in small groups or one-on-one, sometimes for hours at a time, to answer their questions.

[3] USA (Washington state, Clark county): low vaccination rate
Date: Wed 6 Feb 2019
Source: New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/us/measles-outbreak.html


Clark county has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Washington state. About 78 percent of the kindergarten through high school population is vaccinated, according to state figures. Along with other cities mainly in the West -- including Seattle, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Houston -- Portland is considered a hot spot for families that opt not to vaccinate for medical, philosophical, or religious reasons.

For measles, epidemiologists generally consider the threshold for preventing public measles outbreaks to be a vaccination rate of 93 percent or higher.

"If you have a population that is unvaccinated, it's like throwing a match into a can of gasoline," said Dr Alan Melnick, Clark county's public health director. "Measles is exquisitely contagious and immunization rates have been dropping."

Measles can cause permanent neurological damage, deafness and in relatively rare cases, death. All states allow parents to exempt children from vaccination for medical reasons, and most also allow for a religious exemption, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

But 17 states, including Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Texas, have gone further, allowing parents to keep their children from being vaccinated for unspecified personal or philosophical reasons. Some may be connected to a broader anti-vaccination movement, including concerns that vaccines lead to autism, an idea that has been widely debunked.

"I'm very worried that these measles epidemics are becoming a new normal," said Dr Peter Hotez, a co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He said that misinformation had been spread about vaccines, and that state lawmakers in some cases have allowed those claims to drive their decisions about legislation.

"The enablers are state legislators in those states, that have allowed themselves to be played," he said.

Dr Melnick, the Clark county official, said he had heard recently from doctors that parents have been showing up in greater numbers seeking vaccinations since the outbreak emerged. A plan is also underway, he said, for a mass clinic to give free shots.

"We've already had a child hospitalized; I hope it doesn't take a death or a real serious complication like encephalitis for people to change their minds," about vaccination, he said.

In 2018, 17 measles outbreaks were reported, mostly in pockets around the nation. In 2017, 75 cases were reported in Minnesota, in a Somali-American community with low vaccination coverage. In 2015, 147 cases across multiple states were tied to an amusement park in California, which an infected person was said to have visited, according to the CDC.

In Washington State's Legislature, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to reverse the state's rule allowing philosophical or personal exemptions to vaccination. A bill, filed in the midst of the measles outbreak, has yet to be voted on.

A measles outbreak is rapidly spreading across a Washington county known for choosing not to vaccinate its children, and health officials have declared a public health emergency.

As of [Thu 7 Feb 2019], Clark county, Washington, which is about 9 miles [about 14.5 km] away from Portland, Oregon, identified 49 confirmed cases [currently 55 -- see above] and 11 suspected cases since the beginning of the year [2019]. Most cases are affecting children younger than 10.

The county has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the state: more than 22 percent of public school students did not complete their vaccinations, The Oregonian reported, citing state records.

[5] Philippines: outbreak expanding
Date: Thu 7 Feb 2019 11:22 AM PHT
Source: ABS-CBN news [abridged, edited]
https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/07/19/measles-outbreaks-declared-in-more-luzon-visayas-areas


An outbreak of measles, first declared in Metro Manila and Central Luzon, was also observed in another Luzon region and 2 areas in Visayas, which tallied an increase in cases of the disease, the health department said [Thu 6 Feb 2019].

The outbreak declaration has been expanded to Calabarzon, Western Visayas, and Central Visayas, the agency said in a statement.

The wider outbreak declaration aims to "strengthen surveillance of new cases and alert mothers and caregivers to be more vigilant," Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told reporters.

As of [26 Jan 2019], Calabarzon tallied 575 measles cases and 9 deaths, said DOH. Meanwhile, Western Visayas had 104 cases and 3 deaths and Central Visayas had 71 cases and 1 death. Metro Manila logged 441 cases and 5 deaths while Central Luzon had 192 cases and 4 deaths, DOH said.

This contradicts data from San Lazaro hospital in Manila which recorded 55 deaths since January [2019], with most of the fatalities aged 3 months to 4 years old.

Low trust in the government's immunization drive may be attributed to anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia, which French drug maker Sanofi admitted could trigger more severe symptoms in some cases, Duque earlier said.

The Dengvaxia issue should not muddle trust for other vaccines, the efficacy of which have been proven for decades, said the health chief.

[6] Philippines: spread beyond capital
Date: Thu 7 Feb 2019
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/world/asia/philippines-measles-outbreak.html


The Philippines expanded the area of a declared measles outbreak on [Thu 7 Feb 2019] from the highly populated capital to nearby regions, after a steady rise in infections and deaths attributed to the disease in recent weeks.

The government's Epidemiology Bureau raised the "red flag" after an increase in infections in the capital, Manila, as well as the northern and southern ends of Luzon, the island that includes the capital.

The Department of Health said that measles had killed 55 children age 4 or younger at San Lazaro Hospital in Manila since the start of the year [2019].

According to the Epidemiology Bureau, there were 196 cases of measles in metropolitan Manila from [1 to 19 Jan 2019], compared with 20 in the same period last year [2018]. The region had 10 times more measles cases in 2018 than the year before.

We are expanding the outbreak from metro Manila to the other regions as cases have increased in the past weeks and to strengthen surveillance of new cases, and alert mothers and caregivers to be more vigilant," Health Secretary Francisco Duque said.

He said the outbreak had first been declared only in metropolitan Manila, a megacity of some 12 million people packed in sprawling suburbs and slums, but that further monitoring suggested infections had spread to other areas.

Dr Duque urged people to participate in a government-sponsored measles vaccination program, emphasizing that the injections had been "proven effective and safe."

Trust in immunization programs in the Philippines was seriously damaged in 2017 after the French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur admitted that a dengue vaccine it had distributed in the country, Dengvaxia, could backfire: if people who never had dengue were vaccinated and later become infected, the vaccine could provoke a much more severe form of the illness.

The government responded angrily, stopping the Dengvaxia program and asking Sanofi Pasteur to reimburse the 3.5 billion Philippine pesos, or about USD 67 million, it had spent on the vaccine. State prosecutors have recommended that charges be filed against Dr Duque and Benigno S Aquino III, the president at the time; 2 congressional committees also recommended charges this week [week of 4 Feb 2019].

But another consequence of the immunization scare is that many parents stopped vaccinating their children against other diseases, health officials said. Government officials have given diverging accounts of the effects of the Dengvaxia program. Persida Acosta, the government's public attorney, blamed the vaccine for the deaths of 14 children, though an expert panel concluded otherwise. Ms Acosta has accused the Health Department of paying families to drop their criminal complaints, which Dr Duque called "baseless" last month [January 2019].

In December [2018], a group called Doctors for Truth and Welfare, led by a former health minister, criticized Ms Acosta and another official in the Public Attorney's Office over their comments on Dengvaxia. "We call for a halt to the continuous spread of unproven claims of deaths caused by the dengue vaccine by the same unqualified but noisy people who are largely responsible for the fall in vaccine confidence in the country," the group said.

Salvador Panelo, a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said on [Thu 7 Feb 2019] that the immunization rate for measles was low because the Dengvaxia scare had undermined public confidence in the government's vaccination program.

He said Mr Duterte had ordered a "massive immunization program" for children in response to the measles outbreak.

Worldwide, reported cases of measles have increased 30 percent since 2016, the World Health Organization said last year [2018], as gaps in vaccination coverage led to outbreaks, including in the United States. Measles killed 110 000 people globally in 2017, mostly children under 5. Senator Richard Gordon, who is also chairman of the Philippine Red Cross, said there was a "surge" in patients being treated for measles at San Lazaro Hospital on Wed night.

"When we visited at midnight, we saw 2 or 3 children sharing one bed with parents also sharing the space," he said on [Thu 7 Feb 2019]. "What was usually a room for 2 or 3 patients now accommodates up to 10 children. Even hallways are now being used." Most of the measles patients are children and teenagers.

"Let's stop the scare and rather educate the parents, families, and communities on the importance of vaccination for our children's sake," Mr Gordon said.

[7] Madagascar: 50 000 cases
Date: Thu 7 Feb 2019 13:35 GMT
Source: CNN [abridged, edited]
https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/07/health/madagascar-measles-outbreak/index.html


Measles found [HR] and her family. Over 3 heartbreaking days in late January [2019], 3 of her young children died of the virus. She says they weren't able to access the measles vaccines at the clinic when they wanted them.

Madagascar, the island nation off the coast of East Africa, has been hammered by its worst measles outbreak in decades. The secretary general of the ministry of health told CNN that more than 50 000 people have caught the disease since October 2018 and there have been more than 300 deaths -- mostly children.

[HR] has brought her youngest surviving child to this clinic on a hillside in the center of Antananarivo because he has a cough. After his siblings died, he was vaccinated during one of the 4 planned rounds of a massive campaign orchestrated by the government, UNICEF and the World Health Organization.

The doctor tells her the cough is nothing to worry about. It's just a common cold.

Because of its relative rarity in the developed world, measles is sometimes incorrectly regarded as a mild virus with limited impact. But it can take hold rapidly and cause encephalitis, deafness, and in extreme cases, death, especially when a patient is malnourished or has a weakened immune system.

[HR's] children were only sick for a few days before they rapidly worsened and died. She says they weren't able to access the measles vaccines at the clinic when they wanted them. "This is hard and I am bitter," she says. "You cannot always prevent death, but mothers should do all they can to protect their children."

When Lon Kightlinger retired from his job as state epidemiologist in South Dakota, he didn't think his past life would catch up to him quite like this. "We heard rumblings of a measles outbreak in the capital between December [2018] and January [2019] and I just knew we were going to get hit," he says, inside a tiny clinic in Madagascar that's about 3 bone-jarring hours' drive from the capital.

Kightlinger worked in public health here [in Antananarivo] as a young man. Now, well into his 60s, he has come back as a Peace Corp volunteer. "Most of the other volunteers are young, idealistic, and full of energy," he smiles, "but I bring a bit of perspective, I think."

That perspective helped him recognize the warning signs of a larger outbreak. "Our one doctor here, who has been practicing physician for 12 years, had never seen a case of measles until a month ago. And then boom, boom, boom, they started walking through the door. And it hasn't stopped," he says.

In Madagascar, the outbreak has hit every region of the country and all major towns and cities.

Now, as several areas in the United States grapple with measles outbreaks, largely because of non-medical exemptions for vaccinations, Kightlinger and other experts point to Madagascar as a dangerous portent.

Throughout the country, private tragedies are playing out because of a lack of vaccine coverage.

Health officials [in Antananarivo] believe that vaccine coverage was at less than 50% at the start of this outbreak because of a weak, underfunded health system, and a failure of routine immunization delivery.

For herd immunity to work -- when enough people are vaccinated that the disease can't get a toe-hold -- coverage needs to be at around 95%.

And for many Malagasy, it isn't through lack of trying. "We Americans, we have concocted all of these excuses and reasons to be complacent about measles. The people in Madagascar they have busy lives as well. But when they do have vaccine drives, most of them will come out, travel long distances, and sit in the hot sun for their turn," says Kightlinger, who rides a bicycle several miles each week to deliver vaccines to nearby villages.

Ironically, some of the complacency in the developed world, is because of the very success of the public health response.

The 1st effective measles vaccine was developed in the early 1960s. Before that, there were an estimated 2.6 million deaths a year from the virus, according to the World Health Organization. In 2017, about 110 000 people died from measles, mostly children younger than 5, the WHO said.

But lack of understanding about measles and the rise of anti-vaccination beliefs based on phony science and social-media fueled conspiracy theories has a put a chink in the armor of otherwise well-protected countries such as the United States and France.

In a country like Madagascar, where they are still battling a deadly outbreak, that infuriates physicians.

"It is a question of mentality, because we need to convince those people. Maybe they don't know the reason why we should be vaccinated. Not only people in poor countries are not well educated," says Dr Andosoa Rakotoarimanana, the director of the Ambohimiandra Children's Hospital in Madagascar's capital.

[8] Cases soar

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-07/measles-cases-soar-to-decade-high-in-europe-with-72-deaths?srnd=markets-vp


Measles cases soared last year [2019] in Europe as gaps in vaccinations at a local level left the virus an open door to kill 72 children and adults, the World Health Organization said.

More than 82 000 people in the European region -- an area stretching from Russia to Iceland and south to Malta -- caught measles in 2018, the most infections in the past decade, the agency said in an emailed statement. The highest infection rates were in Eastern Europe and Israel, while France and Italy reported much higher rates than other Western European countries.

The wave of infections came despite record vaccinations across Europe in 2017. Anti-vaccine sentiment among parents in some localities is part of the problem, the WHO said. The challenge mirrors the situation in the US, where recent outbreaks occurred in Seattle and New York communities where parents opted against the preventive shots.

"The most important message is to be immunized," said Dragan Jankovic, a technical officer at the health agency's European vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization program. "A vaccine is the only way to protect against the disease."

Also fueling the spread of measles are adults who received only one shot of vaccine, instead of the 2 routinely given today, and may now need booster shots, Jankovic said. If adults aren't sure whether they are still immune, another dose of vaccine won't do them any harm and could help prevent infection, he said.

In the US, 79 cases of measles have been reported so far this year [2019] -- already 1/5 of last year's [2018] total. Measles cases in the Philippine capital region also surged 10 times at the start of the year, as the government failed to hit its immunization target in 2018.

[9] 2017: 109 000 people died
Date: Wed 6 Feb 2019 1307 GMT

A child was hospitalized in Brooklyn in the largest measles outbreak in New York state in decades. A 17-year-old died outside Paris, France. At least 12 children suffered the same fate in Brazil.

And these are not just isolated cases. In 2018, in Europe, 72 people have died and more than 59 000 have fallen ill with measles -- greater than double the number from the previous year. Meanwhile, nearly 17 000 people have caught the virus in South America and 76 people have died in Venezuela alone, where a regional outbreak began.

In the United States, Europe, and Latin America, we're seeing more and more headlines proclaiming a child has suffered due to measles -- a disease that is easily preventable by vaccination.

As the disease surges to its highest levels in more than a decade, it's imperative that we all come together to stop the world from backsliding any further -- and that means ensuring everyone gets vaccinated. Unless we act -- and fast -- more people will get the virus and die. And many of the victims will be children.

Together with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, we have supported the vaccination of over 2 billion children, resulting in more than an estimated 21 million lives saved. Since 2001, the start of the Measles and Rubella Initiative (M&RI), a global partnership made up of the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the World Health Organization, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and UNICEF, we have dedicated our efforts to eliminate not only measles, but rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), as well.

But now, after years of winning hard-fought battles, the current outbreaks threaten our progress. Measles may once again become common in places previously measles-free, as fewer children are being vaccinated.

This is the reason outbreaks are occurring in Europe and the Americas -- vaccination coverage has dropped, which means not enough people are being vaccinated. At least 95% of a population must receive two doses of the measles-containing vaccine to stop the virus from spreading, and in many areas with outbreaks, this is not happening.

Failure to vaccinate has far-reaching consequences -- from financial hardship in the form of lost wages while caring for a sick child, to a child developing life-long disabilities or dying. Some suffer complications such as blindness, encephalitis (brain swelling caused by infection), severe diarrhea, dehydration, ear infections, and pneumonia.

We have the tools, knowledge, and know-how to stop this avoidable disease. To build on this success and continue to move toward the elimination of measles, we must close immunity gaps around the world by reaching every child with lifesaving vaccines and detecting and responding quickly to stop every measles infection from spreading.

In the past 4 years alone, the global Red Cross and Red Crescent network says it has mobilized thousands of volunteers around the world who have visited millions of households in the poorest and most marginalized communities to stress the importance of vaccination. Such capabilities within each country help to ensure strong community safety nets that can be mobilized to protect the world from other health threats.

The recently published report, Progress towards Regional Measles Elimination -- Worldwide, 2000-2017, in the World Health Organization Weekly Epidemiological Record shows that over 109 000 vaccine-preventable deaths still occurred in [2017]. We call on ministers of health to commit to strengthening their immunization activities and to intensify surveillance to quickly detect cases and prevent this needless suffering. We call on parents to vaccinate their children.

With your support, the United Nations Foundation and the American Red Cross, along with other M&RI partners, pledge to continue to provide vaccines, training for health workers, technical assistance and community outreach, and education.

We can -- and we must -- protect our kids against measles, and once again regain the progress we've made against this disease.

[10] Vaccine: complacency

On the darkest day of 2018, the winter solstice [21 Dec 2018], we at the Center for Vaccine Research at the University of Pittsburgh tweeted, with despair, a report in The Guardian that measles cases in Europe reached the highest number in 20 years.

Why was this a cause for concern? Europe is far away from the US, and as some people apparently believe measles is a benign, childhood disease that causes a bit of a rash, a dribbling nose, and a few spots, right? What was all the fuss about?

Well as George Santayana said, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." Collective amnesia about the virulence of this disease has driven us to forget that measles virus has killed tens of millions of infants throughout history. Now, with several ongoing outbreaks across our own country, this unnecessary threat is back.

Measles is a highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease that spreads like wildfire in naive populations. The virus played its part in decimating Native American populations during the age of discovery. Since these people groups had no natural immunity to the diseases brought to the New World by Europeans, some estimates suggest up to 95 percent of the Native American population died due to smallpox, measles, and other infectious diseases.

In the 1960s, measles infected about 3 to 4 million people in the US each year. More than 48 000 people were hospitalized, and about 4000 developed acute encephalitis, a life-threatening condition in which brain tissues become inflamed. Up to 500 people died, mainly from complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. This was why vaccine pioneers John Enders and Thomas Peebles were motivated to isolate, weaken and develop a vaccine against measles that is truly transformative for human health. Parents who knew the reality of the disease were quick to vaccinate their children. Uptake skyrocketed and the number of cases, and associated deaths, plummeted in the developed world.

By 1985, when John Enders died, over one million of the world's kids were still dying because of this infection. However, now measles was a disease preventable by vaccine, and there was a huge impetus to address that tragedy by the World Health Organization.

When I started working on the virus in 1996, there were still over 500 000 children dying of measles each year worldwide. Such big numbers can be hard to digest. So, to put it into perspective, if you've ever been on or seen a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, you will know it's a pretty big airplane. Think of over 3 of these planes full of infants crashing every day of the year with 100 percent of the people on board dying. January, February, March ... the summer solstice, the autumnal equinox ... November, back to the winter solstice in December ... one rhythmic year. That's the reality of measles -- over half-a-million lives were lost globally every year in the [1990s].

Thanks to vaccination, however, between 2000 and 2016 there was an 84 percent decrease in measles mortality, and over 20 million deaths were prevented due to vaccination. What an achievement!

Near universal adoption of the vaccine in the developing world meant that measles infections and concomitant deaths became very rare. By 2000, the led to measles being eliminated from the US. The last person to die of the infection here was in 2015.

The effectiveness and irony of vaccination
--------------------------
These successes don't mean the measles is gone or that the virus has become weak. Far from it. Seeing the virus up close and personal over all these years and knowing what happens when it runs rampant in an infected host gives me such respect for this minuscule "little bag of destruction" whose genetic material is 19 000 times smaller than ours. It's also ironic how losing sight of the disease because of the success of vaccination has brought new societal challenges.

What's important to realize is those millions of kids who died of measles each year in the [1990s], for the most part were not living in the developed world. In those days here in the US and in Europe, there was a widespread appreciation that #vaccineswork, meaning that the vast majority of people received the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and were well and truly protected. 2 doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective at stopping the infection.

What one of the most infectious pathogens on the planet can do to an unvaccinated person in 2019 is biologically incredible. Yes, that's right, an unvaccinated human. But why would anyone decide not to get vaccinated or refrain from protecting their children?

That's because forgetting the past has precipitated selective amnesia in our post-measles psyche. Ignoring scientific facts has tragically brought us to a place where some people fail to appreciate the values and utility of some of the most phenomenal tools we have created in our historical war on infectious disease. Unsubstantiated claims that vaccines like MMR were associated with autism, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, etc., etc., and ill-informed celebrities have wreaked havoc with vaccination programs. Genuine, caring parents unaware of the realities of diseases they had never seen decided that since the viruses were gone from this part of the world shots were so last millennium. Put simply, some people have given up on vaccines.

This has created the perfect storm. Since the measles virus is so infectious and Europe, Africa, South America, and South East Asia are not really that far away by jumbo jet, a case somewhere in the world can lead to an infection anywhere in the world. Failure to vaccinate large groups of people is helping measles come back. From California, to New York, from Washington state to Minnesota and Georgia, measles is back with a vengeance. Now we can only live in hope that the last death from this deadly disease in the US remains from 2015.

Unfortunately, that is not a given.
