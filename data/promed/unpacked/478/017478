Situation update; data as reported by 24 Nov 2019
-------------------------------------------------
In the week of 18-24 Nov 2019, 7 new confirmed EVD cases were reported from 4 health zones in 2 affected provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC]. The majority of the confirmed cases in this week came from Mabalako Health Zone (57%; n=4). Violence and civil unrest in the week have led to the suspension of Ebola response activities in some areas of Beni, Butembo, and Oicha health zones. On 26 Nov 2019, some response personnel were temporarily relocated from Beni, though most remain in place to continue responding. The immediate focus will be on maintaining the safety and welfare of response personnel while preserving essential response activities in these places. The disruptions to the response and lack of access to Ebola-affected communities is threatening to reverse recent progress. As seen previously during this outbreak, such disruptions limit contact tracing, surveillance, and vaccination efforts, and they often result in increased transmission. In the past 21 days (from 4 to 24 Nov 2019), 12 health areas and 4 health zones have reported cases (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 28 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority reported from Mabalako (54%; n=15 cases) and Beni (32%; n=9). There have been no new confirmed cases in Nyakunde Health Zone for 42 days. As of 24 Nov 2019, a total of 3303 EVD cases, including 3185 confirmed and 118 probable cases have been reported, of which 2199 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1862) were female, 28% (935) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (163) were healthcare workers.

[3] Insecurity disrupts control effort
Date: Tue 26 Nov 2019 7:04 AM EST
Source: Nasdaq, Reuters report [abridged, edited]
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/who-unicef-evacuate-76-staff-from-ebola-teams-in-congo-due-to-insecurity-2019-11-26


The World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) on [Tue 26 Nov 2019] evacuated dozens of their staff working on the Ebola epidemic from the town of Beni in DRC due to the worsening security situation. Rebels believed to belong to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) killed 8 people in an overnight raid on [Sun 24 Nov 2019].

Residents angry at the perceived inaction of both the government and a UN peacekeeping mission then set fire to the mayor's office and several UN buildings on [Mon 25 Nov 2019]. At least 2 people were killed in clashes with police.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a news briefing in Geneva that 49 non-essential staff were flown on Tuesday morning [26 Nov 2019] to the eastern city of Goma, where they will continue working. "71 remain on the spot at this point to ensure as good as possible or at least the minimum support to the Ebola response," Lindmeier said. "The frustration, the anger of the population on the ground is very much understandable. But we need law and order restored to carry out vital operations," he said.

The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) has temporarily relocated 27 staff, leaving 12 in Beni, spokeswoman Marixie Mercado said.

Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said on [Fri 22 Nov 2019] that about 360 people were at potential risk of Ebola after contact with an infected person in eastern Congo, yet many of them were out of reach due to clashes and insecurity.

"The violence has to stop, we have enough areas where we cannot go due to violence, military violence, or rebel violence going on. So this is very bad for the Ebola response," Lindmeier told the briefing.

There have been 3303 cases of Ebola, including 2199 deaths, in the outbreak that was declared in August 2018. The WHO declared it an international emergency in July 2019.

[4] Diagnosis and treatment
- Wed 27 Nov 2019. Ebola treatments

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/11/new-data-highlight-promise-2-ebola-treatments
[byline: Lisa Schnirring]

New data highlight promise of 2 Ebola treatments
------------------------------------------------
A research group today [27 Nov 2019] published full results from a clinical trial of 4 Ebola therapies in the DRC outbreak, in which preliminary findings in August [2019] led health officials to push the pause button to steer patients into groups to receive 2 treatments that stood out as most promising.

An international research group, which includes renowned Ebola researcher and DRC health official Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, MD, published its findings in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). [ref: Mulangu S, Dodd LE, Davey RT jr, et al. A randomized, controlled trial of Ebola virus disease therapeutics. N Engl J Med. 2019. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1910993. [Epub ahead of print]; https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1910993]

Study fleshes out preliminary findings
--------------------------------------
In August [2019], an independent board that was monitoring the study in people treated in DRC Ebola treatment units took an early look at the data and saw that mortality rates were significantly lower in those who received the monoclonal antibody cocktail REGN-EB3 (made by Regeneron of Tarrytown, New York) and the single monoclonal antibody mAb 114, developed from antibodies of an Ebola survivor.

The other 2 therapies in the trial were the triple monoclonal antibody ZMapp, used as a control, and the antiviral drug remdesivir.

Patients in the study were randomized to receive one of the drugs, plus standard care. The trial began in November 2018 and enrolled 681 patients. To compare the 4 treatments, the researchers assessed their impact against death at 28 days.

Mortality was lower in the mAb114 group, 35.1%, compared with 49.7% in those who got ZMapp. For REGN-EB3, mortality was 33.5%, compared with 51.3% in a ZMapp subgroup. And for remdesivir, overall mortality was 53.1%. Results were even more impressive for patients who had low viral loads. The team identified four serious adverse events that were possibly related to the trial drugs.

The group concluded that both mAB114 and REGN-EB3 are superior to ZMapp in reducing death from Ebola and that it's possible to conduct ethically sound clinical research in an outbreak setting.

Implications for future outbreaks
---------------------------------
In a related commentary in the same NEJM issue [see ref below], Myron Levine, MD, DTPH, with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, wrote that the effects of the top 2 performing treatments are promising enough to explore the cost, number of doses that can be produced, and target populations for treatment. A single monoclonal antibody-based treatment offers some advantages, he said, and it would be helpful to have stockpiles of both products if they are licensed.

Among the study's notable findings that Levine highlighted was the fact that the efficacy of the two drugs was greater in people who sought early treatment, had low viral loads, and markers for less severe illness.

Community engagement can influence patients to get early care, but Levine added that early care hinges on the availability of rapid diagnostics and the ease of travel to treatment centers, both issues that can enhance the impact of the two treatments and should be addressed in future outbreaks. He praised the research team for their work conducting a randomized, controlled clinical trial under difficult conditions that included civil unrest and armed conflict. Levine also said the trial clearly shows a role for monoclonal antibodies in cutting Ebola deaths, which he said raises questions about their role in tamping down deaths in outbreaks involving other diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

[ref: Editorial. Levine MM. Monoclonal antibody therapy for Ebola virus disease. N Engl J Med. 2019. doi: 10.1056/NEJMe1915350 [Epub ahead of print]; https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMe1915350]

Four DRC hot spots remain
-------------------------
No new Ebola cases were reported in the DRC today [27 Nov 2019], keeping the outbreak total at 3304 cases, according to numbers reflected on the WHO online Ebola dashboard. Health officials are still investigating 366 suspected cases, and the number of deaths held steady at 2198.

WHO's detailed weekly situation report on the outbreak yesterday [26 Nov 2019] said 7 new cases in 4 health zones were reported for the week ending 24 Nov 2019, and 4 were in Mabalako. It said civil unrest prompted some Ebola responders to be relocated from Beni yesterday, but most remain in place to continue their activities. "The immediate focus will be on maintaining the safety and welfare of response personnel while preserving essential response activities in these places," WHO said.

The group warned that violence in response areas could affect contact tracing, case management, and other activities in areas where virus transmission is still occurring. Yesterday's daily report from the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said that, despite the tension in Beni, a vaccination ring was opened around a case that was confirmed in late October [2019].

MSF urges focus on wider health needs
-------------------------------------
Meanwhile, Doctors Without Borders (Médecins sans Frontières; MSF) yesterday [26 Nov 2019] weighed in with its Medlatest assessment on the outbreak, airing several concerns about the response and sharing the latest developments on its efforts. MSF said many health workers have been recruited from health centers across the DRC, which stretches staffing and resources for non-Ebola medical needs throughout the country and further weakens the country's health system and affects how the community views the Ebola response. The organization said it strongly encourages donors to consider the country's wider needs, rather than just focusing on the Ebola response.

Though fewer cases have been confirmed over the past weeks, data show an average 5-day delay between symptom onset and diagnosis, a time when patients are infectious and miss receiving treatments that increase their chance of survival.

The group emphasized that the Ebola outbreak is only one of several pressing medical issues in the DRC, noting that only 4% of patients taken to treatment centers have tested positive for Ebola. It also repeated its concerns about a need to limit ring vaccination, instead highlighting possible benefits of a wider geographic approach, given contact tracing difficulties.

MSF said its staff in the DRC is adjusting to evolving hot spots. It has closed or downsized some centers, but is setting up new activities in other regions. One such area is Ituri, where the group is transforming a small facility into a 20-bed Ebola treatment center in the Biakato Mines area.

- Sun 24 Nov 2019. Mobile lab
[Science magazine, abridged, edited]
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/11/lab-wheels-could-be-gamechanger-during-next-ebola-outbreak-scientists-say
[byline: Martin Enserink]

A new mobile lab was born out of scientists' "frustration" about the lack of infrastructure during the West African Ebola outbreak.

During the next Ebola outbreak, this brand new vehicle might come to the rescue. It's a lab on wheels that some scientists say could greatly improve the response to disease outbreaks and epidemics. It can be flown into trouble spots by plane and driven to even the most remote locations, and it has everything on board needed to rapidly diagnose patients or carry out research studies.

The company that developed it, Greensboro, North Carolina-based Integrum Scientific, says the 1st vehicle may soon be tested in Uganda, which occasionally has outbreaks of Ebola and a related virus, Marburg.

The idea was born out of "deep frustration" among scientists during the 2013-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, says clinical virologist and pediatrician Calum Semple of the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom, who is on the company's infectious disease scientific advisory board. The 3 most affected countries -- Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone -- had almost no laboratory infrastructure. Suspected Ebola patients were often held in quarantine rooms for a long time while their samples were shipped to other locations and tested, putting those not actually infected at risk of infection by other patients.

Research suffered as well: Semple, who carried out a study to treat patients with plasma from Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone, says he lost 3 months bringing in equipment -- some of which disappeared along the way -- and refurbishing a local blood bank. His lab had a flood and an electrical fire; dust and the fickle local power system damaged fragile instruments. The new mobile lab would solve most of those problems, Semple says.
