A government committee met Wednesday in Washington, DC, US, to discuss what
to do about the catastrophe that appears to be wiping out frog populations
world wide and whether humans are in danger. "All amphibian biologists are
now convinced that something unusual and catastrophic is happening to
amphibians," Ron Heyer of the Smithsonian Institution told reporters. The
committee, commissioned by the Interior Department, includes officials from
the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health and Human Services
Department, the National Institutes of Health, other agencies and
environmental groups. Bill Brown, scientific adviser to Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt, said President Clinton proposed adding $8.1 million next
year to the Interior Department's budget for studying amphibian decline --
a huge increase in the$1 million now allocated. [Is this 1 Million USD
allocated as the Interior's budget or to studying amphibian decline?
The decline in the United States first hit headlines when schoolchildren in
Minnesota started bringing home deformed frogs. When scientists started
looking, they found frogs were disappearing. "In some sites we are actually
witnessing the decline as we try to study it," said Gary Fellers, a
research biologist with the US Geological Survey (USGS). He said one
California species, the mountain yellow-legged frog, is a good example.
"Over a 10- or 12-year period this frog has rapidly declined," he said.
"Even at sites where we do find frogs, we find 4 or 6 or 8 individuals."
There used to be hundreds.
There are a number of possible causes, said Fellers, who stressed
scientists are just starting to sort them out. "The most significant, we
believe, is airborne contaminants -- pesticides and herbicides that are
used in huge quantities in central California," he said. Prevailing winds
blow the chemicals into the Sierra Nevada mountains. Those areas that get
the most winds from the agricultural valleys have the fewest frogs, Fellers
said. "We have not yet demonstrated the contaminants have caused the
decline. But ... those areas with the most contaminants are the areas with
the fewest frogs," he said.
Other possible causes are the introduction of fish into lakes where they do
not naturally occur. "They eat frogs and they eat tadpoles," Fellers said.
It is also possible that disease is playing a role. Other scientists have
identified a fungus that kills some frogs. The researchers are reluctant to
blame any specific chemicals. Not only has cause and effect not been
proved, but many different chemicals are involved.
Some speices have been lost to extinction in some areas while some
populations have been lost in other areas. These phenonmena have occured in
the United States, Costa Rica and Australia. Heyer said possible factors
include ultraviolet radiation allowed through by the thinning ozone layer,
climate change, and chemicals called endocrine disruptors that mimic the
effects of hormones on the body. Such chemicals can cause deformities and
interfere with reproduction. "We also think the amphibians are telling us
humans something has happened to the habitat we share with the frogs,"
Heyer said. "We need to act on the early warning the amphibians are
giving."
Sam Droegge, a research biologist at the USGS, said citizens can help.
"They can actually help us in terms of collecting data," he said. The
Interior Department, an environmental group and a children's television
have set up an Internet site -- http://www.frogweb.gov
<http://www.frogweb.gov> -- to commission schoolchildren as a nationwide
"frog force." The site asks U.S. and Canadian residents to report
sightings of normal and malformed amphibians encountered during outdoor
activities.
