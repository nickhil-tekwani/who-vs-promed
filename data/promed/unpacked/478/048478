The mysterious bug [should read "agent" rather than "bug;" see
commentary. -Mod.AS] which has killed thousands of camels has not
affected herds in the UAE, as scientists and authorities are closely
monitoring the situation.
The disease recently killed thousands of camels in neighbouring Saudi
Arabia, sending a wave of panic among farmers and scientists who are
baffled as to what the disease is and its cause.
Dr Ghaleb A. Al Hadrami, Dean of the College of Food and Agriculture
at the UAE University, said no trace of any such disease had yet been
found anywhere in the UAE.
"We have closely been monitoring the situation, and people need not
to worry," he told Gulf News.
He said Saudi Arabian experts were not describing it as an infectious
disease. They are calling it an incident of food poisoning.
"Nobody, however, knows the exact cause of this camel ailment so far,
but scientists have been working on it," said Al Hadrami.
Dr Ulrich Wernery, Scientific Director of the Central Veterinary
Research Laboratory (CVRL) in Dubai, said scientists had been
investigating lines such as poisoning, antibiotic pollution, viruses
and climate change as possible causes.
It was earlier believed the cause of the camels' deaths was some kind
of infectious disease. However, according to international reports,
blood tests of the camels indicated a contamination of fodder.
An estimated 5000 camels in Saudi Arabia and North Africa [see
commentary] have died so far from the mystery bug.
Dr Wernery said the Saudi authorities remained tight-lipped over the
situation and were not sharing information. "This has been a problem
in finding out what has actually been killing the camels," he said,
adding his organization was willing to help Saudi authorities. "I am
to go to Saudi Arabia to collect firsthand information and on-site
evidence," said Dr Wernery. This message has been sent to the Saudi
authorities through the UAE Ministry of Environment and Water but no
reply has been received, he said.
He said on-site investigation was very important for scientists and
experts in identifying the cause of the bug and finding a solution.
Dr Wernery said the CVRL has a monitoring system in the UAE and so
far had not found a single incident in the UAE. He said farmers and
people who own camels in the UAE need not worry about this mysterious disease.
The UAE, he said, had stopped importing camel fodder from Saudi
Arabia years ago. Now most of the hay comes from Oman and food
pellets from other countries in the world.

[Mass mortality involving at least 2000 (according to some sources,
5000) Saudi camels has been observed in Wadi al Dawaser, south of
Riad, since August this year 2007. ProMED-mail published, during the
following 5 months, 7 requests for information without response; the
event remained "undiagnosed."
It was disclosed that samples were sent to a Saudi and an (unnamed)
French laboratory and that the mortality was suspected to be caused
by fodder intoxication, probably by the ionophore Salinomycin.
Later, cases in another location, namely Yanbu' al Bahr, a Red Sea
port in the Al Madinah province of western Saudi Arabia,
approximately 350 km north of Jedda, were mentioned as well. It is
not clear whether these cases are related to those seen in Wadi al Dawaser.
Background on the major event in Saudia and on camel intoxications in
North Africa is available in an article published by Science at the
end of November 2007 (Vol. 318, no.5855, pp.1372-1373); see posting
20071205.3926.
An official report from the responsible Saudi authorities is still
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
