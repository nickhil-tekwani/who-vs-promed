As the heroin epidemic continues in New Jersey, an infectious disease specialist is finding that a growing number of heroin users are testing positive for a potentially deadly virus they don't even know they had. Dr Ronald Nahass, president of ID Care in Hillsborough, says the heroin epidemic is pushing up the number of hepatitis C cases dramatically. "In our study, it was just over 40 percent of those admitted for detoxification for heroin were positive for hepatitis C," Nahass said. Hepatitis C is often transmitted by drug users who share their needles, since the virus is transmitted by blood and body fluids.

"It's a huge problem, the numbers affected by hepatitis C that are under 35 are in the thousands, and the situation is getting worse," Nahass said. The doctor stressed that hepatitis C should not be ignored. "20 to 30 percent of the people who get hepatitis C, over their lifetime, will end up with either cirrhosis, which is liver failure, or hepatoma [hepatocellular carcinoma], which is liver cancer, so it is a pretty serious problem. It is one of the so-called silent diseases, most of the time when you have hepatitis C you will be asymptomatic until you wind up with one of those complications."

[Needle exchange programs and availability of rehabilitation programs are vital in the approach to injection drug use-associated infectious diseases, including HIV and hepatitis B, as well as hepatitis C. - Mod.LL

While antiviral drug treatment for hepatitis C is expensive, it is cost-effective compared with other healthcare expenses. (See for example, Linas BP et al. Ann Intern Med. 2015; 162(9): 619-29. http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleID=2212248). In addition, there is an as-yet unquantified public health benefit in treatment because it reduces the likelihood of transmission to others. - Mod.LM
