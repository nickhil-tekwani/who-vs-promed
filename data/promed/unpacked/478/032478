[3] India (New Delhi): cases

https://indianexpress.com/article/india/monkeypox-cases-delhi-intl-travel-history-under-diagnosis-infection-report-8249144/


A new report has described 5 cases of human monkeypox infection detected in New Delhi without any international travel history, suggesting under-diagnosed monkeypox infection in the community. Researchers from Maulana Azad Medical College in New Delhi, Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology [ICMR-NIV] in Pune, and AIIMS [All India Institute of Medical Sciences], New Delhi have emphasised the need for active surveillance of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in the high‐risk population such as men having sex with men and female sex workers.

On 14 Jul 2022, India reported its 1st human monkeypox case from Kerala. Since then, 20 confirmed cases of monkeypox have been identified from Kerala (6) and New Delhi (14) until 13 Oct 2022. The study, published in the Journal of Medical Virology in October [2022; see citation below], noted that the cases observed in Kerala had well-defined epidemiological linkage, with international travel history and contact with suspected cases. The detection of monkeypox cases in Delhi without a travel history to endemic or affected areas suggests the undetected circulation of MPXV in the community.

"The confirmed monkeypox cases from New Delhi have no travel history to monkeypox endemic or current outbreak areas," researchers said further adding that monkeypox cases were mild and recovered completely. "This emphasizes the significance of timely clinical and laboratory diagnosis for early detection and patient management leading to recovery without secondary complications," lead author Dr Vineet Relhan from Maulana Azad Medical College has said in the report.

"They were immunocompetent with no comorbidities, and had shown good clinical recovery without the administration of any antivirals," Dr Pragya Yadav, senior scientist and one of the researchers at ICMR-NIV said. There were 2 cases who denied in‐depth details of any sexual contact and, according to researchers, this was primarily due to the stigma associated with the disease. This necessitates the counselling of monkeypox‐positive cases to alleviate the fear, stigma, anxiety, stress, and depression associated with the infection, said researchers Rima Sahay, Anita Shete, and others.

It has been observed and reported that transmission of MPXV through MSMs (men having sex with men) was the major reason for the monkeypox outbreak in 2022. Hence, intensified surveillance involving MSM/female sex workers/bisexual community would be needed to understand the transmission, the researchers said. The study has shown that enhanced awareness is required amongst healthcare workers, specifically those working in STI (sexually transmitted infections) clinics for understanding the newer presentations of the monkeypox infection.

Monkeypox virus is an emerging orthopoxvirus causing infection in humans post‐smallpox eradication. Since May 2022, a multi-country outbreak of monkeypox has been observed affecting all 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions. A total of 73 288 cases from 109 locations were found to be affected by MPXV until 14 Oct 2022, according to the report.

Interestingly, the worldwide case report lists India with 17 cases of monkeypox and 1 death. The report above indicates that there was the original case and then 20 additional confirmed cases. Perhaps the worldwide case count for India will begin to report the higher number. - Mod.TY]

[4] Canada (Quebec): eradication

Source: Lethbridge News, The Canadian Press report [edited]
https://lethbridgenewsnow.com/2022/11/07/monkeypox-almost-eradicated-in-montreal-once-epicentre-of-virus-outbreak-in-canada/


Once the epicentre of Canada's monkeypox outbreak, Montreal has almost eradicated the virus on its territory, according to doctors in the city -- but they warn it's too early to declare victory.

Cases can still be imported by tourists and other visitors, they say, adding that it's still unclear how long the vaccine will remain effective.

Doctors and members of the city's LGTBQ community are crediting the quick launch of a vaccination campaign and collaboration between public health officials and community organizations for the success in controlling the disease.

Dr Geneviève Bergeron, responsible for health emergencies and infectious disease at Montreal's public health department, said she's "cautiously optimistic."

"We've definitely seen a large decrease in the last few weeks," she said in a recent interview. "At this point, the latest cases that we have began their illness in late September."

Dr Réjean Thomas, the president of a clinic in Montreal's Village district that specializes in sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections, said that early in the outbreak, his clinic -- l'Actuel -- was seeing almost a dozen people a day who thought they had the disease.

Now, he said in a recent interview, "we're seeing almost no more cases; it has completely diminished, almost eradicated."

In total, his clinic treated 125 people with monkeypox -- more than a quarter of all the cases in Montreal since the 1st case was detected in the city 12 May [2022].

But Thomas said it remains unclear what the future holds; he said he recently saw a patient with monkeypox who had been vaccinated in July [2022]. "So that's the big question: what will be the effectiveness of the vaccine -- for how long."

Bergeron said studies are ongoing about the length of the protection offered by Imvamune, a smallpox vaccine that was approved for use against the related monkeypox virus. The vaccine is offered to anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to the virus, as well as to those whose sexual contacts may put them at higher risk for the disease.

Public health officials are now encouraging people who got an initial dose of monkeypox vaccine to get a 2nd shot, she said. "We know that one dose offers good protection, a 2nd dose offers even better protection."

Around 30 000 people have received one dose of a monkeypox vaccine in Quebec. Last week, the province's public health director, Dr Luc Boileau, said around 6000 had received a 2nd.

"The situation is going well," Boileau told reporters, adding that one case had been detected in the province over the past 2 weeks.

But Quebec isn't the only place where monkeypox cases are declining. In Ontario, where the trajectory of the disease has followed a similar pattern, the province's chief medical officer of health said in mid-October [2022] he was "actively looking" at declaring the outbreak over.

The World Health Organization says the number of new monkeypox cases across several countries -- including Canada, the United Kingdom, and Italy -- decreased by more than 50 per cent in the final week of October [2022] compared to the week prior. Several other countries, including France and the United States, have recorded smaller declines, but the number of new cases is still rising in other parts of Europe and in parts of Central and South America.

Bergeron said it's not clear what's driving the decline, but she said vaccination and seasonality could be playing a role.

"We've seen overall in Montreal a lower number of cases compared to other countries and other jurisdictions, so I think that the vaccination campaign did help," she said.

Bergeron said public health officials knew there was a high risk of stigmatizing people and worked closely with the community to design the messaging around vaccination. If people were worried they would be judged or stigmatized for protecting themselves, that would be counterproductive, she said.

Christian Tanguay, the executive director of the Montreal LGBTQ+ Community Centre, said that while the experience at the vaccination clinic felt like getting a flu shot, he worried that people wouldn't get vaccinated because they feared being stigmatized as having multiple partners.

Seeing 3 people he knows get the virus motivated him to get vaccinated quickly and to encourage others to do the same, he said.

Tanguay said the outbreak caused real fear and it came at a difficult time, when life was returning to normal after the COVID-19 pandemic and people wanted to be around each other again.

Alexandre Dumont Blais, the executive director of RÉZO, an organization that promotes sexual health among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, said he thinks people in the LGBTQ community are confident that the outbreak is largely behind them, adding that the number of questions his group gets about the disease has declined significantly.

"We feel much better than a couple of months ago," he said in a recent interview.

[The significant decline in monkeypox (MPX) cases in Quebec province is good news indeed. The caution about declaring MPX as eradicated in the province is justified since people move and take their MPX infections with them. There is always the possibility that someone who is infected outside the province can bring it into Quebec. The decline is attributed to the vaccine but that and changes reducing risky behavior have been factors in case reduction in other localities. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We report a case of monkeypox in the United States in a patient who had been vaccinated with ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine 8 years earlier. Despite his vaccination status, he still contracted disease. He showed prodromal symptoms preceding development of painless penile lesions that later coalesced.

[Conclusion]
Although vaccination is foundational for preventing infectious disease, this case highlights that vaccination alone does not guarantee immunity from monkeypox. Public health leaders should taper expectations that vaccination alone will end the outbreak. Vaccine should complement, not replace, public health campaigns that aim to minimize high-risk health behaviors.

[This single case does introduce a note of caution about the effectiveness of the vaccine alone to prevent monkeypox virus infection. There is increasing evidence that changes in behavior to reduce risk may be playing a major role in the decline of cases. - Mod.TY]

[6] Central Africa: potential escalation

New monkeypox study increases concerns of potential escalation in Central Africa: Analysis of surveillance data in Democratic Republic of the Congo shows potential for more, larger outbreaks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new assessment of monkeypox infections in a remote area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) -- with a strain linked to more severe disease than what's circulating internationally -- shows transmission rates rising closer to the point where outbreaks are likely to be larger and more frequent.

The report from researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Kinshasa School of Public Health, and the DRC's Ministry of Public Health is based on data collected between 2013 and 2017, raises fresh concerns about the neglected burden of monkeypox in Africa. That includes its potential to cause more cases in African communities, which may in turn increase risks of new outbreaks globally. The findings were presented today at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

"Our data show that monkeypox transmission in the area we studied was notably higher than previous estimates and was getting close to the point where it can cause large and sustained local outbreaks," said Kelly Charniga, PhD, MPH, a Prevention Effectiveness Fellow at CDC. "With today's interconnected world, outbreaks don't necessarily stay at their source. This research puts the global health community on alert that there may be the opportunity for larger outbreaks in DRC on the horizon and we must work diligently to prevent future outbreaks where people are most at risk for getting and dying from monkeypox."

Charniga and her colleagues analyzed reports from 1463 laboratory-confirmed cases that occurred between 2013 and 2017 in Tshuapa Province in northwestern DRC. The team focused on calculating what is known as the reproduction number, which measures the average number of new cases caused by a single infection.

The effective reproduction number, also known as Rt, is a closely watched parameter for any infectious disease. Rt values greater than 1 indicate that every new infection is causing at least one additional case, with the potential for sustained transmission. Charniga and her colleagues found that the Rt for monkeypox in the region they studied had risen to 0.81. That Rt value is up from 0.3 to 0.5 seen in the 1980s -- rates that were consistent with the isolated, sporadic outbreaks of monkeypox that have been occurring in the region for some 50 years.

"When it's significantly below one, outbreaks die out because fewer people are being infected -- and thus spreading the disease to others. That's what we have typically seen in the DRC, small outbreaks that don't last," Charniga said. "But if it gets closer to or above one, then a disease can continue to spread between people in a region and outbreaks can be larger and more frequent."

The researchers also found new evidence of potentially more regular "spillovers" of monkeypox infections from rodents, which are thought to be the natural reservoirs, to people. Infections from rodents, often involving children, were then continued through person-to-person spread to household contacts. Charniga said that the more this happens, the more opportunities there are for monkeypox to be sustained solely by spread between people.

Monkeypox cases in African countries where the disease has traditionally been found have been increasing during the past several years, including the re-emergence of monkeypox in Nigeria after 40 years with no reported cases there.

"Many people in CDC, the World Health Organization and in health ministries and research institutions across sub-Saharan Africa were calling attention to the rising danger of monkeypox long before we started seeing infections outside of Africa," said ASTMH President Daniel Bausch, MD, MPH&TM, FASTMH. "This study provides important new insights that point to the urgent need to provide additional resources that can help Africans fight this disease."

Potential threats from a dangerous strain -- locally and globally
-----------------------------------------------------------------
An additional concern is the 2 different types or "clades" of monkeypox virus. The one that long has been circulating in the DRC -- known as clade I -- can have a fatality rate up to 10%, while the fatality rate for the clade II virus, found in West Africa and the source of recent outbreaks outside Africa, is usually less than 3%. Charniga said severe complications caused by monkeypox, which can include blindness, also appear to be more common with clade I.

Infections with both clades of monkeypox have become more common in Africa since smallpox vaccination was halted around 1982 following the global eradication of smallpox.

Monkeypox virus s in the same virus family as the variola virus, the cause of smallpox, and smallpox vaccines and therapeutics may also work against monkeypox. However, there is little access anywhere in Africa to these products since most of the global supply was produced as a countermeasure for possible bioterrorism against smallpox and is not widely available. There is now a vaccine licensed for use against monkeypox, but there is only one manufacturer globally and much of its production is under contract to the United States.

Given the poor access to vaccines, fighting monkeypox in Africa -- and limiting the risk for new global outbreaks, including those involving the more dangerous clade I -- requires more surveillance and contact tracing to prevent onward spread of monkeypox. She said that since 2010, CDC and the Kinshasa School of Public Health have been assisting DRC with improving surveillance in rural areas, where many clinics still rely on paper forms to report suspected cases.

[Knowing what the incidence is of monkeypox (MPX) and which clade is circulating requires ongoing surveillance with laboratory support. Providing that support is not in place in many parts of Africa, especially in more remote rural areas. The timely focus of vaccination efforts, assuming that vaccine is available, requires knowing when and where cases are occurring, and that requires surveillance. Will international organizations and high-income countries provide the collaboration with MPX-endemic African countries to put an integrated surveillance system in place? - Mod.TY]
