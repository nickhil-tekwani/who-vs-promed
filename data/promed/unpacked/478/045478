A week of torrential rainfall has devastated vast tracts of farmland and
left thousands homeless in Ghana's east and northern regions, the
government announced. There were reports of 48 deaths last week from a
cholera outbreak triggered by deteriorating sanitation conditions.
Nigeria

September 17, 1999
Reuters
At least 200 people have died in a cholera epidemic in Nigeria's
northeastern Borno state, a local newspaper said on Friday. The mainly
government-owned Daily Times said the epidemic was claiming 20 lives a day.
It said the state's elected assembly on Thursday adopted a motion calling
on the government to send emergency medical teams to eight affected local
council areas. Cholera outbreaks are frequent in parts of Nigeria,
particularly during the rainy season when drinking water sources become
contaminated.
Sierra Leone

WHO/CSR Outbreak Disease outbreaks reported Cholera in Sierra Leone.
The Ministry of Health and Sanitation has reported to WHO an outbreak of
cholera, with 134 cases and 1 death between 1-6 Sep 1999. Of 8 stool
specimens sent for laboratory tests, 6 were positive for _Vibrio cholerae_
O1
subtype Ogawa. Tests have revealed sensitivity to tetracycline, doxycycline
and cotrimoxazole. WHO and other partners have been supporting the Ministry
in taking appropriate control measures, e.g. reactivation of the cholera
task force, establishment of specific subcommittees (for surveillance, case
management and sanitation) and of cholera treatment centres. Mass health
education campaigns are being carried out and communications networks are
being strengthened. Available supplies are adequate for the treatment of
3000 cases. Please see the Global Cholera Update for additional information.

As at 31 August 1999, a total of 6 964 cases have been reported to WHO this
year (see the Global Cholera Update for more information). The disease is
appearing in new areas and since 1 August, 3-4 cases of watery diarrhoea
have been registered every day at Bosaso hospital; in all 190 cases have
been admitted, of which 84 were males and 106 females (F:M ratio, 1.26:1).
The age group most affected has been > 5years (60% of cases). There have
been 15 deaths (case-fatality rate, 8%). On 5 August, 5 rectal swabs were
sent to the AMREF laboratory services in Nairobi (Kenya) for
identification, culture and sensitivity tests. Vibrio cholerae serotype
Ogawa has been isolated from 1 of these. The result of the antibiogram
indicates sensitivity to tetracycline and nalidixic acid, but resistance to
chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cotrimoxazole and ampicillin. Over 90 % of
cases are from the same residential area. Investigations have shown that
they had been drinking from 100 wells located in that same area, and which
are adjacent to pit latrines. Three control committees have been set up in
Bosaso town, namely for social mobilization, water and sanitation, and case
management. The wells which have been shown by analysis to be positive for
vibrios are being chlorinated by the water and sanitation committee with
the help of WHO and UNICEF. UNICEF is working on a piped-water project for
the area. A focal point for control of the epidemic has been appointed to
work closely with local WHO staff, who have also conducted a series of
training sessions for the hospital staff on case management of cholera, in
close collaboration with UNICEF and local authorities. Intensive health
education and social mobilization are ongoing, targeting especially the
affected residential area. Supplies of ringer's lactate solutions, chlorine
and antibiotics are sufficient.

Health authorities in Guatemala confirm 4 cases of cholera, including a
10-year-old girl, & 2 others with similar symptoms among coffee farm
employees in the Department of Retalhuleu (South), epidemiologist German
Reyna reported Thursday.
In the first 6 months of 1999 Guatemalan health authorities registered 885
cases of cholera, but only 102 were confirmed, of whom 2 died.

A cholera outbreak has killed 27 Iraqis this summer and hospitalized
thousands more, a senior Health Ministry official said Tuesday. The U.N.
World Health Organization in Baghdad confirmed the outbreak of the
infectious disease and cited poor sanitation, contaminated water, power
failures and rampant poverty as the main causes -- troubles Iraq blames on
U.N. trade sanctions. State-run hospitals have recorded 1,900 cases this
summer in the central and southern parts of the country, said Abduljabbar
Abdulabbas, director-general of the ministry's department of preventive
health. Ghulam Popal, WHO's acting representative in Baghdad, said health
authorities in the Kurdish rebel-controlled city of Sulaimaniya have
reported another 1375 cases. Abdulabbas gave a bleak picture of the
quality of drinking water, the main carrier of cholera. ``Raw sewage now
seeps into leaking and corroding pipes'' in major cities, he said. In 1989,
the year before sanctions were imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait,
no cholera cases were reported in the country.

Epidemiologists in the Russian Far East registered 7
cases of cholera in the region, the Far Eastern emergency centre reported
on Wednesday. Three cases were registered in the village of Homutovo in the
Sakhalin region and another four in Vladivostok, capital of the Primorye
territory, the centre said in a statement. Medical authorities in the
Sakhalin region have worked out a plan to localise and eliminate the
cholera nidus, the centre said. They set up a cholera hospital for 20
persons and provisory hospitals for 40 adults and 50 children in the city
of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, it added. The source of cholera in Sakhalin remains
unknown, the centre said. The diseased could have taken the infection with
water from the nearby Khomutovka River. It is also likely that they got
infected by eating fish washed in the river. Khomutovka is situated 500
metres below sewers from the local cantonment. In Vladivostok, the four
diseased were living near the city dump. Epidemiologists in Primorye and
Sakhalin are disinfecting the affected territories to prevent the spread of
this dangerous disease.

Kenya

August 25, 1999
Panafrican News Agency
An outbreak of amoebic dysentery has hit residents of the north
Rift Valley Kenyan town of Eldoret, following suspected use
of contaminated water. No deaths, however, have been reported. The Kenyan
media Wednesday quoted the town's medical officer of health, Dr. Isaiah
Tanui, as confirming the outbreak, but could not immediately confirm the
number of people affected by it. "Yes. I am aware of the outbreak but I do
not have the exact figures of those suffering from the disease," he told
the East African Standard newspaper. He, however, said medical personnel
would be dispatched to the affected areas to establish the cause and
extent of the disease. Early last week, residents of the town raised
concern over the supply of untidy and impure water by the local municipal
council, saying it posed a major health hazard to consumers. Tanui said he
could not rule out the possibility of the dirty water being consumed by
residents, who have been affected by the outbreak. The town's deputy
clerk, Fredrick Kemei, has confirmed the presence of dirty water, saying
the town's water reservoir was being cleaned and "some of the dirty water
could have gone into the supply pipes." He, however, assured that normal
supply had resumed, and the water was being treated with chemicals.
Residents have, however, dismissed the council's assurance, saying
the situation had been made worse by overflowing drainage systems due
to blockage.
Sudan

More than 40 people have died from gastro-enteritis in Sudan's central
Al-Gezira state, the privately-owned Al-Rai Al-Aam newspaper said on
Thursday. The newspaper said flash floods had led to the pollution of
drinking water in the town of Managil and surrounding areas. "The reasons
for the spread of the disease are the pollution of drinking water and the
use by the citizens of infected water from the canals,'' the daily said.
Managil is part of the large Al-Gezira agricultural scheme which uses
irrigated water. Ten of the victims are from Managil and the other 30 from
the surrounding areas, Al-Rai Al-Aam quoted a Sudanese Red Cross official
as saying. The newspaper said local health authorities had ordered the
closure of restaurants, cafeterias and other eating places to prevent the
spread of the illness, which causes the stomach to become swollen and
painful and can lead to fatal diarrhoea, particularly in children. The
newspaper said thousands of people in the area had been displaced by the
floods and were living in the open, where their health situation was
critical. Hundreds of people are reported to have died from intestinal
complaints and diarrhoea in several parts of Sudan since the onset of the
rainy season in June.

Dagestan
August 23, 1999
ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin [edited]
Bad food and a failure to observe the rules of elementary hygiene have led
to an outbreak of dysentery and other intestinal disorders among the bandit
formations that have seized mountain villages in Dagestan. An ITAR-TASS
correspondent was told by law-enforcement agencies that the bandits,
surrounded by troops and unable to obtain food from Chechnya, are resorting
to plunder, slaughtering cattle and feeding indiscriminately on anything
edible that they come across in houses abandoned by the local inhabitants.
The situation is compounded by a shortage of clean drinking water.
