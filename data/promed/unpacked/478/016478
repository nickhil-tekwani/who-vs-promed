The Ministry of Health has declared an outbreak of meningitis in South Sudan's Upper Nile state, after the disease reportedly killed 2 people in its Malakal County.

At least 38 suspected cases, the ministry said in a release, have so far been recorded since the 1st patient was admitted in Malakal teaching hospital on 15 Apr 2013. The most affected patients, it added, are between the ages of 18 and 20 years.

"The State Ministry of Health has so far collected 11 CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] samples; these were tested, and 8 of them tested positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A using latex agglutination testing (Pastorex rapid test)," says the release signed by Kariom Makur, the ministry's undersecretary.

The meningitis bacteria, according to the Health Ministry, are transmitted from one person to another through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions. The commonest symptoms of the disease are stiff neck, high fever, confusion, headaches, and vomiting, among others.

The ministry, in February last year [2012], declared the young nation, which lies in Africa's meningitis belt, free from the bacterial disease. Meanwhile, the health ministry said it had undertaken several activities to contain the disease outbreak. These included: reactivation of national and state epidemic task forces to coordinate the intervention response; heightening of surveillance at facility and community levels; enhancement of case management and laboratory capacity through training and deployment of technical officers from Juba [the capital of South Sudan]; the provision of drugs and laboratory supplies and their transport to Malakal; and planning with health partners to conduct a mass meningitis vaccination campaign targeting over 260 000 people living in Malakal county and surrounding payams [districts].

An outbreak of meningococcal meningitis has claimed 2 lives and infected dozens of people in Upper Nile State in South Sudan, health officials said on Thursday [2 May 2013], warning that the number of new cases was still rising.

"In week 15, there were 3 cases; in week 16, there were 19, and this week there are already 16 cases," Dr John Lagu, the director of emergency preparedness at the Ministry of Health, said, adding that 2 patients have died of the disease.

Meningococcal meningitis is caused by bacteria that affect the brain and spinal cord. The infection causes high fever, confusion, headache, and vomiting. Untreated, the illness can kill in 24 to 48 hours. The disease is contagious and spreads particularly quickly among people in close contact. Avoiding contact with an infected person is not always easy because some people show no symptoms of the disease even when they are infected and also because of the difficulty of keeping people isolated, Lagu said.

"Mass gatherings are discouraged but, of course, you cannot discourage them 100 per cent because people have to go on with their daily lives, to buy things," he said. To try to prevent the disease spreading further, South Sudanese health authorities plan to conduct a vaccination campaign, focused on the area in and around Malakal.

A meningitis vaccine that costs USD 0.50 cents a dose and can be transported and stored for as long as 4 days without refrigeration or an icepack is available in Africa and has already had a dramatic impact in fighting the disease in the parts of Burkina Faso and Chad where it has been administered.

South Sudan lies in the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa, which stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, and has the highest rates of the disease in the world. In 2009, 14 African countries reported 5532 deaths from meningitis, the highest toll since an epidemic in 1996 claimed more than 10 000 lives.

[South Sudan is one of the countries in the African "meningitis belt" that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to the Horn of Africa in the east. This region is plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm). The meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (December to April) and end at the onset of the rainy season (from May to June). Larger outbreaks occur every 8-12 years (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (World Health Organization (WHO): Meningococcal meningitis fact sheet: http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf).

There are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of meningococcal meningitis, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135.

The serogroup most commonly associated with the African meningitis belt is A. However, outbreaks have also been caused by serogroups C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14760584.5.3.319), and X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751 ). In March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/3581-ethiopia-suspected-meningitis-outbreak-situation-as-of-08-march-2012-.html). The 1st news report above says that the current outbreak in South Sudan is due to serogroup A.

To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). While effective capsular polysaccharides-based vaccines exist against serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, no similar vaccine is available against disease caused by serogroup B or X strains. A new protein-based, 4-component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine has been developed that is hoped will be a broad-spectrum B vaccine (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).

Because meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains, laboratory confirmation of the serogroup causing an outbreak is important so that the appropriate vaccine is used.

South Sudan became an independent country on 9 Jul 2011. Upper Nile is one of the 10 states of South Sudan and is located in the South Sudan's northeast corner. Malakal is the capital of Upper Nile.
