Bluetongue In Poland: Final Report
-----------------------------------------
See also:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_71.HTM#Sec0> 9 Nov 2006
Information received on 7 Nov 2006 from Dr. Krzysztof Jazdzewski, Acting
Chief Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development,
Warsaw:
End of previous report period: 30 Oct 2006 (see Disease Information, 19
[45], 769, dated 9 Nov 2006).
End of this report period: 6 Nov 2006.
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed (updated information):
National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy
Results: competitive ELISA on 26 Oct 2006 was positive; RT-PCR on 3 Nov
2006 was negative.
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed (updated information):
Institute for Animal Disease Research (AFRC), Pirbright (United Kingdom)
Results: ELISA on 2 Nov 2006 was positive and RT-PCR on 2 Nov 2006 was
negative.
As the presence of bluetongue virus in 3 serologically positive animals is
not confirmed, Poland is still considered to be a bluetongue virus free
country. All cattle in the farm concerned are being tested: to date, 220
animals have been tested, and 5 other animals will be tested very soon. If
no other positive results are found, the restrictions imposed on the farm
will be lifted.
Final report: yes

[The admirable efforts at transparency are to be applauded. Furthermore, it
appears that there has been no spread of the disease within Poland to date,
in contrast to everywhere else in northern Europe that has had recent
outbreaks. This is either because Poland is truly negative for bluetongue
(including the rather easily transmitted new BT-8 strain recently
circulating in northern Europe) or we have gotten late enough in the fall
season to preclude vector transmission by _Culicoides_ species. - Mod.PC]
