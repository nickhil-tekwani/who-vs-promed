[The progression of the Ebola outbreak can be followed in the 4 daily reports from the MoH above. The number of cases increases on a daily basis as do deaths, the latter mostly taking places in community centers without proper protection for healthcare workers and family of patients, and not Ebola treatment centers, although deaths in the latter are occurring as well. The new Ebola treatment center (ETC) that opened in Katwa health zone will be helpful in providing an increase in beds in safely operated facilities, and the 2nd repair of the Beni treatment center after damage was inflicted during election unrest is encouraging. But the outbreak appears to continue to simmer. - Mod.LK]

Ebola outbreak continues to grow in multiple DRC sites
------------------------------------------------------
Over the weekend [5-6 Jan 2019] and through today 7 Jan 2019, the ministry of health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recorded 16 new Ebola cases from towns and cities across North Kivu and Ituri provinces, including Butembo (6 cases), Katwa (5), Oicha (2), and 1 each in Mabalako, Kyondo, and Kalunguta.

The outbreak now stands at 625 cases, of which 577 are confirmed and 48 are probable. A total of 377 deaths have been recorded, and 101 suspected cases are still under investigation [see [1] above for numbers as of 8 Jan 2019].

Treatment centers open
----------------------
On 3 Jan 2019, DRC officials opened a 16-bed Ebola treatment center in Katwa health zone to treat more patients in that region, and the ministry of health said the Beni transit center is operational again after the building was attacked during election protests on 27 Dec.

Vaccination efforts are still under way throughout the region, with 56 509 people vaccinated, including 19 619 in Beni, 11 526 in Katwa, 6369 in Butembo, 5550 in Mabalako, health ministry said [see [1] above for numbers as of 8 Jan 2019].

Election results still unknown
------------------------------
SHEA [Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America], which in a statement called for a coordinated response to the outbreak, said there is no health risk to the US public.

4. Containment efforts in Beni -- the major hotspot of the past few months -- are paying off, @WHO says. But progress is fragile & instability in the region threatens it. The election results still aren't out. ...]

[3] Response in risky environment

Ebola response resumes despite 'risky environment'
--------------------------------------------------
Despite a precarious security environment and continuing pockets of mistrust on the part of affected populations, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on [Tue 8 Jan 2019] that all Ebola-affected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) North Kivu province are now accessible to health workers.

Civil unrest in Beni, the epicenter of the epidemic, crippled operations last month [December 2018]. But WHO says that now, under Government leadership and in collaboration with partner agencies, the Ebola response has resumed in force. However, it warned, further disruptions and security issues, could seriously impact the complex effort to end the outbreak.

The main challenges to the response are a hazardous security situation and the inability to prevent and control infection in many public and private health facilities.

WHO revealed that some 577 confirmed cases and 377 deaths have been recorded since the outbreak was declared in August last year [2018]. The UN agency also stated that 220 people have recovered and more than 56 500 have been vaccinated.

From 31 Dec 2018-2 Jan 2019, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to Ebola-affected areas in the DRC, where he spelled out that "Ebola responders are sacrificing a lot... to combat one of the world's deadliest viruses in a risky environment."

Accompanying him, Dr Jeremy Farrar, Chair of WHO's Research and Development Blueprint, came away "worried by the immense challenges they face in such a complex environment."

"It is vital the international community recognizes this and ensures the DRC and WHO have the support needed to ensure this outbreak does not spiral out of control," he said.

The Ebola outbreak is in reality, several distinct outbreaks in the different affected areas. While the major outbreak in Beni, which was responsible for a large proportion of cases in recent months, is coming under control, the positive trend there is not mirrored elsewhere.

WHO pointed out that the volatile situation in Komanda and Butembo/Katwa has rendered those outbreaks more unstable.

At a glance: DRC's continuing battle against Ebola:
- WHO currently has 447 staff in DRC to support the response.
- Some 37 000 contacts have been registered for tracing, with almost 5000 under surveillance.
- 6 Ebola treatment centers [ETC] are caring for 143 inpatients -- 30 confirmed cases.
- To date, 248 patients have been treated under the MEURI [monitored emergency use of unregistered and investigational interventions] protocol, an ethical framework developed by WHO, in consultation with experts and the DRC.
- As of [Sun 6 Jan 2019], 44 patients were enrolled in a randomized control trial in Beni.
- Over 24 000 000 travelers have been screened, with 2 confirmed cases detected among them.
