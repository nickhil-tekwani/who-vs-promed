The highly contagious disease [ASF], which is incurable in pigs but harmless to humans, has spread rapidly across neighbouring China since [August 2019], and has been found in 7 areas in Viet Nam, the state-run Vietnam News Service reported.

"We should combat the epidemic as if we are fighting against the enemy," [Viet Nam's prime minister, Nguyen Xuan] Phuc said in a meeting with regional officials on [Mon 4 Mar 2019], according to today's [5 Mar 2019] report, which said Phuc had called for "drastic measures" from the "whole political system" to fight the disease.

From 1 Feb to 3 Mar 2019, the fever was found in 202 households in 7 cities or provinces in northern Viet Nam, including in the capital, Hanoi, Viet Nam's government website reported.

Over 4300 pigs have been infected and destroyed because of the virus, the website said, citing data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

Viet Nam produced 3.82 million tonnes of pork in 2018, equivalent to 72 percent of the country's entire meat production, up 2.2 percent from 2017, the report said.

The virus started to spread at some locations around Hanoi during last week's summit between US President Donald Trump, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un [27-28 Feb 2019], after the 1st confirmed cases of the disease in Viet Nam were found in 3 farms in Thai Binh and Hung Yen provinces.

Pork accounts for 3/4 of total meat consumption in Viet Nam, a country of 95 million people where most of its 30 million farm-raised pigs are consumed domestically.
