South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan all acted at the end of last
week to ban or increase checks on some imported European food.
Taiwan said on Monday it was planning to ban dairy products imported from
Belgium and France, while Thailand said it was likely to target Belgian
products soon. Shoppers in Singapore were forced to seek alternatives to
European brands of baby formula, after most brands were recalled from
supermarkets following a ban on European dairy products.
The dioxin issue has been a hot topic in Japan for most of this year amid
concerns that rubbish incinerators were emitting the carcinogen and dioxin
may have contaminated vegetables.
Malaysia, which has been reeling from a viral epidemic that has killed more
than 100 people and devastated its own pork industry, imposed a temporary
ban on EU food imports on Monday. The ban covered all meat, eggs and
egg-based foods and dairy products, the Bernama news agency quoted Health
Minister Chua Jui Meng as saying.

Bulgaria has banned imports of fodder, meat and dairy and poultry products
from Belgium, France and the Netherlands fearing the goods could be
contaminated with toxic chemical dioxin, the National Veterinary Service
said.
"The ban is imposed and it includes imports of all products of animal
origin and feed from Belgium, France and Holland and German chickens and
eggs," NVS deputy executive director Yanko Ivanov told Reuters on Monday.
"The ban is temporary but it will remain effective until the EU resolves
the issue," said Ivanov.

The Public Health Ministry yesterday slapped a ban on import and sale of
dairy products from Belgium amid a contamination scare. The ban, prompted
by reports of contamination by dioxin, a carcinogen, is effective today and
the goods affected include dairy products, meat and eggs.
Though the FDA [Thailand's Food and Drug Administration has three
importers registered for bringing animal meat into the country, so far none
have done so, said [Mongkhol na Songkhla, the FDA secretary-general. In
May, about two million baht worth of white egg, which is used as a food
ingredient, was imported from Belgium, he said. Currently, the FDA has 16
importers of Belgian products registered, of which 10 are of chocolates,
two of biscuits.
Dr Mongkhol said the main concern is the recent import of white egg, but
the importers have confirmed the product is not sold within the country. It
is exported to a third country as a food ingredient.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO:The Democratic Republic of the Congo has
banned imports of chicken meat and eggs from former colonial power Belgium
following the scare over contamination of animal feed there with the toxic
chemical dioxin. The government announced the ban in a statement issued on
Tuesday and said that all suspect food would be withdrawn from the market
for analysis.
THE NETHERLANDS: The Netherlands' central bureau for food retail (CBL)
has ordered shops to withdraw 519 Belgian products in case they contain
cancer-causing dioxin, Dutch NOS radio reported Wednesday.
It said the list of brands, published by the CBL Wednesday morning,
included meat, cheese and other dairy products. Products on the list
include some processed cheeses, meats, chocolate products, snacks, cakes,
biscuits and dog food.
The CBL had decided to order the withdrawal of the products because the
suppliers had failed to give sufficient assurances that they did not
contain dioxin, the report said.
SOUTH AFRICA:(Source: Business Day(edited)- The names of Belgian farms from
which contaminated meat could have been imported since January would be
released in SA, the agriculture department's food safety director, Gideon
Bruckner, said yesterday.
This follows the worldwide ban at the weekend of imports of poultry, pork,
beef and dairy products from Belgium after it was found that the products,
especially poultry and pork, contained toxins which posed a serious health
threat to the public.
Scientists found dangerously high levels of dioxin, a toxic chemical linked
to cancer, in the meat of animals raised on 13 Belgium farms. "The dioxin
on these farms has been traced to a small amount of combustion oil
incorporated into feed at a food manufacturing plant," Bruckner said.
