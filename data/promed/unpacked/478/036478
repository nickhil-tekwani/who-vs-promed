[Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, the one most likely responsible for this and 6 previous cases in Veraguas province this year (2013) is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease. Fortunately, 6 of the 7 cases this year have survived their infections.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_) a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
