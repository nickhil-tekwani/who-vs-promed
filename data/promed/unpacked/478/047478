A total of 87 people have been hospitalized for eating faulty pastry
in Macedonia, news reaching here from Skopje reported on Tuesday [9
Sep 2008]. The patients, some of them are children, are being treated
at the capital's infectious diseases clinic. Many of them are
displaying symptoms of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.

It was reported that most of the poisoning cases have been reported
in 3 districts of Skopje, the capital city. They have consumed
eclairs, cream-filled pastries.

[Cream-filled pastries are one of the classical vehicles of
staphylococcal enterotoxin disease. The following is a discussion
regarding this entity (from Lutwick LI, Gradon J, Zellen J: Category
B Biotoxins. In, Beyond Anthrax: The Weaponization of Infectious
Diseases, Lutwick LI, Lutwick SM, eds, Springer Press, New York,
2008, pgs 181-205, in press. The numbering of the references has been
changed to be consecutive, starting at 1:

Staphylococcal food poisoning is caused by the ingestion of preformed
enterotoxin B (SEB) (or one or more of the other enterotoxins of the
organism) in food contaminated with toxin-producing strains of _S.
aureus_. Enterotoxins A and D appear to be more frequently associated
with the illness (1). It has been the 2nd most common cause of
food-borne illness (2) and can be associated with retail-produced as
well as home made foods. Those most conducive to this toxin
production are usually previously cooked or not adequately cooked,
unrefrigerated or not rapidly cooled after preparation. Common
vehicles include custard, dairy products, canned foods, potato salad,
and ice cream although many food including meats have also been
implicated. Proteinaceous foods that are semipreserved with salt or
sugar such as cooked meats are not protected from _S. aureus_ growth
and are therefore at risk (1). The food has often not been fully
cooked and characteristically has a normal taste and appearance
despite the presence of _S. aureus_ and/or SEB.

Staphylococcal food poisoning presents with the acute onset of
nausea, vomiting abdominal cramping, and diarrhea usually within 4-6
hours after ingestion. Following ingestion of the contaminated food
there is an increased intestinal peristalsis due to sympathetic
activation. The vomiting that occurs appears to be due to the effect
of SEB on the local neural receptors in the gut, rather than a
central neural effect, based on cross-circulation experiments
performed in nonhuman primates (3). The diarrhea, caused by more
local effects on the intestines of the toxin, may contain blood.
Diarrhea does not occur in the absence of vomiting (2). The patient
is usually afebrile in contrast to human aerosol exposure (4).
Hypotension may develop if fluid losses are of sufficient magnitude.
Fatalities are uncommon but may occur in infants, the elderly and
with large dose ingestions.

Although most individuals with staphylococcal food poisoning are
afebrile, the presence or absence of fever is not felt to be a
reliable diagnostic criterion (2). In this large series of patients,
however, subjective fever was reported in 16 percent, chills in 12
percent and sweats in 2 percent. In hospitalized patients,
temperature readings were no higher than 38 deg C (100.4 deg F).
Other features not found to be helpful in diagnosis were the presence
of skin lesions in food handlers and large numbers of _S. aureus_ in
the food.
