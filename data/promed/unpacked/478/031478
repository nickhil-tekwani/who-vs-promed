British scientists are concerned with deadly bacteria, resistant to antibiotics, found in meat products.

The scientists tested over 100 various meat products of UK farm origin, including sausages and minced meat, and detected a methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA).

Drug-resistant strain of Staph kills thousands of Americans annually, and has become more prevalent throughout continental Europe over the past few years.

Dr. Des Walsh, Head of Infections and Immunity at the Medical Research Council, which helped fund the research, expresses concern about this finding. "Studies like this are crucial not just to reveal concerns to human health through contaminated livestock," he said, "but to show resistance to antibiotics is a problem growing far beyond just humans. To win the fight against antimicrobial resistance, we need an all hands on deck approach, and that's why we've teamed up with leading experts in biological, social and other sciences in a joint initiative designed to find new solutions, fast."

The presence of LA [livestock-associated]-MRSA CC398 in the human food chain demonstrates, in addition to the established risk through direct contact with animals, a possible further pathway for the transmission of antimicrobial resistance from livestock to the broader human population, and not just via those with direct contact with farm animals.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, signs of MRSA infections are often confused with spider bites, as the skin tends to redden, swell or feel painful in areas where there are cuts or sores.

[The following has been extracted from my comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Staph. aureus (MRSA) - Denmark: porcine, human, ST398, increased incidence 20140827.2725468:

Colonization and infections with LA-MRSA ST398 in humans with no known contact with animals have been reported in the United States and Europe (http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/1164.long).

Livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA is largely a single clonal complex on the basis of multilocus sequence typing (ST398) and non-typeable (NT) because of the inability to type it by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using Sma-1. LA-MRSA initially was detected in the Netherlands in pigs and pig farmers in 2003. This strain of presumably animal origin (nearly 40 percent of pigs in the Netherlands have been found to be colonized by this strain) has been reported to be responsible for more than 20 percent of all MRSA infections in the Netherlands (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/568512) and has been found in community-associated human infections in several European countries, North America, and Asia. Nosocomial transmission of this strain has also been reported among patients and health care workers in the Netherlands (http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/eccmid18/abstract.asp?id=69352).

According to an investigative story in the Washington Post, of the 35 million pounds of antibiotic used in the US in 2008, 70 percent went to pigs, chickens, and cows to help prevent disease and make them grow large quickly (http://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2009/12/29/pressure-rises-to-stop-antibiotics-in-agriculture). Confinement of these farm animals at high stocking density requires use of antibiotics to mitigate the spread of disease exacerbated by these crowded living conditions. Similarly, intensive fish farming provides conditions that require large quantities of antibiotics to be added to feed (http://www.bellona.org/aquaculture/artikler/Antibiotics). Exposure to antibiotics allows survival of antibiotic resistant mutants and organisms that have acquired from other bacteria genes that encode antibiotic resistance.

Antibiotics, as well as bacteria that carry antibiotic resistance genes, from agricultural sources can enter the environment via wastewater treatment plant effluents, processing plant effluents, application of agricultural waste and biosolids to fields, and leakage from waste-storage containers and landfills and can facilitate the development and spread of antibiotic resistance (Tello A, Austin B, Telfer TC: Selective Pressure of Antibiotic Pollution on Bacteria of Importance to Public Health. Environ Health Perspect. 2012 August; 120(8): 1100-6. Published online 2012; available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3440082/). Consequently, antibiotic resistant pathogens have been found on non-farm workers and wildlife, as well as farm workers, in farm country (see ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance - USA: (IA) MRSA, wildlife 20121023.1360127). - Mod.ML
