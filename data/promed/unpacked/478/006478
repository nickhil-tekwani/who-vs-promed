Malawi: Cholera outbreak claims 51
---------------------------------------
A cycle of drought and flood in Malawi's southern and central regions has
aggravated a cholera outbreak that has claimed 51 lives so far, according
to the UN's Children Fund (UNICEF).
"Malawi is dealing with 3 crises at the same time: food shortages, floods
and cholera," said Dr Eliab Some, who heads UNICEF's health and nutrition
team in Malawi. Over 4000 cases of cholera, a disease associated with poor
sanitation, a lack of hygiene and access to potable water, have been
recorded over the past 3 months, mostly in Malawi's southern region.
The south experienced one of its worst droughts in a decade in 2005, and
persistent dry spells have forced people to move around in search of food,
exposing them to the risk of consuming contaminated food and water, which
causes cholera, explained Some. Almost half the country's population of 12
million were affected by food shortages and the lack of potable water in
2005's drought.
Many rural Malawians had also gone in search of employment in urban areas
like the commercial capital, Blantyre, in the south of the country, where
most of the cholera cases have been recorded. "The surge in the population
has led to more pressure on services, and exposure to very unhygienic
conditions," Some commented.
UNICEF said although the situation was serious, the outbreak was not as
severe as the one in 2001/02, which claimed more than 1000 lives. According
to Some, "cases of the disease have only been recorded in cholera-prone areas."
The UN body has stepped in provide chlorine for water purification and
medication to control the outbreak.

80 die as south records 4000 confirmed cholera cases
-----------------------------------------------
The International Red Cross has reported that a total of 4094 cases of
cholera, including 79 deaths, were reported in the southern Sudanese city
of Juba since the outbreak of the disease there in February 2006.
"As of 7 Mar 2006, the total number of cases of acute watery diarrhea
reported in Juba was 4094, and the number of resulting deaths 79," the
Geneva-based group said in a statement sent to news organizations in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital. Juba is the capital of the autonomous
southern Sudan region. It has a population of more than 250 000 people who
are known to rely heavily on polluted water from the River Nile.
The Red Cross said it has airlifted about 30 tons of emergency medical
supplies to Juba in response to the cholera outbreak. Its staff is helping
Juba Teaching Hospital to run and expand an isolation ward and has
installed an emergency water-supply system.
"The hospital has been admitting some 20 victims of acute watery diarrhea
per day. Other victims have received care elsewhere," said the statement.
It said cholera has been confirmed in Malakal, a major urban center on the
banks of the Nile to the north of Juba. 34 cases had been admitted to a
cholera-treatment center there run by the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres.
The 1st suspected cholera cases were reported at the end of January 2006 in
Yei, a town southwest of Juba. Since then, the disease has quickly spread.
On 6 Feb 2006, the 1st suspected case was identified in Juba, and a few
days later, the cholera outbreak was confirmed.

Cholera epidemic reaches Mozambique's Nampula province
-----------------------------------------------
Mozambique's cholera epidemic, restricted in the 1st months of 2006 to the
central provinces of Sofala, Manica and Zambezia, has now reached Nampula
in the north of the country.
According to a report in the Thu 16 Mar 2006 issue of the Maputo daily,
Noticias, the Nampula outbreak began a week ago in the districts of Malema
and Monapo.
As of Wednesday morning, 15 Mar 2006, there were 177 known cases and 5
deaths. It is believed that heavy rains in the region have contaminated
wells with fecal matter, thus ensuring the spread of the water borne
disease among the rural population.

Uganda: Strange Disease Kills 2 in Moyo
-----------------------------------------------
An abdominal infection with symptoms like those of cholera has killed 2
people in Maduga village, Obongi County. 13 others have been admitted in
critical condition to Obongi Health Center.
The signs of the disease include vomiting, watery diarrhea and rapid
dehydration. Dr Sarafin A'dibaku, the District Director of Health Services
yesterday 16 Mar 2006 said the 1st victim of the unknown infection died on
11 Mar 2006, while the 2nd died on Wed 15 Mar 2006.
A'dibaku ruled out earlier reports that the disease could be cholera.
"It is a kind of diarrhea we cannot explain, but certainly, it is not
cholera. We have just sent stool and other specimens for examination to the
government laboratory in Kampala," A'dibaku said.
He said with cholera, a patient in critical condition either dies or
recovers quickly.
"But the people admitted at Obongi Health Centre have been there for almost
a week," A'dibaku said.
Daily Monitor has learned that health educators have been put on high alert
and dispatched to inform the residents about proper hygiene practices to
prevent further spread of the illness.
In a bid to avoid getting the infection, the residents have abandoned the
tradition of shaking hands while greeting.

Concern for SA as Botswana diarrhea escalates
-----------------------------------------------
Concern is mounting that the massive outbreak of diarrhea in neighboring
Botswana could spill over into South Africa. Since January 2006, 191 deaths
from diarrhea have been recorded in Botswana, among more than 10 000 cases,
most of them in children younger than 5.
Colo Boitshoko, a spokesperson for the Botswana health ministry, struggled
to answer a question on whether the outbreak has already crossed our borders.
Boitshoko said: "It depends on what the cause is. Right now, I can't tell
you whether it will affect South Africa, but I think I've heard in the news
sometime that South Africa is also affected by the disease to a large
extent, to a certain extent; I don't know how exactly it is. It depends on
what causes it."

20 new gastro cases reported in Mumbai; cholera report soon
-----------------------------------------------
20 new cases of gastroenteritis were reported in Mumbai (Bombay) today, 20
Mar 2006, even as doctors maintained that reports of cholera could not be
confirmed until tomorrow, when test results were expected.
"20 new cases have been admitted in 4 government-run hospitals today, 20
Mar 2006, while 16 patients have been discharged. We have conducted
preliminary test on 4 patients for possible cholera, but it cannot be
confirmed until the final test results arrive," the dean of JJ Hospital,
Pravin Shingare, said.
More than 173 patients had been admitted with gastro symptoms in various
city hospitals since the past week, mainly from Crawford Market area of
south Mumbai. Since then, several have been discharged.
All of them complained of diarrhea and vomiting, common gastro symptoms.
Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) health department officials
earlier ruled out the possibility of food poisoning and said the possible
cause of the gastro outbreak could be a contaminated water supply.

_Vibrio cholerae_ found in 68 yr old
-----------------------------------------
A 68-year-old man from Mazgaon, found infected with a _Vibrio cholerae_
strain by a private laboratory, is now recuperating at a private hospital
in Byculla.
As the Mazgaon businessman recuperated, public hospitals awaited results
confirming whether the cholera bacteria had hit south Mumbai. The man
initially ignored the bouts of vomiting and loose stools that started on
Sunday night, 12 Mar 2006.
"But he did not get any better the next day and became weaker. So we rushed
him to hospital," his brother said. Doctors at the hospital were shocked by
Sadiq's rapid deterioration.
Doctors got worried when the infection began to affect his kidneys, and his
body refused to respond to standard treatment. A stool test conducted on
Tue 14 Mar 2006 produced the alarming finding: "_Vibrio cholerae_ isolated."

3 test positive for cholera
-----------------------------
3 of the 170 patients admitted to 5 state and civic-run hospitals with
suspected gastroenteritis tested positive for cholera on Thu 16 Mar 2006,
after their stool samples were tested at St George Hospital.
All 3 patients -- a watchman, a 4-year-old girl and a helper at Crawford
Market -- are South Mumbai residents and were admitted to the hospital on
Tue and Wed, 14-15 Mar 2006.
"3 samples have tested positive for cholera bacteria'" confirmed Dr Pravin
Shingare, dean of the JJ Group of Hospitals, which include JJ, Cama,
Gokuldas Tejpal and St George hospitals. "But it's only a preliminary test.
The samples will be sent for stool culture tests, and the results will be
available after 48 hours." The samples may be sent to the National
Institute of Virology in Pune.
As the number of gastroenteritis cases jumped to 170 -- more than double
the Wed 15 Mar 2006 figure of 69 patients -- with people from Colaba,
Carnac Bunder, Paltan Road, Samuel Street, Kalbadevi, Bhuleshwar, Mandvi
Koliwada, Chira Bazar and Thakurdwar streaming into hospitals, Municipal
Commissioner Johny Joseph said 47 water samples had been collected from
overhead tanks and taps in several South Mumbai chawls.

3 cases of cholera in city
---------------------------
The government on Tue 14 Mar 2006 admitted that the incidence of cholera in
Bangalore is a cause for concern, and Health Minister R. Ashok announced
plans to contain its outbreak on a war-footing.
Speaking to press persons after a meeting with officials of the Health
Department, Bangalore Mahanagara Palike and the Bangalore Water Supply and
Sewerage Board, Mr. Ashok said cholera had been confirmed in 3 persons
after 97 cases were investigated in Jakkarayanakere and Siddhartha Nagar,
where illness from consumption of water came to light a week ago. He said
the reported death of a person from Jakkarayanakere was not due to cholera.
Mr. Ashok said all precautionary measures are being taken, particularly in
the slums where the residents are most vulnerable because of water
contamination. Halogen tablets to clean the water, and acid wash for
toilets are being supplied. He said 14 ambulances have been kept ready at
various locations to speedily transport emergency cases to hospitals.
The areas identified as being susceptible are the slums in Chamarajpet,
Jagjivanramnagar, Koramangala, Kadugondanahalli, Banashankari, and
Yeshwanthpur. The sale of ice manufactured under unhygienic conditions
being one of the main causes of the spread of cholera, a circular will be
issued to ban its sale immediately.
Everyday, an average of 23 patients with symptoms of cholera or
gastroenteritis are admitted to hospitals, and the BMP and the BWSSB have
been told to be on 24-hour watch. The BWSSB had been asked to replace old
and leaking pipes, which could spread the infection, and ensure that the
water supplied to vulnerable areas is adequately treated.
