[In the message concerning pertussis in Switzerland cited above the only
concrete information that we are given for a relation between whooping
cough and _Bordetella pertussus_ is that [the PCR for _B. pertussis_ was
positive in 26% of cases.
What about the other cases: how sensitive /specific is PCR in such setting?
How
many of the 74% of the remaining cases are/ or could also be due to _B.
pertussis_?
And what about the [fraction of the 74% of cases who cannot/could not be
accounted
by _B. pertussis_ (what diagnosis? what relevance with vaccination for _B.
pertussis_, what relevance with [infectious agenta)?

[ProMED-mail would appreciate comments from anyone associated with the
Sentinella study who is knowledgeable about the PCR data as they relate to
the numbers of pertussis cases reported, and any available clarification of
the diagnosis of PCR-negative cases. - Mod.ES
