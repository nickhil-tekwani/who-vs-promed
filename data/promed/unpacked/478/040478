Rabies on the rise in Kampala and Wakiso
----------------------------------------
There has been an increase in the number of animal bites in Kampala and
Wakiso districts. According to a report by the health ministry, 23 cases of
suspected rabies were registered in Kampala and 35 in Wakiso in the 2nd
week of this month [April 2009]. A total of 290 cases of animal bites were
recorded countrywide, the report said.

Dogs and cats are the most renowned carriers of rabies and transmit the
virus to humans through saliva by biting them. Although there are no deaths
recorded yet, the number of animal bites in the 2 districts has increased,
indicating a rise in unimmunised animals in the 2 districts.

Kampala City Council (KCC) spokesperson Simon Muhumuza blamed the increase
in animal bites on overcrowding. "Kampala district is 195 square kilometers
[75.3 square miles] with 2 million people, most of them living in a crammed
environment. So, this puts them at a high risk of animal bites," he
explained. Muhumuza called upon the public to keep their animals indoors,
adding that stray animals would be killed.

Attempts to get a comment from the KCC health inspector, Dr Mesach Mubiru,
and Wakiso district health director, Dr Emmanuel Mukisa, were futile as
their phones were switched off.

[The 58 cases of suspected rabies recorded in Kampala and Wakiso in
mid-April 2009 is a very high number. No fatalities have occurred. It is
not clear to what extent this is due to post-exposure vaccination and to
incorrect diagnosis. The statements are confusing. Exposure to dog bites is
obviously a serious problem but difficult to evaluate the situation in the
absence on information on the prevalence of rabies virus infection in the
canine population. Further information would be welcomed regarding the
prevalence of canine and human rabies in Uganda. - Mod.CP]
