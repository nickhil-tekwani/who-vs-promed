South Africa: FMD outbreak in cattle
------------------------------------
The agricultural authorities in South Africa reported an outbreak of
foot and mouth disease [FMD], type SAT1, in cattle. 6 animals were
affected in a village situated on the border between an FMD infected
zone, the Kruger National Park, and the FMD buffer zone. The affected
cows were identified at a dip tank, and 727 cows were considered
susceptible.

The outbreak will not have an effect on the FMD-free status of South
Africa. Vaccinations will commence and back and forward tracing of
recent movements are being done.

[According to information from the Web site of the World Reference
Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD Pirbright), all 3 SAT types are endemic in
the Kruger National Park buffalo population. The most recent South
African outbreaks in cattle, reported by WRL, were the following: SAT1
(2000), SAT2 (2001), SAT3 (2006), O (2000). The latter (FMDV-O) was an
outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal of an exotic strain, introduced from the Far
East.

The current information on FMD-SAT1 outbreak is regarded as
"suspected" until officially confirmed (or otherwise). The exact
location, including the administrative affiliation of the outbreak,
has not been named in the item; a map is available at the above URL. -
