State warns of surge in EEE cases in horses
-------------------------------------------
State officials are warning horse owners to get their animals vaccinated
against eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] after a surge of reported cases,
especially in areas where the disease is less common. There have been 16
confirmed cases statewide this year [2010], which is a normal number, but
officials say 7 of those were reported on Wednesday, 23 Jun 2010.

"Most of the cases have been in the central and north central part of the
state which is normal. But we are also seeing increased EEE and West Nile
virus activity in sentinel chickens in the southern part of the state,
including Martin County which has not had EEE detected in 30 years," state
ag commissioner Charles Bronson said in a news release. He also noted a
confirmed case in Collier County. That horse, which lived near Wilson
Boulevard North in the north western part of the county, was euthanized on
9 Jun 2010.

EEE is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system and is
transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs include fever,
listlessness, stumbling, circling, and coma, and in 90 per cent of cases
the disease is fatal.

Bronson says EEE is preventable, and urges all horse owners to check with
their veterinarians on their animals' vaccinations and/or booster shots.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a mosquito virus that in horses is
very preventable with a vaccine. Several of the encephalitides are combined
into one vaccination. A vaccination includes West Nile virus, eastern and
western equine encephalitis, and often tetanus. Although the vaccine needs
to be repeated in about 3 weeks for the animal to develop complete
immunity, it takes very little to protect the horse. There are vaccinations
available with different combinations than those listed above. If a horse
develops EEE, it is not contagious to other horses or to humans. It is the
mosquito that transmits the virus.

The season for EEE is starting early this year (2010). Horse owners, please
vaccinate your animals.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans by the
bite of an infected mosquito. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a rare
illness in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the United States
each year. In those cases that do occur, they are generally located in the
Atlantic and Gulf Coast states (see map at
<http://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/tech/epi.html#map>). Most
people infected with EEEV have no apparent illness. Severe cases of EEE
(involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the
sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may
then progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma. EEE is one of the
most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United States with about
33 per cent mortality and significant brain damage in most survivors. There
is no specific treatment for EEE; care is based on symptoms. You can reduce
your risk of being infected with EEEV by using insect repellent, wearing
protective clothing, and staying indoors while mosquitoes are most active.
If you think you or a family member may have EEE, it is important to
consult your health care provider for proper diagnosis.
