SA Health has identified multiple people who had contact with the patient, of whom 8 people have been directed to receive clearance antibiotics.

Meningococcal health information has been distributed to contacts in accordance with the Invasive Meningococcal Disease Communicable Diseases Network Australia: National Guidelines for Public Health Units.

There have been 5 cases of invasive meningococcal disease reported in South Australia this year [2022], compared to 3 cases recorded at the same time last year [2021]. Of the 5 cases, all have been typed as serogroup B.

[The news report above says there have been 4 other cases of serogroup B meningococcal meningitis so far this year (2022) in the Australian state of South Australia, but we are not told if there is any epidemiologic linkage between these cases. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is usually due to one of 6 serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, and Y) of _Neisseria meningitidis_. In Australia, serogroups B, W, and Y account for most cases of IMD, with serogroup B accounting for about 50% of cases (https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-meningococcal-W.htm).

Following the mass introduction into the population of a meningococcal vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically. In Australia, following the introduction of the conjugate meningococcal C vaccine in 2003, there was a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf).

In Australia, a single funded dose of conjugated meningococcal ACWY vaccine (MenACWY) is now scheduled at 12 months of age. A single dose of conjugated MenACWY vaccine is also given to adolescents through a school-based program (14-to 16-year-olds) (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule#national-immunisation-program-schedule-from-1-july-2020).

Invasive meningococcal disease is more common in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/meningococcal-vaccines-in-australia-a-2019-update). In 2019, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had a 10-fold greater incidence of meningococcal disease than the non-indigenous across the same age-groups.

For all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (MenB) is given at 2 and 4 months of age (can be given from 6 weeks of age) (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule#national-immunisation-program-schedule-from-1-july-2020). Additional doses of MenB and MenACWY is given for children with specified medical risk conditions, such as splenia/hyposplenia, complement deficiency, and those undergoing treatment with eculizumab (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule#national-immunisation-program-schedule-from-1-july-2020).

South Australia (SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. Its population of about 1.77 million people is the most highly concentrated, with more than 75 percent of South Australians living in the capital city, Adelaide, or its environs; other population centers in the state are relatively small (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia).
