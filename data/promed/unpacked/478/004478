Russia: 19 People in Ulyanovsk Region Bitten by Rabid Dog
--------------------------------------------------
In the Zavolshsk district of the Ulyanovsk region, a rabid dog has bitten
19 people, more half of whom are children. The dog was caught and brought
to a veterinary service clinic where the diagnosis was confirmed. All those
known to have been bitten by the dog have been vaccinated, and according to
the Gazeta.Ru newspaper, their lives are no longer considered to be at risk.
However, physicians are worried that other people possibly bitten by the
dog might have suffered only minor injury and have not sought medical
attention. As a consequence all local radio and television channels are
broadcasting information warning of the danger and stressing the necessity
for immediate vaccination of feral and domestic dogs.
