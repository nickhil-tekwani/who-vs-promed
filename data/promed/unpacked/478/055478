State health officials are potentially investigating 58 cases of blastomycosis linked to the Little Wolf River in Waupaca County. The Department of Health Services says it now has 29 confirmed cases -- 3 more than a week ago -- and 29 probable cases -- 7 more than it was testing last week [week of 24 Aug 2015].

Blastomycosis is caused by inhaling spores from a fungus in the soil where there's decaying matter, like leaves or logs. When the soil is disturbed, the spores are kicked up and become airborne.

The outbreak started over Memorial Day weekend [23-25 May 2015]. Most of the patients being treated for the infection spent time near the Little Wolf River near New London [Wisconsin].

People who are infected may develop a cough, fever, chills, muscle aches, joint pain or chest pain. Health officials say it can take 2 to 15 weeks for symptoms to appear. Anyone with these symptoms should see a health care provider. It's important to let them know if you've been in areas near the Little Wolf River.

About half of people who are infected won't develop any symptoms. But if symptoms do develop, the infection can progress, attack multiple organ systems, and become fatal if left untreated.

[ProMED-mail reported one week ago a total of 18 (now 29) confirmed cases and 13 (now 29) probable cases of blastomycosis linked to the Little Wolf River in Waupaca County, Wisconsin (ProMED-mail post Blastomycosis - USA (03): (WI) more cases, RFI 20150825.3596046).

The initial 4 cases were associated with tubing on the Little Wolf River. However, we are not told whether these additional cases were linked to tubing on the Little Wolf River or to some other type of activity. Their exposure likely started on Memorial Day weekend (23-25 May 2015), but we don't know if it is thought that the exposure is continuing. More information would be appreciated in this regard from knowledgeable sources.

A photo of the Little Wolf River is available at the source URL. A map showing the location of the Little Wolf River tubing campground in Waupaca County, 6 miles (about 10 km) west of the town of New London, can be found at https://goo.gl/bLtUWg. A map of Wisconsin showing the location of its counties can be found at http://geology.com/county-map/wisconsin-county-map.gif. The length of the tubing trip is either 1.5 or 4 miles (2.4 or 6.4 km) down the not very rapid Little Wolf River (http://wolfrivertrips.com/river-trips/first-time-tubing-useful-info/).
