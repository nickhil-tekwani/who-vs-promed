I hereby inform you about the appearance of foot-and-mouth disease in a pig farm near Fasuta, Upper/Western Galilee, located approximately 4 km northeast of Ma'alot Tarshiha and at a distance of about 4 km from the Lebanese border. This is a relatively isolated holding which includes over 2200 pigs, of which 250 are sows.

The clinical findings, seen in one group of the sows, included blisters and erosions on the muzzle, tongue, gums, lips, teats and hooves. About 120 out of the 150 present young piglets died. From samples submitted to the Kimron veterinary institute, FMD virus has been isolated; serotyping is pending.

The control measures immediately applied included the setting up of a 3-km protection zone and a 10-km surveillance zone. A map and a list of the municipalities within the zones are attached. [The number of municipalities within the 3 and 10 km zones are, respectively, 4 and 27].

Additional instructions and updates will become available on the Veterinary Services' website.

[For the location of Fassuta, see maps at http://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/Fassuta and http://tinyurl.com/nwvpvfs. In this area there is a relatively dense population of wild boars. It will be interesting to investigate the possible role of these animals as transboundary transmitters of the virus from Lebanon's territory, where they are similarly abundant and may get infected from livestock. Such studies deserve to be undertaken on both sides of the border.

FMD affects, in the Middle East, almost exclusively ruminants (sheep, goats, cattle), rarely seen in domestic pigs (regarded unholy according to Islam and Judaism). The last outbreak in pigs in Israel was reported in 1976. It was caused by FMDV-O; in Bulgaria, FMD cases in domestic pigs, similarly caused by serotype O, were reported in 2011 following the detection of the disease in wild boars and in cattle; see 20110111.0125). Almost the entire domestic pig population of Israel (according to OIE's 2014 data, 200 000 head) is kept in the Western Galilee, an area with a considerable Christian population. In fact, the maintenance of pigs in other regions is banned by law for traditional/religious reasons.

The epidemiology of FMD in the wild boar has received some attention in Israel throughout the years. In 1992, wild pigs with typical FMD foot lesions were discovered on the Lebanese border, and FMDV serotype O was identified. The same virus was found to affect, at the same time, grazing beef cattle in the same area. Between 1987-1999, a total of 740 wild boar sera were sampled in the upper Galilee and adjacent regions of northern and north-eastern Israel, adjacent to the Lebanese, Syrian and north Jordanian territories, 108 (14.6 percent) of which were found SN (seroneutralisation) positive. In 2007, 21 serum samples were collected from wild boars in 3 locations in northern Israel, of which 18 (85.7 percent) were found positive (ELISA NSP tests). Of these samples, 7 came from a location adjacent to the current outbreak (see 20070517.1571).

Results of the serotyping and genotyping of the current pig outbreak are anticipated with interest, as well as information on the vaccination history of the farm (FMD annual vaccination is compulsory in Israel). The most prevalent serotype in the Middle and Near East is O, followed by A and Asia 1. Rare introductions of SAT 1 and SAT 2 have been recorded.

We have been informed that a preliminary report on this event has already been submitted to the OIE. - Mod.AS
