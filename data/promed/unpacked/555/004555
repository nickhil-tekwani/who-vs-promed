[With 5 new cases, the incidence of Lassa fever cases may be slowing and perhaps ending for this transmission season, although the Lassa fever virus transmission season usually lasts into June, so a few more cases might occur. The graphs of the epidemic curves continue to indicate that the peak number of cases nationally has passed. This outbreak has been wide-spread, occurring in 21 states and 71 local government areas. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in this area.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus, _Mastomys natalensis_ can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis and _M. erythroleucus_ and _Hylomycus pamfi_ at: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. They can be accessed at the source URL above.
