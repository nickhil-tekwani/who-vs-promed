Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Antibodies of classical swine fever (CSF) were found during CSF state surveillance programme in wild boars on 15 Oct 2012.

[Classical swine fever (CSF), also known as hog cholera, is a contagious viral disease of pigs. The causative virus is a member of the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. There is only one serotype of CSF virus (CSFV). The reservoir of the virus is the wild boar population.

For the location of the above case, on the border with Belarus, please see the interactive map at the source URL.

According to Belarus' annual report to the OIE for 2011, CSF in domestic animals was last recorded there in Aug 1995; information of CSF last occurrence in wild animals is given as "unknown."

Subscribers are referred to the following media-derived, unofficial information, cited in posting 20120305.1061612:

"On 16 Feb 2012, all pigs owned by the inhabitants of the village Neznanova in the Novogrudok district, Grodno region were collected and burned."

This message was received via Twitter@TUT.BY and was confirmed by the villagers; so far, local authorities and the veterinary station refused to comment. According to villagers, a local farmer had cases of disease in the autumn [2011]; he got rid of the pigs and did not inform the veterinary office. According to the farmers, the culling in Neznanova was carried out since "an outbreak of plague has been found." No response to ProMED-mail's RFI has been obtained.

In view of the fact that the Latvian infected boars have been detected on the border with Belarus, details on CSF surveillance in the wild boar population in Belarus, if undertaken, and particularly the lab test results, will be useful. - Mod.AS]
