Ricardo Estrada de la Torre, president of the Poultry Farmers Association in Tepatitlan, Jalisco, said a new outbreak of avian influenza virus infection was detected in a farm in the municipality of Encarnacion de Diaz.

The source said that the return of the disease was due to a breach of the targeted immunization stages indicated by the National Health Service of the Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture.

The center involved carried out the 1st vaccination of birds, but ignored the 2nd vaccination and the corresponding biosafety monitoring, and as a result had the outbreak.

The Secretariat of Agriculture ordered a definitive quarantine of area, located about 44 kilometers [27 mi] from Aguascalientes.

It was precisely in Jalisco, producer of 55 percent of the eggs in Mexico, where the disease 1st appeared in June 2012. It was declared controlled at the end of October 2012, but forced to terminate more than 22 million chickens. According to international standards, after 68 consecutive days without new cases, the disease can be declared as controlled.

Avian influenza caused losses to the industry of almost USD 753 million as a result of culling, depopulation, repopulation, loss of jobs, and investment in other products.
