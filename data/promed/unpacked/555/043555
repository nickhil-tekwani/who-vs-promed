According to reports, dozens of people have been sickened at a Boy
Scout camp in Virginia, due to an _E. coli_ outbreak. There have been
15 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ [O157:H7] among the people sickened
thus far at the popular Boy Scout camp.

The news comes from public health officials in Virginia, who have
stated that 14 Boy Scouts, as well as one adult have been sickened.
There is no word yet on the exact source of the _E. coli_ to this
point, though an investigation into the matter is ongoing.

In total, there have been over 50 Boy Scouts who have been sickened,
with 9 of them having to be hospitalized.

The Boy Scout camp is located in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia.

Boy Scout officials have closed a popular camp in Virginia's Blue
Ridge Mountains where more than a dozen Boy Scouts and one adult
contracted an _E. coli_ infection. The Goshen Scout Reservation in
Rockbridge County hosted several thousand scouts and adult leaders
and staff starting late in July 2008. At least 17 Boy Scouts and one
adult became ill, including 3 scouts who attended the camp last week
[27 Jul-2 Aug 2008].

Alan Lambert, executive of the National Capital Area Council of the
Boy Scouts of America, said Sunday [3 Aug 2008] the source of the
outbreak remains unknown. The camp will remain closed until further
notice, Lambert said.

The 4000-acre [about 1620 ha] camp, located between Lexington and
Staunton in western Virginia, includes Lake Merriweather. Nearly 1500
scouts and adult leaders and 200 staff were at the camp from 20-26
Jul 2008, and 1310 scouts and leaders attended last week, the
National Capital Area Council said.

Public health officials who visited the camp examined its food
handling and storage practices and recommended changes, said Robert
Hicks, director of the Office of Environmental Health Services.

[With cases occurring during 2 different sessions, the source of the
pathogen is not a single exposure but rather a persistent one. Food
remains high on the list, especially a vehicle that is stored frozen
such as ground beef. Waterborne _E. coli_ O157:H7 also occurs related
either to drinking contaminated water or swimming in it. - Mod.LL
