An analysis by researchers in Pennsylvania found that meat from conventionally raised poultry harbored nearly twice as much multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ as meat from antibiotic-free poultry, according to a study reported today [3 Oct 2019] at IDWeek 2019.

The findings come from a study conducted by scientists with the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Penn State College of Medicine, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that examined non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ cultures from nearly 3500 samples of chicken and turkey bought from randomly selected stores in Pennsylvania from 2008 through 2017. Analysis of the _Salmonella_ cultures found that 55% of those from conventionally raised poultry meat were resistant to 3 or more antibiotic classes, compared with 28% of the cultures from the antibiotic-free poultry meat.

_Salmonella_ is a leading cause of foodborne illness, affecting more than 1.2 million Americans each year. While most cases are self-limiting, some salmonellosis cases require antibiotics and hospitalization. Drug-resistant _Salmonella_ is harder to treat and can cause more severe and sometimes deadly infections.

"Antibiotic-resistant _Salmonella_ is a public health concern," presenting author Xin Yin, MPH, a doctoral student at Penn State College of Medicine, said in a press conference. "The key message here for consumers or the average person is that, when you go to grocery stores to purchase poultry meat, you should read the antibiotic-related production claims, and think about the rate of antibiotic-resistant _Salmonella_ before you make the purchase."

In a related study conducted by some of the same scientists, nearly one-third of _Salmonella_ cultures from poultry, ground beef, and pork samples randomly bought from stores in Pennsylvania from 2015 through 2017 were resistant to 3 or more antibiotic classes. And one-quarter of cultures from human _Salmonella_ infections collected during the same period were resistant to 3 or more antibiotic classes.

In the 1st study, Yin and his colleagues analyzed 3481 chicken and turkey samples collected for the National Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS), a program that tracks antibiotic resistance in _Salmonella_ and other potentially harmful bacteria that are commonly transmitted through food. Poultry packages with "organic," "antibiotic-free," or "no antibiotics ever" labels were considered antibiotic-free for the purposes of the study. These labels refer to antibiotics that are also used in human medicine.

Yin said they focused on poultry because it's an important vehicle for the transmission of drug-resistant enteric pathogens (bacteria that cause gastrointestinal illness), and because Americans eat a lot of chicken. "In 2019, the projected consumption of poultry meat [per capita] is around 50 kg (110 lb)," Yin said. He also noted that antibiotics have been widely used to treat illness in poultry.

Overall, the researchers found _Salmonella_ strains in 10.2% of the conventionally raised poultry meat samples (280 of 2733), compared with 5.3% of the antibiotic-free chicken and turkey samples (40 of 748). Review of antimicrobial susceptibility and whole-genome sequencing data from 320 of the _Salmonella_ isolates found resistance to 3 or more antibiotics in 55% of the isolates from conventionally raised meat (154 of 280), compared with 27.5% of the isolates in the meat labeled antibiotic-free (11 of 40).

Further analysis found that 24.3% of isolates from the conventional poultry meat (68 of 280) contained the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene blaCMY-2, which confers resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Yin said it's noteworthy that a similar study conducted 10 years ago, using far fewer samples, found no statistically significant difference in the amount of antibiotic-resistant _Salmonella_ found in conventional and antibiotic-free poultry-meat samples. He also noted that a broader analysis of the NARMS database from 2008 through 2017 confirmed the findings.

In the 2nd study, led by Nkuchia M'ikanatha, DrPH, MPH, a surveillance epidemiologist with the Pennsylvania Department of Health, the researchers set out to compare antibiotic resistance levels in _Salmonella_ isolates from retail meat samples with resistance levels from clinical isolates collected from patients with _Salmonella_ infections. They used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis -- a method of DNA fingerprinting used to investigate foodborne disease outbreaks -- to match the animal and human isolates. A total of 96 _Salmonella_ isolates collected from 2520 poultry, ground beef, and pork samples were compared with 109 clinical _Salmonella_ isolates.

In the _Salmonella_ isolates from the meat samples, 29.2% (28 of 96) were resistant to 3 or more antibiotic classes and 17.7% (17 of 96) were resistant to 5 or more classes. Four of the isolates contained genes conferring resistance to 8 antibiotic classes. The researchers also observed in the meat isolates that resistance to ceftriaxone, which is frequently used to treat severe _Salmonella_ infections, rose from 12% in 2015 to 27% in 2016, then declined to 14.7% in 2017.

In the clinical isolates, resistance to 3 or more antibiotic classes was found in 25.7% (28 of 109), and resistance to 5 or more antibiotics was found in 11.0% (12 of 109). Two of the clinical isolates carried genes that confer resistance to 8 antibiotic classes, and ceftriaxone resistance rose from 0% in 2015 to 12.5% in 2016 and 24.3% in 2017.

"The genes associated with high resistance are especially concerning because _Salmonella_ can share them with other bacteria, such as _E. coli_, and cause other multidrug-resistant infections, not just salmonellosis," said M'ikanatha, who worked on both studies. M'ikanatha added that the findings are significant because clinicians need to be aware that not all _Salmonella_ cases are caused by "garden variety" _Salmonella_. "When you have a _Salmonella_ infection where the clinician decides that antimicrobial therapy is indicated, it's very important to look at the susceptibility test results and determine whether the drug they intend to use is going to be susceptible," he said.

Federico Perez, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University and a moderator at the press conference, said the findings also highlight the important links between antibiotic use in animals and human health. "As clinicians, it is crucial to know the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in _Salmonella_ that affects our patients. Furthermore, for those interested in the science of antibiotics resistance, characterization of resistance determinants in _Salmonella_ illuminates how antibiotic use in animals raised for human consumption impacts human health, thus informing the concept of One Health," he said.

[Non-typhi _Salmonella_ (NTS) infection (salmonellosis) is a common bacterial disease that is usually limited to the intestinal tract with fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps that resolve in a few days without antimicrobial treatment (1). Life-threatening complications also may develop if the infection spreads beyond the intestinal tract (invasive NTS or iNTS), i.e., bacteremia and focal infection secondary to hematogenous dissemination (such as meningitis, osteomyelitis, or septic arthritis). Some patients are more at risk of iNTS. The frequency of iNTS varies geographically: Africa has the highest incidence (2). In this region, infants and young children are most affected by NTS infection, and higher rates of bacteremia have been reported in this age-group (3). Infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms has been associated with a higher risk of bloodstream infection and hospitalization (1).

Host factors that are known to be associated with an increased frequency of iNTS and that may contribute to the frequency of NTS bacteremia in sub-Saharan Africa include:
- HIV infection (4)
- Hemolytic anemias, such as sickle cell disease and malaria (5);
- Rotavirus infection (6); and
- Schistosomiasis (7).

People with severe NTS infections (those with severe diarrhea, high fever, or manifestations of iNTS) or at increased risk of iNTS (infants, older adults, and the debilitated or immunosuppressed) are commonly treated empirically with fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or with extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone, until susceptibility data become available. Resistance to antimicrobial agents among NTS is rising and varies by serotype and geographic region. Where fluoroquinolone resistance exceeds 10% (e.g., Latin America or Asia), azithromycin is an alternative agent for adults and can be used for children (1).

Antimicrobial resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics such as ceftriaxone is conferred by AmpC beta-lactamases or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) (8). These resistance genes are frequently encoded on mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids, that can make antimicrobial resistance highly transmissible between bacteria. For patients with iNTS who are resistant to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, carbapenems may be the last drug of choice.

The US government suggests that consumers can help protect themselves from these foodborne bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, by following 4 basic food safety tips: clean (wash hands, utensils, and surfaces often), separate (don't cross-contaminate), cook to the right temperature and keep food hot (140 deg F or above) after cooking, and chill (refrigerate and freeze food properly) (9).
