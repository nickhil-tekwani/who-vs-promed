The World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard shows a case count of 3433 today [18 Feb 2020], with a single newly confirmed case. The death toll is now 2249 in an outbreak that has lasted 18 months in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

The WHO said 334 suspected cases are currently under investigation. According to the latest weekly report from the WHO's African regional office, only one case has been reported in the past week, from Beni. In the past 3 weeks, 11 cases have been recorded.

"Beni remains the main hotspot for the continuing EVD outbreak as the number of new cases keep lowering," the WHO said. "While there is room for cautious optimism around the decline in new confirmed cases, continued access and heightened vigilance is required to maintain case investigation and contact tracing activities in all health zones."

Beni has reported 90% of cases in the past 21 days.

[This is wonderful news, a single newly confirmed case. However, the community must continue to remain alert because one case can rather quickly become many cases. The DRC really needs to get to zero cases if possible. But even with that goal achieved, preparedness for the next outbreak must be maintained and surveillance continued. - Mod.LK]

WHO: 4 African countries license Ebola vaccine
--------------------------------------------------
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, Ghana, and Zambia have licensed Merck's Ervebo -- the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine -- according to the WHO.

The move allows Merck to stockpile the vaccine and distribute it to countries most at risk of ebolavirus disease outbreaks. Once licensed, the vaccine can be used outside of research protocols and clinical trials.

"The approval of the Ebola vaccine by these countries is another milestone in the fight against this unforgiving disease," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, in a news release. "Africa has rallied to cement hard-fought progress to keep its people safe from Ebola."

Ervebo has been used on almost 300 000 people in the DRC since August 2018, when the country's current Ebola outbreak began. Preliminary studies suggest the vaccine is 97.5% effective in preventing Ebola transmission.

Weekly bulletin on outbreaks and other emergencies
Week 7: 10-16 Feb 2020
Data as reported by 16 Feb 2020

The ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to improve. Since our last report on 9 Feb 2020 (Weekly Bulletin 6), one new confirmed case and 2 new deaths have been reported in Beni Health Zone. In the past 21 days (26 Jan-15 Feb 2020), 11 new confirmed cases have been reported from 4 health areas in 2 health zones. Beni remains the principal hot spot of the outbreak in the past 21 days (91%; n = 10) and remains the only health zone to report new confirmed cases in the past 7 days.

As of 15 Feb 2019, a total of 3432 EVD cases, including 3309 confirmed and 123 probable cases, have been reported. To date, confirmed cases have been reported from 29 health zones: Ariwara (1), Bunia (4), Komanda (56), Lolwa (6), Mambasa (82), Mandima (347), Nyakunde (2), Rwampara (8) and Tchomia (2) in Ituri Province; Alimbongo (5), Beni (720), Biena (19), Butembo (295), Goma (1), Kalunguta (198), Katwa (653), Kayna (28), Kyondo (25), Lubero (31), Mabalako (463), Manguredjipa (18), Masereka (50), Musienene (85), Mutwanga (32), Nyiragongo (3), Oicha (65), Pinga (1) and Vuhovi (103) in North Kivu Province; and Mwenga (6) in South Kivu Province.

As of 15 Feb 2020, the total number of health workers affected remains at 172, representing 5% of confirmed and probable cases. Contact tracing is ongoing in 2 health zones. A total of 1972 contacts are under follow-up as of 15 Feb 2020, of which 1814 (90%) have been seen in the past 24 hours. In Beni, the proportion of contacts followed was 91%. Thirty-five of 50 health zones raised alerts on 15 Feb 2020. Of 5229 alerts processed (of which 5196 were new) in reporting health zones on 15 Feb 2020, 5183 were investigated and 504 (9.7%) were validated as suspected cases.

- Tue 18 Feb 2020. Ebola outbreak fact sheet no. 4
[ReliefWeb, abridged, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/democratic-republic-congo-ebola-outbreak-fact-sheet-4-fiscal-year

Highlights
----------
- USAID provides more than USD 52.6 million in additional funding for ebolavirus disease (EVD) preparedness and response efforts;
- Health actors, including USAID/OFDA partners, respond to case cluster in Beni;
- Insecurity continues to disrupt EVD response activities and hinder access in affected areas.

Key developments
----------------
- USAID is providing more than USD 52.6 million in additional funding to support ongoing EVD response activities within the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), as well as EVD preparedness efforts in Burundi and South Sudan. The funding includes approximately USD 50.4 million from USAID/OFDA to support public health interventions, complementary programs intended to address other key needs in EVD-affected areas, humanitarian coordination and information management (HCIM) services, and logistics support. In addition, the total includes USD 2.2 million from USAID/GH to provide critical EVD preparedness support in areas at risk of virus transmission.

- The Government of the DRC (GoDRC) Ministry of Health (MoH) recorded 10 confirmed EVD cases from 27 Jan-16 Feb 2020, the 3 most recent epidemiological weeks. Despite low recent weekly case counts, response actors report continued gaps in surveillance and other response activities following the recent detection of a cluster of confirmed EVD cases with epidemiological links to a private health facility in Beni Health Zone's Kanzulinzuli health area, North Kivu Province. In response to the case cluster, USAID/OFDA partners are increasing support for community engagement and infection prevention and control (IPC) activities in and near Kanzulinzuli.

- Armed group activities in and around EVD-affected areas -- including attacks in southern Mandima Health Zone, Ituri Province, by suspected Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) elements in early February [2020] -- continue to disrupt response efforts and restrict access for EVD response teams, jeopardizing recent progress in interrupting virus transmission.

[One hopes that the continued low number of cases is not artificially low due to lack of identification of cases as a result of the armed group activity. - Mod.LK
