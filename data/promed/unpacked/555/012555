CJD & SQUIRREL BRAIN CONSUMPTION - USA (02)

A tentative warning against eating squirrel brains was published in a
Research Letter in this week's issue of The Lancet. A research team at
the University of Kentucky reported on a possible link between the
consumption of squirrel [genus _Sciurus_] brains, a practice found in some
rural parts of the United States, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).
Spongiform encephalopathies have been reported in a variety of large and small
mammals. Dietary transmission of prion diseases has been documented
experimentally in animals and in humans who are cannibals. Several case
reports have suggested the possibility of transmission of CJD by consumption
of brains of wild animals. These observations, together with recent concerns
about the transmission of a variant of CJD to humans believed to be related
to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, led these investigators to examine the
possible association of eating squirrel brains with CJD in rural Kentucky,
where eating squirrel and other small game is not uncommon. Joseph Berger,
Erick Weisman and Beverly Weisman of the University of Kentucky reported on
five patients, aged between 56 and 78, who had been diagnosed as having CJD.
All of them reported that they had eaten squirrel brains. Among 100 people
of similar age who had no neurological disease, 27 reported eating squirrel
brains. A big unanswered question is whether the disease occurs in squirrels.
CDPC Note: How would you diagnose a "mad-squirrel"?

Not having access to the Lancet report, it's difficult to evaluate the
statistical reliability of the data. But this report raises questions: Do
squirrels get spongiform encephalopathy? Is there a species heirarchy in the
capacity of the protein(s) involved to produce/induce the necessary
conformational change(s)? Does the incidence with which scrapie, BSE, etc.
occur increase with greater cross-species feeding of nervous tissues? i.e.,
does incidence of scrapie increase with feeding of cattle tissue from cattle
that in turn were fed sheep tissues?

I heard a brief mention on KABC radio, of a case, or possibly 2, of CJD in
people who had eaten squirrel brains. Usually KABC gets their items from a
published article [In this instance it was either the New York Times or The
Lancet]. It might be another item from one of those weekly papers you see in
the supermarket checkout lines.
I was on a backpacking survival trip in the high sierra a few weeks ago. We
caught several marmots [probably the yellowbelly marmot, _Marmota
flaviventris_] (similar to eastern woodchucks [_Marmonta monax_]) and ate
them. One participant who grew up on wild caught game ate the brains (which
weren't as well cooked as the rest of the meat). He said this was considered
a delicacy and they ate them all the time when he was a child.

[Keep in mind that no squirrels have been tested for "mad squirrel disease".
Although I wouldn't doubt for a minute that there is at least one squirrel
(genus _Sciurus_) retrovirus, as far as I know, none has been reported. This
sequence redefines the term "squirrely" but it is intriguing. -- Mod CHC]
