The number of people infected with a contagious diarrheal disease [cryptosporidiosis] continues to grow in central Ohio and public health officials say poor home hygiene could be to blame. This year's [2016] cases of diagnosed cryptosporidiosis spiked to 423 [Mon 31 Aug 2016], up from 250 last week, marking a nearly 70 per cent increase in just a few days, according to Jose Rodriguez, spokesman for Columbus Public Health.

The 2-county outbreak is the largest one that health departments in Columbus and Franklin and Delaware counties have seen in 15 years. On average, the entire state typically logs about 400 cases of cryptosporidiosis in a year, said Melanie Amato, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health.

Since declaring it a community outbreak on [11 Aug 2016], health officials have emphasized the parasitic disease's ability to spread quickly through water in swimming pools, splash pads, and water parks. But the highly contagious illness also can be transferred through human-to-human contact in homes, schools, and daycare centers -- the likely cause of many recent cases, said Dr Teresa Long, the city's health commissioner. "We're seeing more transmission within families, which is one reason why the number is going up so fast," Long said.

Of this year's [2016] 423 central Ohio cases, 249 are in Columbus, 130 are in Franklin County, and 44 are in Delaware County. About 60 per cent of the patients are younger than 18 years old.

Cryptosporidiosis is caused by a microscopic parasite that is spread through feces and can cause infection when swallowed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The parasite most commonly moves through water and is resistant to chlorine disinfection. If people who are sick don't regularly wash their hands, especially after using the restroom, they can contaminate objects and spread cryptosporidiosis by people touching that object and then their mouth, Long said. And a sick person can spread the germs several days after diarrhea subsides, sometimes as long as 2 weeks after, Long said.

As families gather over Labor Day weekend [3-5 Sep 2016], it's crucial to practice good hygiene if an infected person is present, she said. That includes regularly disinfecting shared spaces and objects in kitchens and bathrooms, and practicing frequent hand-washing with soap and water. The cryptosporidiosis germ is hardy and gel hand sanitizers likely won't kill it.

Health officials already have reached out to pool operators and physicians about the outbreak, and are working with schools and day-care centers. Many area pools have been "hyper-chlorinated" to flush out traces of the disease before the pools close for the season. But because infected people stay contagious for so long, "we haven't seen the numbers stabilize yet," Long said. "We'd like to get to that plateau phase very soon."

Symptoms of cryptosporidiosis include watery diarrhea, stomach pains, and vomiting. The disease can be serious for people with compromised immune systems. It typically isn't life-threatening in healthy people, but it's important to stay home and hydrated if you're experiencing frequent diarrhea, officials say.

Cryptosporidiosis often occurs in isolated cases. Outbreaks are less common. Central Ohio most recently encountered this many cases in 2008, when Delaware and Franklin counties saw nearly 350 cases, Rodriguez said.

Most counties across Ohio have reported just a handful of cryptosporidiosis cases this summer [2016], according to data provided by the Ohio Department of Health. Union County, which borders Delaware County, reported 34 infected people. Stark County, in northeast Ohio, reported 20 cases.

[It is an interesting hypothesis that the spread of infection is due to spread in families which then contaminate new common water recreational areas. However, a link to the water supply to the area is important to exclude. - Mod.EP
