As many as 86 patrons and 3 workers may have contracted salmonellosis from a popular Las Vegas restaurant that shut down following a health inspection, according to the Southern Nevada Health Department (SNHD). Officials for the county's health authority spoke on Thu 2 May 2013 on details of the bacterial outbreak that forced the temporary closure of Firefly restaurant and its sister business Dragonfly restaurant on Paradise Road this week.

In a news conference, SNHD officials said at least a dozen people were hospitalized due to the salmonella outbreak. They believed those who ate food from the restaurant on 21-25 Apr 2013 were affected. Three employees also were affected in the outbreak, officials said at the news conference.

Health officials said they were looking at 10 menu items to see whether any of those were the cause of the outbreak.

In an interim report by SNHD, inspectors found improperly stored food in inadequate temperatures, when it cited Firefly restaurant on 44 demerits. The eatery was also cited for employees handling food without gloves and preparing food next to cleaning chemicals.

Dragonfly, which is located next to Firefly, was also cited for 47 demerits connected to its sister restaurant's inspection.

The SNHD interim report also marked 30 demerits for the local restaurant chain's W. Sahara Avenue location and 6 for the S. Eastern Avenue location. The citations stemmed from a 29 Apr 2013 inspection, according to the report. "People have gotten sick here, and we're trying to get to the bottom of it and figure out what happened," said Firefly owner John Simmons.

"It could come from an employee or person that currently has it that is working in the establishment and handling ready-to-eat foods without practicing good hygienic practices," said the SNHD's Amy Irani.

[The serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ involved in this outbreak has not yet been reported. Having restaurant workers involved in an outbreak does not infer the source being the food worker, as they too could have ingested the vehicle of transmission. A well performed food diary from individuals who became ill compared with those patrons who did not become ill may implicate a source. - Mod.LL
