Hepatitis E virus genome sequences detected in pork livers in supermarkets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genome sequences has been detected in pork livers
sold at supermarkets, a team led by a medical university professor has
found. Professor Hiroaki Okamoto of Jichi Medical School in Tochigi
Prefecture will report these findings in a British medical journal.
However, he said the chance of infection with HEV from pork livers is slim.
"You can't get infected with HEV from eating pork flesh. And you don't have
to worry about pork livers if you sufficiently heat them up before eating."
In his research, Professor Okamoto purchased 363 packs of pork livers at
supermarkets in Hokkaido and detected HEV genome sequences in 7, or 1.9 per
cent of them. The sequence found in 3 of the 7 samples is identical to that
of the HEV virus found in a Japanese HEV patient.
Nine out of 10 HEV patients who developed illness in Hokkaido between 2001
and 2002 had eaten pork livers, according to Okamoto. Pork liver sashimi is
considered a delicacy in Japan, although many people, especially women,
find it revolting.

[It is likely that farmed pigs as well as wild-living pigs may harbour
hepatitis E virus. Transmission of hepatitis E virus infection from wild
pigs to human has been a consequence of consumption of uncooked meat, and
the same risk applies apparently to meat from farmed pigs. The low
frequency of detection of hepatitis E virus sequences in meat purchased in
supermarkets, however, could be explained also by contamination of the pig
meat from a human source during its preparation for sale. - Mod.CP]
