Sudanese celebrate Eid in turmoil over slaughter
------------------------------------------------
Sudanese celebrated the Muslim sacrificial holiday of Eid al-Adha on
Wednesday [19 Dec 2007] but many were cautious about slaughtering animals
after an outbreak of the Rift Valley fever virus. The Health Ministry said
that as of 16 Dec 2007 there were 565 cases of haemorrhagic fever reported
in humans. "The fatality rate is 29 per cent (with) haemorrhagic fever.
(And) we have about 5 or 6 cases of eye manifestation [an infrequent
consequence of Rift Valley fever - Mod.CP]," said spokesman Magdi Saleh.
But the government denied there were any confirmed cases in cattle, a main
source of income for many Sudanese in the agricultural economy, or in
sheep. Rumours of the virus caused panic among Sudanese Muslims as they
celebrated Eid al-Adha which began on Wednesday with the slaughtering of
sheep to remember Abraham who was prepared to sacrifice his son for God. "I
am still not sure whether to slaughter or not," said trader Mohamed Omer.
He said he did not trust the government's directive to go ahead and
slaughter sheep for the holiday.
Rumours of dead animals in Khartoum with blood streaming from their mouths
are rife. Some of the poor who go to people's houses during the holiday to
get food refused to take raw meat this year. The price of powdered milk
rose in the market as people became too scared to drink fresh milk. The
ministry of animal resources said a batch of samples of animal blood from
an isolated area in While Nile State came back 25 per cent positive for
antibodies of the virus.
"(But) the positive results were as a result of antibodies maybe due to
vaccinations or due to past infection," spokesman Abdel Moneim said. He
said the samples sent to a South African laboratory were being tested again
to see if the antibodies had increased with time, which would confirm an
outbreak of the disease. Mohamed Abdel Ghazi, a senior official from the
ministry, said they were still waiting for the results.
Rift Valley fever, named after the part of Africa in which it is prevalent,
is an animal disease which can spread to humans through mosquitoes or
through contact with bodily fluid. There is no commercially available
vaccine for humans. About 1 per cent of human cases get haemorrhagic fever
bleeding from the nose and mouth, which can result in a quick death. About
95 per cent of human cases feel flu-like symptoms and then the virus
disappears after a week. Saleh said as of 1 Dec 2007 there were no new
human cases from White Nile State where the animal tests are taking place.
But cases had been recorded in 3 other states.
Vets in Khartoum criticised the government for not acting with
transparency. "The government should have been honest with the people and
talked with transparency," said one vet in Khartoum who declined to be
named. "The people got panicked." The vet said the government should have
issued guidelines on how to deal with meat and taken precautions such as
spraying pesticides given the heavier than usual rains this year.
Well-cooked meat and boiled milk is safe. "We have a history of the disease
since 1931 and some say even earlier ... this was to be expected," the vet
said. Sudan has in the past denied outbreaks of diseases. Earlier this year
Kharotum denied an outbreak of cholera in the east announced by the World
Health Organization.

[Since the last statement (by WHO) on 21 Nov 2007 the number of cases has
risen from 436 to 565, with a fatality rate estimated at 29 per cent. The
outbreak is far from contained and the above report implies that the
Sudanese government may not be responding with appropriate urgency. It
suggests that the general population is more aware of the hazards than
their central government.
In outbreaks of Rift Valley fever, the vast majority of human infections
result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected
animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of
animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal
births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses
or fetuses. Human infections also result from the bites of infected
mosquitoes. Humans may also become infected with Rift Valley fever by
ingesting unpasteurized milk or uncooked milk or meat of infected animals.
Key public health measures include social mobilization, to help people who
come into contact with cattle, sheep, and other animals to adopt safe
handling and slaughtering practices; epidemiological measures such as
active case finding; supportive clinical measures; vector control to stop
the spread of disease, primarily between animals but also from animals to
humans; and laboratory diagnosis capacity (see: Rift Valley fever - Sudan
20071103.3570).
It was reported previously (see: Rift Valley fever - Sudan (07):
20071118.3735 ) that clerics have given Sudanese Muslims the all-clear to
sacrifice animals infected by a Rift Valley fever outbreak in coming
festivities. Religious scholars have ruled that animals suspected of having
the disease will still be acceptable sacrifices for the major Muslim
festival of Eid ul-Adha, daily newspaper Akhir Lahzah reported. The Board
of Sudanese Religious Scholars ruled that Muslims were only banned from
sacrificing animals with a disease mentioned in the Hadith, a collection of
the sayings of the Prophet, the paper said.
Wisdom will be needed to achieve a balance between exercising health care
responsibilities and offending religious susceptibilities. - Mod.CP]
