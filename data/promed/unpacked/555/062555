State veterinarians are investigating a beef herd in Sargent County, North Dakota, after bovine tuberculosis was identified.

"In late 2018, we were notified that 2 adult beef cows originating from the herd tested positive for _Mycobacterium bovis_ at out-of-state slaughter plants," state veterinarian Dr. Susan Keller said. "The National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the TB diagnosis in the cows."

The herd was subsequently tested by state and federal veterinarians, and 5 additional cows have been confirmed affected. Additional testing is ongoing.

This strain of TB has not been previously identified in the USA and is most similar to cases that have been identified in Mexican cattle.

Tuberculosis is a zoonotic disease and can be transmitted from animals to humans and from humans to animals.

"An epidemiologic investigation is now underway, and further testing will be done to determine the source of the disease and to prevent its spread," Keller said. "The herd owners are fully cooperating in the investigation."

There are no other cattle herds that have direct contact with this herd. Animals that test negative for the disease may move direct to slaughter, but other movements are not allowed. Meat from animals that pass inspection is safe for consumption.

Keller said the bovine tuberculosis eradication program is a state-federal cooperative program, and the North Dakota Department of Agriculture and State Board of Animal Health typically work with USDA-APHIS Veterinary Services on disease responses. Due to the federal government shutdown, federal funding and field staff are currently limited in their ability to assist.

[A new strain of TB resembling one from Mexico was found in South Dakota in 2017 and in Canada in 2016; another new strain was found in Canada in 2019.

Bovine tuberculosis is proving difficult to eradicate. These new strains are being more frequently identified. Whether this is due to better surveillance and testing or to the organism evolving is difficult to determine. However, vigilance at the slaughter plants is critical to keeping our meat supply safe. Furthermore, NVSL is still functioning to help keep the food supply safe, regardless of the government shutdown. - Mod.TG
