Increase in tick-borne diseases, USA
------------------------------------
Rates of tick-borne infection in the United States have been
increasing dramatically since 2000. See graph at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Tick-USA.jpg>
(Lyme disease displayed as cases/100 000 to allow fit).

Although this phenomenon might reflect changes in human exposure
dynamics and artifacts of reporting and diagnosis, I suspect that
these data are related to
increasing tick and animal reservoir populations.

[ProMed-mail thanks Steve Berger for drawing attention to the recent
increased frequencies in the United States of the tick-borne
diseases: Human monocytic erlichiosis, Human granulocytic
erlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. - Mod.CP]

[Some 20+ years ago I carried out various surveys for bovine
anaplasmosis as well as my students' research. Then it had a
prevalence of around 3 percent in Louisiana because it was dependent
on haemophagous flies (horse flies) for transmission. These flies must
refeed within 2 hours to transmit this pathogen before it dies, hence
the low prevalence. We had lost our one-time heavy tick infestations
thanks to 'fire' ants (_Solenopsis invicta_) which are now found from
Florida to California, munching on ticks and anything else they can
find. Latterly they have breached the frost line and are progressing north.

This will impact on the ability of human infections (and pathogens)
to spread. It would be worth investigating if these human infections
are presently spreading or not, and their reservoirs. - Mod.MHJ]
