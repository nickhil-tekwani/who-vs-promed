While an antibiotics policy is on the anvil for the 3 major municipal hospitals in Mumbai, the majority of private hospitals, nursing homes, and standalone consultants there continue to prescribe antibiotics arbitrarily. Studies show the rate of resistance to antibiotics has quadrupled from 5 percent to 20 percent in civic hospitals. What the rate is in private hospitals remains anyone's guess.

A WHO report released on Wednesday [30 Apr 2014] warned that the world is darting towards a post-antibiotic era, where common infections and surgeries can turn fatal because of ineffective drugs. Unsurprisingly, the report has set alarm bells ringing. It says that many of the 114 nations that contributed to the study lack measures to curb drug resistance. India may be among these since it is still designing a national policy whose implementation may take years. Given the prevalence of drug resistance, years may be too long a wait.

Recently, a Nalasopara woman suffered multiple complications, necessitating 2-month hospitalization, after being infected with methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_, a hospital-acquired infection that can become life-threatening. A child birth at Cama and Albless Hospital had become near-fatal for the 33-year-old mother. In another case, a man spent about a month at PD Hinduja Hospital after contracting pneumonia and developing resistance to the medication.

"Resistance to the best of antibiotics is turning routine. Not just from hospital, people are getting resistant bugs directly from the community. We see resistance in ailments like gastroenteritis, pneumonia, typhoid and malaria," said Dr Khushrav Bhajan, intensivist, Hinduja Hospital.

Many like Dr Bhajan feel the abuse of antibiotics begins with general physicians, continues with hospitals and nursing homes operating without antibiotic stewardship, and extends to the local chemist who dispenses drugs without valid prescription. "Barring a few major hospitals, nobody has a policy to regulate antibiotic use," said Dr Lalit Kapoor of the Association of Medical Consultants. "Worse are the combinations of drugs used." Specialists concede that prescription of multiple antibiotics by doctors is sometimes at the insistence of patients wanting to recover quickly.

Appropriate drug combinations hold the key to beat resistance, said Dr Rohini Kelkar, head of Tata Memorial Hospital's microbiology department. "It is preferred to a single antibiotic regimen. The problem is that clinicians treat the bacteria, not the infection."

[This news report above refers to a recent WHO publication (1) and its summary (2), which ProMED-mail posted on 1 May 2014 (Antibiotic resistance - worldwide: WHO 20140501.2442194).

1. Antimicrobial resistance: global report on surveillance -- 2014. Full report: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/112642/1/9789241564748_eng.pdf?ua=1.
2. Antimicrobial resistance: global report on surveillance -- 2014 Summary: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/112647/1/WHO_HSE_PED_AIP_2014.2_eng.pdf?ua=1.

In this report, WHO cited increasing antibiotic resistance in the WHO South-East Asia Region, which is home to a quarter of the world's population, specifically mentioning high levels of Enterobacteriaceae resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones and high levels of _S. aureus_ infections resistant to methicillin. But the problem of antibiotic resistant pathogens in this region is much more extensive. It includes, for example, multidrug resistant _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, _Salmonella typhi_ , _Campylobacter_, and _Vibrio cholerae_, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and drug-resistant malaria parasites, as has been reported in prior ProMED-mail posts listed below.

Antibiotic resistance is not restricted just to hospitals in India, but is circulating widely in the community, and its causes are not restricted just to overuse of antibiotics by physicians or pharmacists who dispense antibiotics without valid prescriptions. Its causes are complex and will require wide-ranging efforts to control.

India is a large producer of the world's supply of generic antibiotics. In fact, India's pharmaceutical industry supplies 40 percent of over-the-counter and generic prescription drugs consumed in the United States, and the US scrutiny of Indian drug plants last year (2013) led to a flood of new penalties, including half of the warning letters the agency issued last year to drug makers (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/world/asia/medicines-made-in-india-set-off-safety-worries.html). This level of antibiotic production in India, however, poses risks to human health by exposing people and wildlife to the drugs and by creating local environmental conditions for pathogens to develop antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistant organisms and their mobile genes that encode resistance to antibiotics can be incorporated in the human microbiome and then spread in an environment of unsanitary disposal of human fecal waste and a contaminated water supply.

A study found high levels of antibiotics downstream from a waste-water treatment plant that received effluent water from 90 Indian drug production facilities near Hyderabad, India -- much higher levels than levels measured in waters that receive sewage effluent in the USA. In addition, high levels of antibiotics were found both in well water that was used for drinking by local villagers and in lakes that do not take in wastewater from the sewage plant, suggesting that drug contamination of surface, ground, and drinking water was more generalized (Fick J, Soederstroem H, Lindberg RH, et al: Contamination of surface, ground, and drinking water from pharmaceutical production. Environ Toxicol Chem. 2009 Dec; 28(12): 2522-7. doi: 10.1897/09-073.1; available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1897/09-073.1/full).

A subsequent study of DNA sampled from river sediment downstream from the Indian treatment plants identified a high prevalence of genes that encode resistance for multiple classes of antibiotics and genetic elements (including integrons, transposons, and plasmids) that transfer resistance genes from one bacterium to another. The results suggested that environmental releases of effluent contaminated with antibiotics promote resistance genes and genetic elements for their mobility. (Kristiansson E, Fick J, Janzon A, et al: Pyrosequencing of antibiotic-contaminated river sediments reveals high levels of resistance and gene transfer elements. PLoS One. 2011 Feb 16; 6(2): e17038. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0017038; available at http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017038).

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are plasmid-encoded enzymes that mediate resistance to extended-spectrum (3rd generation) cephalosporin antibiotics as well as many other beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and the monobactam aztreonam. In a study of 3004 Gram negative bacilli collected from intra-abdominal infections in the Asia-Pacific region during 2007, ESBL rates in Enterobacteriaceae were highest in India (about 70 percent or more were ESBL-producers); additionally, in India, the frequency of ESBL-producers in the community-acquired-intra-abdominal infections of 79.0 percent was virtually identical to that in hospital-acquired infections (78.9 percent) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2715591/). The very high rates of ESBL-positive strains were seen over the entire country and were not restricted to any single city or region.

Antibiotic-resistance in bacteria has been found to be about 60 times greater in May and June than other times of the year in water sampled from the Upper Ganges River in the foothills of the Himalayas, one of the most pristine locations in Asia, and linked to the annual human pilgrimages to the region, when hundreds of thousands of people visit sacred sites (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/item/water-samples-from-the-upper-ganges-river-shed-light-on-the-spread-of-potential-superbugs).

New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a plasmid-encoded enzyme that mediates resistance to almost all beta-lactam antibiotics. The gene encoding NDM-1 has been found in 51 of 171 samples of pools of water in streets or rivulets and 2 of 50 samples of public tap water collected from sites within a 12 km [7.5 mi] radius of central New Delhi (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21478057).

Acquisition of antibiotic resistant bacteria is not only a problem for Indians living in the country, but also for tourists. A study found that the risk of acquisition of an ESBL-producing _Escherichia coli_ was highest for travelers visiting India -- 88 percent of healthy Swedish volunteers traveling to India who were negative pre-travel, were colonized with ESBL-producing _E. coli_ after the trip to India (http://aac.asm.org/content/54/9/3564.full). Travel to other destinations was associated with the following rates of post-travel ESBL colonization: 32 percent for Asia (India excluded), 29 percent for the Middle East, 13 percent for Southern Europe, and 0 to 4 percent for other parts of the world.

Control of antibiotic resistance in India presents an immense challenge. These examples suggest that control in India will require not only regulation of antibiotic use and infection control in healthcare facilities, but also require much improved level of environmental sanitation, quality control and testing of drinking water, and also improved wastewater management in one of the world's largest centers for antibiotic production. - Mod.ML
