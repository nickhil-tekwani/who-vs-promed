Anthrax hits Danbury
-----------------------
Diagnosis of 2 residents raises fears, closes part of Route 37
The revelation Wednesday [5 Spp 2007] that 2 residents had contracted
anthrax raised concerns throughout the city and shut down one major
thoroughfare for more than 24 hours. Numerous city, state and federal
health, law enforcement and governmental officials joined forces to
deal with the issue, and Danbury municipal and school officials
alerted residents to the problem. In a press conference Wednesday
afternoon, officials tried to calm possible fears about the spread of
anthrax by emphasizing that the type of anthrax contracted by the
residents is not a communicable disease.
In a subsequent, hastily called press conference at 10 p.m.
Wednesday, state officials said they were preparing to take samples
from a house, a shed and some soil along Padanaram Road to see
whether any contamination had occurred. Officials said they
considered contamination unlikely and said they expected to make that
determination by midnight Wednesday. If officials do discover
contamination, they said, a cleanup would likely take several days.
According to officials, two city residents contracted cutaneous
anthrax -- a form of anthrax that develops under the skin -- last
month after working with imported animal hides used to make African drums.
The state Department of Public Health made the diagnosis official
Tuesday. They are reportedly the first cases of cutaneous anthrax in
the state in almost 40 years. That news forced the city to reroute
traffic off the heavily traveled Padanaram Road from Jeanette to
Stacey roads throughout most of the day, as city, state and federal
officials investigated the matter and removed hides from a barn used
as a workshop at 69 Padanaram Road. City and state officials refused
to give the names of the patients [one of whom is an African drummer
and drum maker.]
