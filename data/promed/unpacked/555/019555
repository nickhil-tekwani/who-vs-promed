Trace amounts of cyanide found in letter at New Jersey post office
-----------------------------------------------------------
A letter addressed to a New Jersey police department contained "trace
amounts" of cyanide that spilled onto 2 workers at Newark's main post
office, authorities said Saturday. The powdery white substance spilled onto
a postal worker and a supervisor Friday night. Tests Saturday determined
the powder was mainly laundry detergent, mixed with a small amount of
cyanide, said Tony Esposito, a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Inspection
Service. "Based on the small amount of copper cyanide, it did not pose a
hazard to anyone unless it had been ingested," he said.
The post office remained open, and the work area where the material was
spilled was cordoned off and cleaned. Postal inspectors cordoned off the
immediate area and called in the fire department's hazardous materials
unit. The post office remained open and the employees returned to work
after washing their hands. The FBI and state police are investigating.

Anthrax traces found at Washington VA hospital
--------------------------------------------------------
A mailroom in the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center has tested
positive for anthrax [_B. anthracis_], the federal agency reported
Saturday. The mailroom is located in a hospital that houses 250 patients
but is not near patient areas, said Phil Budahn, the VA's media relations
director. But, he added, hospital officials are keeping "a close eye on
patients."
Swabs were taken in the mailroom 30 Oct because the hospital receives its
mail from the main Brentwood branch post office in Washington, the facility
that processed an anthrax-laden letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle. 2 Brentwood postal employees have died of inhalation anthrax, and
2 others are hospitalized with the same disease.
Of the 22 swabs, one was positive, Budahn said. Administrators closed the
mailroom, he said.
Hospital administrators at present are not considering moving patients,
Budahn said.

NBC tape sent to New York City Hall contained anthrax
------------------------------------------------------------
New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani confirmed Sunday that a tape sent by NBC News
anchorman Tom Brokaw's office to City Hall contained anthrax. [Anthrax
spores -- no mechanical thing can suffer from the disease. Journalists
please note. - MHJ]
Giuliani said the tape was sent in the first week of October before
Brokaw's assistant tested positive for the cutaneous form of the disease.
The tape was dropped off at the City Hall police desk, then was picked up
by 2 people, including his chief of staff, Tony Carbonetti. "Tony handled
it, watched it," Giuliani said. The mayor did not elaborate on what was on
the tape, nor did he say why NBC News sent the tape to his office.
Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has vaccinated
about 140 members of epidemiologic teams that can be summoned at a moment's
notice to examine a suspected case anywhere in the country, The New York
Times reported Sunday.
While officials say there is no evidence that anyone is readying a terror
attack using smallpox, they say these steps are necessary to prepare for
any attack. Smallpox is greatly feared as a weapon because it is contagious
and has a high death rate. [This is exactly as written in the CNN report.
The suggestion is that the 140 individuals have been vaccinated against
smallpox, not anthrax. - Mod.MHJ]
Latest developments
---------------------
Elsewhere in Washington, Treasury Department officials said they were still
waiting for results of environmental testing for anthrax at an off-site
mail facility. Officials closed the facility Friday night following the
discovery by a mailroom worker of a suspicious letter with a Trenton, New
Jersey, postmark. All 3 known letters laced with anthrax in the United
States so far have been postmarked from Trenton. Results from those
environmental tests should be available sometime this weekend, said a
Treasury Department spokeswoman.
Health experts told doctors there is a clue to distinguish between colds,
flu and anthrax. They said anthrax victims do not have runny noses.

Gas Will Be Used to Kill Bacteria in Senate Office Building
------------------------------------------------------------------
ASHINGTON, Nov. 2 - Workers from the Environmental Protection Agency
finished sealing the doors and windows of the Hart Senate Office Building
today with sheets of plastic and duct tape to make it airtight in
preparation for a novel housecleaning. Sometime next week, technicians will
wheel in machines that generate chlorine dioxide, a gas that kills germs,
and the gas will be spread throughout the anthrax-infected nine-story
building using the ventilation system. Special strips with harmless
bacteria are being placed in the building and connected to computers so
scientists on the outside will be able to tell when the building is safe.
If everything works as planned, all the anthrax [_B. anthracis] spores will
be destroyed, and in a couple of weeks, the 50 senators who have offices in
the building will be able to move back in, all their possessions intact.
The approach has never been used before to decontaminate a building, and
some senators are anxious. "My impression is they're getting major stage
fright," said a staff assistant to a Senate leader. "Using the Hart
building as a guinea pig is sort of like testing a new fuel tank design for
747's on Air Force One."
But the senators had little alternative. This is the building where last
month anthrax spilled out of a letter to Senator Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, the Democratic leader. In the days that followed, anthrax
contamination was detected on the first, fifth, sixth and ninth floors and
in filters in the heating and air conditioning system. "We have to go with
what the E.P.A. recommends," the aide said. "These are the guys who clean
up Superfund sites. If it's good enough for their constituents, it ought to
be good enough for the senators."
This week, government scientists tested the technique in a big trailer in
the parking lot of the Brentwood Post Office. Chlorine dioxide killed the
bacteria in the trailer, said Tina Kreisher, a spokeswoman for the
environmental agency, but it did no damage to a computer, paper documents,
pictures, ink signatures, carpet or wood.
The other contaminated buildings on Capitol Hill -- the Dirksen Senate
building and the Longworth and Ford House office buildings -- have been
disinfected with bleach and foam. That was possible, Ms. Kreisher said,
because evidence of anthrax was found in only small amounts and limited to
a few specific sites.

[Let us pray that this disinfection works and in doing so engenders
sufficient confidence that people will return to once-contaminated
buildings which have been so disinfected. This is very important. - Mod.MHJ]
