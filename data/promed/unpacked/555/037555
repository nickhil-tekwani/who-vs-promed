An invasive mosquito species has been newly detected in Sacramento County, local officials announced Wednesday [19 Oct 2022], marking the 2nd such species found in the area since 2019.

_Aedes albopictus_, commonly referred to as the Asian tiger mosquito, was recently located in the backyard of a Carmichael resident who reported being bitten, the Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District said in a news release.

Field technicians with the district then conducted door-to-door inspections at other homes in the same neighborhood and found additional mosquitoes and larvae, according to the release.

The species joins _Aedes aegypti_, or the yellow fever mosquito, another invasive species first found in 2019 in Citrus Heights that has since been detected in other parts of Sacramento and Yolo counties.

"Now that we have found this 2nd species of invasive mosquitoes, our goal is to limit their expansion as best we can," district manager Gary Goodman said in a statement.

The Asian tiger mosquito is common in southern California but was discovered in Shasta County in 2020, according to the local mosquito control district.

Both the Asian tiger and yellow fever mosquito are "small, dark mosquitoes with white stripes on their backs and legs" that bite aggressively during the day. They each can carry viruses including Zika, yellow fever and dengue.

The vector control district will add trapping to surveil for the newly discovered mosquitoes.

District staff found a mosquito larva in a watering can of the Carmichael resident who first reported the Asian tiger mosquito. Residents are urged not to leave standing water outdoors, as mosquitoes use it to breed.

Goodman says anyone who notices mosquitoes in their yard can call the district at 800-429-1022 for a free inspection.

[Although _Aedes aegypti_ was found in Sacramento County for the 1st time in 2021 (see Invasive mosquito - USA (04): (CA) 20210912.8662561), this is the 1st time that _Aedes albopictus_ has been found there. Both species have been found in southern California in recent years and are now found further north in the state. Both species could transmit yellow fever, chikungunya or Zika viruses should a viremic individual come into areas where the mosquitoes are present. Ongoing transmission of these viruses would require abundant mosquito populations greater than those reported in California currently. Although elimination of these mosquitoes in Sacramento and other California locations is difficult, efforts by mosquito control districts can keep their numbers at low levels. - Mod.TY
