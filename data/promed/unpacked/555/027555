Pasco girl's death may have link to E. coli outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
The state's top health official confirmed, on Mon 28 Mar 2005, that the
sudden death of a Pasco County girl is being investigated as possibly
linked to an outbreak of kidney disease caused by _E. coli_ bacteria
believed to have been contracted at a fair.

Florida Health Secretary John Agwunobi said there are 14 confirmed cases of
people who attended the Strawberry Festival in Plant City or the Central
Florida Fair in Orlando in early March 2005 who have since been sick, and
who either tested positive for _E. coli_ or a kidney disease that sometimes
results from _E. coli_ infection.

Of those 14, the majority by far are in Orange County, which includes
Orlando. Agwunobi said that 9 of the victims remain hospitalized. He
declined to say what their conditions were, but said none had died. Along
with those 14 cases, state health officials are also investigating 7
suspect cases around the state, including the death of the Pasco County
girl, in which victims may have been sickened by the _E. coli_ strain or
contracted the potentially fatal kidney disease.

He said state officials were awaiting reports from the medical examiner to
help make a determination of whether she was infected with the particular
bacterium, _E. coli_ O157:H7, or had the kidney disease that sometimes
results from it, known as hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS.

Local media reports said the 12-year-old girl had a high fever and
collapsed and died on Wed 23 Mar 2005. Her family told medical
investigators that she had visited the Strawberry Festival, the St.
Petersburg Times reported.

Officials have said that contact with animals in petting zoos that were at
both fairs is one possible way victims could have contracted the bacteria.
But Agwunobi cautioned on Monday [28 Mar 2005] that officials don't know
the definitive source. "We're not sure that the petting zoos have anything
to do with this outbreak," Agwunobi said. "They are one possible source
that we are investigating." Others include the possibility that tainted
food was served at the fairs or that contact with other animals, animal
waste, or even hay might have caused the sickness.

The recent Florida HUS problem may or may not be a petting-zoo-_E.
coli_-related problem. Nevertheless, petting zoos do pose a significant
risk to children if precautions are not taken.

Those animal owners who exhibit animals in petting zoos do that for
commercial purposes. It is a nice thing for children to get to see and
touch animals, but the providing of access to animals in a petting zoo is
something that is done for commercial profit.

The risk of serious toxigenic _E. coli_ infection in children following
exposure to animals at petting zoos is well documented.

I consider it irresponsible for those running the petting zoos to fail to
ensure that the children wash their hands. I am offended that the petting
zoo operators "sell" the hand wipes rather than provide them as an
essential part of their service. The fact that the hand wipes are there and
are for sale does, in my opinion, constitute acknowledgement that there is
a need to wash hands, and the failure to provide them to unsuspecting and
susceptible children constitutes significant negligence.

[The death of the 12-year-old girl reported in the 1st posting is of
unclear etiology, but high fever is not a common manifestation of _E. coli_
O157:H7 disease. I would think her unfortunate death is of a different
etiology, despite her visit to the fair.

Regarding Dr. Johnson's comments, I personally visited the petting zoos at
the North Carolina State Fair last fall [2004], which was linked to a fair
number of _E. coli_ O157:H7 disease cases. I observed many signs regarding
the need for hand washing as well as the easy availability of both
water-based and non-aqueous forms of hand cleansing. There was no cost for
using the cleaning stations. - Mod.LL]

[OSHA does not have regulations over the animals or the workers, aside from
a requirement that a safe working area be provided. Generally, OSHA does
not regulate the zoo to the point of hand wipes. They regulate the zoo to
the point that a safe environment is provided. _E. coli_ is not on their
list. Additionally, the zoo is a private enterprise. How hand washes are to
be made available is not dictated. If the enterprising zoo elects to sell
them, it has, nevertheless, met the standard of the law. However, it was my
understanding that there were free hand wash stations available. The zoo is
not responsible for making sure the patrons use them, no more than the
department of health can force people to wash their hands after visiting
toilet facilities. - Mod.TG]
