First Report of a New Postharvest Fruit Rot on Apple Caused by _Sphaeropsis
pyriputrescens_
-------------------------------------------------
C. L. Xiao, Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center, Washington State
University, Wenatchee, WA; J. D. Rogers, Department of Plant Pathology,
Washington State University, Pullman; and R. J. Boal, TFREC, Washington
State University, Wenatchee. Plant Dis. 88:223, 2004; published on-line as
D-2003-1201-04N, 2004. Accepted for publication 5 Nov 2003.
During March to July 2003, a postharvest fruit rot was observed on 'Golden
Delicious', 'Granny Smith', and 'Red Delicious' apples (_Malus x domestica_
Borkh.) sampled from commercial packinghouses in Washington State. Losses
as high as 24 percent in storage bins were observed in July on 'Red
Delicious'. The disease started at the stem bowl area or the calyx end of
the fruit. Decayed fruit was apparently not wounded.
Decayed areas were brown and firm. Internal decayed flesh appeared
yellowish brown. On 'Red Delicious' apples, decayed fruit was apparently
discolored from red to brown. As the disease advanced, pycnidia of a fungus
might form on the stem, sepals, or the surface of decayed fruit.
Pycnidia were 0.3 to 0.7 mm in diameter, black, and partially immersed in
decayed tissues. To isolate the causal agent, decayed fruit was lightly
sprayed with 70 percent ethanol and air dried. Fragments of diseased tissue
were removed from the margin of diseased and healthy tissue and plated on
acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA). A fungus was consistently isolated
from decayed fruit with the symptoms described above.
On PDA, the colonies of the fungus first appeared with dense hyaline
mycelium and later turned light yellow to yellow. Black pycnidia of the
fungus formed on 2- to 3-week-old oatmeal agar cultures at 20 deg C under
12-h alternating cycles of fluorescent light and dark. The fungus was
identified as _Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens_ Xiao & J. D. Rogers, based on
the description of the fungus (1). Voucher specimens were deposited at the
WSU Mycological Herbarium.
2 isolates of the fungus recovered from decayed apples were tested for
pathogenicity on apple. Fruit of 'Golden Delicious' and 'Gala' were
surface-disinfested for 5 min in 0.5 percent NaOCl, rinsed, and air-dried.
Fruit was wounded with a sterile 4-mm-diameter nail head. A 4-mm-diameter
plug from the leading edge of a 3-day-old PDA culture or plain PDA
(control) was placed in the wound of each of 10 replicate fruit for each
isolate or control. Fruit was tray-packed with polyethylene liners and
stored in cardboard boxes in air at 3 deg C, and decay was evaluated 2
weeks after inoculation.
5 decayed fruits from each treatment were selected for reisolation of the
causal agent. The experiment was conducted twice. In a separate
pathogenicity test, 2 isolates (one each from apple and pear) were included
in the test. Fruit of 'Red Delicious' apple was prepared and inoculated as
the same manner described above, but fruit was stored in air at 0 deg C.
The experiment was conducted twice.
All fruit that were inoculated with the fungus developed decay symptoms. No
decay developed on fruit in the controls. The same fungus was reisolated
from decayed fruit. This indicates that isolates from apple and pear were
pathogenic to apple. _S. pyriputrescens_ is the causal agent of a newly
reported postharvest disease on 'd'Anjou' pears (1).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of this fungus causing
postharvest fruit rot on apple. We propose 'Sphaeropsis rot' as the name of
this new disease on apple and pear. Preliminary evidence suggests that
infection of fruit by this fungus occurred in the orchard prior to storage.

[This piece appears to be the first record of _Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens_
in ProMED-Plant. A related fungus, _S. malorum_, the imperfect stage of
_Botryosphaeria obtusa_, causes black rot or frogeye leaf spot of apple.
Other species of _Sphaeropsis_ infect citrus. Disease management basically
requires strict attention to sanitation in orchards and the use of an
appropriate fungicidal spray regimen.
