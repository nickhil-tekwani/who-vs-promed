Comments on the MSF report on emerging trypanosomiasis in Africa
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To visually illustrate that "... there has been a resurgence of this
disease...", I send you the attached graph, [which we cannot show in
ProMED-postings - sorry which is self-explanatory. The data are from the
Democratic Republic of Congo, for which country the statement "... because
of population displacement, political instability and collapse of health
systems caused by civil wars.." applies more than for any other.
Trypanosomiasis control in RDC has from the beginning been - and still is -
the main responsibility of FOMETRO (Fonds Medical Tropical), a Belgian NGO
working - in collaboration with the Congolese Government - essentially, but
not exclusively in that area. More recently, MSF has also started
Trypanosomiasis projects. When looking at data like those attached [see
below , it is astounding that funding agencies sometimes block funds
because of war situations, or are simply slow in releasing funds for
administrative reasons, which makes organizations like FOMETRO's work
sometimes very difficult. Despite these difficulties, FOMETRO has managed
to continue its activities in all parts of the country, even in those held
by the rebels or foreign armies, and to support local health workers and
doctors who often work under extremely constraining conditions.
MSF are [is right to say that the solution [for Trypanosomiasis control
will not likely come from the private industry. That is true also for most
tropical diseases. Fortunately, there are some notable exceptions: Tibotec,
a young but promising pharmaceutical company in Mechelen, Belgium, still
does research on Trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis, malaria, drug-resistant
TB, and of course on HIV/AIDS, which is where they started a few years ago.

Please find below the data for the graph on Trypanosomiasis in the RDCongo
(it definitely looks nicer as a graph!). Please note that I will be on a
mission in Central Africa from tomorrow morning until the beginning of
September, and reachable only on the address Années Nbre de cas dépisté

[Sorry for giving you all these numbers, but the data clearly show that the
number of registered cases of sleeping sickness in the Congo (Democratic
Republic of Congo [Democratic?) is rapidly increasing and has not been
higher since 1933. Given the current situation in the Congo, it is
reasonable to assume that most cases are not reported and the conclusion is
therefore that sleeping sickness is again rapidly becoming endemic and is
as prevalent as when reporting started in the twenties. Given all the
doctors and health workers who have worked so hard since the 1920s to
control trypanosomiasis, it is tragic that after a few years of war all of
their hard work has been destroyed. -Mod.EP
