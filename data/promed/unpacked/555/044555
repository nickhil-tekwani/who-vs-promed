Apple is known to be susceptible to various virus and viroid
pathogens. Symptomatic apple cultivars and rootstocks were collected
and analyzed by ELISA and then through RT-PCR.

The study reports the presence of _Apple mosaic virus_ (ApMV), _Apple
stem grooving virus_ (ASGV), _Apple stem pitting virus_ (ASPV), _Apple
chlorotic leaf spot virus_ (ACLSV), the major apple viruses, as well
as _Prunus necrotic ringspot virus_ (PNRSV), a minor apple virus, at
the molecular level in India. _Apple scar skin viroid_ (ASSVd)
infection was also confirmed at the molecular level. Sporadic
incidences of _Tomato ringspot virus_ [ToRSV] and _Arabis mosaic
virus_ [ArMV] infections were also detected by ELISA in nursery
plants.

[More than 10 important diseases of apple have been shown or are
suspected to be caused by viruses or viroids. They can cause symptoms
like leaf distortion, mosaic patterns, chlorosis, and stunting. Many
trees also carry one or more latent viruses which do not cause any
obvious symptoms but reduce tree vigour, lead to tree decline and may
enhance symptoms of other viruses/viroids (synergism). Both
symptomatic and latent infections of rootstocks and/or scions can
cause serious yield losses.

The pathogens can be transmitted by grafting and infected pruning
tools, and some are also spread by insect or nematode vectors, seed,
or pollen. Molecular methods, as reported above, are needed for
reliable diagnosis, and quarantine measures to prevent introduction
with new plant material are important. Disease management relies
mainly on phytosanitation (for example, disinfection of pruning tools)
and use of certified clean rootstocks and scions.
