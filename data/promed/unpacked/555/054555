The Virgin Islands Department of Education (DOE), in conjunction with the V.I. [Virgin Islands] Department of Health (DOH), is advising parents of an island-wide public health alert for St. Croix due to an outbreak of impetigo.

According to information released by DOH on Wednesday, Oct. 21, impetigo (im-puh-TIE-go) is a highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects infants and children. DOE is committed to the health and safety of all of its students, and asks that parents and childcare workers adhere to DOH guidelines.

Classic signs and symptoms of impetigo involve red sores that quickly rupture, ooze for a few days and then form a yellowish-brown crust. The sores usually occur around the nose and mouth but can be spread to other areas of the body by fingers, clothing and towels. A less common form of the disorder, called bullous impetigo, may feature larger blisters that occur on the trunk or diaper area of infants and young children. A more serious form of impetigo, called ecthyma, penetrates deeper into the skin -- causing painful fluid or pus-filled sores that turn into deep ulcers.

Impetigo is spread through direct contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. The bacteria may also be spread through contact with persons without symptoms but who carry the bacteria on their skin. Persons who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are much less contagious. Treating an infected person with an antibiotic for 24 hours or longer generally prevents the spread of the bacteria to others.

[Impetigo is a highly contagious superficial infection of the skin that especially affects the skin around the nose and mouth, but can spread to other areas around the body. Blisters burst, leaving honey-colored crusts. It is caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) or _Staphylococcus aureus_ and occurs more commonly in infants and children than adults. It is transmitted primarily from direct contact with someone who has impetigo or by contact with contaminated objects such as towels, toys, clothing, or household items.

Hot, humid weather, and the presence of eczema predispose to developing impetigo. Antibiotic therapy can shorten the course of the disease and help prevent the spread to others. The patient may no longer be contagious 24-48 hours after starting antibiotic therapy. Impetigo may be complicated by post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which cannot be prevented by prior antibiotic therapy for the impetigo.
