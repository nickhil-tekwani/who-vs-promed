Fresh outbreak of swine fever in Eastern Cape
-----------------------------------------------
Eastern Cape agriculture authorities have admitted that they don't
know whether they are winning the fight against swine fever. There's
been a fresh outbreak of the disease at KwaNobuhle in Uitenhage in
the Nelson Mandela Metro. [Map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SF/1/KwaNobuhle.html>].
Officials and state veterinarians met with the affected farmers
earlier, when it was announced that 600 pigs from the area will be
culled on Wednesday [15 Mar 2006]. Farmers have expressed concern
that the department is losing the fight against the disease, as
preventative measures have enjoyed limited success. Already, there
are fears that the pigs in the Kirkwood area could be the next in
line.
Jane Pistorius, the western region's Veterinary services manager,
says they are concerned about the disease spreading. Pistorius says
they can't really say what the disease is going to do next. She says
when there's an outbreak, they will go in and cull, and when the
virus starts spreading throughout, then they will have to depopulate
entire areas, as in other areas where entire pig populations had to
be obliterated.

[South Africa's last official update on the evolution of the CSF
(hog cholera) epizootic in the Eastern Cape Province was sent to the
OIE on 14 Dec 2005 (see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_40.HTM#Sec3>).
It included the locations of 33 outbreaks; at that point, the
estimated number of pigs exposed was 150 000, of which 131 000 had
already been culled. - Mod.AS]
