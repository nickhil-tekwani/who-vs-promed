Los Angeles County is warning its residents to look out for fleas that could be carrying typhus after more than 40 cases have been reported in the area in the last several months. "The Pasadena Public Health Department is reporting epidemic levels of typhus fever this year [2018]," the city said in a statement.

Symptoms of typhus include fever and chills, body aches, muscle pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting or rash on the chest, back, arms or legs.

Typhus is typically transferred from infected flea feces when human rub their eyes, cuts or scrapes. The disease cannot be transferred between humans.

A total of 20 cases have been reported in Pasadena, along with 12 in Long Beach and nine in the rest of Los Angeles, according to NBC.

[Los Angeles County, California, is the most populous county in the United States, with more than 10 million residents as of 2017 and is the 3rd-largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a nominal GDP of over $700 billion -- larger than the GDPs of Belgium, Saudi Arabia, Norway and Taiwan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California). Its area is larger than the combined areas of Delaware and Rhode Island, with 88 incorporated cities and many unincorporated areas. Its county seat, is the city of Los Angeles (population almost 4 million); other cities include Long Beach (population almost 0.5 million) and Pasadena (population almost 150 000 residents) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California). Long Beach, a Pacific coastal city is the 2nd busiest container port in the United States and is among the world's largest shipping ports; downtown Long Beach is approximately 22 mi (35 km) south of downtown Los Angeles, and the 2 cities share a border for several miles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California). A map of Los Angeles County can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Los+Angeles+County,+CA.

Two prior ProMED-mail posts reported on outbreaks of murine typhus in the downtown area of the city of Los Angeles (9 cases) and in Pasadena (20 cases) this year (2018) (See Also's below). The above news report adds 12 more cases in the city of Long Beach. Although murine typhus involves mainly homeless individuals in downtown Los Angeles, we have not been told which segments of the population are affected by murine typhus in the cities of Pasadena and Long Beach. - Mod.ML
