Typhoid outbreak hits Tajik capital, over 500 sick
--------------------------------------------------
More than 500 people have fallen ill with typhoid in Tajikistan's
capital Dushanbe, and authorities are struggling to limit the spread
of the disease, a health ministry official said on Thu, 23 Oct 2003.
The official said that the ministry has recorded 551 cases of
typhoid in Dushanbe so far in 2003, up from 490 cases recorded
during the same period in 2002. "No deaths have been registered,"
the official told Reuters. "It is premature to say it's an epidemic."
Infectious diseases caused by poor sanitation are common in
Tajikistan, an agrarian, mountainous central Asian state of 6 million
which remains the poorest ex-Soviet nation after years of civil war.
Infections, however, usually occur in rural areas.
The official said medical experts were inspecting water reservoirs
in the city of around 1 million. Dushanbe residents are advised to
tighten personal hygiene and use boiled water.
At least 80 people died from typhoid in Tajikistan in 1997, when the
authorities failed to halt an epidemic that infected some 10 000
people.

[This is a strange story, given that 500 cases of typhoid were
reported to have already occurred in the city by the beginning of
September 2003:
"The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs recently announced a typhoid outbreak in Tajikistan. ...
Following the 19 July [2003] UN announcement, the Tajik Ministry of
Health forbid all public clinics and hospitals from disclosing
information on how many people had contracted the viral disease. An
Asia-Plus report on 1 Aug [2003] put the toll at 500. 3 of the victims
have reportedly died from the disease." -- see ref. below.
We hope the ministry has since reconsidered its position on
outbreak reporting. The outbreak was said to have started in July
2003, and water was already suspected to be the source. The
1997 epidemic lasted 6 months. Multi-drug resistant _Salmonella
Typhi_ have been found in Tajikistan. We draw attention to the
offer of culture, antibiotic sensitivity testing, and advice about possible
treatment options by the University of Oxford-Wellcome Trust Unit at
the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam
