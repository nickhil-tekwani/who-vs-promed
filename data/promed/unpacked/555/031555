Re: ProMED-mail post Lyme disease - USA (03): (NY) increased incidence 20140728.2640626
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It would be interesting to see a posting about any work happening to reintroduce a Lyme disease vaccine given the increasing incidence and the spread of the range of the ticks and the disease in North America.

An effective vaccine would be extremely useful given the intrusiveness of the protective measures (long pants and sleeves, plus layers of DEET in hot weather) and would be preferable to frequent courses of antibiotics for prophylaxis or treatment. Not surprisingly, very few religiously follow the prevention measures, especially as they may be needed beyond areas with heavy grass and other vegetation.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Gould for his comments.

LYMErix, a recombinant Lyme disease vaccine containing an outer surface protein (OspA) from _Borrelia burgdorferi_, 1st licensed in 1998, is no longer available, and there is no other vaccine currently available to prevent Lyme disease. The vaccine manufacturer (SmithKline Beecham, now GlaxoSmithKline) discontinued production in 2002 as a result of insufficient consumer demand, plus public concern about adverse effects (arthritis) and class action lawsuits (See Dr. Stanley Plotkin's op-ed article in the New York Times last year (2013) at: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/opinion/bring-back-the-lyme-vaccine.html).

The concerns about OspA vaccine side effects involved a theoretically possible rare immune-mediated complication of inflammatory arthritis in people with HLA-DR4 haplotype via antibodies against _B. burgdorferi_ antigens that could cross-react with autoantigens (i.e., molecular mimicry) (1,2). A new, potentially safer 2nd-generation vaccine for humans that excludes the cross-reactive epitope is being studied (3).

In the United States, 4 veterinary vaccines are available: (1) monovalent bacterin, available since 1990; (2) bivalent bacterin, available since 1994; (3) nonadjuvanted rOspA vaccine, available since 1996; and (4) adjuvanted rOspA vaccine, available since 1999, but their use has been debated (4).

The recombinant OspA vaccine had an unusual mechanism of action; the OspA antigen in the vaccine stimulated circulating anti-OspA antibodies that would be ingested by the tick during a blood meal and kill _Borrelia burgdorferi_ within the tick's gut as it fed on the human host, before the bacteria were able to enter the human body. The vaccine was indicated in individuals between 15 and 70 years old in regions with high rates of Lyme disease. The vaccine was found to be about 80 percent effective in protecting against the infection, but 3 doses were required over a 12-month period, so that people were not fully protected in the 1st year of vaccination; the vaccine could not be used in children younger that 15 years of age who were at high risk; there was the theoretical possibility of autoimmune inflammatory arthritis; and because the duration of protection afforded by 3 injections of vaccine was not known, additional booster injections may have been necessary (5).
