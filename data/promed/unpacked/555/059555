The Sabah Medical and Health Services Department said there were no cases
of paralytic shellfish poisoning associated with the red tide breakout in
Sabah waters last January.
Department director Dr Saimy Ismail said since 7 Mar 2000, several people
suffering from diarrhea were hospitalized. "Until now, there have been no
victims of paralytic shellfish poisoning in the state," he said. [His
statement, "Until now" leads me to believe, indeed, there are now cases. -

Regarding reports in local newspaper of 4 people hospitalized here for
paralytic shellfish poisoning, Dr Saimy said they did not have symptoms of
such poisoning.
He said victims would suffer from numbness and burning sensations on the
lips, fingers and hands followed by dizziness, fainting, stomach ache and
nausea.
A local newspaper reported on Tuesday 4 people from Menggatal and Sepanggar
Bay were victims after eating crabs and ikan tamban.

[There seems to be some confusion regarding whether there actually are
victims of paralytic shellfish poisoning. ProMED-mail cannot confirm either
report in this case. - Mod.TG
