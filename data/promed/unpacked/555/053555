[The "birds" species affected is not specified; Newcastle disease (NCD) virus has been shown to be able to infect over 200 species of birds. The affected population in the outbreak above is, reportedly, "poultry in backyard"; OIE's definition for "poultry" is: "all domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose." It may be assumed that the backyard poultry in the case above are chickens (_Gallus gallus domesticus_), the species upon which NCD has the most significant impact. - Mod.AS
