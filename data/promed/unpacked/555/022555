Reports suggest a recent spate of cases of Q fever in rural areas likely comes from closer human exposure to livestock during times of drought, according to Local Land Services District Veterinarian Dr. Erica Kennedy, who is encouraging farmers to get tested and vaccinated. It has been confirmed there have been reports of 4 cases in Nyngan alone.

Dr. Kennedy said the bacteria virus [obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen, not a virus] can be carried by cattle, goats, sheep and other domesticated and wild animals, infecting people through contact of birthing fluids or the inhalation of dust containing dried animal secretions, which can be spread by winds. Symptoms often appear like a very severe flu, and include high fevers and chills, severe sweats, severe headaches, muscle and joint pains and extreme fatigue.

Dr. Kennedy believes current dry conditions have increased people's exposure levels to livestock, which could be the cause for the recent spike in cases. "People are out feeding and around animals so much more so I wouldn't imagine prevalence of disease in the livestock in the region is getting higher ... I would say that people's exposure levels have increased," she said.

Dr. Kennedy said anyone in rural areas should be mindful when handling livestock, particularly birthing fluids, encouraging anyone who has contact with animals to get themselves tested then vaccinated. "If you're a producer out here or have anything to do with livestock you should really go and get tested and vaccinated if you haven't before," she said.

One of the key complications of the virus [obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen] is chronic fatigue, which Dr. Kennedy said reinforces why producers in the region need to get tested and vaccinated. "The cost of chronic fatigue to a producer far outweighs the cost of vaccination. I think this just highlights that producers need to focus and look after themselves so they can then continue to be productive."

Dr. Vicky Sheppeard Director Communicable Diseases NSW Health said a single dose vaccine is recommended for people who work in high-risk occupations and anyone over 15 years who has the potential to be exposed to Q fever. "Q fever vaccine is not recommended for those aged under 15 at this stage, so it is very important parents make their children wear protective clothing and equipment. For those over 15, skin and blood tests are required before vaccination to make sure there is no previous exposure to Q fever bacteria."

While the vaccination costs hundreds of dollars, the Bogan Shire Council are working to put the vaccine on the Pharmaceutical Benefits scheme to help reduce the costs.

[Q fever is due to _ Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.

In Australia, people most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries, shearers, veterinarians, laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants or farms.

In Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups. However, there is a risk of severe local reactions to the vaccine in those people previously exposed to Q fever or Q fever vaccine. To assess prior exposure, prevaccination serologic screening is necessary. Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/disease-information-advice/q-fever).

Nyngan, with a population of 2073 people, is a town in the center of the Australian state of New South Wales, in Bogan Shire local government area within the Orana Region, 583 km (362 mi) northwest of Sydney (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyngan). Nyngan's agricultural industry is predominantly grazing (cattle and sheep), which accounts for 76% of the land area (https://www.mdba.gov.au/sites/default/files/pubs/630%20-%20NBR%20Community%20profile%20-%20Nyngan_0.pdf). - Mod.ML
