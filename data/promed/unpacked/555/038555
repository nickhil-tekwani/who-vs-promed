Seven new cases of hemorrhagic dengue have been reported by the Ministry of
Health, raising to 14 the total number of cases this year, the daily El
Heraldo reported Tuesday (June 22). However, the deadly mosquito-borne
disease has so far claimed just one life.
Marco Pinel, head of the Epidemiology Department, also said there were 583
new cases of classic [classical dengue fever last week for a total of
5,393 cases this year -- 2,000 more cases than during the same period last
year.
