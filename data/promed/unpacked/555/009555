[summarized from the Spanish by Mod. JW]
Dr. Paula Padula, Chief of the Virology Department of the Carlos Malbran
Institute of Microbiology, has confirmed the existence of a chain of
interhuman transmission during the hantavirus outbreak in Argentina from
September to December 1996. Nucleic acid analyses of the 26 cases showed
that in 16 of them the strain of Andes virus was identical. Those included
10 cases in El Bolson, 4 in Bariloche and 2 in Buenos Aires. Five of that
group were physicians. These findings will be presented at the International
Congress on Emerging Viruses in Ireland, September 1997.
According to Dr. Padula, the four people who died in Bariloche were not
infected by a rodent, but by person-to-person transmission. It is still not
known whether the contagion was airborne or through body fluids. Evidently
the primary reservoir of the disease is the rodent, and the human chain of
infection dies out.

The case was pretty solid before this, but explaining the fact that two
viruses from Buenos Aires were "genetically identical" to those from El
Bolson and Bariloche would require consultation with the "X-files" to
generate an alternative explanation. One of these Buenos Aires cases was a
doctor who did not leave the capital but who treated a patient imported from
Bolson. Maybe I'm missing something concerning burden of evidence, but this
[the infected physician who did not leave Buenos Aires] clinches it for me!
As to the claim that spread within the outbreak area in Patagonia must have
been person-to-person, that is a much more difficult case to make, and the
genetic evidence supports but does not clinch it.

[What Brian Hjelle means as "identical" and what Dr. Padula means as
"identical" may be two different things. Still, there is something missing
in all this but I cannot put my finger on it. I have the feeling that this
scenario is not yet fully explained. It is starting to remind me of the
original Legionnaire's disease studies. -- Mod CHC]
