Cocoa farmers in Ashanti region are in a quandary after a "strange disease" that is yet to be identified has destroyed their crops. They helplessly look on while their cocoa trees keep dying. Some of the farmers stated that they started witnessing the strange calamity about 3 weeks ago.

This is the 1st time they are experiencing such an onslaught in the area. [They] claimed that, for apparently no reason, some of their cocoa trees started dying under mysterious circumstances. The syndrome kept creeping into farms with the speed of light, but all attempts to stem the tide yielded no results. The farmers are therefore appealing to the government to come to their aid.

[Dieback symptoms on cocoa, similar to those on the photos supplied by the source, have been attributed to a number of diseases and environmental factors. In addition, physiological stress may increase susceptibility of the trees to pathogens. Cocoa dieback syndromes due to a complex of pathogens have also been reported, and it is thought that more than 80 fungal species may be associated with them.

Cocoa swollen shoot disease (caused by badnaviruses), black pod (caused by fungus-like _Phytophthora_ species) and black root rot (caused by fungi of genus _Rosellinia_) are known to occur in the region and may also include dieback symptoms on leaves or branches. (For more information on these diseases, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.)

Reliable diagnosis of pathogens and identification of other factors contributing to the problems above are essential for designing management strategies.
