A diarrhoea outbreak has gripped the city of Cape Town, leading to the deaths of at least 2 children and the hospitalization of hundreds of other children, according to official statistics released on Monday [14 Jan 2013]. Nearly 300 were admitted at Red Cross Children's Hospital between November and December [2012], while more than 2500 children have been treated at local clinics with moderate to severe dehydration due to diarrhoea, the Mayoral Committee for Health (MCH) said. Among the patients, at least 2 children, less than 5 years old, have died, the committee said. MCH spokesman Sandile Bontsa said the number of diarrhoea cases seen in children this season had gone up slightly compared with last year at this time. Only 57 children out of 2519 were treated for severe dehydration, he said, adding that authorities were bracing themselves as the worst time was yet to come.

In informal settlements, where there is poor sanitation, residents are particularly at risk, Bontsa said. Summer time is the season for diarrhoea outbreaks, which usually start around November and peak during February and March. It is the time when bacteria breed due to heat, leading to serious gastric illnesses.

[Diarrhoeal disease is the 2nd leading cause of death in children under 5 years old, and is responsible for killing 1.5 million children every year. Diarrhoea can last several days, and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. Most people who die from diarrhoea actually die from severe dehydration and fluid loss. Children who are malnourished or have impaired immunity are most at risk of life-threatening diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms, most of which are spread by faeces-contaminated water. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene. Diarrhoeal disease is treatable with a solution of clean water, sugar, and salt, and with zinc tablets.

Infection is more common when there is a shortage of clean water for drinking, cooking, and cleaning. Rotavirus and _Escherichia coli_ are the 2 most common causes of diarrhoea in developing countries.

Malnutrition: children who die from diarrhoea often suffer from underlying malnutrition, which makes them more vulnerable to diarrhoea. Each diarrhoeal episode, in turn, makes their malnutrition even worse. Diarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under 5 years old.

Although this report favours a bacterial cause, rotavirus infection is a more likely cause in view of the restriction to children.
