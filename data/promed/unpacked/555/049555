- The #Ebola case count topped 1500 today. It's conceivable that today or tomorrow the death toll will cross 1000. There were 984 deaths as of yesterday and the deaths are coming fast these days.
- 2 more health workers have been infected, making 94 so far this outbreak. 33 have died to date. One of these 2 was vaccinated, I believe. That bears looking into. But also: Why wasn't the other one? Why are health workers refusing #Ebola vaccine in an Ebola outbreak?

How many refuse vaccine and how many are not offered vaccine because they are not considered "frontline"?

This grabbed me by the throat: Of the #Ebola cases so far in North Kivu, 422 have been kids under 18. For context: The 3rd largest outbreak ever, in Gulu, Uganda, involved 425 cases. The pediatric cases in this outbreak are effectively another Gulu. Staggering. - Rapp.MM]

- Sources tell me none of the 14 cases were vaccinated. In the past 3 days 56 #Ebola cases have been reported. Only 1 was vaccinated, and late, I think. Vaccine refusal & the insecurity hampering vaccination efforts are really driving this outbreak now.
- I compared January [2019], which had lots of cases but when huge numbers of vaccine doses were given, to April [2019]. The comparison is telling. April had 2.5 times the number of #Ebola cases -- but less vaccine was used. Of course January was before the major attacks on Ebola teams began. - Rapp.MM]

News of the response
Eye health of Ebola survivors
-----------------------------
- Research over the past few years on people who have survived Ebola virus disease has revealed that nearly 20% of Ebola survivors develop eye problems of various forms, including eye inflammation that can lead to total loss of eyesight. Early diagnosis and treatment of these problems limits the risk of serious sequelae.
- For example, as part of the National Ebola Survival Program, the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization set up eye clinics in Beni and Butembo to check the eye health of survivors and provide them with specialized care where appropriate. The 2 partners in this project are 2 American universities, Emory University and the University of North Carolina. During their mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, international ophthalmologists conducted refresher sessions for their Congolese colleagues. 10 Congolese ophthalmologists have been trained on how to diagnose and treat eye problems related to the Ebola virus.
-This is the 1st time that ophthalmic monitoring of survivors has been implemented so quickly after survivors have left Ebola treatment centers during an active epidemic. As a reminder, the Ministry of Health and its partners have created a national program to monitor Ebola survivors. This program provides monthly clinical, biological, and psychosocial follow-up for Ebola survivors.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 107 565 people have been vaccinated.

[One wonders whether research into viral persistence in the eye and the risk of transmission to a susceptible person is taking advantage of this opportunity to connect with these Ebola survivors. - Rapp.MM

Helen Branswell @HelenBranswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell):
- 2. 15 of today's [29 Apr 2019] newly reported cases are already dead -- they died in the community. In other words, the first time the #Ebola response learned of these cases was when they were testing their corpses. These communities will lose more & more people if this continues.
- 3. I believe only 1 of these 27 people was vaccinated. There is a lot of interest right now in getting more #Ebola vaccines into the field to try to stop this outbreak. But if high risk contacts refused to be vaccinated, hard to see how that strategy fixes this problem.
- 4. Some perspective: There have been 93 #Ebola cases reported in the past 4 days. If those 4 days were an outbreak, they'd be the 10th largest outbreak on record. There've been 377 cases reported in April. If April were an outbreak, it would be the 4th largest ever.

Situation update
----------------
This past week saw a continued increase in the number of new Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases reported in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a total of 126 new confirmed cases reported. Most of these cases originated primarily from several geographically-limited, hotspot areas within Katwa, Mandima, Butembo, Mabalako, and Musienene health zones.

During the last 21 days (8-28 Apr 2019), a total of 297 confirmed cases were reported from: Katwa (141), Butembo (33), Mandima (33), Vuhovi (23), Mabalako (19), Beni (14), Musienene (14), Kalunguta (10), Masereka (5), Biena (1), Kyondo (1), Mutwanga (1), Oicha (1), and Komanda (1). During this period, 70 health areas in 14 health zones reported new cases; 45% of the 156 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2 -- available at the source URL).

Of the 1466 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 56% (815) were female, and 28% (416) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 92, including 33 deaths.

Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) teams on the ground have been working closely with Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) teams this week in support of the Safe Injection Campaign, an initiative aimed at encouraging the safer use of needles and injections in homes as a means of reducing EVD transmission risks. The campaign will commence on 5 May 2019, alongside activities for the World Hand Hygiene Day.

As part of the continued efforts to empower communities to be more actively engaged in the EVD response, requests received from the numerous dialogues with local residents are being reviewed to aid the transfer of the response ownership back to the community. Further plans are currently being drafted on who will deliver these feedback to the communities in a timely manner. Lastly, RCCE teams are also working closely with other WHO partners to bring about a new mass communications campaign to comprehensively promote key messages to the affected communities from all outbreak response pillars.

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/05/drc-ebola-cases-near-1500-after-deadliest-month
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The surge of Ebola cases continued today [1 May 2019], with the ministry of health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recording 15 new cases and 14 deaths in an outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

April [2019] was the deadliest month of the 9-month long outbreak, which has been studded with acts of violence against response workers and discord between community members and health officials. In April, two attacks in Katwa and Butembo (current virus hot spots) significantly stalled outbreak surveillance and lowered the morale of clinicians in the region.

April total: 406 cases, 308 deaths
According to US Centers for Disease control and Prevention (CDC) data, the 406 cases recorded in April [2019] -- if considered by themselves -- would constitute the 3rd-largest Ebola outbreak in history, behind the West African outbreak in 2014 through 2016 (28 652 cases) and a 2000 outbreak in Uganda (425 cases).

As it stands, the current outbreak is the world's 2nd largest, and the DRC's 10th since 1976, when the disease was first recorded.

Preliminary data from the World Health Organization (WHO) released last month show the vaccine is 97.55% effective against the virus.

Award aims to accelerate response
Today the Paul G Allen Family Foundation named the WHO, Red Cross, and UNICEF as recipients of the Ebola Response Accelerator Challenge, funding projects that aim to end this outbreak quickly, according to a Paul G Allen news release.

In 2014, Paul G Allen was the single largest private donor to the West Africa Ebola response, committing USD 100 million to contain the spread of the disease. Funding for the three projects announced today totals USD 2.4 million.

The Red Cross project will track community data for response workers, while the WHO's project aims to train Congolese medical students and youth leaders about Ebola.

The grant allows UNICEF to establish a new text message system.

"UNICEF and partners will be able to mobilize effective community engagement through U-Report, a free SMS social messaging tool that allows community members to speak out and engage with critical emergency issues. Together, this impactful partnership will continue to save lives and support healthier futures in the DRC," said Caryl M Stern, president and CEO of UNICEF USA, in the press release.

- Tue 30 Apr 2019. WHO officials visit Ebola hot spot, call for more support
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/who-officials-visit-ebola-hot-spot-call-more-support

African countries near the DRC met in Kampala today [30 Apr 2019] will review their Ebola preparedness steps and form new plans for preventing and responding to the possible arrival of the virus within their borders.

High-level visit airs profound worry
The visit from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, and WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti, MD, comes just 10 days after WHO epidemiologist Dr Richard Mouzoko was killed in an armed attack during his work on the Ebola outbreak.

In a statement, the 2 said they were profoundly worried about the situation and acknowledged that recent surges in infections are the result of setbacks each time the response sustains violent attacks.

Most of the response activities -- such as community engagement, vaccination, and case investigation -- have restarted following a slowdown after the attacks that killed Mouzoko and injured two others, the WHO said. It notes, however, that the torrent of cases in recent weeks is further straining resources.

Moeti said her pride and respect for the outbreak responders has grown. "They have been through something unimaginable and yet are willing to continue this vital work. We need the security situation to be under control for them and for the local people."

The group met with Butembo's mayor, US Ambassador Michael Hammer, a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO) representative, and other partners, as well as local business, religious, and political leaders.

WHO officials also urged the international community to step up its support to contain the outbreak, including bridging funding gaps. Tedros said the response requires major shifts. "WHO and partners cannot tackle these challenges without the international community stepping in to fill the sizeable funding gap." He added that the WHO has received only half of the support it asked for, which could require health officials to scale back activities when they are needed most.

In other outbreak developments, the ministry said that -- based on a recent request from the DRC's president -- the country's prime minister and Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, today signed a decree establishing and organizing a multisector committee for Ebola response. The committee's goal is to spell out new government steps to battle the outbreak, coordinate with different government levels, and help allocate resources for the response. It will meet weekly or more often, as needed [see MoH report above].

Regional officials meet in Kampala
Also today [30 Apr 2019], international partners working on Ebola preparedness and response began a 2-day meeting in Kampala, Uganda's capital, to discuss key risk factors and response challenges and to suggest new solutions.

In a press release from the WHO's Uganda office, Jane Ruth Aceng, MBChB, MPH, the country's health minister, said the increasing complexity of the outbreak in the 2 DRC provinces poses a risk of spread within the DRC and to its neighbors. "This outbreak is therefore not a problem of the DRC alone," she said.

Comprising delegates from 9 countries, the group is slated to share information on their Ebola preparedness strategies and share information on their challenges and best practices. At the end of the meeting, the group will develop a joint preparedness roadmap.

Among the experts' worries are infection prevention and control in health facilities and deaths that keep occurring in community settings, the WHO said.

However, the biggest concern is the fragile security situation in the DRC's affected areas. Presenters from the DRC said there are about 30 armed groups in the outbreak region, some of which have attacked Ebola treatment centers.

Officials said the DRC's neighbors have reason to worry, given long porous borders and frequent population movements.

- Mon 29 Apr 2019. Ebola spreading at record pace in DRC, now 1466 cases
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/ebola-spreading-record-pace-drc-now-1466-cases
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Today [29 Apr 2019] the ministry of health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recorded 27 new cases of Ebola, setting a new single-day record for this 9-month outbreak on the far eastern edge of the country. Late last week [week of 22 Apr 2019], officials recorded 23 cases in one day, the previous high.

Deadliest day
In addition to the 27 cases recorded today, the ministry also recorded 26 deaths -- also the highest daily total to date -- 15 of which took place in the community. Community deaths are linked to further virus transmission, as they can signal improper burial practices and contact with a patient's bodily fluids.

The sobering numbers follow a weekend of increased virus activity. The ministry recorded 41 cases over the weekend and 31 new deaths, making this the deadliest series of days in this outbreak. The 3-day total of 70 cases is a record, as is the 3-day fatality total of 57.

Katwa and Butembo remain the outbreak hot spots, with Beni, Mandima, Musienene, Biena, Kalunguta, Mutwanga, and Mabalako also noting cases in the past few days.

And in a sign that some of these cases may be linked to nosocomial transmission, the DRC said over the weekend that 3 health workers were among newly confirmed cases in the last 2 weeks.

The cumulative number of confirmed cases or probable among health workers has now reached 92 ([now 94 as of 01 May] 6.4% of all confirmed and probable cases), including 33 deaths.

Epidemic 'beyond public health'
Over the weekend [27-28 Apr 2019] Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the minister of health in the DRC, held a meeting about Ebola for government leaders, including president-elect Felix Tshisekedi. Heads of finance, defense, and budget also attended the meeting.

"In his presentation, the Minister of Health insisted that, given the difficult security situation, this epidemic had gone beyond public health," the 27 Apr 2019 DRC update said. "So far, the epidemic has been contained in 2 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, but in order to put an end to it, it is necessary to strengthen the multisectoral component of the response, and therefore the involvement of other ministries."

In today's [29 Apr 2019] update, DRC officials highlighted a partnership among the health ministry, the World Health Organization, and two US universities to train local ophthalmologists and monitor Ebola survivors for eye problems, which can occur in nearly 20%.

"This is the 1st time that ophthalmic monitoring of survivors has been implemented so quickly after survivors have left Ebola treatment centers during an active epidemic," the health ministry said.

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
------------------------------------------------------
The operating environment has become increasingly insecure and socio-politically complex. Insecurity remains a major impediment to ensuring timely response interventions in the affected communities. Ebola virus disease (EVD) response activities in Butembo and Katwa remained limited; however, these are gradually resuming following a comprehensive reinforcement of security measures and community engagement efforts. The overall security situation, nevertheless, remains volatile. While no significant injuries or damages are reported this week, access and activities in parts of Mandima, Masereka, Kalunguta, and Vuhovi, remain irregular due to the presence of armed groups and other security concerns. New EVD cases are expected to continue to increase, in tandem with incidents of insecurity in these hotspot areas over the coming weeks, placing significant strain on response teams and the security resources available to secure their movements.

The rise in positive cases of Ebola patients in Butembo and surrounding areas continues to raise several concerns. According to Dr. Nestor Lubi, who was contacted from Brussels in Belgium, attacking experts, doctors, nurses, and health services who deal with this disease is endangering not only our population but also the republic.

The outbreak of confirmed cases is sometimes due to the resistance by some people to observe certain prevention rules. For Dr. Nestor Lubi, a Congolese doctor and teacher living in Brussels, Belgium, the public must take the threats of this disease seriously -- a disease that is endangering the population of the region. For this doctor, the population must combine its efforts in the fight against this disease.

"We must not be dispersed before this epidemic. The disease exists. And the Ebola virus kills. If we do not pay attention, she [it, i.e., the disease] will continue to kill. If there was a group of Mai-Mai behind the attacks of the Ebola treatment centers, they must understand that at this level they are irresponsible. If they were manipulated by a politician, they need to ask the politician what type of solution he is going to propose immediately to the people of our country to avoid illness. Because destroying health centers, attacking experts, doctors, nurses, health services who deal with this disease is endangering not only our population but also the republic. We may end up in quarantine. I would like to add the last thing. We already have a problem with ADF [rebel group], we do not need to add more," said Dr. Nestor Lubi from Brussels.

- Tue 30 Apr 2019. Record high case numbers
[Lemonwire, abridged, edited]
https://lemonwire.com/2019/04/30/congo-ebola-cases-hit-record-for-most-reported-in-single-day/

Monday [29 Apr 2019] set a new record in this outbreak of 27 confirmed cases in a single day, Congo's health ministry said. Over the past 4 days, 93 cases have been confirmed.

The World Health Organization said 126 new confirmed cases were reported over a 7-day stretch ending on Sunday [28 Apr 2019], the largest such tally in this outbreak, which was 1st declared in August 2018. A total of 15 deaths were reported on Sunday [28 Apr 2019] alone, marking the highest number of deaths reported on a single day in the outbreak.

In an e-mail, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic sought to play down the significance of the higher figures, saying the case numbers were "better interpreted as an increase in case activity within the outbreak hotspot areas."

"We discourage phrasing this as 'record numbers' or similar, as it does not reflect well current activity/data, and provides an unnecessarily alarmist view of the outbreak," he wrote.

The fact that many are dying outside the health care system means the full scale of the crisis is unknown. "There might be double this many cases in reality that we're just not aware of," said Tariq Riebl, emergency response director for the Ebola response crisis with the International Rescue Committee (IRC). "A very small number are actually presenting themselves to health centers," he said.

WHO's Jasarevic said 38% of people who died over the 7-day period ending Sunday [28 Apr 2019] had died before reaching Ebola treatment centers (ETCs), down from more than 60% about 2 months ago.

Distrust of health workers, combined with a highly volatile security situation at the outbreak's epicenter, is putting the Ebola response in serious peril. The spike in recorded cases has been attributed to a series of attacks that have hampered health workers' efforts to go out into the affected communities to educate and vaccinate. The IRC said it has had to curtail its triage efforts in those areas as a result. Doctors Without Borders has also pulled out temporarily, leaving the health ministry to run the treatment centers there.

Health experts have attributed the community resistance to the fact that eastern Congo has suffered a quarter-century of armed conflict, leading to a deep mistrust of government officials who are now running the ETCs. Voters in Ebola hotspots also were unable to vote in the January [2019] presidential election, deepening false suspicions that Ebola had been brought to the region for political gain.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6972749/Congos-Ebola-outbreak-match-devastation-West-Africa-epidemic.html
[Byline: Sam Blanchard]

Dr. Osman Dar, a global health expert at Chatham House and member of the Royal College of Physicians Edinburgh and Public Health England, called on the UN, African Union and British Government to do more. Dr. Dar warned the situation must change. If health workers' safety isn't improved, the death toll could spiral to rival the 11 310 who were killed in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone 5 years ago, he said.

The country's president, Felix Tshisekedi, said in April [2019] he wants to see the Ebola outbreak end in the next 3 months. "It's theoretically possible to end the outbreak in 3 months," Dr. Dar said. "It could end in weeks if the region wasn't so unstable. But in the absence of security, it is difficult and this is an ongoing problem. The international community needs to make more of an effort to stabilise the security situation for response teams to work safely."

There are currently WHO and Medecins sans Frontieres officials working alongside Congolese health workers in the northeast of DRC, close to its borders with Uganda, South Sudan and Rwanda. But there is a real risk doctors could pack up and leave if their lives are at risk -- something Dr. Dar said is already starting to happen. Dozens of medical staff marched in the city of Butembo last week to appeal for better security -- and have threatened to go on strike indefinitely. Dr. Kalima Nzanzu, a medic on the frontline, said: "If our security is not guaranteed, we will go on strike from the 1st week of May [2019]."

Dr. Dar said the United Nations, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the African Union must work harder to make the area safe. But he admitted the presence of foreigners is already distressing local people, and moving soldiers to the area could worsen this effect. He added: "This needs to be approached sensitively with political awareness. It needs to be done carefully but it does need to be done. [The organisations involved] need to come forward and say the response at the moment isn't adequate and it isn't working. Otherwise this outbreak will keep rolling on and it's going to end in disaster."

https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1121155/ebola-outbreak-congo-world-health-organisation-pandemic-stratgey-shift
[Byline: Ciaran McGrath]

The ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is "profoundly worrying," World Health Organisation director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said during a visit to the country to assess the worsening situation following the brutal murder of a doctor who was treating victims of the killer virus.

Dr. Ghebreyesus visited the Butembo region, along with Dr. Matshidiso Moeti. It was in Butembo on 19 Apr 2019 that WHO epidemiologist Dr. Richard Mouzoko was killed by armed men while he and colleagues were working on the response to what is the 2nd-worst outbreak of Ebola in history. Dr. Ghebreyesus said: "Dr. Mouzoko's death moved me profoundly."

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: "I am also profoundly worried about the situation. Cases are increasing because of violent acts that set us back each time. We have already begun to adjust our response."

Dr. Ghebreyesus and Dr. Moeti urged the international community to step up support to contain the Ebola outbreak, including filling the funding gap that threatens to stymie the Ebola response. Most Ebola response activities, including community engagement, vaccination, and case investigation, have been relaunched following a slowdown in the wake of the attack that left Dr. Mouzoko dead and 2 people injured.

However, Dr. Ghebreyesus and Dr. Moeti voiced their deep concern that a rise in reported cases in recent weeks is straining resources even further.

[Radio Moto Butembo-Beni, in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=de160220-822ea542-de14fb15-000babd9f75c-00d753a3348783e7&u=http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5779

A 2nd case of Ebola virus disease has occurred in the Mabuku hospital center in the rural health zone of Kalunguta in the territory of Beni on Sat 27 Apr 2019. The patient had fled the health center Mambombo in the health zone Mabalako. He then went to a health post in Mabuku, where he spent a week before going to Mabuku Hospital where he died.

"For me it's really bad because the patient really came [at the last minute]. Just when we wanted to do first aid, it was already very serious. Just after, he arrived on 27 Apr 2019 at 1 am, he is dead. Then, as in the habit, we must always take on the dead. When we sent out for testing, a positive Ebola result was returned. Which worried us more; and it was found that the patient came from Ngazi. It was there that he was treated a week ago before arriving here in Mabuku. That's how we got a 2nd case here in Mabuku," said Dr. Kamoto of Mabuku Hospital Center.

Meanwhile, the vaccination went well at Mabuku Hospital. A total of 20 people were vaccinated. The low participation of contacts or of some who have been denied has been noted. And Dr. Kamoto is shocked. "Others who are also concerned are avoiding the vaccine and saying that it does not concern them, while the disease exists. People need to understand that the vaccine is there to prevent," he said.

FARDC soldiers and suspected Mai-Mai militia have secured this vaccination campaign.

[4] Uganda
- Thu 2 May 2019. Ebola preparedness
[WHO ReliefWeb, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/uganda-s-health-minister-calls-cross-border-collaboration-accountability-and-country

Uganda's Minister of Health Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng has lauded international partners for supporting the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) battle of the current Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, as well as the neighbouring countries in their preparedness and readiness phase. "The outbreak in DRC affects everyone, and while we have no confirmed cases in the neighbouring countries, preparation is paramount. I thank the partners for their support in both response and preparedness modes during this EVD outbreak," she said.

Dr. Aceng was closing the 2-day International Partners meeting convened by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (WHO-AFRO) that sought to strengthen partnerships for EVD preparedness and response. While appreciating the various interventions that have been implemented to control the outbreak in DRC and prevent spread to other countries, Dr. Aceng singled out vaccination of health workers, cross-border collaboration and awareness creation as interventions that have helped Uganda and other countries stay EVD-free up to now.

Awareness creation has also contributed tremendously to prevent the spread of EVD within DRC and to other countries. "Awareness creation should continue in all communities so that our people remain alert," said Dr. Aceng.

However, Dr. Aceng also proposed 2 issues that she strongly urged international partners to always adhere to in order to ensure effective and sustainable response not only to EVD but also to other disease outbreaks in Africa. "First always ensure transparency and accountability in all actions and in what you do on the ground. Share what you are doing based on the funds given because it not only helps to avoid duplication of work but also builds donor and community confidence," she said adding that this will contribute to building strong and resilient health systems in Africa.

"Secondly, I urge you to always ensure country leadership and ownership in your work. Let country authorities be in charge of and lead preparedness and response activities because they know the countries better than you. Please don't impose; instead, work with us and support us within the national government structures," she said.

Earlier, delegates at the meeting made recommendations that will inform the preparation of a roadmap on EVD preparedness and response in the region. This included support to build resilient and reliable health systems in countries that can respond to EVD and other disease outbreaks promptly.

They also called for increased investment in community engagement through existing community structures. This, they observed, is vital because disease outbreaks primarily occur and affect communities; they are the 1st points of contact and know the norms and practices that usually drive the spread of infections. Besides, community resistance, hostility and stigma such as those witnessed in a few instances in DRC can be effectively tackled through community engagement.

The delegates also looked at disease surveillance in the region and recommended that this be strengthened within the existing health system and community-based structures. They emphasized the importance of resource mobilization, which they agreed should be done transparently, focusing on priorities and needs identified by countries in their preparedness and response plans.

The delegates agreed that cross-border collaboration is critical in disease outbreaks especially because of the interlinkages and social-economic activities that bring people together. Such consideration, activities and structures should be used to contribute to disease outbreak efforts such as surveillance. The delegates particularly noted the critical role of regional economic bodies such as the East Africa Community that can be used to harness political and financial contribution to disease outbreaks right from the highest offices in countries and also facilitate cross-border collaboration.

"We have held meetings with DRC, visited their facilities and shared experiences on how to better manage this outbreak. Therefore, cross-border collaboration is an important measure during any disease outbreak," said the WHO Representative in Uganda, Dr. Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam while emphasising the need for cross-border collaboration at the closing ceremony.

Other issues discussed at the 2-day meeting included infrastructure and human resources development, infection prevention and control.

As the meeting closed, the mood and determination to tackle disease outbreaks were yet again succinctly captured by Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng, enlisting ovation from delegates: "Africans can control outbreaks. Nothing is impossible in Africa. Let us rise up to critically address the current Ebola outbreak in DRC."

[New Vision, abridged, edited]
https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1499432/ebola-screening-established-lake-albert-shores
[Byline: Ismael Kasooha, Andrew Musinguzi]

The International Rescue Committee (IRC), in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Kagadi district, is to establish Ebola screening points at points of entry into the country on the shores of Lake Albert. The IRC responds to the world's worst humanitarian crises and helps people to survive and rebuild their lives.

Dr. Herbert Muhumuza, the Health Coordinator of the IRC, told New Vision that this is a high-risk area that has direct linkages with Ebola-stricken DRC because of the daily cross-border movements on Lake Albert. More than 5-8 boats cross from both countries daily with an estimated 300 people. "These people have relatives on either side and even transact business together across the borders, so it's a high-risk area which must be handled with care to avoid the spilling over of Ebola into Uganda," said Muhumuza.

He said that the IRC will go ahead to provide equipment that will be used at the screening points and will be available until March 2020 with support from ECHO (European Union Commission).

Silvano Thembo said that at points of entry the district will provide health workers who will be trained on how to assess persons and will be obliged to report on how many people have been screened periodically. He said that in case of any suspected Ebola case, the district should ensure that the person is transported to the Ebola treatment unit at Kagadi Hospital.

The Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI), as an implementing partner in the district, has been providing vehicles to enable the district Ebola task force go to hard-to-reach areas down the escarpment. The screening points shall be established at landing sites on Lake Albert, including Kabukanga, Kitebere, Kamina and any other as the need arises.

Emmanuel Ainebyoona, the Public Relations Officer in the Ministry of Health, said, "We welcome such an intervention because it strengthens our fight against Ebola and as a country, we shall cooperate with IRC."

During this period, 59 health areas in 11 health zones reported new cases; 41% of the 145 health areas have been affected to date.

- Tue 30 Apr 2019. Ugandan health workers fatigued -- Ebola simulation report
[The Independent, abridged, edited]
https://www.independent.co.ug/ugandan-health-workers-fatigued-ebola-simulation-report/

Health workers on Ugandan borders are tired of the endless state of Ebola preparedness, an Ebola simulation exercise carried out early this month [April 2019] has revealed. The results were disseminated during an international Ebola virus disease meeting that begun in Kampala on Monday [29 Apr 2019]. The simulation exercise was carried out in Wakiso and Kasese, which are part of the 22 high-risk Ebola districts.

The exercise showed that health workers at different border posts are tired of being on standby. Uganda has been in a state of Ebola preparedness since August 2018 when the disease broke out in North Kivu in DRC.

Dr. Yonas Tegegn Woldermariam, the Country Representative of the World Health Organisation, says the exercise was an eye opener because it revealed gaps that need to be filled. Health Minister, Dr. Ruth Aceng, attributed the reports of fatigue on the part of health workers to the unfamiliar working environment. She said there is need for financial assistance to make sure that the country bridges the existing gaps. "There's a need for financial help as the numbers of people suffering of Ebola in DRC increases," she said.

Uganda's 1st Ebola preparedness budget totaled up to UGX 4 trillion (USD 1.06 billion) while the next stood at UGX 3 trillion (USD 796 million), according to the health ministry.

The simulation exercise also showed that Uganda needs to re-enforce its border health teams. Aceng says they are planning on hiring more health workers to fill the gaps.

The Health Ministry is set to hire an additional 500 health workers in the 2019-2020 financial year. Similar simulation exercises were also carried out in Tanzania, Sudan, Central Africa Republic, Rwanda, Zambia, South Sudan, Angola and Burundi.

According to WHO, Uganda was not the only country that still falls short in some areas of Ebola preparedness. Dr. Zabulon York, the WHO Technical Coordinator of Health Emergencies programme who represented the WHO Director General, said results from other countries where the simulation exercise was carried out revealed existing gaps. He revealed that the countries were rated according to the level of community engagement, infection prevention and control, state of isolation facilities, capacity building and emergency response.

[5] Vaccine program
- Tue 30 Apr 2019. Ebola vaccination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
[PNAS, abridged, edited]
https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/04/24/1817329116.abstract?etoc

Significance
Using a spatial model that incorporates human mobility, poverty, and population density, we assessed the effectiveness of the vaccination program that was implemented during the 2018 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our results demonstrate that even modest delays in initiating vaccination would have markedly eroded the impact of the program. The methodology we present has applicability for identifying areas at risk during outbreaks of other emerging and reemerging diseases, which is imperative for swift control.

- Fri 3 May 2019. Vaccine effectiveness
[Axios, abridged, edited]
https://www.axios.com/bright-spot-ebola-outbreak-vaccine-imperiled-attacks-c6b63297-8aab-422d-a4fc-435f6fcb8cee.html

The Ebola vaccine -- which appears to have an effectiveness of more than 97% when given 10 days before infection -- also must be given quickly once an outbreak starts, according to scientists in a study out this week.

One of the few bright spots about this deadly outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the preliminary finding that the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is very effective. But the violent disruptions of the hard efforts of public health officials there -- causing the WHO chief to warn, "The world has never seen anything like this" -- are endangering that benefit.

The research team from the University of Florida used a spatial model examining human mobility, poverty and population density to see how this affected the effectiveness of the vaccination program during the prior Ebola outbreak in the DRC in 2018.

"Our primary purpose was to investigate the timing and pattern of geographical spread of an Ebola outbreak starting from initial cases," study author Burton Singer tells Axios. They used Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, as it was the most effective known vaccine and it was available for distribution, Singer says. The outbreak in May 2018 was in a different location than the current outbreak.

The study found the vaccination program lessened both the geographical area that was at risk and the risk level for infection within that region. The vaccination program contracted the geographical area at risk for Ebola by up to 70%, and the program reduced the level of risk within that region by up to 70%.

However, it also shows there may be a significant decrease in the vaccine's ability to lower infection rates in an area if it's given even a week after the infection has started. A delay of a week led to the above effects to drop to 33% and 45%, respectively, the authors say.

"I was surprised by the dramatic potential impact across a substantial geographical area of a delay of even one week in initiating vaccinations following an outbreak. Vaccinating people as early as possible is critically important," Singer says.

Unfortunately, the vaccination regimen is being stymied in the current outbreak by community distrust and violent attacks, including the recent death of WHO epidemiologist Richard Mouzoko.

[See figures in report at the URL above showing increase in number of cases and deaths from the DRC MoH, as well as cases under investigation over time.

Beth-Ann Coller, executive director of project management and leadership at Merck, said it takes one year to produce the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine being used in the DRC. I hope they are trying to scale up in case the outbreak expands rather more explosively than gradually. The company had agreed to stockpile 300 000 doses as a donation to WHO, which sounds like a lot, but not if the virus gains a foothold in a city of one million people, e.g., Goma.
