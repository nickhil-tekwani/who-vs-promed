--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to a note of the Italian Ministry of Health, isolates from cases that occurred in a relatively limited area of the Tuscany Region belong to the ST-11 clonal complex (fine typing C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:ST11). Surveillance has been strengthened at a national level in order to promptly detect the possible (although unlikely) spread of the same clone in other areas of the country.

[ProMED-mail thanks Franco Giovanetti for responding to the query concerning the genotype of the strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C that is causing the outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Tuscany.

Apparently the genotype of the outbreak strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C is multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence type 11 (ST-11) (C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:ST11). This genotype is the same as that of the strain causing IMD among men who have sex with men (MSM) in France and Germany. IMD cases in MSM living in the Paris region was linked to the circulation since mid-2013 of C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11 isolates, and this strain is also reported to be the same as that causing the outbreak of IMD in MSM in Germany (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V20N03/art21016.pdf).

This genotype caused IMD not only in MSM, but also in individuals (women, as well as those men who do not identify as MSM) who attended social venues associated with the gay community in France (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V20N03/art21016.pdf). ProMED-mail would appreciate any information on contacts of cases of IMD in Tuscany with MSM or social venues associated with the gay community, if available, from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
