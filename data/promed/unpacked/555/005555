[3] Saudi Arabia, Jeddah, media report on outbreak
Date: Tue 8 Apr 2014

http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/mers-mystery-11-medics-taken-ill-in-jeddah-1.1316682


The emergency unit at King Fahad Hospital in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah has been shut down as a precautionary measure amid reports that several people fell ill with MERS coronavirus.

The news comes as Saudi health authorities have reported the deaths of another 2 men and 4 new cases of [MERS-CoV], bringing the death toll from the respiratory disease in the worst hit country to 66. At least 11 medical staff have been reported to have contracted the virus, a spokesperson at the hospital said; "6 of them are hospitalised at the King Fahad hospital, 2 at the King Abdul Aziz hospital, 1 doctor at the King Faisal hospital and 2 other doctors at the University hospital and at the National Guard hospital," the spokesperson said.

One of the patients is in critical condition, the spokesperson was quoted [as saying] by Al Madinah newspaper.

Patients seeking treatment at the now shut down King Fahad emergency unit have been referred to other hospitals in the city.

The paper on Tuesday [8 Apr 2014] reported "deep mystery" over the status of the Jeddah hospital amid rumours that several people, including staff, fell ill with the MERS coronavirus.

Rumours claimed that 15 people working at King Fahad Hospital in Jeddah, including 3 doctors, 4 nurses and 8 employees, had fallen ill, Al Madina said. However, hospital authorities refused to divulge any figures or state what actually happened, it added. The paper said that its reporter went to the emergency unit and found no patients. A local official said that people opted to stay away from the hospital following the spread of the MERS rumours. However, the official denied claims that medical staff refused to report to work for fear of falling ill, insisting that the hospital was adequately equipped to deal with the emergency.

A Saudi national told the daily that his family had concerns about the condition of his hospitalised father. "We just need the health ministry to issue a statement that clarifies the situation," [the Saudi national] said.

According to March figures by WHO, 206 people have had the MERS coronavirus since September 2012, with 86 cases ending in death. Most cases were reported in Saudi Arabia or among people who had travelled to Saudi Arabia.

The MoH said that WHO has confirmed the virus is not a concern for public health at the moment, and that the current situation does not require a travel ban to any country in the world, screenings at different ports, or any restrictions on trade.

[Maintaining an accurate up to date count of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV continues to be a challenge. The most recent global tally published by WHO on 1 Apr 2014 had a total count of 207 cases including 87 deaths. This tally did not include the 11 laboratory-confirmed cases including 2 deaths in Jeddah reported by the Saudi MOH website (see parts [2] and [3] above), and the case reported in Abu Dhabi, UAE, reported in the media report in [4] above. The addition of these 12 cases (including 2 deaths) will bring the global tally to 219 cases including 89 deaths. Clarification of these figures would be greatly appreciated.

According to the Saudi MOH website on MERS-CoV, there have been 175 laboratory-confirmed cases including 64 deaths in Saudi Arabia. A review of the media reports as well as the most recent report on the Saudi MOH website (see [2] and [3] above), there appears to be nosocomial transmission of the MERS-CoV in Jeddah, with a suggestion that the Emergency Department may have been the source of this spread. Many of the media reports (not included in this update, but readily available through web searching) suggest that the majority of the newly reported cases have been in healthcare workers and other hospital-based personnel. Clarification of this with information on possible exposure risks of these 11 confirmed cases in Jeddah would be greatly appreciated.

With respect to the media report on a newly reported laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV in the UAE, this case represents the 18th such case reported with possible exposure in the UAE.
