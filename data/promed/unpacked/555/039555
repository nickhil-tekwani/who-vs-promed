A 60-year-old man from Yame, Fukuoka prefecture, died last week from the tick-borne infection severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), according to a Mainichi report.

According to the Kurume municipal public health center, the man was hospitalized on 16 Aug [2021] for symptoms including fever and fatigue, diagnosed with SFTS 3 days later, and died on 21 Aug [2021]. As he had a tick bite mark near his right ankle, he was possibly bitten while he was farming.

The public health center is urging people to reduce their skin exposure in places such as tufts of grass, as ixodid ticks are active between spring and autumn.

SFTS is a newly emerging infectious disease. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities are fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and elevated serum enzyme levels. Multiorgan failure occurs in severe cases, and 6%-30% of case-patients die. The syndrome is caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV) (genus _Phlebovirus_, family Bunyaviridae).

Ixodid tick species are implicated as vectors of SFTSV.

[SFTS has been occurring sporadically in Japan since 2013, and SFTS virus has become established there. Cases have been widely disbursed geographically in 2018, with 24 prefectures reporting infected individuals. There were 96 cases in the 1st 11 months of 2019 (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd - Japan 20210705.8495328). SFTS is likely underreported in some areas. SFTS should be included in differential diagnoses when cases of _Rickettsia japonica_ infections are suspected. Since there is no vaccine, the best way to avoid infection is to avoid tick bites and contact with infected pets, especially cats.

As noted earlier, SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well, so the previous numbers may be an underestimate of the total number of infections. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, but that appears to be a rare event. The virus is doubtless endemic in several countries in Asia, and cases have occurred previously in Japan. Apparently, there are 2 previously reported affected individuals who acquired their infections directly from an SFTS-virus-infected cat. No mention was made of tick transmission in that instance. The possible route of transmission from the cat to the veterinarian and veterinary nurse via exposure to blood or other bodily fluids is not mentioned (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - East Asia (02): Japan (MZ) 20181211.6204927).

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of a longhorn tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, the SFTS vector, can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm. - Mod.TY
