An outbreak of _Shigella sonnei_ affecting more than 300 people appears to have been repeatedly imported by international travels and
clustered within multiple communities of men who have sex with men, according to data presented at IDWeek 2015. In addition, testing of the strain revealed frequent resistance to ciprofloxacin and sub-clusters of isolates resistant to a number of other antimicrobial agents, according to Anna Bowen, MD, MPH, of the CDC.

"Currently, there are high rates of resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [TMP/SMX] in the USA, ranging from about 40 percent to 80 percent," Bowen said during a presentation. "Less commonly, there is resistance to azithromycin (3.8 percent), ciprofloxacin (3.5 percent) and ceftriaxone (1.2 percent). These modest rates of resistance, however, translate into large numbers of cases, with approximately 27 000 per year in this country, and there are hints that these numbers are increasing."

Bowen and colleagues examined cases of _S. sonnei_ infection matching 1 of 5 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns detected from 1 May 2014 to 31 May 2015, as well as those identified during a San Francisco outbreak within homeless populations between 1 Nov 2014 and 15 Apr 2015. Data on these cases were collected from the CDC's PulseNet PFGE surveillance system and the San Francisco Department of Public Health, with antimicrobial susceptibility testing data examined if available.

There were 307 identified cases spread across 34 states and Puerto Rico, according to Bowen. Median duration of illness was 7 days, 97 percent of isolates were obtained from stool, and hospitalization occurred among 25 percent of patients for whom clinical information was available. International travel was common among cases, Bowen said, with various destinations such as Hispaniola and India, suggesting no common source of illness.

More than 2/3 of men whose sexual practice data was available self-identified as MSM, with many reporting high-risk behavior with persons not identified in the outbreak case count. These MSM represented several clustered, domestically acquired cases within 6 states spread throughout the country.

Antimicrobial resistance testing revealed 86 percent of isolates to be resistant to ciprofloxacin. Among these a sub-cluster of 5 cases resistant to ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, TMP/SMX with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin also was identified, which Bowen said is especially worrisome. "This outbreak reminds us again of the importance of international travel in the spread of drug-resistant pathogens," Bowen said. "Actions we must take include educating travelers about food, water and hand hygiene precautions, and warning them that they're at risk for more than just a little travelers' diarrhea, but rather multidrug-resistant infections that can be difficult to treat and easy to spread to their families or communities."

[Shigella was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine, where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread. Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon that results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces, with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea).

Resistance to the fluoroquinolone group of antimicrobials is of concern, and increasing resistance of isolates has been earlier highlighted in a CDC report authored by Dr. Bowen (Shigellosis - USA (02): sonnei, fluoroquinolone resistance 20150409.3278553). - Mod.LL
