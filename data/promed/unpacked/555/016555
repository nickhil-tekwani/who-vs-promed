----------------------------------------------------------------------
Angiostrongyliasis was first reported in Taiwan in 1945.

The disease is commonest among children, with highest rates during the summer rainy season, and infection is often diagnosed among Thai laborers who ingest raw snails (_Ampullarium canaliculatus_, _Achatina fulica_).

Angiostrongyliasis has been reported in a child who raised snails (_Ampullarium canaliculatus_) as pets. 125 cases of angiostrongyliasis were reported in southern Taiwan during 1968 to 1969, with highest rates among Aboriginals.
37 cases (2 fatal) were treated at a hospital in Kaohsiung during 1991 to 2009.

Prevalence surveys
------------------
12.3 per cent to 29.4 per cent of _Ampullarium canaliculatus_ snails from irrigation canals in southern Taiwan (2011 publication)
29.6 per cent of rats (_Rattus norvegicus_ and _Suncus murinus_) in Kaohsiung (1996 publication).

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
- 1985: outbreaks (13 cases in 2 outbreaks) were reported.
- 1998: an outbreak (8 cases) was reported among Thai laborers in Kaohsiung.
- 1999: an outbreak (9 cases) was reported among Thai laborers in Kaohsiung.
- 2004 (publication year): an outbreak (5 cases) among native Taiwanese was ascribed to ingestion of contaminated vegetable juice.
- 2009: an outbreak (4 cases) was reported among workers who had ingested raw snails.
