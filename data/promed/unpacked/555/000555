The Department of Agriculture wants to assure the public that there is no
outbreak of the deadly avian influenza (H5N1) in the country!
One farm near Rustenburg in the North-West Province and one farm in the
Gauteng Province have been placed under quarantine to allow the Department
of Agriculture to complete an investigation into the illegal importation of
water bird eggs into the country. The importer failed to obtain a permit
from the Department of Agriculture for such an importation.
South Africa is determined to maintain its avian influenza free status and
does not allow the importation of any live birds, poultry or poultry
products from any country that has not been free for at least the past 3
months.
Smuggling of live birds, eggs or poultry products pose a serious danger to
the poultry and ostrich industries in this country. Human health could also
be at risk.
It should be noted that chicken and ostrich products on supermarket shelves
in South Africa remain safe for human consumption.

[Prof van Gelder kindly added the following comment:
"The best information that I have been able to obtain from Onderstepoort on
24 Aug 2006 is that genetic sequencing of material from the farm at
Rustenburg excludes HPAI H5N1 and shows similarity with LPAI H5N1.
Serological testing shows H5, with the N-component still uncertain. This
information is in the public domain as it is the subject of court action in
the Pretoria Supreme Court".
Rustenburg is situated at Lat 25-39-35 S, Lon 27-14-36 E. Map at

Millions of rands worth of water fowl belonging to Hilko Insel, South
Africa's largest [exotic?] fowl breeder, are being culled by the department
of agriculture at Bon Accord, north of Pretoria. [Lat 25-37-00 S; Lon
28-12-00 E. Map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map//map/browse.cgi?lat=-25.6167&lon=28.2&scale=1000000&icon=x>].
The department says there is a possibility that the fowl, including ducks,
geese and swans, carry a strain of the bird flu virus. The results of tests
carried out at Onderstepoort to determine this have not been made public.
The Pretoria High Court has ordered that the culling of Insel's birds and
those on a farm in Rustenburg should go ahead. Insel says he is shocked by
the decision.

[Earlier in 2006, South Africa reported several outbreaks of highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), virus subtype H5N2, in ostriches. The
last official report was received on 4 Aug 2006, notifying the confirmation
of 2 outbreaks in the Western Cape province. (Follow-up report No. 3,
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_06.HTM#Sec1>).
The current outbreaks seem -- geographically and species-wise -- to be
distinctly different from the earlier ones.
Results of the laboratory investigations, particularly the pathogenicity
and the identity of the N component, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
