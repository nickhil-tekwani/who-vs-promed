SAGARPA confirms death of livestock by poisoning in Actopan
-----------------------------------------------------------
Poultry litter contains large amounts of urea, which is transformed into ammonia inside the stomach of the animal and generates amino acids or proteins, substances that cause excessive intoxication.

The delegate of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (SAGARPA) José Vicente Ramirez Martinez, said the death of 600 head of cattle in the municipality of Actopan was caused by poisoning by consumption of a cheap food of bad quality called "pollinaza" [manure] which the stock ranchers gave to their livestock without realizing the consequences.

"After conducting a study of dead animals, it was discovered that cause of death was the consumption in excessive quantities of a food comprising a cheap and shoddy chicken litter which poisoned the animals that died."

The results showed traces of urea, which involves a pattern of intoxication, however, independently of this we are awaiting the outcome [of the investigation] of the manure" explained the federal official.

According to studies by SAGARPA, the manure contains large amounts of urea, which is transformed into ammonia within the stomach of the animal and produces amino acids or proteins, substances that in excess lead to poisoning.

[Urea can be fed to ruminants as an economical replacement for a part of the protein in a ration. The amount of urea a ruminant animal can use depends on the digestible energy or total digestible nutrient (TDN) content of the ration. Researchers have recognized non-protein nitrogen (NPN) compounds are used by bacteria in the rumen of cattle and sheep. Studies show these compounds are broken down to ammonia during the normal fermentation process in the rumen. Microorganisms in the rumen combine the ammonia with products of carbohydrate metabolism to form amino-acids and hence, proteins. The proteins formed in this manner (from NPN compounds) are similar in amino-acid content to the proteins available to the animal when the principal source of dietary nitrogen is intact protein.

Poultry litter is type of NPN. Much of the nitrogen in poultry litter is in the form of non-protein nitrogen (uric acid, urea, and ammonia) and is therefore of lower biological value than true protein.

The bacteria and protozoa, and the protein they contain, are digested by the animal farther on in the digestive tract. In this manner, the ruminant animal makes use of certain NPN compounds even though it does not possess enzymes of its own for their breakdown.

Urea toxicity (poisoning) may be a problem if urea is fed at high levels. Most cases of urea poisoning are due to poor mixing of feed or to errors in calculating the amount of urea to add to the ration. Accidental overconsumption of urea-containing supplements also has resulted in some cases of urea toxicity. If the proper level of urea is added to the ration and it is mixed uniformly, no problem should arise.

Urea toxicity is characterized by uneasiness, tremors, excessive salivation, rapid breathing, incoordination, bloat and tetany [muscular spasms]. These signs usually occur in about the order listed. Tetany is the last sign before death occurs. Laboratory findings of urea toxicity include a sharp rise in blood ammonia levels and a rise in rumen pH. Animals usually die when their blood ammonia level reaches 5 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood. Rumen pH will rise to about 8, and the normal function of the rumen will cease.

When low carbohydrate rations are fed, clinical signs of toxicity can be seen from as little as 0.3 grams urea per kilogram of body weight (0.14 grams urea/lb of body weight) of animals that have not been fed urea previously. Feeding a 1000-pound cow 7-8 pounds of 30 percent crude protein cube containing 10 percent crude protein from urea would give 0.3 grams urea per kilogram of body weight.

When adequate carbohydrate rations are fed, as much as 1-2 grams of urea per kilogram of body weight may not cause toxicity if animals previously have been fed urea. For instance, feeding 35 to 50 pounds of a 30 percent crude protein cube (10 percent CP from urea) to a 1000-pound cow provides this level of urea.
In this case, the poultry litter is what is providing the NPN source. How much carbohydrates are available to these animals is not evident from this article.

I hope that someone is doing a necropsy on some of the animals and checking rumen pH and ammonia levels. The analysis of poultry litter, or manure, should show that it does contain things like urea, and ammonia.
