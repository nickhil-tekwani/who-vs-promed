Canadian soldiers are bringing home from dusty Afghanistan a
powerful, drug-resistant bacterium that health officials have been
worrying about for several years.

3 Canadian soldiers who recently returned from Kandahar carrying
so-called "Iraqibacter" are under quarantine at a civilian hospital
in Quebec City. 2 civilian patients who came in close contact with
the soldiers at Hopital de l'Enfant-Jesus have also been isolated for
fear they may have contracted the bug officially named _Acinetobacter
baumannii_.

The [usually] hospital-acquired germ, commonly found in soil and
water, strikes weakened immune systems, especially in those
recovering from wounds. It has been known to cause conditions such as
pneumonia, meningitis as well as blood, urinary tract and wound
infections. Some people carry the bacteria on their skin without
showing symptoms.

2 years ago, the Public Health Agency of Canada warned Canadian
hospitals that outbreaks could happen after wounded soldiers returned
home from Afghanistan either sickened by the strain, or simply
carrying it in their system.

A 2007 report in the publication Wound Care Canada said incidences of
the strain have increased in American military hospitals. "With more
injured soldiers returning to Canada, we would expect the same
phenomenon to occur, albeit to a lesser scale, in Canada," the report
said. "Although rare, the finding of significant antimicrobial
resistance has made treatment more difficult. It is, therefore, an
emerging potential problem within hospitals."

Military hospitals treating USA troops serving in the Iraq, Kuwait
and Afghanistan 1st noticed an increase in _Acinetobacter baumannii_
infections in 2002, said a report by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. American soldiers have since dubbed the germ
"Iraqibacter."

A spokeswoman for Quebec City's Hopital de l'Enfant-Jesus said the
hospital has treated between 15 and 20 soldiers carrying the organism
since 2007. The 3 quarantined soldiers stayed at the military
hospital in Kandahar before arriving last Friday [14 Aug 2009] in
Quebec City from the war zone, Genevieve Dupuis said. "This isn't the
1st case we've had. We've received military patients returning from
Afghanistan with this bacterium since 2007," she added.

et al: Multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter infections in critically
injured Canadian forces soldiers. BMC Infectious Diseases 2007,7:95.
The electronic version of this article published online on 14 Aug
2007 can be found online at:

A 2007 publication from the USA military (1) reported that only one
in 160 patients screened (0.6 percent) was found to have _A.
baumannii_ on their skin and only one of 49 (2 percent) soil samples
were positive, but the organism was recovered from treatment care
areas in 7 of the 7 field hospitals sampled. Their results suggest
that environmental contamination of field hospitals and infection
transmission within the healthcare facilities played a major role in
the outbreaks of this organism. Indeed, one of the 5 cluster groups
with _Acinetobacter_ infection involved hospitalized individuals who
had not been deployed to Iraq. Be that as it may, in a recently
published surgical study (2), _Acinetobacter_ species were the most
commonly isolated organism from trauma-related infections in
battlefield casualties from Iraq. Of note, one of the authors, Kyle
Petersen, of the 1st paper and 1st author of the 2nd one submitted
ProMED's initial posting on this topic.

Community-acquired _Acinetobacter_ infections do occur. As an
example, Anstey and colleagues reported 11 cases of bacteremic,
community-acquired _A. baumanii_ pneumonias from the Northern
Territory of Australia and reviewed 34 others (3). Cigarette smoking,
alcoholism, chronic lung disease, and diabetes were risk factors. The
scenario has also been described in Papua New Guinea (5) and other
parts of Asia including Taiwan and Malaysia, as well as more
developed countries such as the USA (4) and France (6).

_Acinetobacter_ infections of wartime injuries have been recognized
for a time much longer than this current conflict; Myron Tong
reported that _Mimeae-Herellea_ (organisms of which some were renamed
_Acinetobacter_) were the most common Gram-negative bacilli isolated
from wounds on day one of hospitalization in the Viet Nam conflict
(7). Additionally, Aarabi (8) found that _Acinetobacter_ was the 2nd
most common cause of infection of missile-related head wounds in an
Iranian report from data collected during the Iran-Iraq conflict.
