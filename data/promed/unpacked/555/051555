China: 1735 deaths during period Jan-Aug 2006
---------------------------------------------
BEIJING: China's Ministry of Health reported a total of 1874 rabies cases
in China during the first 8 months of this year, with 1735 deaths. The
figure is up 29.2 per cent on last year, the ministry said.
The cases were found in 21 provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities across China including Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, Guangdong,
and Hubei.
The ministry said that China ranks second in the world after India in terms
of the number of rabies cases. Every year more than 50 000 people around
the world die of the disease, with most of them living in developing countries.

[The continuing failure to reduce rabies mortality in China is alarming.
Travellers should take note. Neglect of this aspect of public health in
China is surprising. Rabies is a vaccine preventable disease, which in
urban areas could be contained by comprehensive provision of facilities for
post-exposure vaccination for the human population, elimination of stray
animals, and compulsory vaccination of domestic pets. In rural areas,
however, a programme of wildlife vaccination may be an essential additional
component in rabies control.
