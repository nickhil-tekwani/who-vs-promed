Doctors have treated 3 people with Legionnaires' disease, which has been
traced back to a leisure center at a hotel. Experts say the risk of
infection at the Cricket St Thomas Hotel in Chard has been isolated. But
they are warning anyone who has used the hotel's facilities in the last
month to watch for symptoms. One of the people diagnosed has made a full
recovery, but 2 others are still in hospital.

The leisure center's showers and spa tub have been closed for extra
cleaning, but its pool, which is chlorinated, is open. It is the second time
in recent months that the hotel, which was the setting for BBC television
series To The Manor Born, has been at the center of a health scare. Dozens
of guests were affected by the Norwalk virus, which causes vomiting and
stomach upsets, before Christmas -- forcing it to close for 3 days.

"We understand that people might be concerned about hygiene," said hotel
spokeswoman Sarah Gallo. "But it is important to note that Norwalk virus is
an airborne virus which was brought into the hotel by someone visiting the
hotel. What we are dealing with now is bacteria, but we are dealing with it
in all the ways outlined by the Somerset Health Protection Unit."
[Noroviruses are generally spread by direct contact or via contaminated food
rather than airborne. There is not necessarily any relationship between the
two outbreaks, but separating them by the kind of organism does not
necessarily keep them from being transmitted the same way. - Mod.LL]

Experts are warning anyone who has stayed at the hotel since the beginning
of the year who suspect they may have the disease to contact their GP for
tests. Dr Elaine Farmery of the Somerset Health Protection Unit said: "We
are quite concerned that there are people out there -- all over the
country -- who may not be taking the appropriate antibiotics. They may just
think they have the flu, but normal antibiotics will not treat the
legionella organism." [One might quibble with the definition of a "normal"
antimicrobial, certainly the use of macrolides and quinolones for adult
respiratory infections is commonplace, and both have good activity against
_Legionella_ organisms. - Mod.LL]
