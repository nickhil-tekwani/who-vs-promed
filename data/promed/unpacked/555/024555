The following background data on leptospirosis and leptospirosis in the
United States were extracted from the GIDEON software program:
Leptospirosis has a worldwide distribution, and is most common in rural
areas in proximity to farming and animal raising activities during warmer
months. Other occupations at risk include mining, sewage and canal work,
fish farming and trench warfare. Urban disease may occur in areas of rodent
infestation. The major reservoirs are rodents; however, others include
hedgehogs, rabbits, hares, mice, voles, skunks, opossums, mongoose, frogs,
snakes and birds. Dogs are associated with _Leptospira interrogans_ serovar
canicola; cattle - serovar hardjo; cattle and swine - serovar pomona; mice
- serovar ballum; field mice (Apodemus speciosus) - serovar autumnalis;
rats - serovar icterohaemorrhagiae.
Rats may pass organisms in their urine for several months. The leptospires
survive in fresh, but not brackish water.
Disease due to serovar icterohaemorrhagiae is usually overt, and often
manifest as hepatitis, meningitis and nephritis. Canicola fever is due to
serovar canicola (occasionally serovar pomona) and characterized by a
milder lymphocytic meningitis, without hepatic or renal involvement.
Serovar automnalis (occasionally serovar pomona) produces Fort Bragg fever,
a febrile illness associated with raised, erythematous, and mildly tender
pretibial skin lesions.
Leptospirosis in the United States:
The disease is most common in the southeastern states and Hawaii. The
male/female ratio for reported cases varies from 1.5 to 3.3; however, among
the 381 cases were reported for Hawaii during 1971 to 1990, the male/female
ratio was 8.5/1. Over 80% of patients are Caucasian.
The annual rate in Hawaii is estimated to exceed 128/100,000.
The most common sources are dogs or cattle; rat transmission also occurs.
The principal cattle strains are _Leptospira hardjo_, _L. pomona_ and _L.
grippotyphosa_.
Year Reported cases
1947 to 1956 268
1957 to 1966 775
1967 to 1976 666
1977 to 1986 741
1989 93
1990 77
1991 58
1992 54
1993 51 (includes 24 from Hawaii)
1994 38 (includes 22 from Hawaii)
Twenty deaths were ascribed to the disease during 1982 to 1991.
Leptospirosis is no longer nationally notifiable as of 1995.
