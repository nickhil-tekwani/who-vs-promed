CCHF morbidity in the Volgograd Oblast
--------------------------------------
As of Wed 5 Aug 2009 there have been 2 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) in Volgograd, one of which resulted in death. The regional
Rospotrebnadzor laboratory conducted 12 PCR tests on human specimens and
found 2 of them were positive.

There were 212 cases of CCHF in the South Federal Okrug of Russia in 2008.
Investigators at the Volgograd Centre for Hygiene and Epidemiology
collected a total of 4856 ticks, including 1002 specimens identified as
_Hyalomma marginatum_ (21 per cent). So far in 2009 846 samples of ticks
have been tested for CCHF virus antigen, of which 9 samples tested positive
(1 per cent). Of 585 samples of ticks tested in 2008 3.2 per cent tested
positive.

The index of _Hyalomma marginatum_ tick abundance on cattle (a tick
infestation indicator) was 0.2 for the last 6 months. The same indicator
was 0.5 for the previous year. The tick abundance index for all pasture
ticks in the Oblast was 0.7 for 2009 and 1.1 for 2008.
