Another 4 cases of pork products originating in China have tested positive for African swine fever (ASF), including the 1st courier package found to contain meat products that tested positive for the virus, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Thursday [24 Jan 2018].

During a press conference organized by the government's ASF disaster response center, COA deputy chief Huang Chin-Cheng said the 4 new cases brought the total to 18 [see also item 2].

According to the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ), the 15th case was found on 14 Jan 2018 in a courier package containing ham sausages produced in China's Shandong province.

It was the 1st time pork products in a courier package tested positive for ASF, the BAPHIQ said, adding that this shows the virus could enter Taiwan through multiple channels, including the postal system.

The 16th case, which was dried pork jerky produced in China's Jiangsu province, was sent anonymously to inspection officials in Hsinchu.

Meanwhile, the 17th and 18th cases were found on 11 Jan 2019 in 2 different type of sausages brought by passengers from the Chinese city of Tianjin, for which separate fines of NTD 200 000 (USD 6474) were issued.

To prevent AAF from reaching Taiwan, the government on 18 Dec 2018 increased the fines for bringing in pork products from countries with ASF outbreaks, with 1st offenders liable to a fine of NTD 200 000 and repeat offenders NTD 1 million [USD 32 567].

As of 23 Jan 2019, 71 people had been fined NTD 200 000 for violating the ban, according to data from the BAPHIQ.

[2] ASF-contaminated pork products in Australia & Asia; awareness USA
Date: Tue 22 Jan 2019

1. The Australian Department of Agriculture has reported the 1st cases of African swine fever [ASF] detected in products confiscated by authorities at points of entry. Authorities communicated that the ASF virus was found in 5 of 152 samples analyzed by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong. In addition to the findings in Australia, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan have also reported the identification of ASF in confiscated products at ports of entry since last August [2018] (Map 2 includes the following data: South Korea - 1st ASF-positive product detected on 26 Aug 2018; Japan - 1st ASF-positive product detected on 22 Oct 2018; Taiwan - detected 12 ASF-positive samples out of 708 decommissioned products. Reported steadily since 31 Oct 2018).

2. In a communication with SHIC, USDA/APHIS has indicated: "In August 2018, the USDA communicated with the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regarding the importance of heightened awareness of ASF and the potential risks associated with swine products carried by travelers. USDA requested that CBP pay close attention to passenger baggage from ASF-affected countries."

"CBP reports that their personnel maintain a high degree of vigilance to mitigate the risk of ASF entry into the country through pork and pork products. They also report that they are closely analyzing data and looking for any changes in seizure rates of swine products, particularly within the past couple of months. Increases in inspections (both passengers and express consignment cargo) are occurring; however, rates of swine product interdictions are remaining relatively flat. This is actually good news, as it suggests that CBP was operating with high efficiency prior to the increased emphasis on swine/animal product vigilance. We will continue to encourage the high focus on swine and animal products and will continue to monitor for any upticks.

"USDA does not currently have a protocol for testing seized pork products for ASF. We consider all seized product to be potentially contaminated and handle and dispose of such materials as contaminated. Existing mitigation measures have successfully prevented to date the introduction of numerous foreign animal disease affecting swine, such as African swine fever, classical swine fever, and foot-and-mouth disease."

[The OIE has published, since 4 Oct 2018, 8 periodic ASF global situation reports; the most recent report covered the period 15 Dec 2018-17 Jan 2019; it is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/ASF/Report_8_Current_situation_of_ASF.pdf.

The following excerpts from the 8th report may be of interest:

1. Pertaining to China:
"In this period, 98% of all losses (80 014 of 81 824 animals) occurred in Asia. Compared to the previous period, the losses notified by China remained stable (from 81 023 in the previous period to 79 715 animals in the current one). In this country, the recurrence of the disease in a single farm accounted for 51% (39 684 animals) of all of their notified losses."

2. Pertaining to the entire world:
"Countries with ongoing outbreaks in the current period: 10 countries notified ASF through immediate notifications and follow-up reports, 7 in Europe (Belgium, Hungary, Latvia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine), 2 in Asia (China and Mongolia), and Chad in Africa. The new occurrence in Mongolia demonstrates the dissemination of the disease towards northern Asia and clearly demonstrates a deteriorating trend in this region."

The continued detections of ASF-contaminated Chinese products upon entrance into other countries are indicative of the wide dissemination of the virus throughout China. This hazard warrants alertness globally. - Mod.AS
