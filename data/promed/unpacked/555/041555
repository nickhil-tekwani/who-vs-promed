Kentucky animal health authorities have confirmed additional cases of neurologic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) in horses currently or previously residing at the quarantined facility in Oldham County. Additionally, a horse residing on a different Oldham County facility tested positive for non-neuropathogenic EHV-1.

In the initial Oldham County case, all the horses on the property were tested for EHV after 4 horses residing there tested positive for neurologic EHV.

"Results of testing for the EHV-1 ... identified 2 additional horses positive for EHV-1," the Equine Disease Communication Center reported on 12 Jan 2017. "In addition, (a) horse that had spiked a fever late last week tested positive (for) the same virus type (neuropathogenic strain).

"All 3 of these horses were moved from their stabling area and placed in the isolation unit, and none of the remaining horses in the barn were positive for EHV-1," the EDCC said. "Subsequently, the horse that had fever presented with neurologic abnormalities on Monday [9 Jan 2017] and was moved to isolation at a veterinary hospital for treatment, where it continues to improve."

At last update, the Kentucky Department of Agriculture (KDA) had traced and located all equids that left the index facility since mid-December 2016.

"Two horses that had moved were identified as positive," the EDCC said. "These horses are in isolation on private facilities and are being monitored with the established protocol."

Meanwhile, in the 2nd Oldham County case, one horse tested positive for non-neuropathogenic EHV-1 after developing a fever on 9 Jan 2017, the EDCC said. That horse has not exhibited any neurologic signs.

"The affected horse on this new premises was moved to an isolation barn when fever was detected, and plans are in place to remove him from the premises tomorrow," the EDCC said. "The barn where this horse resided was placed under order of quarantine by the KDA. All the horses' temperatures in all barns on the premises are being monitored and recorded daily.

"Samples (nasal swabs and whole blood) were collected from each horse residing in the affected barn, and those samples were submitted to the laboratory for EHV-1 testing," the EDCC said. "KDA has and will continue to have personnel on the grounds monitoring activity."

The EDCC said that, although this is the 2nd premises currently under quarantine in Oldham County, different strains of the virus are involved. There is currently no evidence that this case is related to the initial outbreak.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

The equine herpesvirus outbreak at Fair Grounds widened Tuesday [10 Jan 2017], with 3 more horses testing positive, and a new, more rigorous testing protocol that could extend the quarantine of the New Orleans track during the height of its racing season.

The 3 horses testing positive Tuesday [10 Jan 2017] all ran a fever for a brief period but showed no other signs and now are healthy, according to their trainers. Two of the cases were in barns not previously affected by the outbreak. Merrill Scherer, who is stabled in barn 4, had a horse test positive, as did Tim Glyshaw in barn 30. The 3rd positive, on a horse trained by Ken Hargrave, came in barn 47, which already was under quarantine because of a positive test there on 3 Jan 2017. The start of a 14-day quarantine of barn 47 will be reset to 10 Jan 2017.

The 3 positive tests all were for the so-called wild subtype of the herpes virus, known as EHV-1. Wild-type infections are far more common and far less serious than cases of the neuropathogenic subtype of the EHV-1 virus, which often involves neurologic symptoms and can prove fatal. In a small number of cases, the wild subtype of the virus will mutate in the equine host into the neuropathogenic subtype.

A neuropathogenic EHV-1 case was the 1st reported at Fair Grounds this winter, on 26 Dec 2016. The horse that tested positive had to be euthanized and remains the only animal to have died from the virus. A 2nd neuropathogenic case was reported on 31 Dec 2016 in barn 14, but that horse has since recovered. No horse since 31 Dec 2016 has tested positive for the neurophathogenic subtype.

There now are 6 Fair Grounds barns under quarantine: numbers 4, 14, 30, 36, 47, and the receiving barn.

The Louisiana State Department of Agriculture and Forestry, in conjunction with federal officials and Fair Grounds, announced a policy, beginning Wednesday [11 Jan 2017], of testing every horse in barns under quarantine. Horses that test positive will be taken to the isolation area set up on the backstretch, as the 3 horses Tuesday [10 Jan 2017] were. Horses that test negative will be tested again no sooner than 72 hours later. To exit quarantine, a barn must produce a full set of negative tests on the 14th day after the quarantine began.

Until this policy was introduced, barns with positive tests were merely required to go 14 days without any horses showing symptoms of illness and testing positive for EHV-1 in order to exit quarantine. Barn 14 was scheduled to come out of quarantine on 13 Jan 2017, and entries from that barn were accepted for the 13 and 14 Jan 2017 cards. Those horses now will have to be scratched, as will horses from the new barns quarantined Tuesday [10 Jan 2017]. Besides Scherer, barn 4 houses horses trained by Ray Sibille and Carlos Silva. Glyshaw shares barn 30 with trainer David Heitzmann.

Morning training is conducted in 3 shifts: Horses from the general population train 1st, followed by horses from barns that have had a wild-type EHV-1 positive, and a 3rd window for horses stabled in barn 14.

Horsemen are beginning to wonder whether the outbreak has a horizon. A significant percentage of the thoroughbred population (4 percent is the figure widely cited) will test positive for the wild type of the EHV-1 virus under any conditions. The widespread testing Wednesday [11 Jan 2017] is likely to produce further positives.

With so many barns now under quarantine, and no shippers allowed, the task of filling race cards will become more difficult. Between the large number of EHV-1 scratches and races carded for turf but rained onto dirt, cards last weekend at Fair Grounds were decimated. Entries taken Wednesday for the Thu 19 Jan 2017 card, however, were surprisingly solid: 77 in 8 races.

The 6-stakes card of 21 Jan 2017 which includes the Grade 3 Lecomte for 3-year-olds, is scheduled to be drawn Friday [13 Jan 2017].

Meanwhile, Delta Downs, about 230 miles west of Fair Grounds, has extended its ban on ship-ins through 16 Jan 2017. Delta has not reported any EHV-1 cases. The many Louisiana horsemen based at training centers in the state, particularly in the Lafayette area, currently have nowhere to race since their horses aren't allowed to come to Fair Grounds and Delta, and Oaklawn Park has placed an indefinite ban on Louisiana horses.

There have been no reports of EHV-1 anywhere in Louisiana beyond Fair Grounds. John Walther, assistant commissioner for animal health and food safety with the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, said the department been in contact since the start of the Fair Grounds EHV-1 event with equine facilities throughout Louisiana.

Walther said 65 Fair Grounds ship-ins could have been exposed to an EHV-1 positive horse in the receiving barn. Those horses all have been traced, and EHV-1 testing on them was scheduled to begin Wednesday [11 Jan 2017].

The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) reported on 10 Jan 207 that a 12-year-old Quarter Horse mare displaying severe neurologic signs of disease has tested positive for non-neuropathogenic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

"Due to the severity of clinical signs, the horse was euthanized," the CDFA said. "The premises of 56 exposed horses in Los Angeles County has been placed under quarantine, and all horses are being monitored for clinical signs with twice daily temperature monitoring."

Additionally, the CDFA said, a febrile 32-year-old horse residing on the index property tested positive for non-neuropathogenic EHV-1 on 10 Jan 2017.

"This horse has been placed in isolation on site," the agency said.

The CDFA said it has staff onsite that has begun an epidemiologic investigation.

An outbreak of equine herpes virus 1 (EV-1) and 4 (EV-4) has been confirmed in Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire.

Vets Chiltern Equine Clinic published details of the outbreak on its Facebook page and said that biosecurity measures were in place.

This is the 2nd outbreak of the virus reported in recent months.

In November 2016, 4 horses were put down at a yard on the border of north Hertfordshire and south Bedfordshire following an outbreak of EV-1.

Chiltern vet Carmel Molloy said it could not be determined whether the outbreak in Chalfont St Giles is connected to the one on the border of north Hertfordshire and south Bedfordshire.

"It's such a contagious disease it's impossible to tell," she told H&H.

Advice to owners:
The practice offered advice to owners surrounding the disease.

"This is a very infectious virus which can cause respiratory disease, neurological disease and abortion in mares," they said.

"If you have any questions regarding EHV, please don't hesitate to get in touch. If you are concerned about your horse, particularly if he or she has a high temperature, please give us a call straight away.

"Risk of infection can be minimised with good biosecurity measures, i.e. avoiding close contact or sharing of water or feed buckets with other horses, particularly at competitions, and isolating new horses at livery yards. Known cases should be isolated."

She added that yards should continue practising good biosecurity measures at all times.

"We should always be doing it all year round."

The forms of equine herpes virus:
There are 5 forms of equine herpes virus.

EHV-1 and EHV-4 are very common, and almost every horse will have been exposed or infected at one time or another, according to Chiltern Equine Clinic.

"The most common signs are those of an upper respiratory tract infection. Depending on the infecting strain and the individual horse's immune response, the severity can vary markedly from little or no clinical signs to a high temperature, lethargy, purulent nasal discharge and cough.

"The incubation period ranges from approximately 2-10 days.

"EHV can set up a latent infection, i.e. the virus remains in the horse after cessation of clinical signs, and can become reactivated at times of stress.

"The horse might not exhibit clinical signs during these periods but can spread EHV in oral and respiratory secretions."

Equine herpes in pregnant mares:
In pregnant mares, EHV-1 and EHV-4 can also cause abortion.

The abortion tends to occur in late pregnancy regardless of the time at which the mare became infected.

"If many mares on a stud are infected, particularly with EHV-1, we might, therefore, see 'abortion storms' in which many mares abort within a short period of time," added the Chiltern spokesman.

"Clearly, the emotional and economic effects of this can be terrible.

"In rare cases, EHV can invade the nerve tissue of the spinal cord. The resulting inflammation causes weakness and ataxia (wobbliness) and can quickly progress to recumbency.

"Unfortunately, the majority of these neurological cases are fatal.

Treatment:
"As EHV is a virus, we cannot kill it with antibiotics. Treatment involves supportive therapies such as anti-inflammatories, and administration of intravenous or oral fluids.

"Since EHV is so widespread within the horse population, it is very difficult to pinpoint the source of infection. There is a vaccine for EHV-1 and EHV-4, which can reduce the severity of clinical signs and reduce the shedding of the virus by infected horses, but does not give complete protection from infection."

Chiltern Equine Clinic has produced a poster providing information regarding EHV and sensible biosecurity precautions.

To receive a copy of the poster by email, please contact the clinic.

[The statement that EHV is prevalent in the equine population certainly is true, with so many animals in a variety of places currently being affected by this virus.

While biosecurity measures such as not sharing holders or water buckets as well as isolating affected horses are all necessary, it is also important to be checking the animals' temperature at least twice a day. That is the earliest sign of a problem. The sooner appropriate treatment and supportive care can be provided, the better the chances for the animal. - Mod.TG]
