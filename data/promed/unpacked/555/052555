Bluetongue -- extension of the BTV 1 and BTV 8 restriction zones
----------------------------------------------------------------
The restriction zones as related to bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes 1 and
8 have been extended to cover the whole departments of Charente,
Charente-Maritime, Dordogne, Gironde, and Lot-et-Garonne.

The updated list of all the regulated communities/municipalities will be
sent by mail.

As of 18 Jul 2008, 6280 cases of BT disease are listed in France for the
year 2008 (of which 6 are cases of BTV serotype 1). A total of 260 BTV-8
cases of 2008 have been ascribed to viral circulation during 2008.

For information: during 2007, 15 569 BT cases have been reported (of which
3 caused by BTV-1).

[The above update includes a map showing the locations of the new outbreaks
while indicating their respective involved serotypes. The document includes
also a detailed list of the regions under BTV restrictions.

A previous French bluetongue update of 2 Jul 2008 (see posting
20080703.2027), said: "To date, 6017 cases of BT disease are listed in
France for 2008 (of which 6 are cases of BTV serotype 1). A total of 13
cases of BTV-8 of 2008 have been derived from viral circulation in 2008."

Comparing the 2 reports it may be concluded that, since 2 Jul 2008, the
number of 2008 BTV-8 cases has increased in France from 6017 to 6280 (263
added), while the number of new cases, attributed to virus circulation, has
increased from 13 to 260 (243 added). This deserves an explanation which
would be very much appreciated.

According to a report from the Bluetongue French National Reference
Laboratory (AFSSA-Alfort), dated 3 Jul 2008, only 4 isolates of BTV-8 had
been performed, until 3 Jul 2008, from samples derived during 2008 (1 in
March, 3 in June). See Zientara et al, posting 20080703.2027, item [2]. An
official update would be most welcome.

We are obliged to repeat the 2 questions included in the above posting --
which, in fact, may address all BTV-8 affected countries:
1. How many new cases, indicative of virus circulation, have been
identified during 2008?
2. Has the 2008 vector season commenced already?

Since the disease activity season is expected to start soon anyway (or has
already started?!), practitioners, veterinary inspectors, and
epidemiologists will have to deal with suspected cases and provide
advise/directions to animal breeders. We find it useful to include the 2
following abstracts from reports written by Dutch, French, Belgian, and
German investigators. The papers have just become available online as
corrected proofs of articles in press. - Mod.AS]

Clinical signs in sheep and cattle in Belgium, France, and the Netherlands
(abstract)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting August 2006, a major epidemic of bluetongue (BT) was identified in
north west Europe, affecting The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Luxemburg,
and the north of France. It was caused by BT virus serotype 8 (BTV-8), a
serotype previously unknown to the European Union (EU). In this outbreak,
the virus caused clinical disease in a few individual animals within cattle
herds, whereas overt clinical disease was usually restricted to sheep.

Investigations in Belgium suggested that the 1st clinical signs of BTV-8
appeared mid July 2006 in a cattle herd, while the 1st suspicion of a
BT-outbreak in Belgium was reported on 17 Aug 2006. In the 1st 10 BTV-8
outbreaks in the Netherlands, the owners indicated that the 1st clinical
signs started approximately 12­17 days before a suspicion was reported to
the veterinary authorities via a veterinary practitioner.

In BTV-8 affected sheep flocks, erosions of the oral mucosa, fever,
salivation, facial and mandibular oedema, apathy and tiredness, mortality,
oedema of the lips, lameness, and dysphagia were among the most frequent
clinical signs recorded. The most prominent clinical signs in BTV-8
affected cattle herds were: crusts/lesions of the nasal mucosa, erosions of
lips/crusts in or around the nostrils, erosions of the oral mucosa,
salivation, fever, conjunctivitis, coronitis, muscle necrosis, and
stiffness of the limbs.

Case fatality and clinical recovery in sheep and cattle in the Netherlands
(abstract)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data collected in the Netherlands during the Bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV-8)
epidemic indicated that in outbreak cattle herds, predominantly dairy and
nursing cows were clinically affected and not young stock, beef cattle,
beef calves, or breeding animals. In outbreak sheep flocks, mainly ewes and
­- if present ­- rams, were clinically affected and not the lambs.

Median morbidity rate in outbreak herds was 1.85 per 100 sheep-month at
risk and 0.32 per 100 cattle-month at risk for sheep and cattle,
respectively. The mean proportion of BT-affected animals in outbreak herds
that recovered from clinical disease was approximately 8 times higher for
cattle compared to sheep in the Netherlands. Median mortality rate in
outbreak herds was 0.5 per 100 sheep-month at risk of dying and 0 per 100
cattle-month at risk of dying for sheep and cattle, respectively. Median
recovery time of both sheep and cattle that recovered from clinical disease
in outbreak herds was 14 days.

Median case fatality was 50 per cent in sheep outbreak flocks and 0 per
cent in outbreak cattle herds. It is concluded that morbidity and mortality
in outbreak cattle herds was very limited during the BTV-8 epidemic in the
Netherlands in 2006. In outbreak sheep flocks, morbidity was limited, with
exceptions for a few flocks. However, almost 50 per cent of the clinically
sick sheep died in outbreak sheep herds.

[The above observations in both papers may serve as a helpful tool in the
dealings with new bluetongue disease outbreaks in affected countries, and
particularly in new, hitherto unaffected territories, which may be expected
within Europe and maybe elsewhere.

One comment is due: though paper II includes the statement "there were
suggestions by farmers that part of the differences in mortality rate could
be attributed to differences in sheep breeds, but we were unable to verify
this", both papers do not include any information on the animal (bovines,
ovines) breeds exposed and affected. Breed susceptibility, particularly in
sheep, is of utmost significance when clinical signs, morbidity and
mortality of bluetongue are addressed.

BTV-8 vaccination in the affected European countries seems to proceed
according to plans. In the UK, the Protection Zone will be extended again
from Mon 21 Jul 2008 to cover Worcestershire and the districts in North
Yorkshire (Scarborough, Ryedale, Hambleton and Harrogate), Cheshire
(Macclesfield, Congleton and Crewe and Nantwich) and Greater Manchester
(Rochdale, Oldham, Tameside and Stockport) previously in the Surveillance
Zone, following the delivery of 1.9 million additional doses of Bluetongue
vaccine. This is in accordance with the Bluetongue vaccination plan in the UK.

restriction zones in Europe is available at
