[1] Vaccines: CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations)

The world still needs more -- and better -- COVID-19 vaccines. But a major hurdle stands in the way of the development of new vaccines, as well as the critical studies needed to determine the best way to use these important tools, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) warned in a letter published Tuesday [7 Sep 2021] in the journal Nature [see citation below].

Unless countries that have purchased vaccine doses and companies that have already brought vaccines into use agree to find ways to resolve the problem, manufacturers that trail the 1st wave of producers may not be able to prove that their vaccines work. Not only will that slow efforts to vaccinate the planet, it will block development of next-generation vaccines, and it will stymie efforts to answer key public health questions, like whether boosting with a different vaccine would generate better protection, or whether giving smaller -- fractional -- doses could protect more people more quickly.

The letter was signed by CEPI's director of vaccine research and development, Melanie Saville.

In an interview with STAT, CEPI's US director, Nicole Lurie, said the organization has been trying for months to break the logjam, to no avail. "We're going round and round in circles."

The problem stems in part from the fact that at this point in the pandemic, it isn't considered ethical to test new vaccines against placebos; instead, they would have to be tested against one of the existing shots. But getting one's hands on licensed or authorized vaccines for study purposes is nigh on impossible; all available doses have been snapped up by countries keen to vaccinate as many of their citizens as possible.

Contracts for those doses contain rigid stipulations about how the vaccines can be deployed. The doses often have to be used in the country that made the purchase; when the Biden administration wanted to share AstraZeneca doses with Canada and Mexico in March [2021], it loaned the doses to get around the restrictions. Contracts also often stipulate that doses that have been purchased must be used for outbreak control, not for research purposes, Lurie said.

There's little upside for companies to make doses of their vaccines available for study purposes. With global demand vastly exceeding current supply, manufacturers can sell every dose that they can make.

And there are potential downsides. If a clinical trial testing a new vaccine shows it performs better than the vaccine to which it was compared, that doesn't help future sales of the comparator vaccine. Likewise, if a study showed that it would be better to use a different vaccine as a booster shot -- called a heterologous boost -- that could undercut plans by manufacturers like Pfizer and Moderna to sell 3rd shots of their vaccines.

There are many questions that need answering about the best way to use COVID vaccines. And the only way to answer them is to conduct studies that would require doses of vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech's Comirnaty and Moderna's Spikevax, as well as the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines and shots made by manufacturers outside of North America and Europe.

"Whether it's interval [between doses], whether it's heterologous prime-boost [studies], whether it's boosting strategies, fractional dosing, whatever . . . you need an authorized vaccine" to test against, Lurie said. "And we can't get access to vaccines. That's the basic issue."

The problem shouldn't be insurmountable. The South Korean vaccine manufacturer SK Bioscience announced recently that it is beginning a Phase 3 trial of a vaccine it is developing in conjunction with vaccine giant GSK, which is supplying a boosting compound known as an adjuvant. The clinical trial will compare the SK vaccine against AstraZeneca's vaccine. SK Bioscience also produces the AstraZeneca vaccine.

On the health policy studies front, so-called mix-and-match trials are being conducted both in the United States and in Britain. The aim is to see whether using 2 different vaccines is more effective than using the same vaccine for both priming and boosting doses.

The US trial, being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is studying combinations of the 3 vaccines authorized for use in this country: the Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J vaccines. The UK trial, being conducted by the University of Oxford, is studying combinations of the Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines -- which are all authorized for use in Britain -- as well as a vaccine made by Novavax, which is in the process of seeking emergency use authorization from the British regulatory authorities.

But in both cases, the trials are only being conducted using vaccines authorized for use in the country in which the study is being conducted. That means that questions that have global ramifications -- for instance, could some of the Chinese vaccines be more effective if boosted with a Pfizer, AstraZeneca, or Novavax vaccine? -- won't be answered by these studies. None of the Chinese vaccines has been authorized in either the US or the UK.

Lurie said CEPI is willing to finance some of these crucial studies, but "moving forward on any of those things is contingent upon us getting vaccine."

The amount of vaccine doses needed is not massive. A Phase 3 trial of a new vaccine might require 20 000 doses of a comparator vaccine. A Phase 2 trial measuring immunogenicity -- the levels of antibodies vaccine doses generate -- would need substantially fewer. The British trial, called Com-COV2, is giving just over 1000 volunteers a 3rd dose of a vaccine that differs from their original vaccination regimen. The US trial is smaller still, involving about 150 people.

Lurie said the problem could be solved, if countries buying vaccine modify the contracts with suppliers. A number have initially indicated willingness, she said, but progress has stalled when they realize the amount of work involved.

"We have a global problem to solve," Lurie said. "We're stuck with the vaccines we have unless we can move forward."

[2] Remote learning: mental health
Date: Tue 7 Sep 2021

A study late last week in JAMA Network Open [see citation below] reveals a small link between COVID-19-related school closures and worse child mental health, particularly among older and Black and Hispanic students and those from low-income families.

University of Washington at Seattle researchers led the study, which involved an online and phone survey of 2324 US adults 18-64 years old with at least one child aged 4-17 years from 2-21 Dec 2020. Parent participants, randomly selected from the AmeriSpeak panel (developed by NORC at the University of Chicago), reported child emotional, peer, conduct, and hyperactivity problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.

Of the 2323 adults who completed the survey, 71.9% were women, 16.0% were Hispanic, 10.5% were Black, and 18.1% had a high school education or less.

Among children, 58.0% engaged in distance learning, while 18.0% were in a hybrid format, and 24.1% attended in person. Of children learning from home, 17.1% belonged to a learning pod, a group that completed schoolwork together, as did 29.3% of those in a hybrid model.

Relative to children attending school from home, those who attended in person came from higher-income households (mean difference, USD 9719) and were more likely to be White (65.8% vs 44.5%).

One reason may be that private schools, which were more likely than public schools to be open during the pandemic, often have high proportions of White children from higher-income families, the authors said. More Black and Hispanic families may be more likely to choose distance instruction because they have higher odds of having an at-risk family member or believe that their child's school can't effectively mitigate COVID-19 risk.

Children from higher-income homes also saw more benefits from in-person education than those from lower-income families, an effect not seen with hybrid students. "It is possible that schools with more resources have smaller class sizes, closer student-teacher relationships, more school counselors per student, and, consequently, a greater ability to help regulate child behavior," the authors wrote.

Older children who were engaged in distance learning had more mental health struggles than those attending classes in person, while younger students attending school remotely had similar or somewhat better mental health outcomes than those learning in person. Older children are especially vulnerable because they are in the midst of forming more complex social relationships and higher-stakes academic outcomes, the researchers wrote.

"Thus far, reopenings have prioritized younger children because of the lower transmission rates compared with older students and the relatively higher burden of care they require from working parents," the authors said. "Unfortunately, current results suggest that school closings have been disproportionately detrimental to mental health adjustment for older children, with effect sizes in the small range."

The use of learning pods lessened the effect of hybrid schooling on mental health difficulties, but the same was not observed for distance learning.

The researchers said that a host of factors related to remote education could chip away at children's mental health, including isolation, decreased access to mental health services, loss of free and reduced-cost meals, disrupted routines, decreased physical activity, lack of structure, stress due to technological limitations, and lack of identification of abuse and neglect.

For racial minorities and students from low-income families, the interruption of their schooling may be compounded by racism, poverty, food insecurity, and home instability. "Most families are struggling to support their child's at-home learning; however, challenges may be heightened among families with low income who lack workplace flexibility or the financial resources to work fewer hours or pay for child supervision," the researchers wrote.

The authors called for more funding for mental health personnel in the schools, as well as community-based supports.

"Critically, as children return to in-person instruction, mental health inequities may not resolve on their own," they concluded. "Ensuring that all students have access to additional educational and mental health resources must be an important public health priority, met with appropriate funding and work force augmentation, during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic."

Mental health and physical are tied together. It is critical that schools have at least one nurse on staff to attend to children 's physical health and a mental health specialist who is trained in talking with children with mental health issues. The COVID lockdown policy was extremely hard on most children, but especially on those children who were just beginning to form social networks and children who were at the stage where school results have important consequences for their future prospects in life. - Mod.LK]

[3] Diagnostics: pooling samples

Abstract
--------
The rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals remains a key strategy for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Frequent testing of populations to detect infection early in asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals can be a powerful tool for intercepting transmission, especially when the viral prevalence is low. However, RT-PCR testing -- the gold standard of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis -- is expensive, making regular testing of every individual unfeasible. Sample pooling is one approach to lowering costs. By combining samples and testing them in groups, the number of tests required is reduced, substantially lowering costs. Here we report on the implementation of pooling strategies using 3-d and 4-d hypercubes to test a professional sports team in South Africa. We have shown that infected samples can be reliably detected in groups of 27 and 81, with minimal loss of assay sensitivity for samples with individual Ct values of up to 32. We report on the automation of sample pooling, using a liquid-handling robot and an automated web interface to identify positive samples. We conclude that hypercube pooling allows for the reliable RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, at significantly lower costs than lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests.

[RT-PCR testing is expensive, making regular testing of every individual prohibitive. Pooling samples has worked well in blood banks to detect blood-borne pathogens and should work well with SARS-CoV-2 detection. It is cost efficient and can be run frequently to rapidly identify and quarantine infected individuals. It allows detection of infection early in asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals, especially when the viral prevalence is low. Along with lateral flow individual point-of-care tests, pooling offers a good approach to controlling virus spread. - Mod.LK

[In the past 24 hours, 13 countries including the USA (107 060), UK (37 179), India (39 398), Iran (27 138), Turkey (23 638), Malaysia (18 547), Philippines (17 977), Russia (17 425), Mexico (15 784), France (14 534), Thailand (14 176), Viet Nam (14 208), and Brazil (13 645) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 11 278 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 5 Sep 2021 to late 6 Sep 2021). There appears to be a weekend-related drop in the reported case numbers. A total of 61 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 32 of the 61 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 6.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 3.5% increase in daily reported cases and 18.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 800 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 222.77 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.60 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
