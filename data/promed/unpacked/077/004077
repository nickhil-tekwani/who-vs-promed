CCHF takes a deadly toll in Central Asia
----------------------------------------
A tick-borne virus is making its deadly return to Central Asia. In
late June [2009], a 23-year-old gave birth to her 2nd child at a
hospital in the Turkistan district of Kazakhstan's southernmost South
Kazakhstan Province. But ensuing complications and surgeries led to
more complications and surgeries. Within a few weeks [the woman], her
newborn, 2 surgeons, and a pediatrician at the hospital were dead.
[The woman] had contracted Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] from
a tick that latched on to her in her home. Breast-feeding in turn
transmitted the disease to her newborn. Continued bleeding that
required 2 operations after her delivery spread the disease to the
surgeons, and the pediatrician got it from the baby [see ProMED-mail

At least one other person in Kazakhstan has died of the fever in
recent months, and many more are believed to have been infected. The
outbreak is even worse in Tajikistan, where tens are believed to have
died this summer [2009], including physicians, and the number of those
infected could number in the hundreds.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever gets its name from its discovery in
the Crimea in the 1940s, and subsequent outbreak in the Congo in the
late '60s. The disease is carried by ticks, which often live off wild
and domesticated animals, and has been found in Eastern Europe, the
Mediterranean, parts of China, and Central Asia. Predictably, news of
the latest spread of CCHF in Central Asia has caused panic in some
areas.

In early August [2009], 24 people were reported to have died of CCHF
in the western Tursunzade area within a 2-day period. Witnesses cited
in the report said the town was under quarantine and surrounded by
law-enforcement officials. Following a request from the Tajik
government, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stepped in to help.

As reports surfaced that 4 infected people in Kulob were recovering
from the fever, WHO and Tajik officials held a joint seminar on [24
Aug 2009] to inform locals about preventive measures they can take. "A
group of 3 consultants from the WHO arrived in the country to assist
us on diagnostics, cures, and preventive measures at the sources of
the epidemic, and to evaluate what has been done by Tajik Health
Ministry specialists," said Tajik deputy health minister Aazam
Mirzoev. "They will share with us their own vision and solutions where
needed, and evaluate where and what kind of aid could be helpful."

Dr Pierre Rollin, acting chief of the Special Pathogens Branch at the
Centers for Disease Control [& Prevention] in Atlanta, Georgia, told
RFE/RL that CCHF is no stranger to Central Asia. "This virus has been
known in this area for decades; it's not a new virus," Rollin said.
"This virus has been described there in the 1940s, 1950s, so every
year there is some that pops up here and there. There are 2 ways to be
infected -- from ticks or from contact with [the blood of] the
patient." Stressing that one would have to come into contact with the
blood of an infected person to contract the virus from a human, Rollin
explained that different people can react in different ways to the
virus. Sometimes, "the disease can be very mild," Rollin said. "We
don't know why there is mild disease and severe disease. Some get a
fever like the flu and it goes away in a few days and people recover."
In severe cases, however, the patient can hemorrhage under the skin
and or internally. This is usually accompanied by very high fever.
These symptoms are particularly dangerous, Rollin said, "if it is
digestive bleeding, vomiting, or diarrhea with blood, and in that case
the prognosis is not very good, and the patient should be kept under
very good care."

Rollin stressed that the virus cannot be passed by eating the meat of
an animal that had an infected tick on it. "The animal may be infected
with the virus but have no sign, no symptom, and the virus is really
not in the meat," he said.

So what can people in areas where the infection already exists do to
limit the possibility of becoming infected? "They should limit the
number of people who are in contact with the patient, and then they
should use gloves, or if you have to touch something that could be
infectious, you can put on a plastic bag if you don't have a glove,"
Rollin explains. "Bleach will destroy the virus; any detergent will
destroy the virus. So for example, say you have a patient that had
some bleeding and you want to take care of the bed sheets, to clean
them, you should use a plastic bag to remove them or put them in a
bucket of water and bleach and leave it for 30 minutes or an hour and
that will destroy the virus." Rollin continued: "Be sure to clean all
the instruments that have been used, all the tables, spoons, forks
they used when they ate, all the glasses that the patient has used to
drink. Disinfect it; water with bleach will destroy the virus;
detergent will destroy the virus." Rollin also stressed the importance
of basic hygiene. "Using soap, washing one's hands very often is
effective at destroying any virus that is on the skin," he said. "We
don't think the virus can penetrate the skinÂŠso wash your hands as
often as you can with detergent or soap and it will be good."

Rural areas in Central Asia are often far from the nearest medical
center, meaning it could take hours, or days, before someone infected
with the fever can be brought to a hospital. Rollin emphasizes the
need for speed in getting an infected person to a medical facility. He
gave the following tips for helping someone who has contracted the
disease in the interval before they can receive medical care. Infected
"people bleed and have diarrhea, and they are going to lose a lot of
water, so [others] should keep giving liquid to the patient. Try to
avoid giving aspirin, for example, as that will cause more bleeding.
They should try to contact healthcare services as soon as possible,"
he said. "And again, if you have a case in the family, that means most
likely this individual has been bitten by a tick that has been
infected, so people should really pay attention to ticks in this
area." Rollin says that anyone bringing a potentially infected person
to a medical center should inform healthcare officials immediately
about contact or suspected contact with ticks, so medical staff can
take the appropriate precautions. And he said people in these rural
areas should check themselves and their clothes often, especially
before entering their homes, to be sure they do not have any ticks on
them.
