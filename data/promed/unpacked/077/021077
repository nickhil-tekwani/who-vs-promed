Mumps Cases in Brazos County
----------------------------
One confirmed case of mumps has been reported in Brazos County,
Texas, and several probable cases are also being looked into by the
county health department. Mumps symptoms can include fever, headache,
muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite. Swelling of the
salivary glands can also follow.

According to WebMD, symptoms will not appear in up to one-third of
people infected, especially in children younger than 2 years
old.Those who are infected are able to spread mumps up to 2 days
before symptoms begin, and then for between 5 and 9 days after the
symptoms start. Symptoms usually last for 10 days if they manifest
themselves. Only complicated cases require hospitalization, according
to WebMD. Most recover with rest and care at home.

"Although the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine is not a
prophylactic treatment once exposed to mumps, it is advised to check
your immunization status to protect from possible future exposures,"
according to the release from the Brazos County Health Department [BCHD].

Health care providers are required to report both probable and
confirmed cases of mumps to their local health department. No other
information concerning the confirmed or potential cases was released
by the BCHD.
