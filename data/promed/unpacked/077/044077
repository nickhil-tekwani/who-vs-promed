Suspected outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis in Iraq
-------------------------------------------------------
"The emergence of a number of black fever cases in southern and central
provinces," the sources said in remarks published by al-Iraq newspaper. The
source said preventive measures against black fever include fighting
mosquitoes that transmit the disease and spraying infected areas with
chemicals. The parasitic disease is usually transmitted to humans by
mosquitoes. It causes high fever, anaemia, swollen liver, and enlargement
of the abdomen.

[The symptoms mentioned in this newswire are consistent with the late
stages of visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala-azar (black disease).
The disease is caused by the protozoan organism _Leishmania_; most commonly
by _L. donovani_, but also _L. infantum_, _L. tropica_ and _L. chagasi_.
The insect vector involved is the phlebotomus (sandfly). According to
GIDEON 8500 cases were reported during 1971 to 1980. There is no
information since then, but it is very likely that a reduction in vector
control has resulted in an increase of leishmaniasis also in Baghdad. More
information on this outbreak would be appreciated. - MPP]
