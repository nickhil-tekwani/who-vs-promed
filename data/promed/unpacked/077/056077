New Jersey Records 7th WNV Human Case; 1st Death this Season
------------------------------------------------------------
TRENTON: A 45-year old Carteret (Middlesex County) man has become the first
state resident this season to die after being infected with the West Nile
virus (WNV). The man reported having intermittent fever and chills beginning
in mid-August, and was hospitalized at Raritan Bay Medical Center on 21 Aug
2001 after experiencing severe muscle weakness. He developed medical
complications and, after a long course of illness, died on 4 Oct 2001. The
man was most likely bitten by an infected mosquito in late-July or early
August. Since then, mosquito control activities and colder weather have
helped reduce the risk of further WNV transmission.
Blood samples drawn from the man and sent to a private laboratory for
testing came back positive for WNV in mid-September. The New Jersey
Department of Health and Senior Services was notified of the case on 2 Oct
2001, and arranged for blood and spinal fluid samples to be sent to its
Public Health and Environmental Laboratories for further testing. Those
tests also detected WNV and were sent to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), which confirmed the case yesterday.
Confirmation of this case brings to 7 the number of New Jersey residents
detected with WNV infection this season. In addition to people, the virus
has also been found this year in 1 071 crows, 322 mosquito pools and in 19
horses. In 2000, testing confirmed the presence of WNV in 6 state residents,
including one who died, and numerous birds, mosquitoes and horses.
While the state lab stopped accepting crows for WNV testing in mid-October,
human surveillance for the virus is continuing to the end of November, Dr.
DiFerdinando said. "Our surveillance efforts this season were effective as
we were able to document West Nile virus activity in all 21 New Jersey
counties," Dr. DiFerdinando said.
Dr. DiFerdinando said New Jersey's WNV surveillance, control and prevention
activities this season involved the coordinated efforts of a number of
federal, state and local agencies. These included the New Jersey Departments
of Health and Senior Services, Environmental Protection, and Agriculture,
the CDC, the State Mosquito Control Commission, the Rutgers Mosquito
Research and Control Unit, and local health and mosquito control agencies.
The commissioner said residents who reported dead crows to local authorities
also played a key role in tracking the virus. Commissioner Bob Shinn stated
that county mosquito control agencies and state agency coordination will
continue to perform surveillance of mosquitoes and mosquito habitats and
will conduct water management and biological control as needed during the
off-season.
While the risk of WNV infection has ended with the arrival of shorter days
and colder temperatures, the risk will return in the spring and people can
take steps now and next year to eliminate mosquito breeding areas around
their homes and protect themselves and their families from infection.
Among the personal precautions residents can take now are such measures as
eliminating standing water on their own property (such as clearing clogged
gutters, draining flower pots, recycling old car tires, etc.), and repairing
window and door screens. In the spring, summer, and fall residents can spray
insect repellent on their clothing and exposed skin in accordance with
labeling directions, wear long sleeved shirts and pants when outdoors, or
curb outdoor activities at dawn, dusk and during the evening.
