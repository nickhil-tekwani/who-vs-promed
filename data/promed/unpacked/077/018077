According to the Department of Health and the WHO Country Liaison officer
in Vanuatu, there is no dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Vanuatu at
present. There was a large outbreak of dengue fever (DF)/DHF in 1989/90,
beginning in April 1989. There were over 3,300 case in Port Vila, the
capital of Vanuatu, with 54 admissions for DHF and 12 deaths. The epidemic
spread to all provinces.
There have been no reported cases of cases of DHF nor DF in Vanuatu since
1990. The government has a surveillance system, and has been very active
in larval surveys and source reduction in the 2 major urban areas this
year, in anticipation of possible introduction of dengue virus from other
pacific countries.
There have been 5 cases of DF reported from Fiji last week, and there is an
outbreak in Western Samoa at present. Earlier in the year Tonga and Cook
Islands reported outbreaks of DF. These have been reported on ProMED-mail
and PacNet.
