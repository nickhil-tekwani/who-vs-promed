Egypt's Ministry of Health said on Tue 30 Apr 2013 that the total number of food poisoned students has reached 161 [at Al-Azhar, Cairo's centuries old seat of Sunni learning]. Preliminary investigations indicate that "bad tuna" served at the campus cafeteria is behind the events. There are no deaths reported so far, the ministry reaffirmed.

Food poisoning hit Egypt's top Islamic university on Mon 29 Apr 2013 evening, less than a month after a mass poisoning incident at the same university left more than 500 students hospitalized. Top Azhar cleric Ahmed al-Tayeb has formed a committee to investigate the incident.

Egyptian prime minister Hisham Kandil said in a statement that he asked the health minister to visit the hospitalized students and asked the interior minister to begin an investigation immediately.

[It will be necessary to assess the symptoms, their length, and the incubation period to analyze the potential etiologies of this illness. With the alleged vehicle of illness said to be tuna, it is tempting to postulate that scombroid fish poisoning was involved. Scombroid fish poisoning occurs after eating fish with high levels of accumulated histamine or other biogenic amines. Histamine is produced and can accumulate when bacterial enzymes metabolize naturally occurring histidine in fish. This most often occurs when fish is held at ambient or high temperatures -- such as 70-90 F (21.1-32.2 C) -- for several hours but can occur at more moderate temperatures (over 45 F or 7.2 C). Rapid chilling of fish immediately after catch is the most effective measure to prevent scombroid fish poisoning. Fish from the family _Scombridae_ (such as tuna and mackerel) contain high levels of free histidine in muscle tissue and are the commonest sources of scombroid fish poisoning, but other fish (such as mahi mahi, amberjack, bluefish, abalone, and sardines) also have been implicated.

The symptoms of scombroid are identical to those of an allergic reaction since the mediator of both are the same, histamine; but in scombroid's case, the histamine is externally produced and not secreted by the affected person's mast cells. The symptoms generally begin 15-60 minutes after ingestion and usually resolve within several hours.
