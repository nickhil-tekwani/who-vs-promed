[We are very grateful to our EpiCore Global Surveillance Project colleague for sharing the above information, and especially for showing that this refugee camp outbreak did involve _B. anthracis_. This was something we were not certain of from the initial report.

Arua is on the north-west border of Uganda with the Democratic Republic of Congo. See http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/uganda_physio-2005.jpg. For a description and map, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arua. - Mod.MHJ
