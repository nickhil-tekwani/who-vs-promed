A strange illness has affected over 1000 laid-off workers and their
families on a farm in Heilongjiang Province, beginning over a year ago.
Today, 300 people are still undergoing treatment in hospital. Workers say
the source of infection was sheep bought for them by the government.
Representatives of laid-off workers again went to Beijing to speak to the
authorities on Thu 22 Feb 2007.
A worker said that several hundred laid-off workers had been affected by
the strange illness since June or July 2005. He also said that because so
many people had been affected, herders brought the sheep herd to quarantine
inspection and discovered that the sheep carried brucellosis. A person has
already died. Although the infected sheep were culled, the worker feels
that there are still infected sheep and the outbreak could spread further.
The worker, who himself had been infected, said he was hospitalized for
treatment for about half a year and is now basically recovered, but is
still debilitated. He also said many of those who had recovered were still
experiencing varying levels of physical symptoms.

[The number of cases with persistent symptoms (about 30 per cent) seems
high for brucellosis, even for _B. melitensis_. ProMED-mail would like more
information about these cases.
The location of China's most north eastern Heilongjiang Province can be
found at: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilongjiang>. The name means Black
Dragon River, for the river separating the province from Russia, now called
the Amur. - Mod.LL
The report says that the illness is in "laid-off workers": were they been
laid off because of the illness or had they already been laid off before
they became ill? - Mod.SH]
