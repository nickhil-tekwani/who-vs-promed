A Victorian from a flood-affected region has been diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis. It's the first case of the virus detected in the state this season. The person is a resident of the Campaspe local government area in the state's north and authorities have not released details about their condition. The area was hit hard by flooding over recent months in towns including Echuca and Rochester, along the Murray River.

Last week a man in his 80s from South Australia's Riverland region was admitted to hospital with the virus and another man from central New South Wales was diagnosed with the condition [see Japanese encephalitis - Australia (31): (NS, SA) 20221224.8707439].

The virus is spread by mosquitoes, and most people will experience no symptoms but about one per cent of cases will become severely unwell. Symptoms can include confusion, headaches, vomiting, seizures, disorientation and may lead to neurological damage or death.

The Victorian health department said people who spend time working or camping outdoors in inland riverine areas or the Murray River were at increased risk of exposure. Vaccine supply is limited in Australia, but it is free for Victorians in flood-affected areas.

[Japanese encephalitis now has been detected in a third state, Victoria. With the onset of cooler weather, transmission to pigs and humans ended mid-year (2022), but the question remained if the virus had become endemic and transmission would resume when warmer weather returned. In November 2022, reports indicated that transmission had resumed. Over the past several weeks, health authorities have warned those living in areas of risk to become vaccinated. The November 2022 report indicates that ongoing surveillance of pigs and mosquitoes detected transmission to pigs. Now, there are 3 human JE cases: one in New South Wales, one in South Australia and now the third in Victoria. Given the increase in vector mosquito breeding sites due to flooding in South Australia and Victoria, extensive increases in JE virus transmission are expected. One hopes that the vaccination efforts will intensify and individuals will take the preventive measures listed above to avoid mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
