Viet Nam: New Human Case of Avian Influenza Reported
-----------------------------------------------
Specimens from a 49-year-old woman from the northern Ha Tay province
of Viet Nam have tested positive to H5N1 avian influenza virus
infection, according to a report in the local newspaper Labor on
Tuesday [2 Aug 2005]. The woman from the Quoc Oai district needs
respiratory assistance at the Institute of Tropical Diseases in
Hanoi, although she no longer has a fever. Earlier, she received
treatment at a provincial hospital for 3 days starting on 27 Jul
2005. The woman had bought a chicken at a local market and cooked it.
Local healthcare agencies have kept close surveillance on areas where
she lives and on those who have close contact with her.
Late last week [final week July 2005], local media reported that 2
people, a 26-year-old woman from southern Ho Chi Minh City and a
24-year-old man from southern Tra Vinh province, had died of avian
influenza. They exhibited symptoms of the disease after eating
chicken.
To date, the Viet Nam Health Ministry has yet to confirm the 3 latest
human cases of avian influenza infection. The Preventive Medicine
Department of the Ministry, in mid-July 2005, confirmed that a total
of 60 local people from 23 localities had been infected with bird flu
since late December 2004, of whom 19 had died.
To deal with possible new outbreaks among poultry, Viet Nam is
vaccinating chickens and ducks in northern Nam Dinh province and
southern Tien Giang province against avian influenza viruses,
including H5N1. It plans to vaccinate over 2.9 million fowl this
month [August 2005].

Viet Nam: Woman in Ha Tay Tests Avian-Influenza-Virus-Positive
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam's northern Ha Tay province reported that a local woman
tested positive for the deadly avian influenza virus that has killed
over 41 people in the country since late 2003, said local Lao Dong
newspaper on Tuesday [2 Aug 2005]. Specimens from the 49-year-old
woman from Quoc Oai district, tested positive for H5N1 avian
influenza virus infection according to a local source.
Although the woman no longer has an elevated temperature, she
continues to require respiratory assistance at the Institute of
Tropical Diseases in Hanoi. Earlier, she received treatment at a
provincial hospital for 3 days starting on 27 Jul 2005. The woman had
bought a chicken at a local market and cooked it. Local healthcare
agencies have kept close surveillance on areas where she lives and on
those who have had close contact with her.
Late last week [final week July 2005], local media reported that 2
people, a 26-year-old woman from southern Ho Chi Minh City and a
24-year-old man from southern Tra Vinh province, died of bird flu.
They showed symptoms of the disease after eating chicken. The H5N1
virus has also killed 12 Thais, 4 Cambodians and 3 Indonesians since
it first swept across much of Asia in late 2003.
To deal with possible outbreaks among poultry, Viet Nam is
vaccinating chickens and ducks against bird flu viruses, including
H5N1, in northern Nam Dinh province and southern Tien Giang province.
Viet Nam plans to vaccinate over 2.9 million fowl this month [August
2005].
