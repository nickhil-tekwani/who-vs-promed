HANOI - A new protozoan pathogen that causes diarrhea has been found for
the first time in Vietnam.
The _Cyclospora_ species was found by a group of Vietnamese scientists
headed by Doctor Phung Dac Cam of the National Institute of Hygiene and
Epidemiology with the assistance of an American scientist, B.A. Connor from
the New York Hospital, Cornell New York University.
The finding was announced at a conference on preventive health-care held
last week.
The new species was detected in stool specimens from two patients aged
three and 42 years old. They were among 703 diarrheal patients examined.
The two patients recovered quickly after using
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the doctors said.
