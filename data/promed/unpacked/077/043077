Measles has has been stamped out in some countries but not in Germany. A new wave of infection has rolled through Germany, prompting renewed discussion about compulsory vaccinations. A brownish-pink rash is the typical symptom of a measles infection but not the only one and certainly not the worst. High fever, a runny nose and a cough also often accompany it. The problem is that it weakens the immune system, making those suffering an acute measles infection more susceptible to more serious illnesses, such as pneumonia or encephalitis, both of which can be fatal. Worldwide, complications from a measles infection end in 200 000 fatalities each year. While measles infections are virtually non-existent in the United States, for example, there have been of late from 122 to 2308 each year in Germany, some resulting in fatalities. Currently, the virus is spreading primarily in Berlin and Bavaria, with Germany's Ministry of Health reporting more than 900 cases in the 1st half of 2013.

How can this be, given that vaccinations against measles have been administrated for more than 3 decades? While the rate of administering the so-called MMR vaccine -- which aims to immunize against measles, mumps and rubella -- has risen in recent years, many parents during the 1990s in particular chose to not have their children vaccinated, which means that young people between the ages of 15 and 30 are the main ones at risk of catching one of the viruses, said Annette Mankertz, director of the National Reference Center for Measles, Mumps, Rubella at Germany's Robert Koch Institute. Mankertz emphasizes the life-saving aspects of a measles vaccine.

According to the German Medical Association, children should be vaccinated twice: once between 11 and 14 months of age and a 2nd time 4 to 6 weeks later. In 2011, the rate for the 1st vaccination was 96.6 percent; the 2nd, at 92.1 percent. A 2nd vaccination provides almost full protection against infection. Experts estimate that a vaccination rate of 95 percent worldwide could permanently wipe out the virus. To prevent future measles outbreaks in Germany, Health Minister Daniel Bahr has brought compulsory vaccinations to the table. Mandatory vaccines were established in the country in the past, in 1874, against smallpox.

Other industrialized countries have stricter laws these days. In the United States, proof of the double-MMR vaccine must be shown before a child enters school. Vaccinations in Scandinavian countries are voluntary; there, explained Mankertz, so-called health nurses discuss the subject with families and encourage vaccinations. Wolfram Hartmann, President of the German Pediatric Society, calls unequivocally for a compulsory measles vaccine. The current wave of infections shows that physicians cannot depend on parents voluntarily having their children vaccinated. The legal framework offering such a compulsory vaccine is the German Protection against Infectious Diseases Act. With this, the government has the possibility of establishing mandatory vaccines for children at risk of catching extremely dangerous diseases.

Bahr anticipates a prickly debate. Michael Friedl, chairman of the Association of Doctors for Individualized Vaccination Decisions, disagrees with compulsory vaccines. Since illness is always an individual process; decisions around it must be left up to the individual, he thinks. The alternative practitioner is not generally against measles vaccines, rather is critical of administering them during childhood years. In his opinion, measles -- like other illnesses that prompt high fevers -- serve an important function. For one thing, experiencing such an illness allows children to better understand their bodies. For another, it helps to strengthen the immune system. Children can deal well with fever up to the age of 7, Friedl noted. "With many illnesses or disease that causes major problems for adults, the complication rate in the childhood years -- if they receive proper medical treatment, which for me includes allowing them to sustain higher fevers -- is extremely low," said Friedl.

Annette Mankertz, for her part, said that "strengthening one's immune system" does not necessarily mean subjecting it to the measles virus. More important, she said, is that the vaccine could save thousands of lives. And, vaccinated people are not only protecting themselves, but also other people. Still, since the measles vaccine uses live attenuated viruses, side effects can occur. In one in 10 cases, fever and headache can result or, less frequently, fever cramps. "Cerebral inflammation is also a risk with such a vaccination," Mankertz said. But the risk is only one in a million, she noted, which makes it one thousand times less likely than in an actual measles infection.

Measles vaccines in Germany are not compulsory at the moment. Measles is extremely contagious. The virus spreads through respiration, or contact with fluids from an infected person's nose and mouth, such as while speaking, coughing or sneezing. The contact does not have to be direct, as the virus can remain active for hours.

Measles infections are particularly dangerous for infants under one year of age. "One in 5000 infants develops subacute sclerosing pan-encephalitis [SSPE). This degenerative encephalitis, if not treated in its initial stage, is always fatal. Parents whose children receive such a diagnosis can only watch them die," said Mankertz.

The number of reported cases of measles in the Bible Belt region has gone up to 161, and 5 children have been hospitalised, the public health institute RIVM said on Mon 1 Jul 2013. The true figure is likely to be higher because not all patients will go to their family doctor, the RIVM said. The outbreak is largely affecting children aged 4 to 12 who attend orthodox Protestant schools. Many of the country's strict Protestant communities do not vaccinate their children on religious grounds.

Two of the hospitalised children have developed pneumonia; 2 others have meningitis. "These are exceptional cases," the RIVM told the Telegraaf. "The most common symptom is inflammation of the ear." The symptoms of the 5th child have not been released.

The outbreak began in May 2013 with 54 reported cases in the past 10 days.

[The Bible Belt (Bijbelgordel) is the name given to a strip of land in the Netherlands, which is inhabited chiefly by conservative Protestants. The Bijbelgordel stretches from Zeeland, through the West-Betuwe and Veluwe, to the northern parts of the province Overijssel. Other places in this area are Yerseke, Tholen, Ouddorp, Opheusden, Kesteren, Barneveld, Nunspeet, Elspeet and Staphorst. The 3 biggest cities regarded to be part of the Bible Belt are Ede, Veenendaal and Kampen. Currently, the traditional Dutch churches have around 650 000 members in about 360 churches.

The number of cases of measles in the Dutch Bible belt has gone up around 40 percent to 230 over the past week, the public health institute RIVM [Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu] said on Thursday [4 Jul 2013]. A further 2 people have been hospitalised, taking the total to 6 children and one adult. The epidemic has also spread to 3 more primary schools and one secondary school, the RIVM said.

Fundamentalist Protestants in the Netherlands do not believe in having their children vaccinated. The measles vaccine is given to most children in the BMR combination injection at the age of 14 months and again at 9 years.

The total number of cases may be far higher because not everyone will have visited their doctor, the RIVM said. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing.

The measles outbreak which centred on Swansea has been declared over 8 months after it began. Public Health Wales has announced there have been no laboratory-confirmed measles cases linked to the outbreak area since 22 May 2013. The outbreak began last November 2012 and saw 1219 diagnosed cases of measles in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. A total of 88 people were admitted to hospital due to measles during the outbreak, and one person died.

Dr Marion Lyons, Director of Health Protection for Public Health Wales, said: "With no confirmed measles cases in the outbreak area since the end of May 2013, we are able to say that the outbreak is over. This is in no small part due to the unprecedented efforts to give tens of thousands of catch-up vaccinations to those who had missed out at an earlier stage, and we are grateful to all of those health professionals who worked so hard to achieve this. Without so many vaccinations being given, we know the outbreak could have continued for many more months."

Efforts to control the outbreak saw 75 868 unscheduled MMR vaccinations being given at GP surgeries, weekend drop-in sessions and schools and occupational health vaccination sessions in Wales during the outbreak period.

But Public Health Wales is warning there are still around 30 000 unvaccinated children in the 10 to 18 age group across Wales and that there is still a possibility of a further outbreak in the future. Dr Lyons added: "We remain concerned about the large numbers still not vaccinated in the 10 to 18 age group, and we would remind those young people and those parents that they remain at risk of measles, even now that the outbreak is over, and should speak to their GP about vaccination as soon as possible. The only reason this outbreak could happen was because not enough young people in Wales were fully vaccinated."

Parents have been put on alert after a reported outbreak of measles at a County Durham school. One child at Wolsingham Primary, Weardale has contracted the disease, and parents are being urged to contact the school if they believe their child also has measles. Steve Whelerton, associate headteacher, said: "One child has measles, and we have informed parents and issued guidance to support them. Staff are more than happy to speak to parents who may have concerns."

One parent said she had taken her children to the doctor to receive a vaccination jab as soon as she heard about the outbreak. "I believe there are a lot of kids at the school in a similar position," she said.

http://www.msf.org/article243/syria-measles-epidemic-signals-growing-humanitarian-needs


A measles epidemic is sweeping through districts of northern Syria, with up to 7000 known cases, an indication that humanitarian needs are increasing and the country's healthcare system is in a state of collapse after more than 2 years of civil war. Teams from the international medical organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) have vaccinated more than 75 000 children in the provinces of Aleppo, Ar-Raqqah and Idlib in an effort to stem the epidemic among a population previously unused to outbreaks of this kind.

With the onset of violence in 2011, Syria's routine vaccination programme was disrupted throughout much of the country, leaving thousands of children unprotected. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes for camps for displaced people or overcrowded accommodations where sanitary conditions are poor. While mortality rates in the current outbreak remain relatively low, measles increases children's vulnerability to other infections, and when basic medical care is unavailable, complications arising from measles can be life-threatening.

The measles epidemic is a sign of the worsening humanitarian situation in northern Syria and the desperate situation in which much of the population is living. While MSF teams have vaccinated more than 15 000 children in the city of Aleppo and more than 22 000 in the rest of Aleppo province, it was a struggle to complete the vaccination campaign due to widespread violence and the fear that dominates people's lives. Queues for vaccinations had to be avoided for fear they might attract airstrikes or rocket attacks.

In Ar-Raqqah province, MSF has vaccinated 35 000 children so far in just one of the 3 districts. The partial coverage is due to security constraints and leaves thousands of children vulnerable to the disease.

In Idlib province, 164 cases of measles were reported in May 2013, and this figure increased in June 2013. This outbreak comes despite MSF's mass vaccination campaign in February 2013, when teams immunised 1900 children under the age of 5 in an area close to the border where more than 40 000 internally displaced people were living. MSF is planning to perform a 2nd mass vaccination in the camps and surrounding villages for all children under the age of 15. The target group could be anything from 10 000 to 30 000 children, as it is almost impossible to get accurate figures for the shifting population. The new surge in measles in the Idlib area is probably due to the continuous arrival of displaced people fleeing the fighting. A similar situation is unfolding in different parts of northern Syria.

A dozen cases of measles have been reported on Fri 5 Jul 2013 in the area of rural health Tembo, 680 km from Bandundu city, capital of the province of Bandundu. The president of the local civil society, Jean Kayishi, says no deaths have been registered so far. He fears that the measles can reappear due to lack of appropriate treatments. Jean Kayishi says patients without means prefer to be treated according to traditional medicine.

The President of the Civil Society of Tembo requested the medical authorities to take appropriate action. "This disease has reappeared with the arrival of Congolese refugees expelled from Angola where the infection has been neglected," said Jean Kayishi in an interview with Radio Okapi. He noted that the area health authorities are involved but cannot contain the situation around Tembo.

We recall that last September 2012, measles affected 594 patients, 21 of whom died, in Kikwit, which is 800 km from the city of Tembo (Bandundu).

An expert team from Berhampur on Fri 5 Jul 2013 rushed to Ganjam's Dasiamaripalli village where a 4-year-old girl reportedly died of measles on Thursday [4 Jul 2013]. At least 20 others have been infected in the village over the past week. "At least a dozen children, aged between 2 and 7 years, have been admitted to MKCG Medical College and Hospital here. Their condition is stable," said chief district medical officer (CDMO) P K Kar.

A senior paediatric specialist, an epidemiologist, a consultant with World Health Organisation (WHO), a laboratory technician, and a medical team from the nearby hospital were in the village to treat the other patients, he said. A doctor told the Times of India that the disease spread because people did not report the incidents.

The residents claimed that the children suffered from the disease despite vaccination. Health department sources said a decision to re-vaccinate children in the village as well as in the adjoining areas would be taken up after studying the prevailing situation.

Two cases of measles have been found in Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.). Health officials are now reviewing vaccination records of students at East Wiltshire Junior High School and Bluefield Senior High School, which is were the 2 attended. An adolescent youth has been diagnosed with laboratory confirmed measles. The youth is now recovering in hospital. A family member showed symptoms of measles earlier in June 2013 after returning from Europe, where measles outbreaks are occurring. This individual has since recovered and did not require hospitalisation. Neither patient had been vaccinated against measles.

"Measles spreads quickly, particularly in children and adults who aren't vaccinated," said Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison. "The majority of Islanders follow the routine schedule of immunization. This protects not only themselves from getting the disease but also helps to protect the general public by preventing future spread."

To prevent future spread, the Chief Public Health Office along with Public Health Nursing are reviewing the vaccination records of students at 2 island schools, East Wiltshire Junior High School and Bluefield Senior High School, which were attended by the 2 patients. "Fortunately, the vast majority of students at the affected schools are fully immunized for measles," said Morrison. "Public Health Nursing will be working to contact individuals in the 2 schools to offer vaccine to those not fully immunized with 2 doses of measles vaccine over the next week."

The Chief Public Health Office recommends that anyone with fever, runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough, should stay at home and limit contact with others to avoid spreading illness. If somebody develops a rash or if their symptoms worsen, call a doctor or seek medical care. Health officials recommend calling the doctor's office or health care facility before arriving so they can protect other patients from exposure. Anyone born before 1970 or those who have had 2 doses of measles vaccine are considered immune.

Morrison said it is important to note that the 2 patients are no longer contagious. However, the development of additional cases is now possible due to exposure to the measles virus in P.E.I.

The last previous laboratory confirmed case of measles in Prince Edward Island occurred in 1992.

There has been ongoing measles transmission among the Orthodox Jewish communities in Borough Park and Williamsburg, according to the Brooklyn District Public Health Office of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene [NYC DOH].

In an email letter, the District Office has advised: As of today, Fri 28 Jun 2013, there have been a total of 57 cases identified: 29 in Williamsburg, and 28 in Borough Park. The most recent case was sick on 6 Jun 2013, in Williamsburg. And as the transmission ensued, cases had been occurring in younger children. None of the cases had documented vaccination at the time of exposure, because they were too young to have been vaccinated or because their parents delayed or refused vaccine for their children.

The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene continues to work with pediatricians in the affected neighborhoods to ensure that young children are fully vaccinated and protected. We have also been placing ads in the local newspaper to inform the community about the outbreak and about appropriate actions to take. During this outbreak, to interrupt the spread of measles in this community, NYC DOHMH recommends that the 1st dose of measles-mumps-rubella-vaccine (MMR) now be given at 6 months of age to all Orthodox Jewish children living in Borough Park, Williamsburg, and Crown Heights. Although cases of measles have not yet been identified in Crown Heights, the department is extending this recommendation to this community to prevent introduction of measles. Further, non-Orthodox children receiving medical care in practices that serve predominantly Orthodox Jewish patients should also receive MMR vaccine beginning at 6 months of age because of the increased risk of exposure.

In the setting of this outbreak, Orthodox Jewish children aged 12 months and older living in Borough Park, Williamsburg, and Crown Heights who have received their 1st dose of MMR should receive their 2nd MMR dose now, as long as 28 days have elapsed after the 1st dose. This 2nd dose will be considered valid and will count toward the school immunization requirements.

Vaccination at an earlier age is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for outbreak control when many cases are occurring among infants younger than 12 months of age.

Local public health officials have learned of a confirmed case of measles in a contagious traveler who arrived at Sea-Tac airport on Thu 4 Jul 2013.

Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease caused by the measles virus. It is mainly spread through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes. Because most people in our area have immunity to the measles through vaccination, the risk to the general public is low. However, people who were in the same locations at Sea-Tac Airport around the same time as the contagious traveler should be aware of their immunity status, monitor themselves for symptoms, and call a health care provider promptly if they develop an illness with fever or an unexplained rash illness sometime between 11-25 Jul 2013. People at highest risk from exposure to measles include those who are unvaccinated, pregnant women, infants under 6 months of age, and those with weakened immune systems.

The contagious traveler flew from Beijing to Seattle on 4 Jul 2013. Persons who were in one of the following areas at Sea-Tac Airport between 12 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. on 4 Jul 2013 were possibly exposed to measles:
- South Satellite International Terminal Arrival Area
- Immigration and primary screening
- Adoption processing
- Restrooms in the South Satellite
- Baggage Claim/Customs
- Train to main terminal
- Main terminal baggage claim
- Elevator in Main Terminal to Level 2 parking garage
(See: Map of Sea-Tac Airport at: http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Maps-and-Directions/Pages/Terminal-Overview).

After arriving in Seattle, the traveler received medical attention and was diagnosed on 4 Jul 2013 and determined to be infectious beginning on 4 Jul 2013. Health authorities in Washington State and at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were notified. The CDC is following up to notify those on the same flights as the contagious traveler.
