Colorado health officials: Tularemia cases on record-breaking pace
------------------------------------------------------------------
Colorado health officials have recorded 11 human cases of tularemia since May 2015, putting the state on pace for one of the most widespread years for the disease in more than 2 decades. In 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [CDPHE] recorded 16 human cases, representing the 2nd highest number of cases since 1983 when there were 20. Before 2014, the previous average was fewer than 4 cases a year.

"People can get tularemia if they handle infected animals, such as rabbits, rodents or hares, or are bitten by ticks or deer flies," CDPHE said in a Wednesday [24 Jun 2014] news release. "They also can be exposed by touching contaminated soil, drinking contaminated water or inhaling bacteria."

Two Weld County men were diagnosed with tularemia -- also known as rabbit fever -- last week and health officials believe both were most likely exposed while mowing or working in their yards. "We are seeing an unusually high number of human tularemia cases along the Front Range this year," Dr. Mark E. Wallace, executive director of the Weld County Health Department, said last week in a statement. "The public really needs to be cautious and not get exposed to this disease."

A Boulder County resident who contracted tularemia in May 2015 after doing yardwork later died. That person's case was the 1st in Boulder County in 2015.

Health officials say tularemia can be avoided by wearing gloves while gardening or landscaping, using a dust mask when mowing or doing yard work, disposing of animal carcasses by using a long-handled shovel to place them in a garbage bag and wearing insect repellent when outdoors.

[As noted, humans become infected through various mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type of exposure will dictate the form of the disease manifestation, with cutaneous exposures usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms. A number of the cases reported were from aerosols associated with lawnmowers where the bacilli can be introduced into the respiratory tract causing a pneumonia that can be fatal. This has occurred in the past, particularly on Martha's Vineyard, an island off of Massachusetts, where tularemia pneumonia occurs in gardeners and landscapers primarily. Oculoglandular and oroglandular tularemia can also occur with aerosols.
