A report on the large measles outbreak in Lyon, France, 2010 to 2011
-----------------------------------------------------------
[From: Huoi C, Casalegno JS, Benet T, Neuraz A, Billaud G, Eibach D, Mekki Y, Rudigoz R, Massardier J, Huissoud C, Massoud M, Gaucherand P, Claris O, Gillet Y, Floret D, Lina B, Vanhems P. A report on the large measles outbreak in Lyon, France, 2010 to 2011. Euro Surveill. 2012;17(36):pii=20264

Summary
------------
In 2010 and 2011, the city of Lyon, located in the Rhone-Alpes region (France), has experienced one of the highest incidences of measles in Europe. We describe a measles outbreak in the Lyon area, where cases were diagnosed at Lyon University hospitals (LUH) between 2010 and mid-2011. Data were collected from the mandatory notification system of the regional public health agency, and from the virology department of the LUH. All patients and health care workers who had contracted measles were included. Overall, 407 cases were diagnosed, with children of less than one year of age accounting for the highest proportion (n=129, 32 percent), followed by individuals between 17 and 29 years-old (n=126, 31 percent). Of the total cases, 72 (18 percent) had complications. The proportions of patients and health care workers who were not immune to measles were higher among those aged up to 30 years. Consequently, women of childbearing age constituted a specific population at high risk to contract measles and during this outbreak, 13 cases of measles, 7 under 30 years-old, were identified among pregnant women. This study highlights the importance of being vaccinated with 2 doses of measles vaccine, the only measure which could prevent and allow elimination of the disease.

Introduction
------------
Measles is a one of the most highly contagious diseases. It is spread through respiratory droplets so that people in contact with the virus, who are not vaccinated or not immune due to prior infection, are at high risk of catching the disease. In France, vaccination against measles was 1st introduced in the vaccination programme in 1983, with a single dose for infants aged 12-15 months. The vaccination schedule was subsequently modified in 1996, whereby 2 doses of vaccine against measles were recommended, with the 1st dose still at 12-15 months. The 2nd dose was 1st administered at 11-13 years of age in 1996, then at 3-6 years of age from 1997 [1]. Since 2005, the 1st dose is recommended at the age of 12 months and the 2nd dose at the age of 13-24 months [1]. A catch up vaccination is recommended for individuals who did not receive 2 vaccine doses. Earlier vaccination is recommended for infants who are attending a daycare centre, with in this case, the 1st dose administered at 9 months of age and 2nd dose at 12-15 months of age.

Measles cases were sporadic in France until 2008. Since the beginning of the year 2008, France has experienced successive measles wave epidemics [2-4]. The 3rd wave was the largest and took place from October 2010 to April 2011 in the whole country, with the highest incidence in the south-east regions of France. Since 2008, measles are also spreading out of control in many other parts of Europe, such as for example Romania, Italy, Belgium or Switzerland [5-8]. Nevertheless, France appears to be the most affected, with more than half of the European cases [9]. Measles have been mandatorily notifiable in France since 2005. Health care practitioners, clinicians and biologists in laboratories have to report each suspected or confirmed case using a standardised form. Between January 2008 and April 2011, more than 18 000 measles cases were reported to the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (Institut de Veille Sanitaire). These included 10 deaths, among which 9 cases aged less than 30-years-old. Neurological complications affected 26 of the total measles' cases while 808 had severe pulmonary infections. About 4000 patients with measles were hospitalised [2,10]. The high burden of the disease in teenagers and young adults under the age of 30 years [2,3] besides children (up to 16 years-old) is a new main feature of this reemerging disease. Young women are also a specifically exposed population, in so far as they are at high risk to contract measles but cannot be vaccinated during pregnancy.

The Rhone-Alpes region has been the most affected area for measles in France [2,11], with an incidence of 97.9 measles cases per 100 000 population between October 2010 and September 2011. Lyon is the biggest city in this region, with about 475 000 inhabitants registered in 2008. Lyon University Hospitals (LUH) are the main hospitals in Lyon and form the 2nd largest hospital group in France. The objective of this study was to describe this large measles outbreak through notified cases diagnosed in LUH. The survey also presents a focus on pregnant women who when exposed while not immune are at higher risk of complications.

Extract from the discussion
---------------------------
In comparison with other European countries, France has been the most affected with 13 957 cases reported between January and August 2011 [9]. Italy, who reported 4300 measles cases during the same period was the 2nd most affected European country [6]. 4 measles cases among pregnant women were reported [6] and 36 percent of cases were hospitalised. Overall 14 percent presented complications [6], which was in concordance with the complication rate of 18 percent in the Lyon area. Romania also experienced a large measles outbreak in 2011, with 2072 reported cases [8]. The complication rate in Romania was much higher than in the Lyon area (respectively, 39 percent and 18 percent). Finally, the Geneva canton in Switzerland, which neighbours the Rhone-Alpes region, only reported 41 measles cases between January and May 2011, so it was far less affected than Rhone-Alpes area [5]. There, serious control measures, with quarantining and a vaccination campaign were systematically implemented. The larger number of cases that we experimented during the outbreak in Lyon area did not prevent carrying out a vaccination campaign, however, quarantining each measles case was more difficult to implement.

The main limitation of our study was a possible underestimation of the true measles incidence, as, in France, about 50 percent of measles cases were not reported on mandatory notification [10]. However this should not bias time-trends. Moreover, we were unable to calculate its incidence per 1000 inhabitants because the exact origin of individuals was not known.

In conclusion, catch-up vaccination campaigns should focus on individuals aged under 30-years-old who have not received 2 doses of measles vaccine and on HCW. The outbreak is likely to re-occur, especially in the regions of France with low vaccine coverage. Clusters of susceptible individuals accrued over the years [10,11]. Indeed, the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS) reported that among children of 24 months old in 2008, only 90 percent had received one dose of the measles vaccine while according to the French vaccination programme, they should have already got 2 doses [23]. A 4th epidemic wave has to be expected in France and Europe. Hospital-based surveillance of measles is relevant to estimate the spread of the disease in the community and to help with early detection of health care-acquired cases.

Jab warning after 20 cases of measles in Cumbria
-----------------------------------------
Around 6000 children in Cumbria are at risk of getting measles because they have not had the MMR vaccination, health chiefs have said. NHS [National Health Service] Cumbria said 95 percent of babies in the county had been immunised but that thousands aged between 5 and 16 had not had the jab. Teenagers moving to Cumbria are also being urged to get protected. In recent months 20 cases of measles -- which can leave victims deaf -- have been reported in the county.

The MMR vaccine is given in 2 doses, the 1st after the age of one, the 2nd before the child starts school. Dr Rebecca Wagstaff, the county's Deputy Director of Public Health, said: "Measles is highly infectious and anyone who has not previously been vaccinated is at risk when it gets into a community, as it has done here."

Students warned over measles outbreak
-------------------------------------
Students are being urged to get themselves vaccinated against measles after an outbreak in the region. 35 cases have been confirmed in Greater Manchester this year, compared to 25 in 2011. And across the north west there has been a surge in the illness, with 440 cases since February [2012], the majority in Merseyside. But health chiefs say students in Manchester -- which has the largest student population in Europe -- are also vulnerable and are encouraging them to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

Dr Paul Cleary, the Health Protection Agency's north west regional epidemiologist, said: "These are highly-infectious illnesses that can have serious complications. More than 60 of the measles cases on Merseyside needed treatment in hospital and some of these were very ill, requiring intensive care. Many of the worst affected were adults and teenagers over the age of 15 years. Thankfully there were no deaths in the Merseyside outbreak, but people do die from measles on rare occasions. This is a disease that should not be treated lightly."

They believe the number of cases is rising because parents are not taking their children to have the MMR vaccine -- which protects against the potentially fatal disease. The popularity of the jab dropped after an unsubstantiated theory in the late 1990s that it was linked to autism and bowel disease. Children need 2 doses of the MMR vaccine -- at 13 months and 3 to 4 -- to be fully protected against the infectious viral illness that at one time affected up to 800 000 people a year in Britain. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, sore eyes and a rash that develops 3 to 4 days after the illness begins. It can affect adults more severely than children and can be easily spread from person to person. Dr Cleary added: "We know that many teenagers and young adults missed out on MMR vaccination when they were young and these remain vulnerable to infection and are particularly at risk when they mix and mingle in close proximity in universities or further education colleges.

"However, it's not too late. If they have doubts about their vaccination status, they should contact their GP surgery who will look into their medical records and advise them. If they haven't been previously immunised they can arrange it through their GP practices and it could save them experiencing the disruption and suffering of illness when they go up to college," he said.

Measles outbreak claims 3 children in Pokot
-------------------------------------------
A total of 3 children have died and over 500 others infected following a measles outbreak in West Pokot County. Health officials said the disease was spreading fast and feared the death toll could rise unless urgent measures are taken. Pokot North District Health Officer [MoH] Obadiah Singoei confirmed the 3 deaths. Dr Singoei said blood samples have been taken to Kenya Medical Research Institute for analysis.

"Hundreds of children have been infected and the disease is spreading at an alarming rate in remote villages bordering Pokot-Turkana counties and Kenya-Uganda border," said the MoH. He said hardest hit areas in the district are not accessible due to rough terrain and lack of roads. The MoH identified the most affected areas as Konyao, Alale, Kasei, Kanyerus and Ombolion location along Pokot-Turkana border. Singoei said lack of funding has hindered vaccination campaigns against the epidemic that is threatening the lives of pastoralist children.

The disease, he said, broke out in villages in Alale Division before spreading to the neighbouring locations. Singoei said no vaccination has been conducted due to lack of funds. He said the Government provided the vaccines but lacked money to mobilise health workers and transport to conduct the exercise in the vast district. "We expected to conduct a mop up against the disease but we lack funds for logistics and we are appealing for financial support from humanitarian agencies such as Action Aid, World Vision and Unicef," he said. Information and Communication minister Samuel Poghisio urged the Government to speed up vaccination to save lives.

The West Pokot immunisation coverage stands at 60 per cent while the national coverage is at 92.

Kenya: Doctors warn against measles outbreak
---------------------------------------
Doctors in Nandi North district yesterday [13 Sep 2012] started immunising hundreds of children against measles following an outbreak of the disease in the area. The area Medical Officer of Health, Erik Terer, said children of followers of a religious sect in Kabiyet division have opposed the immunisation of their children.

"Members of the church have resisted efforts by the Ministry of Public Health to immunise their children and protect them from disease because they believe in the healing by the Holy Ghost," he said. Terer said more blood samples of the victims had been taken to the Kenya Medical Research Institute for analysis.

He said 5 children who have been admitted to the Kabiyet Health Centre were in a stable condition while several others have been treated and discharged. The church doctrines prohibit childhood immunisation and do not believe in modern western medicine [with the result that] parents keep their children at home [avoiding] compulsory immunization for all infants, Dr Terer revealed.

He said he had instructed public health officers in the district to ensure that all sick children of the members of the cult were taken for medications while those not immunised should be inoculated as required by law [because] their resistance is unacceptable and contravened children's rights. He commended members of the provincial administration for the support that enabled the revelation and the disease outbreak.

Areas seriously hit include Cheptuiyet location in Mosop where the religious sect has its big following and [accordingly] the Ministry of Public Health plan to conduct [a] massive campaign to vaccinate children. Paul Cheruiyot, a child Rights activist, called for the prosecution of parents and members of Dini ya Roho [sect] for violating the children rights.

Measles study questions spotty results during outbreak
----------------------------------------------
A 2nd study from Quebec is calling into question the timing at which young children are vaccinated against measles. The new research shows that teenagers who received the recommended 2 doses of measles vaccine but who got the 1st shot when they were 12 months old were 6 times more likely to go on to contract the disease than those who got their 1st dose at 15 months. The work was done to try to discover why a number of teenagers who would have been assumed to have been protected -- because they got 2 doses of vaccine in childhood -- nevertheless were infected during Quebec's large measles outbreak in 2011. More than 700 measles cases were reported in that outbreak.

Lead author Dr. Gaston De Serres of Quebec's provincial public health agency presented the work recently at a major international infectious diseases conference in San Francisco. The study was a followup to an initial paper on the outbreak that he presented to the same conference last year. While the situation bears watching, De Serres said Canadian policy on timing of measles vaccine delivery isn't likely to change just yet. "For Canada, I would probably say that at this time we will not change the schedule," De Serres said from the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. "We need to follow up with more studies."

Prior to the measles vaccine, most children contracted the disease and about 2 million a year died from it. One of the most contagious diseases to afflict humans, measles has largely been quelled in the Americas, though it remains endemic in other parts of the world. Still, outbreaks do crop up in North America. Generally, those outbreaks take place among children whose parents refused to vaccinate them. It is rare to see cases in vaccinated children. While measles can be particularly dangerous for infants, they cannot be vaccinated. That's because antibodies they get from their mothers while they were in the womb kill the virus in the vaccine before it has a chance to induce an immune response in the child. That phenomenon is called maternal antibody interference. Maternal antibodies protect an infant while its own immune system is just starting to develop. The effect of maternal antibodies wanes in the months after birth. The World Health Organization recommends giving the 1st dose of measles vaccine at 9 months, with the 2nd dose to follow any time after 12 months.

Jane Seward, a measles expert with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, said the goal is to vaccinate children as soon as the vaccine can take effect so as to minimize the risk of death and severe disease. "It's a balance between getting the 1st dose as early as possible to decrease deaths and as late as possible to get the best immune response," she said.

Residents inoculated after measles case emerges
-----------------------------------------------
Shanghai disease control authorities have taken emergency measures to vaccinate 400 residents of the Changqiao residential community in Xuhui district after a visitor from Anhui Province was diagnosed with measles, local media reported Tuesday [11 Sep 2012]. The case highlights the city's fragmented system for vaccination records as local health authorities demand almost all nearby residents to get vaccinated whenever a measles case appears.

The visitor was a woman in her 20s from Anhui Province who came to the community to visit a friend while in Shanghai, the committee member said. 7 doctors were dispatched to administer free vaccinations to residents in 7 of the community's buildings on the same day the Anhui woman was diagnosed, according to a report in the newspaper Youth Daily. It took 3 and a half hours to vaccinate the residents. "It is a regular measure that we take whenever a measles case is reported," a staff member surnamed Ding from the Changqiao Community Health Service Center told the Global Times.

The emergency measure, however, sometimes leads people who have already been vaccinated to receive an unnecessary dose, an insider from the Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.

"It was not until recently that Shanghai built a digital system to track vaccinations," he told the Global Times. "Many people above 20 years old have already lost their record cards. People do not remember whether they have been vaccinated for a certain kind of disease."

According to a 2006 plan by the Shanghai Health Bureau, the city aims to push down the annual measles incidence rate to less than one for every 1 million residents by the end of this year [2012]. However, the insider said that the city may be going about measles eradication in the wrong way. "While school-age children receive repeated vaccinations, authorities do not pay enough attention to migrants, which are the primary problem group in keeping down the incidence rate," he said. The measles incidence rate jumped from 5 per 1 million residents in the 1990s to 166 per 1 million residents in 2005 because of the rise in the migrant population, according to the plan.

"The measure should leave out local school-age children as almost all of them have been vaccinated for measles. Although the extra dose is not harmful, it is a waste of money and effort, and does not help control the disease," the insider said.

Cases are at historic low in Western Pacific region
---------------------------------------------------
An 86 percent decline in measles cases brings Western Pacific Region closer than ever to measles elimination.

Measles cases are at an historic low in the Western Pacific Region and it's making excellent progress towards eliminating the measles virus, according to the founding partners of the Measles and Rubella Initiative.

Efforts to reach more children with measles vaccine have rapidly reduced measles cases in the Region by 86 percent between 2008 and 2011. China, which accounts for 75 percent of the region's population, has reported a 92 percent drop in cases as a result of its nationwide measles immunisation effort. These findings were confirmed at a recent meeting of the World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region's Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for immunization. The TAG found that 32 of the 37 countries and areas in the region might already be free of endemic measles.

"China's national, provincial and local governments, together with communities are reaching unprecedented numbers of children with measles vaccine. In just 3 years, China's immunization efforts have lowered measles cases to historic levels for the country and the Western Pacific region," said Andrea Gay, executive director of children's health at the UN Foundation, on behalf of the Measles and Rubella Initiative.

Other countries that have made rapid progress against measles are Cambodia, Laos, Japan, Philippines and Viet Nam. Data presented to the TAG meeting showed how Cambodia, for example, made efforts to identify communities at highest risk of measles, prioritize them during measles campaigns in 2011, and improve their access to routine immunization services. These high-risk communities include ethnic minorities and people living in remote areas with limited access to regular health services.

"This year's regional measles trends are equally encouraging, with cases down 69 percent from January to June 2012 compared to the same period in 2011," said Dr. Stephen Cochi, Senior Advisor at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and a member of the TAG. Regional measles surveillance data shows there were 16 431 cases from January to June 2011 and just 5150 in the same period of 2012.

"Countries in the Western Pacific Region are also building an impressive disease surveillance network to quickly identify measles cases and prevent outbreaks," said Dr. Peter Strebel, Medical Officer at the World Health Organization. "This network includes laboratories that can identify different measles virus types and track spread of viruses between countries."

The TAG, which met from 21-23 Aug 2012 in Manila, urged countries with sustained measles transmission to focus efforts to interrupt the transmission "as a matter of urgency." These include China, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines and Singapore. Country measles surveillance shows that Malaysia is the only country in the region with a growing measles outbreak in 2012.

Measles is one of the most infectious viruses known to humans. It can cause serious illness and complications including pneumonia, diarrhoea and blindness. Children with weak immune systems are at greater risk of death, and measles still kills 380 children each day globally, particularly in India and countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

The global community aims to eliminate measles in 5 of the 6 World Health Organization regions by 2020. The Americas eliminated endemic measles in 2002 and is in the process of verifying the elimination of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome. "The Measles & Rubella Initiative believes that with a focus on equity, immunizing children wherever they live, being ready to respond to outbreaks and carefully tracking measles cases, all countries of the Western Pacific Region can soon be measles-free," said Dr. Robert Kezaala, the head of measles and rubella at Unicef. "This will bring us one critical step closer to a world where no child dies of measles."

The Measles and Rubella Initiative is a global partnership committed to ensuring no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome. Founded originally as the Measles Initiative in 2001, it is led by the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and the World Health Organization. Since 2001 the Initiative has supported 80 countries to deliver more than 1 billion doses of measles vaccine, helped to raise measles vaccination coverage to 85 percent globally and reduced measles deaths by 74 percent.

Measles outbreak in Sydney's south
----------------------------------
Schools are on high alert following a re-emergence of measles in Sydney's south-west. The outbreak comes as new medical research reveals a record number of parents are refusing to immunise their children.

There have been 40 reported cases in the Campbelltown area, with 10 sufferers being taken to hospital. Dr Stephen Conaty from the South Western Sydney Public Health Unit said in all cases those infected were not fully immunised. Those affected have been school-aged children and babies under 12 months. Conaty said all of the cases are either unimmunised infants because they may be too young to be immunised, or teenagers who may have missed either one or both of their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisations. The Department of Education confirmed 4 high schools and a number of primary schools are affected.
