Yellow rust threat to triticale
-------------------------------
Yellow rust has been the focus of much attention in the United Kingdom this [2011/12] season [see ProMED-mail post 20120208.0317] but in Denmark, triticale growers are already facing significant crop losses as a result of the disease.

Danish plant pathologists are concerned a significant breakdown in varietal disease resistance may have occurred. Prof Mogens Hovmoller, Aarhus University, says: "What is worrying the most is affected triticale which used to be resistant."

Triticale is considered very robust in terms of resistance to yellow rust and is very popular in Denmark. However, in 2009, a new rust race appeared almost overnight which devastated previously resistant varieties. In the most severely affected varieties, infection levels reached 100 per cent -- no green tissue remaining -- resulting in yield losses of 7.5 tonnes per hectare (3 t/acre).

"It turned out to be a single race which was very different from what we had seen before. This was a disaster for organic growers. We call this the triticale-aggressiv strain. But the strain is quite different from what we see in wheat," says Prof Hovmoller.

Now there are signs this season a further previously resistant variety is succumbing to the disease and Danish plant pathologists are currently investigating whether it is another form of the triticale-aggressiv strain or a more typical wheat race.

There is no evidence to date in the UK of any yellow rust races on triticale which are different to those seen on wheat.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Between seasons, the fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge". Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or the ability to break down genetic resistance of specific host varieties. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

Triticale (wheat-rye hybrids) affecting strains of stripe rust have also been reported from other areas. For example in Australia, a rust strain breaking down stripe rust resistance derived from a rye gene (Yr9) common in most triticale varieties has been reported (see links below).

A related pathogen, _P. hordei_ (previously _P. striiformis_ f.sp. _hordei_), affects only barley.
