[African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease that
is normally fatal especially in commercial pigs that have not been
previously exposed or vaccinated. The disease is transmitted through
direct contact with infected animals. Symptoms of the disease include
fever, inactivity, and loss of appetite. The abdomen and ventral chest
may present blue and red discoloration.

African swine fever outbreaks have been occurring in the Mbeya region
of Tanzania since December 2010. Currently, the movement of pigs,
pork, and other pig products from, to, and within the affected area is
prohibited until further notice. Prior to that ASF had not been
reported from Tanzania to OIE for almost 7 years.

The location of the current outbreaks can be seen on the map included
in the OIE report at the source URL above. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail
