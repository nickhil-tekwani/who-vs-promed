Active search for visceral leishmaniasis in Luque
----------------------------------------------------
The National Malaria Eradication Service (Senepa) is actively
searching for cases of visceral leishmaniasis in the locality of
Luque, where the 4th victim of the disease was reported.
The patient is a 14-month-old girl who died at the Tropical Medicine
Institute. Dr. Domingo Maciel, head of the leishmaniasis program at
Senepa, commented that the disease commonly affects malnourished
children; when the mosquito locally known as "karacha" bites them, it
is likely that the disease will occur. Maciel added that one of the
1st symptoms is fever that is present for more than 15 days.
So far, 3 infants have died of visceral leishmaniasis, and one adult
from Itapua, as a result of the cutaneous form of the disease. Maciel
emphasized that representatives from Senepa are searching for other
cases of the disease and setting traps for the phlebotomus vector.
Once its presence in the area is confirmed, the fumigation process
will begin. In addition, the public has been informed that infected
dogs must be sacrificed. Should a dog be diagnosed with the disease,
it must be taken to the National Antirabies Center. Alternatively,
the Municipal Pound may be contacted and they will pick up the
animals.

[The highest prevalence of Leishmaniasis is found in the southeastern
part of Paraguay, and both cutaneous and mucocutaneous forms are
seen. More than 90 percent of cases come from the 3 departments of
Caaguzu, Canendiya and San Pedro with reported incidence of about 50
per 100 000 population per year. So far more than 250 cases of
cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported in 2004. Between 30 and 40
percent of dogs tested positive in a recent survey. Visceral
leishmaniasis is very rare, which makes these cases unusual. - Mod.EP]
