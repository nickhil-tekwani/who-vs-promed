[Given the location of these 14 new outbreaks, and the situation of this disease in the area, the disease appears to be spreading within the country rather than reoccurring.

Aghdash and Ujar, the 2 new affected districts, are located in the middle of the country, thus suggesting that the disease is spreading rapidly. The 1st outbreaks of the disease occurred in the southwestern part of the country, in the districts Bilasuvar and Jalilabad near the border with Iran.

A LSD outbreak map from January 2014 to date is available at http://tinyurl.com/mcycwwt. To view the region of interest and the outbreak information in greater detail, click on the map to zoom in.

As was the case with the event communicated in July 2014, vectors and the illegal movement of animals are indicated as the probable source of infection. (See ProMED-mail post 20140719.2621294.)

For this most recent event, the report indicates vaccination as the control measure that is being applied. Follow-up reports may have more information on how this control measure is being implemented, such as vaccination coverage and type of vaccine used.
