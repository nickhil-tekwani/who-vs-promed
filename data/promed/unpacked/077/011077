COUNTRY & DATE: Ecuador. 15 Mar 2006
TYPE: Unofficial
ISSUE: Follow-up: outbreak reported in Pichincha.
SUMMARY: The director of the National Council for FMD Eradication (CONEFA),
Pablo Torres, confirmed that Ecuador is currently under yellow alert due to
the 2 FMD outbreaks detected in Pichincha. During the next days a red alert
may be declared as a result of new outbreaks in Pichincha, Bolivar (southern
Ecuador), and Imbabura (northern Ecuador, close to the Colombian border).
Torres recommended closing the Santo Domingo de los Colorados market, 70 km
from Quito, which is considered an FMD focus. Between 14 000 and 15 000 cattle
are traded per month in the Santo Domingo de los Colorados area.
