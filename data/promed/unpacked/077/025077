Septoria disease in winter wheat is at the worst levels in living memory, which should put growers on alert. The disease has been encouraged by the absence of a cold, frosty winter and the recent wet weather.

Fiona Burnett, Scottish Rural College (SRUC), warns that crops look worse than in the bad septoria year of 2012. She says the disease is normally present on the lower leaves of the wheat crop, but it is very unusual to see it on the upper leaves at this stage of the season. The danger is that the disease will spread quickly from leaf 3 to the flag leaf and so disrupt the crop's yield potential. Dr Burnett says the fungus can grow undetected for 14-28 days.

Dr Burnett advises to help protect the efficacy of the SDHI [succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor fungicides], after some isolates of net blotch in barley were seen to be resistant to SDHI fungicides in the UK last [2013] season.

The 1st confirmation of SDHI resistance in the UK last month [April 2014] has prompted significant concern, especially if the resistance to SDHI develops in septoria. Any sign that the wheat disease becomes resistant to SDHIs would be more serious than in barley, as there are more products to control net blotch.

[Cereal diseases of the septoria complex are caused by the fungi _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ (previously _Septoria tritici_) and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth of the plant and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Up to 50 percent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy, removal of inoculum sources, and use of resistant varieties. Septoria is considered the most important foliar disease of winter wheat in the UK and other parts of Europe where it has evolved high levels of resistance to many fungicides.

Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). The disease causes necrotic areas on leaves leading to yield losses of up to 20 percent. There are 2 types of the fungus, the net type caused by _P. t._ f. _teres_, and the spot type caused by _P. t._ f. _maculata_. The fungus survives between seasons on barley residue, volunteer barley plants, some grasses and seed. Disease management includes cultural practices to remove pathogen reservoirs, fungicide applications, use of clean seed, and use of resistant cultivars. Highly aggressive new strains of the net form are emerging worldwide.

While SDHI fungicides are not new, their previous limited use meant that resistance under commercial conditions remained limited to a few pathogens and crops. A "2nd generation" of SDHIs is currently being used to combat fungal diseases that have developed resistance to other groups of fungicides.
