Cutaneous anthrax, West Bengal, India, 2007
-------------------------------------------
Ref: Ray TK, Hutin YJ, Murhekar MV. Cutaneous anthrax, West Bengal,
India, 2007 [letter]. Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet]. 2009
Mar [date cited]. Available from
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/3/497.htm>.

On 8 Jun 2007, a healthcare facility reported 12 cases of cutaneous
anthrax in the Muslim village of Sarkarpara (population 361). On 4
Aug 2007, another facility 50 km away reported 8 cases from the
Muslim village of Charbinpara (population 835). These 2 outbreaks,
both in Murshidabad district, West Bengal, were associated with the
slaughtering of 4 cows. We investigated each outbreak to confirm
diagnosis, estimate magnitude (incidence and severity), and identify
risk factors. We conducted house-to-house searches to identify
case-patients and collected smears from skin lesions.

From Sarkarpara, we identified 45 cases of cutaneous anthrax and 2
deaths (attack rate 12 percent, case-fatality rate 4 percent); from
Charbinpara, we identified 44 cases and no deaths (attack rate 5
percent). In Sarkarpara, villagers had slaughtered a cow on 2 Jun
2007. The outbreak started on 3 Jun 2007, peaked on 6 Jun 2007 (one
cluster), and ended on 10 Jun 2007. In Charbinpara, villagers had
slaughtered 3 cattle, one each day of 16 Jul, 23 Jul, and 1 Aug 2007.
The 1st case occurred on 17 Jul 2007 and was followed by 3 peaks (3
clusters) (Figure). In each village, attack rates were highest among
persons 15-44 years of age. Microscopic examination at the district
public health laboratory showed gram-positive, spore-bearing bacilli
that were characteristic of _Bacillus anthracis_ on 7 of 20 smears
(5/10 from Sarkarpara and 2/10 from Charbinpara).

To test the hypothesis that exposure to meat of a slaughtered cow was
associated with illness, we conducted a retrospective cohort study
among families who had handled or eaten beef from cows slaughtered
during the week before the outbreak. Through interviews, we collected
information about possible exposures, including slaughtering,
handling meat or skin, and eating beef.

In Sarkarpara, we enrolled 296 persons from 59 families in the cohort
study. Persons who had slaughtered cows and handled meat and skins
had a significantly higher risk for illness than those who had not.
In Sarkarpara, risk associated with slaughtering cattle was 9.1 (95
percent confidence interval [CI] 6.0-13.7) and with handling meat 2.6
(95 percent CI 1.5-4.4) (Appendix Table). Slaughtering cows or
handling meat accounted for the largest proportion of cases; 8
percent and 33 percent of the population was engaged in these
practices, respectively (population-attributable fraction [PAF] 39
percent [95 percent CI 37.0-41.2] and 34 percent [95 percent CI
18.5-42.9], respectively). PAF associated with handling skins was 2
percent (95 percent CI 1.8-2.0).

In Charbinpara, we included 687 persons from 118 families in the
cohort study. Slaughtering cattle and distributing beef were strongly
associated with illness (Appendix Table). Slaughtering cows and
handling meat were common practices and accounted for the largest
proportion of cases (PAF 47 percent [95 percent CI 46.0-48.0] and 19
percent [95 percent CI 17.5-19.4], respectively). In Charbinpara,
risk associated with slaughtering was 19.0 (95 percent CI 11.0-30.0)
and with distributing was 11.0 (95 percent CI 6.8-19.0) (Appendix
Table). Of the persons who ate beef, anthrax developed in 17 percent
in Sarkarpara and 7 percent in Charbinpara. However, when we
restricted the analysis to those who did not handle meat or skin,
eating beef was not associated with illness. No person whose sole
exposure was eating beef became ill. Persons who slaughtered cattle
were not in the butchering profession; they did not wear gloves or
other protective equipment. Their helpers distributed the beef in the
village without any protection. Persons involved in skin trading
carried the skins to nearby villages to sell. Women in the villages
boiled the beef for 30 minutes before serving.

In Sarkarpara, healthcare workers knew the symptoms suggestive of
anthrax and that this disease needed to be reported. As a result,
this outbreak was reported early. In Charbinpara, healthcare workers
knew nothing about the disease and did not report it. As a result,
reporting was delayed until the 3rd cluster. Late reporting prevented
effective public health action. Because the source of infection in
the 2 villages differed (different cattle), we were unable to
formally establish a causal link between these 4 clusters.

The authors proposed the following recommendations: 1st, healthcare
workers in anthrax-endemic areas need to be educated about promptly
recognizing and reporting the disease; 2nd, persons in the community
must be educated about using personal protective equipment during
slaughtering of animals and handling of meat and skins.

Community education should focus on those at risk, including Muslim
communities who eat beef. Because anthrax occurs in only a few
districts, India does not have a nationally organized control program
(7). However, a focal prevention plan based on these recommendations
would ultimately help reduce illness and death in anthrax-endemic
districts.

Normally I do not post published reports, but this series of
outbreaks were not covered by ProMED-mail, and the authors did an
outstanding job reporting their findings, which very briefly were:
[1] No one developed anthrax eating these meats, and it was all
cutaneous; [2] it was all "shade tree" slaughter and butchering with
no precautions or care; [3] local awareness has an immediate payoff
in rapid reporting, and late reporting, if any at all, results in
ineffective medical and veterinary responses. This part of West
Bengal has had repeated outbreaks, e.g., 20080206.0485 and
20060618.1692, and clearly the authorities need to be more proactive.
My editing is light but the letter is worth reading in full.

West Bengal is tucked in on the immediate western border of Bangladesh.

Unfortunately, these 2 villages are too small to be shown even on
Google Earth. - Mod MHJ]
