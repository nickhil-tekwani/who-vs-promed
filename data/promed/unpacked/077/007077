More sick and dead birds were gathered from Laguna Niguel Regional Lake on Wednesday [25 Jul 2012] night for testing for possible avian botulism by a local volunteer.

Kristi Jolliffe says she went out again on the lake in a fishing boat around 5 p.m., her 3rd trip in 3 days, to collect the birds.

"During the past 3 days [Mon 23-Wed 25 Jul 2012], I have collected 55 dead birds and 14 live birds, of which 10 were taken to the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center (WWCC) in Huntington Beach. Three of the birds collected Tuesday [24 Jul 2012] died during the evening, and the 4th was picked up Wednesday evening. The Mallard is in bad condition. If it makes it through the evening it will be transported to WWCC."

She said the 10 birds that have been transported to WWCC are doing great and should make a full recovery.

Jolliffe said that on Sunday [22 Jul 2012] evening she received a call from the concession stand owners of Rip N' Lips who said they had a sick duck. She went to the lake to pick up the duck, and found a 2nd sick duck and one dead duck. She requested the county boat from the park ranger for Monday [23 Jul 2012] morning.

"Once I realized the magnitude of the problem, I started with rescuing rather than recovering. When the boat ran out of battery power, I took the 5 sick birds to my home to keep them cool, and started flushing their systems with fluids via tube feeding," she said. She then returned to the lake.

"Due to low battery power, I started recovering birds, and I collected 13 dead birds in different stages of decomposition. Because of the different decomposition stages, I concluded the outbreak had been occurring for some time," she said.

Staff members of Rip N' Lips confirmed the outbreak started in early July 2012, and they picked up around 60 dead birds that were visible to their patrons before contacting her, Jolliffe said.

"As of now, we are talking about 135 sick or dead birds with at least 20 sick birds still waiting to be rescued and an unknown number of dead birds needing to be picked up," she said.

On late Monday [23 Jul 2012] afternoon, Jolliffe had arranged for friends to transport 6 Mallard ducks and one American Coot from Laguna Niguel Regional Park and admitted them to the WWCC.

On Wednesday [25 Jul 2012] morning, the facility's director Debbie McGuire said: "So far, 30 deceased birds were taken to O.C. Animal Control, and 3 more live Mallards were taken to WWCC. I'm told there is a broken aerator pump at the park's lake. This means that there is low oxygen in the environment, and things die off. The water is also warm, and it can be the perfect set up for germination and more things to grow, like botulism."

Jolliffe confirmed there have been many more outbreaks: in 2007, 2008, 2009 and in 2011. She was the one who collected more than 250 of the live and dead birds at that time.

During the 2009 outbreak, several factors played a role, she said. 1st, herbicides were sprayed on reeds in an overflow area of the lake that needs to remain clear of vegetation for possible major flooding. 2nd, the aerator pumps were off for more than 6 weeks. Finally, the hot temperatures made for perfect conditions for a botulism outbreak, she said.

According to officials at Moulton Niguel Water District, water is not the culprit when it comes to a possible botulism outbreak.

"I can assure residents that recycled water that we provide throughout the area is properly maintained. It goes through rigorous testing, and the water we provide to Laguna meets all the state requirements. How that water is maintained is the responsibility of the facility's owner. If water does sit around and is not aerated, it can go stagnant and attract critters and other things that could eventually lead to algae and odors," said Moulton Niguel Water District General Manager Joone Lopez.

The dead birds are in the process of being tested, and results are pending, it could take several weeks for the results, said Mc Guire.

Jolliffe, a former director of human resources, has spent the past few years on call, volunteering her services rescuing and recovering birds and other wildlife for the county.

"I do this because I am not the type of person who can walk by an injured animal without doing something," she said.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Outbreaks of botulism in wild aquatic birds are a natural phenomenon in North America.
