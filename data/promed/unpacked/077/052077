The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 17 Sep 2018:
- A total of 142 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 111 confirmed and 31 probable.
- Of the 111 confirmed, 66 died and 38 are cured.
- 6 suspected cases are under investigation.
- No new confirmed cases notified.
- No new deaths

News of the response
Surveillance
------------
- The Angumu and Getthy [Geti] alerts in Ituri province were negative.

Support
-------
- On Tue 18 Sep 2018, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, Minister of Health, traveled to Makeke, Mandima health zone, Ituri province to inaugurate the new Ebola treatment center (ETC) built by International Medical Corps (IMC). This 4th ETC of 50 beds will allow to quickly treat any suspected or confirmed case notified in this health zone close to that of Mangina [North Kivu], the epicenter of the current epidemic. The decision to build the ETC in Makeke was made last August [2018] when the coordination found that the 50-bed ETC in Mangina was filling up rapidly and could no longer accommodate additional patients given the rapid increase in confirmed and suspected cases. Since then, the epidemiological curve has been reversed at the epicenter and only sporadic and imported cases are still notified to Mangina and Makeke.

[Note there are no new cases reported and the suspect cases in Ituri province were demonstrated to be negative in laboratory testing. The case number holds in the following MoH report also, promising news that the outbreak is winding down. However, it is important to keep in mind that a single case that goes undetected can lead to reinitiation of a larger outbreak.

The other piece of good news is that the 4th Ebola treatment center in Makeke in Mandima health zone is completed. This center contains 50 beds and will facilitate testing and treatment of patients. - Mod.LK]

News of the response
Coordination of the response to Butembo
---------------------------------------
- On Wed 19 Sep 2018, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, Minister of Health, and Dr Yokouide Allarangar, WHO Representative in DRC, traveled to Butembo with a joint delegation from the Ministry of Health, WHO, and UNICEF to see the evolution of the response in this important commercial city of North Kivu. They visited the new Ebola treatment center (ETC) built by Médecins Sans Frontières [MSF] in Butembo which will be able to welcome its 1st patients in the coming days. They also spoke at length with the city's religious authorities, including the Bishop of the Diocese of Butembo-Beni, Msgr. Melchisédech Sikuli Paluku, and the representatives of the Church of Christ in Congo, the revival churches and the independent churches. Then they met the members of the Federation of Enterprises of Congo (FEC) with whom they spoke about the preventive measures to be taken by these large traders.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 10 352 people have been vaccinated, including 3935 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 3350 in Beni [North Kivu], 1542 in Mandima [Ituri], 754 in Butembo [North Kivu], 314 in Katwa [North Kivu], 220 in Masereka [North Kivu], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], 51 in Komanda [Ituri], and 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).

[2] WHO/AFRO external situation report 07
Tue 18 Sep 2018. Democratic Republic of Congo: Ebola virus disease - External situation report 07
[WHO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, extracted, edited]
http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/274530/SITREP_EVD_DRC_20180918-eng.pdf

Data as reported by 16 Sep 2018 [figures and tables available at the URL above]

1. Situation update
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be closely monitored, with the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners making progress in response to the outbreak. Recent trends (Figure 1 [figures/tables at URL]) suggest that control measures are working, although these trends must be interpreted with caution. The outbreak remains ongoing in Beni, Mabalako [North Kivu], and Mandima [Ituri] health zones, and additional risks remain following the movement of several cases from these areas to Butembo and Masereka [North Kivu] in recent weeks.

Since our last situation report on 11 Sep 2018 (external situation report 06), an additional 10 new confirmed EVD cases and 6 deaths have been reported (Table 1). As of 16 Sep 2018, there are 7 suspected cases under investigation, with 5 new confirmed cases in Beni, 3 in Butembo and 2 in Mabalako, with 4 new deaths in confirmed cases in Beni and 2 in Mabalako (Table 1). 2 new cases in healthcare workers have been reported in the last week. Cumulatively, 19 health workers have been affected (18 confirmed and 1 probable), 3 of whom have died. All health workers' exposures occurred in health facilities outside the dedicated ETCs [Ebola treatment centers].

As of 16 Sep 2018, a total of 142 confirmed and probable EVD cases, including 97 deaths, have been reported. Among the 142 cases, 111 are confirmed and 31 are probable. Of the 97 deaths, 66 occurred in confirmed cases. Among the 135 cases with known age and sex, 56% (n=75) are female. Among females the most affected age group is 25-34 years, while among men the most affected age group is 35-44 years (Figure 2).

As of 16 Sep 2018, 38 cases have recovered and been discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs). A total of 16 cases (10 confirmed and 6 suspected) remain hospitalized in Mangina (2), Beni (8) and Butembo (6) [all in North Kivu]. On this reporting date, there were 9 new admissions to Ebola treatment centres in Beni (5), Butembo (3) and Mangina (1). 2 patients were discharged on the same day, one a previously suspected case and one a previously confirmed case who has now recovered.

The epicentres of the outbreak remain Mabalako and Beni health zones in North Kivu province, reporting 63% (n=89) and 20% (n=29) of all confirmed and probable cases, respectively. However, since late August 2018, most new cases have occurred in Beni or are related to a Beni transmission chain. Of the total deaths to date, 67% (n=65) are from Mabalako, while 24% (n=23) are from Beni (Table 1 and Figure 3). Additionally, 6 other health zones in North Kivu province and one in Ituri province have reported confirmed and probable cases (Table 1 and Figure 3).

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners are monitoring and investigating all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (including Kisangani and Tshopo provinces) and in neighbouring countries. As of 16 Sep 2018, 7 suspected cases are awaiting laboratory testing within outbreak affected areas (Table 1). Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in Uganda and South Sudan; and to date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

[3] Negative tests in Mukambo and Geti
19 Sep 2018. No Ebola virus in Mukambo and Geti after laboratory analysis
[Media Congo; in French, machine trans, edited]
https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-42446_ituri_pas_de_virus_ebola_a_mukambo_et_a_geti_apres_analyse_au_laboratoire.html

Samples taken from a woman who died last weekend [15-16 Sep 2018] in Mukambo in Mahagi territory [North Kivu] and a suspect case in Geti in Irumu territory [Ituri] and sent to the mobile laboratory in Beni, North Kivu for analysis, were negative.

The vice governor of Ituri province who delivers the news to Bunia News however invites the population not to give up and continue to observe the hygiene measures.

"Both suspected cases were negative after analysis at the laboratory of the National Institute for Biological Research, INRB. But it does not mean that we should cross our arms, we ask the people to keep the rules of hygiene and as soon as there is a suspect case, to go to the nearest medical facility," said Pacifique Keta Upar.

Ituri province in northeastern DRC is under threat from this deadly virus and part of its territory, Mambasa, neighboring Beni in North Kivu, epicenter of the disease, is already affected.

The movement of population between the 2 neighboring provinces is significant and the risk of contagion remains high despite some preventive measures taken by the authorities, including washing hands at the various entry points.
