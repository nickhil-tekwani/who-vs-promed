KLM in cholera scare
---------------------
Dutch airline KLM warned about 250 passengers and crew aboard a
flight from the Indian capital of New Delhi to Amsterdam on Monday
[23 May 2005] that a passenger aboard was infected with cholera.
Officials said the risk of contracting the disease was minimal, but
the airline advised those aboard the flight to visit their doctors.
KLM said a 6-year-old boy had been admitted to an Amsterdam hospital
with symptoms of the disease. Many of the passengers on the flight to
the Dutch capital boarded flights for other international
destinations.
The airline said it did not plan to introduce additional health
measures as a result of the incident.

Cholera downs 12 villagers
--------------------------
At least 12 persons were confirmed to have been afflicted with
cholera in 2 barangays in the boundary of Zamboanga City and
Zamboanga Sibugay province. City Health Officer Dr. Rodel Agbulos
today, 21 May 2005, said the cholera victims are confined at the
emergency lying-in hospital in Barangay Vitali.
Vitali, 88 km east of downtown, is 2 barangays away from the city's
boundary with Zamboanga Sibugay.
Agbulos said 7 of the patients are from Barangay Sinaburan, Tungawan,
Zamboanga Sibugay while the 5 are from Licomo, this city's last
barangay in the east coast. He said drinking contaminated water was
the cause of cholera. Residents of the affected barangays get their
drinking water from deep wells.
Agbulos sent health personnel to Licomo to prevent the further spread
of the disease by chlorinating the deep wells. He also asked
residents to boil the water before drinking.
Mayor Celso Lobregat said he has contacted Zamboanga Sibugay Gov.
George Hofer to send assistance to the 7 patients from Sinaburan,
Tungawan town. Hofer told the mayor he is sending boxes of dextrose
and medicines for the patients.

[3] Cholera - India (Delhi)

Cholera cases trouble national capital
--------------------------------------
Of the 148 cholera cases reported in 2005, 76 have been reported in May
2005. Experts say this is due to the supply of contaminated water.
"The quality of water in Delhi is the cause of many waterborne
diseases, including cholera," says Atanu Sarkar, a doctor with the
Center for Science and Environment. "The pipelines are not well
maintained, which increases the risk of leaking sewage getting
mixed with the water supply."
"Since there is a scarcity of water, people in unauthorized colonies
and slums drink unclean water, leading to many waterborne diseases,
especially cholera and typhoid," Sarkar said. "While the Delhi Jal Board and
Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) should provide clean water, their water
treatment process is questionable," Sarkar told IANS.
"In May 2004, there were 126 cases of cholera, in comparison to 76 in the
last 15 days of May 2005," said N.K. Yadav, municipal health officer,
MCD. "It's sure that cholera spreads due to contamination of water, but most
of the water samples tested in May 2005 were found free from contamination,"
Yadav said.
Health authorities said the shortage of chlorine used to treat water
had led to contamination. In the 59 water samples found contaminated
by the MCD, there was a shortage of chlorine. "We have been distributing
chlorine tablets to all the slums and other congested areas," Yadav said.

Pulau Gaya hit by cholera
-------------------------
A cholera outbreak has hit Pulau Gaya, [a small island] just off Kota
Kinabalu [capital of Sabah state on the island of Borneo. - Mod.JW], with 17
islanders warded at the Queen Elizabeth hospital.
Tanjung Aru state assemblyman Edward Yong Oui Fah, whose constituency
encompasses Pulau Gaya, said the 17 patients included men, women and
children. They were admitted to the hospital on 21 May 2005. He said
all those affected were responding well to treatment.
The cholera outbreak at Pulau Gaya comes just 3 weeks after a similar
outbreak in the east coast district of Semporna, where 118 students
from 2 schools were affected.

Gastro downs 145 in Baybay
-----------------------------
Acute gastroenteritis downed at least 145 residents of Baybay town in
Leyte as of Fri 20 May 2005, 4 days since the outbreak started.
Baybay Mayor Jose Carlos Cari said most of the victims were children,
7 years old and under, and only 13 were aged at least 30 years old.
As of the morning of 20 May 2005, he said 65 were confined at the
Western Leyte District Hospital, while 30 others were in various
private hospitals of the town. 50 were treated as outpatients. Cari
said the cause of the outbreak was immediately traced to contaminated
water from one of the wells of the town's water district, located in
the Poblacion, the reason most of the victims were Poblacion
residents.
Cari said sanitary inspectors, who were dispatched to conduct tests
on water, found the presence of _E. coli_ bacteria in the water
supply from this well, but they have yet to determine whether the
contaminant was from human or animal feces.
It was also found that the water district failed to put chlorine in
the well's water system for a few days before 16 May 2005.
