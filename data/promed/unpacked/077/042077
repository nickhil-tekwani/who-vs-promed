Mystery plague kills French oysters
-----------------------------------
Oysters have been mysteriously dying in the worst crisis to hit
France's shellfish industry in 40 years. In the last few days farmers
have lost between 40 and 100 percent of their oysters aged one to 2 years old.

Such a death toll has not been seen in France since 1970, when
virtually an entire harvest was wiped out. Experts are unsure if the
shellfish are succumbing to a viral epidemic or to poor water
conditions caused by global warming.

Mortality rates are always higher in summer but not on this scale,
and never simultaneously throughout France, experts said. At L'Etang
de Thau, a saltwater lake near the south-western city of Montpellier,
about 80 percent of young specimens have died.

"A major part of our 2009 production has been wiped out," one of the
lake's oyster farmers said, adding that the industry's future "is on the line."

Oysters have become more fragile since water temperatures began
rising in 1995 because of climate change. But researchers are puzzled
by the scale of the plague, as sea temperatures are not dangerously
high and tests have revealed no known diseases.

The crisis will have no impact on current oyster consumption, as the
ready-to-eat, mature specimens have not been affected.

<http://oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00035.htm>.

The section includes the following Chapters:
Chapter I.2. General information
Chapter 2.2.1. Infection with Bonamia ostreae
Chapter 2.2.2. Infection with Bonamia exitiosa
Chapter 2.2.3. Infection with Haplosporidium nelsoni
Chapter 2.2.4. Infection with Marteilia refringens
Chapter 2.2.5. Infection with Mikrocytos mackini
Chapter 2.2.6. Infection with Perkinsus marinus
Chapter 2.2.7. Infection with Perkinsus olseni
Chapter 2.2.8. Infection with Xenohaliotis californiensis
Chapter 2.2.9. Abalone viral mortality.

Information on the tests carried out -- reportedly, "revealing no
known diseases" -- and details on the changes seen in the affected
oysters and on the species affected, will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
