Komnova T.D., Sadovskaya T.I., Melekhina Z.S., Fetisova N.F., Komarova
A.I., Tarasevitch I.V. "Carrying out" of the endemic infection from a
nidus into nonendemic region.
Authors report the case of tourist transmission ("carrying out") of
Astrakhan spotted fever (ASF) into Ramenskoye region, Moscow province
(oblast) in 1998. ASF original (natural) focus is situated in the Bakhtemir
river delta of Astrakhan province. In the focus the ASF morbidity rate
increased by 33.3 times (per 100 000 population) since the first report in
1983.
Hedgehogs, hares and small rodents are carriers of rickettsiae, causing ASF,
and ticks (_Rhipicephalus pumilio_) are ASF vectors to humans. A clinical
picture is reported in 5 patients -- 3 boys of 9-10 years, a 16-year girl
and a man of 47. One boy (10 years) died. A diagnosis is confirmed
clinically and serologically by indirect immunofluorescence assay.
The ASF incubation period is 7 days on average. The disease outset is
acute, temperature in patients increased to 38.5-39.7 C. Symptoms:
sickness, headache, pain in hands, back, soles of feet, muscles, especially
in calves (so-called "monkey walk"). At the peak of the disease a
non-itching maculo-roseolic rash appeared lasting 6-17 days.
