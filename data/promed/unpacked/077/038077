I agree with David but I am concerned that his statement
"On a similar note, it is not reasonable to expect animals processed with
the skin on (poultry) to be free of fecal organisms"
implies that skin off animals (been all meats other than poultry, pigs and
goats for Taiwan) could be 100% free of contamination. This is not the
case. To expect this would be the same as assuming a 100% success rate for
surgical procedures with the added commercial realities of production line
speeds. The risks will remain high (relatively) without 100% disease free
animals or a significant change to the supply-demand food chain our society
demands. End product decontamination (cooking, pasteurising or
irradiation) will be the only way to assure the safety of the masses.

I think David Halvorson's statement has been over-interpreted, but readers
may use their own judgement. This thread is cut failing receipt of
significant new information. - Mod.ES
