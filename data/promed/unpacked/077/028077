447 cases of measles in [Western Cape Province]
-----------------------------------------------
The number of measles cases in Western Cape Province has increased
dramatically, and now stands at 447. According to the National
Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD), there were at least 82
newly confirmed laboratory cases in the province by Tuesday [9 Feb
2010], bringing the number of cases to 447.

Gauteng [province] still has the highest burden, with 4359 cases,
followed by KwaZulu-Natal [province] with 631, North West [province]
with 563, and then the Western Cape [with 447].

In the past week, the Eastern Cape saw the highest number of newly
confirmed cases. The 92 new cases there bring their total number of
cases to 314. KwaZulu-Natal had 67 new cases and Gauteng 84, the
institute said. The Northern Cape recorded 75 new cases.

In the Eastern Cape, 3 people have died of a fatal pneumonic measles
strain since January [2010], the latest victim being a pregnant woman
who died last Wednesday [10 Feb 2010].

Last week [week ending 7 Feb 2010] the Western Cape came under fire
from the national health department and civil society groups for
withholding information about the measles outbreak in the province.
The national department said provincial health authorities had failed
in their mandate to inform other health role-players and communities
in the Western Cape about the outbreak. But the provincial
authorities hit back, saying they had kept [silent] because they did
not want to cause "unnecessary panic".

Health MEC [member of the executive council] Theuns Botha said his
administration was handling the measles issue as an "outbreak", not
an "epidemic". He said a measles and polio [vaccination] drive, which
would include radio health talks, advertorials, posters, and
pamphlets, would be fast-tracked, but could not give a timeline for this.

Health department spokeswoman Faiza Steyn said there had been an
increase in suspected measles cases in Bloekombos, and Kraaifontein
[Cape Town, Western Cape province]. She did not quantify the
increase. There had been no deaths linked to the measles outbreak, she said.
