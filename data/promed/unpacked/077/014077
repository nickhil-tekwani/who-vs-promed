[With the continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new
var.) in ProMED-mail) in the human population, it has been decided to
broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED mail reports to include
other prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases from any part of the
world are now included in these updates where appropriate, and other
forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and
GSS/Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since
they may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD cases remains
166. A total of 4 definite/probable patients are still alive, so that
the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases remains 170.

Although 2 new cases vCJD have been recorded this year [2009], the
overall picture is still consistent with the view that the vCJD
outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths
was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in
2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one in 2008, and so
far 2 in 2009.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in 2009
---------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 7 De 2009 in the UK so far this year [2009], there have
been 135 referrals, 55 cases of sporadic CJD, one case of familial
CJD, one case of iatrogenic CJD, 3 cases of GSS, and 2 cases of vCJD.

iatrogenic CJD, and 2 confirmed cases of vCJD.

A total of 25 cases of confirmed or probable vCJD has now been
recorded in France since 1997. The 25 confirmed cases comprise 13
females and 12 males. All 25 are now deceased. Their median age is 37
(between 19 and 58). 7 were resident in the Ile-de-France and 18 in
the provinces. All the identified cases have been Met-Met
homozygotes. No risk factor has been identified. One of the 25 had
made frequent visits to the United Kingdom.

During the period 1 Jan 2009 to 7 Nov 2009 there were 341 referrals,
of which 198 were classified as prion disease, comprising 133 cases
of sporadic CJD, 33 of familial CJD, and no cases of iatrogenic CJD
or vCJD. (N.B. The prion disease category includes cases where the
type determination is pending, but where vCJD has been excluded).

[Although the population of the United States is approximately 2.5
times the combined population of France and the UK, the total number
of cases of sporadic CJD in the USA at 133 matches the combined total
in France and the UK of 132. In contrast the number of cases of
familial CJD in the USA at 33, compared with the combined total of 11
for France and the UK, more closely corresponds to the difference in

Surveillance in the UK [edited]

Summary
-------
The national surveillance programme for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) in the UK was initiated in May 1990. In 1999, the National CJD
Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) became a WHO Collaborative Centre for
Reference and Research on the surveillance and epidemiology of human
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). In September 2001
the National Care Team was formed, which currently comprises 2 care
coordinators and a secretary. It is based within the NCJDSU and was
formed in response to concerns regarding the care of CJD patients.

The information provided in this Seventeenth Annual Report continues
to indicate that the number of sporadic cases remains relatively
stable (the data for 2008 may still be incomplete). Detailed clinical
and epidemiological information has been obtained for the great
majority of patients. Referrals, having been fewer between 2004 and
2007, increased in 2008, back towards pre-2004 levels. 2008 has seen
the highest mortality rate from sporadic CJD in the UK (1.43 per
million per year) since 1985; a rate which is comparable with other
European countries. Although the post mortem rate for patients with
suspected CJD has declined, in line with general autopsy rates in the
UK, it remains high (around 60 percent). The number of brain
specimens examined for sporadic CJD in the neuropathology laboratory
rose from 23 in 2007 to 28 in 2008 (32 in 2006). In 1990-2008 average
annual mortality rates from sporadic CJD in England, Wales, Scotland,
and Northern Ireland were, respectively, 0.94, 1.08, 0.96, and
0.58/million/year. The differences between these rates are not
statistically significant (p=0.4). The mortality rates from sporadic
CJD in the UK are comparable to those observed in most other European
countries and elsewhere in the world, including countries that are
free of BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy]. The highest and
lowest mortality rates from sporadic CJD were observed in the South
West (SMR [standardised mortality rate] =122) and Northern Ireland
(SMR=74) respectively. The variation in the observed mortality rates
between the different regions within the UK is not statistically
significant (p greater than 0.1).

Up to 31 Dec 2008, there were 164 deaths from definite or probable
variant CJD (vCJD) in the UK. Of these, 115 were confirmed by
neuropathology. A further 3 probable cases were alive on 31st Dec
2008. The clinical, neuropathological, and epidemiological features
of the cases of vCJD are remarkably uniform and consistent with
previous descriptions. Risk factors for the development of vCJD
include age, residence in the UK and methionine homozygosity at codon
129 of the prion protein gene -- all 147 clinically affected cases of
vCJD with available genetic analysis have been methionine homozygotes.

In 2008 the NCJDSU was referred the 1st case who met the clinical
criteria in life for possible vCJD and was heterozygous
(methionine/valine) at codon 129 of the PRNP gene (no post-mortem was
undertaken). The clinical picture was typical of vCJD seen to date,
which is reassuring for surveillance purposes. Although a single case
with only a 'possible' classification, this may have implications for
the presentation of further clinical cases in codon 129 heterozygotes
in the future and for the estimation of prevalence of sub-clinical
infection in the population.

Analysis of vCJD diagnoses and deaths from January 1994 to December
2008 indicates that a peak has passed. While this is an encouraging
finding, the incidence of vCJD may increase again, particularly if
different genetic subgroups with longer incubation periods exist. The
identification of an individual of the PRNP-129 MV genotype as a
possible case of vCJD and, in a separate case, disease-related prion
protein in the spleen of a clinically unaffected blood recipient
(reported in 2004) is consistent with such a hypothesis [see
footnote]. These cases, along with the report of the prevalence of
abnormal prion protein in the large study of appendix and tonsil
tissues, suggests the possibility of a greater number of preclinical
or subclinical cases in the population than might be indicated by the
present numbers of confirmed clinical cases.

The incidence of vCJD is higher in the north of Britain than in the
south and the only statistically significant geographic cluster of
vCJD cases in the UK remains that seen in Leicestershire (5 cases
occurring between 1996 and 1999).

The NCJDSU continues to collaborate with the Health Protection Agency
Centre for Infections and Health Protection Scotland, in relation to
a range of activities, including testing of pathological specimens
from the National Anonymous Tonsil Archive study through to input
into the development and implementation of public health policy, for
example, in relation to the follow up of those identified as at
increased risk of CJD. This year [2009], the neuropathology
laboratory identified a UK adult haemophiliac patient with PrPres in
a restricted distribution in the spleen. This patient had been
entered into a joint study with the UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors'
Organisation and NCJDSU. The patient had no neurological signs or
symptoms, and no neuropathological evidence of vCJD. This case raises
the possibility of transmission of vCJD infectivity via plasma
products, and is the subject of ongoing investigations.

A case of protease-sensitive prionopathy was identified on
neuropathological and biochemical grounds, the 1st case of this
disorder identified in the UK since its description by Gambetti et al
in the USA in 2008.

The activities of the NCJDSU are strengthened by collaboration with
other surveillance projects, including the Transfusion Medicine
Epidemiology Review and the study of Progressive Intellectual and
Neurological Deterioration in Children. The collaboration of our
colleagues in these projects is greatly appreciated; the
effectiveness of this collaboration allowed the identification in
2003 of a case of vCJD associated with blood transfusion and the
identification in 2004 of disease-related PrP in the spleen of a
recipient of blood donated by someone incubating vCJD. In 2008, for
the 1st time, the Unit prepared a Scientific Report, which is
available on the Unit's website (<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk>). The aim
of the Scientific Report is to inform interested parties of details
of the current and planned scientific research being undertaken by
staff at the NCJDSU, in the context of the Unit's previous research
and its on-going core background surveillance. The Scientific Report
complements the Annual Report, which provides a description of the
clinicopathological epidemiology of CJD in the previous 12 months,
reflecting the Unit's core surveillance work. The NCJDSU Business
Plan provides financial, structural, and organisational information.
The success of the National CJD Surveillance Unit continues to depend
on the extraordinary level of co-operation from the neurology and
neuropathology communities and other medical and paramedical staff
throughout the UK. Ongoing support is provided by the Infectious
Disease Epidemiology Unit, London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine. We are also particularly grateful to the relatives of
patients for their collaboration.

[Footnote: In 2008 the NCJDSU was referred for the 1st time an
individual who met the clinical criteria in life for possible vCJD
and who was heterozygous (methionine/valine) at codon 129 of the PRNP
gene. This individual died in 2009 after a disease of 22 months
duration. Consent for a post-mortem was not given. The clinical
picture was typical of vCJD seen to date, which is reassuring for
surveillance purposes since the clinicopathological phenotype of vCJD
in this genotype is unknown. To put this possible vCJD case in
perspective, it is useful to examine the final diagnostic outcome of
the 116 suspect vCJD cases that were classified as possible vCJD at
some point during their diagnostic pathway (that is, they met the
criteria for possible vCJD at some point between referral to NCJDSU
and death or other final diagnostic outcome). Of the 116 possible
vCJD cases, 94 (81 percent) had a final classification of definite or
probable vCJD, 10 (9 percent) had a final diagnosis of definite sCJD
[sporadic CJD], 5 (4 percent) had alternative diagnoses to CJD
(Alzheimer's disease, Wilson's disease, viral encephalitis, syphilis,
SSPE [subacute sclerosing panencephalitis]), one was diagnosed with
genetic CJD, one improved clinically and for one individual the
diagnosis remains unclear, but clinically was suggestive of vCJD. 4
cases (3 percent) have resulted in a final classification of possible
vCJD, 3 were methionine homozygotes at codon 129 and the recent case
heterozygous (methionine/valine) at PRNP codon 129. On the basis of
our knowledge of the natural history of other human prion diseases,
clinical cases of vCJD in PRNP codon 129 genotypes other than
methionine homozygotes could be anticipated.]

[The most significant development has been the identification in 2008
of an individual who met the clinical criteria in life for possible
vCJD who was heterozygous (methionine/valine) at codon 129 of the
PRNP gene, unlike the 147 clinically confirmed cases of vCJD with
available genetic analysis data who have been methionine homozygotes.
This case may or may not herald the onset of a category of vCJD cases
with prolonged incubation periods. Uncertainty remains because an
autopsy could not be carried out and the patient's condition remains
classified as probable vCJD. - Mod.CP]

[5] Australian CJD cluster

Analysis of a potential Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cluster
---------------------------------------------------------
During 2008, the ANCJDR [Australian National Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease Registry] published findings from an investigation conducted
assessing an increased number of sporadic CJD cases within a coastal
region of New South Wales during the period 1993-2006. Statistical
analysis identified a spatially significant cluster in 3 contiguous
statistical local areas, consisting of 13 definite and 1 probable CJD
case. An epidemiological review of ANCJDR case data for the 14 cases
did not reveal a plausible cross-over or point source transmission
event to explain the cluster of cases.

One potential hypothesis for the significant finding related to the
region's clinicians and their management of potential CJD cases. To
investigate this theory, further evaluation was undertaken comparing
the regional area with the entire state, emphasising rates of
referrals for 14-3-3 CSF testing, rates of case notification to the
ANCJDR and suspect CJD post-mortem rates. These observations were
chosen to objectively quantify an intensity of surveillance and how
this relates to incidence rates. Our analyses demonstrated that the
cluster area maintained a higher level of surveillance and clinical
awareness compared with the entire State of New South Wales. The
population-based rate of notification of all suspect cases to the
ANCJDR was 68 percent greater in the cluster area than for New South
Wales (age-adjusted RRMH [Mantel Haenszel relative risk]: 1.68, 95
percent CI [confidence interval] =1.36-2.10) and similarly, the
population-based rate of request for CSF testing was 59 percent
greater than the state referral rate (age-adjusted RRMH: 1.59, 95
percent CI=1.25-2.02). No difference between the likelihood of a
suspect case being confirmed as probable or definite CJD (all types
or sporadic only) was observed, suggesting that once CJD was
questioned as a diagnosis in a clinical setting, the likelihood of a
case being assessed for CJD classification was no different in the
circumscribed area to the entire state. In contrast, a difference did
exist in the proportion of cases that were assessed by
neuropathological examination (biopsy or autopsy), with the cluster
area having an almost 2.5 times greater neuropathological examination
rate in suspect cases compared with New South Wales (age-adjusted
RRMH, 2.34, 95 percent CI=1.56-3.51). Simply stated, approximately
double the intensity of surveillance translated to a doubling of the
CJD incidence rate.

One of the distinguishing features of the 14 cluster cases provided
another key piece of supporting evidence for enhanced surveillance.
The cohort displayed a significantly older age at death when compared
with sporadic CJD cases from New South Wales and Australia overall.
Analysis of autopsy data in Austria, where autopsy of all suspect CJD
cases is mandatory, suggests global under-ascertainment of older age
CJD cases. Hence, the ability to detect older and less typical cases
in this cluster region suggests clinicians manifested a greater than
usual suspicion of CJD and atypical presentations. These findings
have provided us with a hypothesis that intensity of surveillance for
rare disorders can be quantified and this can positively correlate
with higher incidence. It further suggests that the true incidence of
CJD in Australia may be almost twice the currently observed average
rate of 1.18 cases per million per year. A further exploration of
this hypothesis is needed within and between individual nations and
may give us an improved understanding of methodologies for optimal
surveillance for rare conditions such as CJD.

[This analysis of an apparent cluster of CJD cases in a coastal
region of the state of New South Wales in Australia attributes the
higher incidence of cases in this region to an increased intensity of
surveillance for rare disorders. By extension this suggests that the
true incidence of CJD in Australia may be almost twice the currently
observed average rate of 1.18 cases per million per year. - Mod.CP]

[6] Kuru genetic resistance

Gene protects brain-eaters from mad cow-type disease
----------------------------------------------------
Villagers in the highlands of Papua New Guinea who ritualistically
ate human brains but did not die of a brain disease called kuru have
a genetic mutation that protects them, researchers said on Wednesday
[18 Nov 2009]. Their study of the unusual cannibalistic practice
shows evolution in real time in the human population, and might lead
to a treatment for similar brain-wasting conditions, the researchers
reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. Kuru once wiped out
entire generations of women in remote Papuan villages. It was traced
to a now-defunct mortuary ceremony in which women and children ate
the brains of their dead relatives. Dr Simon Mead of the University
College London Institute and colleagues found that women in these
communities were more likely to live to an old age if they had the
protective gene. Women without the gene died young of kuru.

Kuru is caused by prions, the unusually folded brain proteins that
also cause mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD, chronic wasting disease in deer
and elk, and scrapie in sheep. All are fatal and incurable, creating
spongy holes in the brain. They can be transmitted by eating
contaminated body parts. BSE devastated British dairy herds in the
1980s and was traced to feeding sheep remains to cattle. Some people
developed a rare form of CJD from eating infected beef, and 166
people in Britain and 25 in France have died of it.

Mead's team studied more than 3000 Papuans, including 709 who
participated in cannibalistic mortuary feasts. They included 152 who
died of kuru. They looked at the genes for prions, ordinary brain
proteins that take on a misfolded shape in prion disease such as CJD
and kuru. They found a mutation called G127V that protected people
from kuru. Only people who ate brains and survived have it, they
found. "It is not found in patients with kuru and in unexposed
population groups worldwide," they wrote.

They have looked at people who had CJD and who did not have it, and
have been unable to find the mutation, Mead said. The gene itself is
seen in many animals and almost never mutates. "All the way back to
frog there is the same amino acid in exactly this position in the
prion protein gene. That tells us it is doing something very
fundamental," Mead said. So the mutation must have evolved because of
the selective pressure caused by eating brains, he said.

"It is remarkable how few definite examples there are that we can
really link with a clear history of a disease or an event. It was
such a devastating disease and well-documented ... and we can now see
the effects of this genetically," Mead said. In prion diseases, the
misfolded prion attaches to healthy prions, which for unknown reasons
take on the misfolded shape. The mutation seems to block this
attachment, Mead said, and its discovery points researchers to the
precise site. That could lead to treatments for CJD, which occurs
randomly in about one in a million people, Mead said.

that Colocalizes with Kuru Exposure. N Engl J Med. 2009 Nov 19;
361(21): 2056-65 (<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/361/21/2056>).

The authors performed genetic and selected clinical and genealogic
assessments of more than 3000 persons from Eastern Highland
populations, including 709 who participated in cannibalistic mortuary
feasts, 152 of whom subsequently died of kuru. Persons who were
exposed to kuru and survived the epidemic in Papua New Guinea are
predominantly heterozygotes at the known resistance factor at codon
129 of the prion protein gene (PRNP). The authors report a novel PRNP
variant -- G127V -- that was found exclusively in people who lived in
the region in which kuru was prevalent and that was present in half
of the otherwise susceptible women from the region of highest
exposure who were homozygous for methionine at PRNP codon 129.
Although this allele is common in the area with the highest incidence
of kuru, it is not found in patients with kuru and in unexposed
population groups worldwide. Genealogic analysis reveals a
significantly lower incidence of kuru in pedigrees that harbor the
protective allele than in geographically matched control families.
The authors conclude that the 127V polymorphism is an acquired prion
disease resistance factor selected during the kuru epidemic, rather
than a pathogenic mutation that could have triggered the kuru
epidemic. Variants at codons 127 and 129 of PRNP demonstrate the
population genetic response to an epidemic of prion disease and
represent a powerful episode of recent selection in humans. - Mod.CP]

Design and construction of diverse mammalian prion strains
----------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: David W. Colby and 6 others. Institute for
Neurodegenerative Diseases Departments of Neurology and Pathology,
University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143]

Prions are infectious proteins that encipher biological information
within their conformations; variations in these conformations dictate
different prion strains. Toward elucidating the molecular language of
prion protein (PrP) conformations, the authors have produced an array
of recombinant PrP amyloids with varying conformational stabilities.

In mice, the most stable amyloids produced the most stable prion
strains that exhibited the longest incubation times, whereas more
labile amyloids generated less stable strains and shorter incubation
times. The direct relationship between stability and incubation time
of prion strains suggests that labile prions are more fit, in that
they accumulate more rapidly and thus kill the host faster.

Although incubation times can be changed by altering the PrP
expression level, PrP sequence, prion dose, or route of inoculation,
the authors report the ability to modify the incubation time
predictably in mice by modulating the prion conformation.
