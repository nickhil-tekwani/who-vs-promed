Today [17 Apr 2019], a suspected case of hog cholera [classical swine fever, CSF] has been confirmed at a pig farm in Ena city, Gifu prefecture.

All required preventive measures against this disease have been applied. The farm stopped all movements of the breeding pigs since the disease was suspected. We expect the public's cooperation in strictly refraining from visits to the location to avoid the spread of this disease.

1. Outline of outbreak farm
Location: Gifu prefecture, Ena city.
Number of animals: 9628

2. History
- Gifu prefecture received a report from the farm on Tue 16 Apr 2019 informing that the breeding pigs presented an abnormality; prefecture livestock epidemiologists conducted an on-site inspection.
- The initial examination, on the same day, at the livestock health and hygiene center revealed suspected CSF; this has been finally confirmed today [17 Apr 2019].

3. Future response
All measures prescribed by the regulations ("specific livestock epidemic disease prevention policy on hog cholera") are to be immediately implemented, including:
- killing and burning of pigs and setting of movement restricted area;
- surveillance within the movement restricted area;
- disinfection around the outbreak farm and at disinfection points on major roads;
- investigation of the route of introduction;
- notification of detection of the event;
- provision of accurate information to producers, consumers, distributors, etc., as well as working closely with relevant government agencies;
- provision of guidance on compliance with the management standards for sanitation, such as disinfection of farms and prevention of contact with wildlife [wild boars].

[The CSF event in Japan, involving wild boars and domestic pig farms, started 3 Sep 2018. It is characterised by wide dissemination of the virus in wild boar within Aichi and Gifu prefectures, with spillovers to domestic pig farms. One outbreak, on a pig farm, was reported on 5 Feb 2019 from the neighboring prefecture Nagano (Lida city; see 20190206.6303481).

As of 12 Apr 2019 (date of the most recent OIE follow-up report, no 24), a total of 268 outbreaks had been reported, of which 19 on domestic pig farms and 249 in wild boar, with the following OIE epidemiological statistics:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Domestic pigs / 75 554 / 235 / 34 / 75 520 / 0
Wild boar / not available/ 271 / 100 / 171 / 0

The governments of both Gifu and Aichi prefectures have recently launched their respective oral vaccination projects, aiming to control the disease in wild boar. - Mod.AS
