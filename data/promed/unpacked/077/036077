According to the February 22, 1998 Internet edition of the Bolivian daily
El Deber, from Santa Cruz de La Sierra, at least 24 cases of cholera with 1
death were notified in El Alto and La Paz (the capital).
The outbreak seems to be centered in El Alto, Bolivia's 4th most populous
city, and the poorest.
It's 5 years since an outbreak of cholera left more than a hundred dead in
Bolivia. Both cities are in the Andean region, were the impact of El Nino
seems to be more intense.
There is a considerable amount of worry that the outbreak could reach the
Brazilian border, where it is raining intensely.
