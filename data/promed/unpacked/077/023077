Zoo falls silent after FMD outbreak
-----------------------------------
The sprawling campus of the Thiruvananthapuram
zoo has fallen silent since Sunday [8 Jul 2007].
The strong smell of disinfectants that wafts
across the zoo's boundary walls is an indication
that all is not well at the 56-acre facility set
up by the rulers of erstwhile Travancore in 1857.

After losing its entire stock of mithun and 8
blackbuck to the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
over the week, the zoo �- for the 1st time in its
history �- has shut its doors to visitors. On
Sunday night, the zoo lost 3 more blackbucks.

The 1st indication that something was seriously
wrong at the zoo came on 3 Jul 2007 when a mithun
�- an ox-like animal endemic to the north-eastern
parts of India [picture at
<http://arunachalipr.gov.in/images/MITHUN.JPG>]
�- started foaming at the mouth and dropped dead
a few hours later. The very next day, the zoo
lost another mithun. On 5 Jul 2007, with 2 more
mithun dead, the Kerala Government approved the
culling of 3 of these animals in a desperate
attempt to contain what was obviously a
contagious disease among the animals. Meanwhile,
the zoo also lost a couple of blackbuck
[<http://www.junglewalk.com/animal-pictures/621/Blackbuck-4026.jpg>].

On Friday [6 Jul 2007] evening, it was confirmed
that the deaths were caused by the FMD virus (strain 'O').

This also triggered a sanitation drive,
unprecedented in scale, at the zoo. There was a
real danger that the disease would spread to
other animals such as the giraffe, hippo,
elephant and the rhino. Animal keepers started
sprinkling kilograms of lime powder and sodium
carbonate around the open enclosure that housed
the mithun and also around the enclosures of
other animals susceptible to FMD. Even though the
zoo lost 3 more blackbuck on 9 Jul 2007, zoo
officials said the virus was on the wane. The
Thiruvananthapuram zoo, classified as a 'large
zoo' by the Central Zoo Authority, houses 72
species of birds and animals. Close to 10 lakh
[one million] people visit it annually.

[The same newswire was kindly sent by Chris Griot; our sincere thanks.

What is intriguing in this FMD outbreak is not
the introduction of FMDV-O, which is endemic in
India, into the zoo -- but its exceptional
virulence in the 2 species: the Mithun [_Bos
gaurus_], a large ox of south and south-east
Asia, and the blackbuck [_Antilope cervicapra_],
a small antelope found in semi-desert plains and
open forest throughout India. Severe cases in
blackbucks have been seen in the past (Ref 1);
information on past history of FMD in _Bos gaurus_ will be welcomed.

FMD has been reported, throughout the years, in
several members of the subfamily _antilopinae_;
for a review on FMD in wildlife, see ref 2.

FMD in the Syrian mountain gazelle, _Gazella
gazellae_, caused in Israel, 1985, more than 50
percent mortality (more than 1500 dead adult
animals) The pathogen was FMDV serotype O. Death
was presumed to be due to a combination of heart
failure (due to viral myocarditis), pneumonia and
dehydration (Ref 3, with pictures). The disease
was reproduced experimentally, with similarly
severe clinical symptoms and pathological
changes. The pathological changes included
pancreatitis, raising the possibility of
post-infection diabetes mellitus (ref 4).

FMD serotype O has been seen again in Israeli
gazelles earlier this year (2007) (see
ProMED-mail posting archived 20070324.1025).
