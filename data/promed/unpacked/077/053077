Washington now has 62 norovirus cases linked to oysters - outbreak now at 467
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to KIRO News [https://bit.ly/3xqvtTh], the Washington Department of Health is advising residents to not serve or eat certain oysters after an outbreak of norovirus across the Seattle area.

Since [7 Mar 2022], 62 residents have reported norovirus-like symptoms after eating oysters harvested from the south and central parts of Baynes Sound, British Columbia, Canada. A list of locations, date of occurrence and the number of people affected in Washington can be found at the source URL.

Canada reported as of 8 Apr 2022, there have been 328 cases of norovirus and gastrointestinal illness linked to consumption of British Columbia oysters reported in the following provinces: British Columbia (293), Alberta (3), Saskatchewan (1), Manitoba (15) and Ontario (16). Individuals became sick between mid-January 2022 and early April 2022, and no deaths have been reported. Although not all cases of illness have been tested, testing of several cases has confirmed the presence of a norovirus infection.

The USA CDC reported as of 6 Apr 2022, at least 103 norovirus illnesses have been reported from 13 states: CDC is working with state and local partners to determine a more accurate number of illnesses in this outbreak and will update this number as more information is gathered. FDA advises restaurants and retailers not to serve or sell potentially contaminated raw oysters from Canada.

States impacted (thus far): California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington. Thus far California reports 34, Hawaii reports 4, Minnesota reports 29 and Washington reports 62.

California: The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) warned consumers on 2 Apr 2022, not to eat raw oysters from British Columbia, Canada because they may be linked to an outbreak of norovirus illnesses in California. In California, at least 34 persons have become ill following the consumption of oysters at 9 restaurants located throughout the state. Illness has been reported from 11 through 19 Mar 2022.

Minnesota: On 1 Apr 2022, the Minnesota Department of Health, Hennepin County Public Health, and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture are working with federal officials and public health agencies in other states and Canada to investigate norovirus illnesses associated with oysters. 29 Minnesotans have been sickened in this outbreak. They became ill with confirmed or suspected norovirus gastroenteritis after eating raw oysters at Travail Kitchen in Robbinsdale on [20 Mar 2022].

Hawaii: Hawaiian Health officials are warning the public of a norovirus outbreak linked to raw oysters from Canada that were distributed to restaurants and retailers in various USA states, including Hawaii, where several cases have been confirmed. The Hawaii Department of Health said there have been 4 suspect cases of norovirus associated with raw oysters reported in the state. 3 of the 4 suspect cases consumed raw oysters in Hawaii County, and one consumed raw oysters in Honolulu County, between [8 and 22 Mar 2022].

Washington: The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) has updated its advisory to Washington residents to not serve or eat certain oysters harvested from the south and central parts of Baynes Sound, British Columbia, Canada until further notice. The advisory is in alignment with the recent release from the FDA on a multi-state outbreak of norovirus illness linked to raw oysters.

Some oyster harvest areas in British Columbia that have been associated with illnesses in this outbreak have been closed as a part of the investigation. The CFIA has issued several food recalls throughout February, March, and April [2022].

[The following are myths about oysters (adapted from https://www.fda.gov/food/health-educators/raw-oyster-myths).

Myth: Eating raw oysters is safe if you drown them in hot sauce, which kills everything.
Fact: The active ingredients in hot sauce have no more effect on harmful bacteria than plain water. Nothing but prolonged exposure to heat at a high enough temperature will kill bacteria.

Myth: Avoid oysters from polluted waters and you'll be fine.
Fact: Many pathogens in oysters have nothing to do with pollution. Some harmful bacteria thrive naturally in warm coastal areas (such as the Gulf of Mexico) where oysters live.

Myth: An experienced oyster lover can tell a good oyster from a bad one.
Fact: These pathogens can't be seen, smelled, or even tasted. Don't rely on your senses to decide if an oyster is safe.

Myth: Alcohol kills harmful organisms.
Fact: Alcohol may impair your good judgment, but it doesn't destroy harmful bacteria.

Myth: Eating oysters in months with an "R" in their name is safe.
Fact: Even though cold-weather-harvested oysters are likely somewhat safer, many oysters come from warmer climates and are imported into the colder climate.

Myth: Raw oysters are an aphrodisiac and will cure a hangover.
Fact: There is no scientific evidence that either of these commonly held beliefs is true.
