An elderly man has died in Greece in what officials believe to be the country's 1st case of dengue fever since the 1920s. The man, in his 80s, died in hospital on 30 Aug [2012] after contracting fever [virus] in the western village of Agrinio. Blood tests are being carried out to check whether villagers or members of his family also have the viral disease.

Dengue fever [virus] is spread particularly by the Asian tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_], which has increasingly been seen in Europe.

Although health officials believe the elderly man in western Greece had contracted dengue fever, they are describing it as a probable rather than a definite infection, because of the complications of his case.

There was evidence of West Nile virus in his blood [antibodies or virus?] when he died in hospital in Patras, but the dengue fever [reaction] was stronger. He also had an infection and low platelets (thrombocytopenia) -- both of them symptoms of the dengue viral disease.

"We are dealing with a disease we haven't seen for several decades," said Dr Sotirios Tsiodras of the Greek Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. "It might be an isolated case but we want to make sure there are no further cases. We need to take it very seriously," he said.

As well as blood tests, mosquito traps have been set up in Agrinio as part of an entomological investigation.

In 2010, cases of dengue fever were reported in Croatia and France and the spread of viruses by the Asian tiger mosquito in Europe has been linked to travellers and migrants.

[It will be of considerable interest to know if other people in the same village have clinical or serological evidence of dengue virus infection, and if dengue viruses are found in any of the collected mosquitoes.

The classification of this case as probable is prudent if the diagnosis is based on serological results, due to the extensive cross-reactions among the flaviviruses, the family to which the dengue and West Nile viruses belong. As the report above mentions, _Ae. albopictus_ has expanded its range into southern Europe and local dengue transmission has occurred in southern France and Croatia. In areas where this mosquito has become relatively abundant, all that is needed to initiate a dengue outbreak is the arrival of a viremic individual, similar to what occurred in Italy and southern France with chikungunya virus. Arrival of individuals from dengue-endemic areas into dengue virus free areas is not an uncommon event.

More outbreaks such as these can be expected in the future where competent dengue virus vectors are present, and underscores the need for ongoing surveillance to detect local transmission early on. - Mod.TY]
