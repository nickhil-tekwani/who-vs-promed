CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Montevideo infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.

As of 18 Jan 2018, 8 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Montevideo have been reported from 3 states.

State / Case Count
------------
Illinois / 2
Minnesota / 1
Wisconsin / 5
---
Total / 8

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 20 Dec 2017 to 3 Jan 2018. Ill people range in age from 26 to 50, with a median age of 34. All 8 (100 percent) are female. No hospitalizations and no deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------
Epidemiologic evidence indicates that raw sprouts served at Jimmy John's restaurants are a likely source of this multistate outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Seven (88 percent) of 8 people interviewed reported eating at multiple Jimmy John's restaurant locations. Of these 7 people, all (100 percent) reported eating raw sprouts on a sandwich from Jimmy John's in Illinois and Wisconsin. This proportion is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people in which 3 percent reported eating sprouts on a sandwich in the week before they were interviewed. Two ill people in Wisconsin ate at a single Jimmy John's location in that state.

Federal, state, and local health and regulatory officials are conducting traceback investigations from the 6 Jimmy John's locations where ill people ate raw sprouts. These investigations are ongoing to determine where the sprouts were distributed, and to learn more about the potential route of contamination.

The information available to date indicates that raw sprouts served at Jimmy John's restaurants in Illinois and Wisconsin may be contaminated with _Salmonella_ Montevideo and are not safe to eat. CDC recommends that consumers not eat raw sprouts served at Jimmy John's restaurants in Illinois and Wisconsin. Regardless of where they are served, raw and lightly cooked sprouts are a known source of foodborne illness and outbreaks. People who choose to eat sprouts should cook them thoroughly to reduce the risk of illness.

This investigation is ongoing, and we will provide updates when they are available. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is underway, and results will be available soon.

[A number of significant pathogens, including _Salmonella_, _Listeria_, and enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, have been linked to transmission from ingestion of a whole variety of different kinds sprouts in the USA and elsewhere. Indeed, sprouts have been a vehicle for illnesses at this restaurant franchise several times before.

The following is a relatively recent review on outbreaks caused by sprouts:

Dechet AM, Herman KM, Chen Parker C, et al: Outbreaks caused by sprouts, United States, 1998-2010: lessons learned and solutions needed. Foodborne Pathog Dis. 2014;11: 635-644.

Abstract
-----
After a series of outbreaks associated with sprouts in the mid-1990s, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidelines in 1999 for sprouts producers to reduce the risk of contamination. The recommendations included treating seeds with an antimicrobial agent such as calcium hypochlorite solution and testing spent irrigation water for pathogens. From 1998 through 2010, 33 outbreaks from seed and bean sprouts were documented in the USA, affecting 1330 reported persons. 28 outbreaks were caused by _Salmonella_, 4 by Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_, and one by _Listeria_. In 15 of the 18 outbreaks with information available, growers had not followed key FDA guidelines. In 3 outbreaks, however, the implicated sprouts were produced by firms that appeared to have implemented key FDA guidelines. Although seed chlorination, if consistently applied, reduces pathogen burden on sprouts, it does not eliminate the risk of human infection. Further seed and sprouts disinfection technologies, some recently developed, will be needed to enhance sprouts safety and reduce human disease. Improved seed production practices could also decrease pathogen burden, but, because seeds are a globally distributed commodity, will require international cooperation." - Mod.LL
