The title of this post is incorrect. The bat tick we recently reported for the 1st time in New Jersey is considered a US endemic. As far as we know, it is not invasive although it may have increased in abundance recently, as their occurrence in big brown bats in New Jersey led a bat expert to contact one of us.

As mentioned in the text, _Carios kelleyi_ has been reported in bats in 29 US states since it was first described from US specimens in 1941 (https://archive.org/details/argasidaeofnorth01cool/page/112/mode/2up). It was not yet known to occur in New Jersey most likely because no one had looked before (or if they had, they did not report it in the peer-reviewed literature).

We are reaching out to ProMED in hope that you can send out a corrected post to your wide readership. Calling this species invasive is creating unnecessary confusion.

For the past few years, as part of his PhD study, Jim Occi has been researching the occurrence of tick species in New Jersey (We recently published a list of hard ticks of New Jersey -- needed for the development of an informed strategy for surveillance of ticks and tick-borne diseases across the state: Occi JL, Egizi AM, Robbins RG, Fonseca DM. Annotated list of the hard ticks (Acari: Ixodida: Ixodidae) of New Jersey [published correction appears in J Med Entomol. 2019; 56(4): 1176]. J Med Entomol. 2019; 56(3): 589-98. https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjz010). This is necessary so we can create risk maps for New Jersey residents. The confirmation of the presence of the soft tick was one more step toward that goal.

Please let us know if you want any additional clarifications. I have copied the correspondence to all co-authors, including Dr. Rich Robbins, an expert in tick taxonomy and ecology currently working at the Smithsonian Institution Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit (https://wrbu.si.edu/team-members/rrobbins).

[ProMED thanks Dr. Fonseca for her remarks and the correction for the use of the term invasive in the title of the post (see Invasive bat tick - USA: (NJ) 20200913.7771210).

Dr. Fonseca raises an important point: In the case of the bat tick _Carios kelleyi_ that is present in 29 states but not previously known in New Jersey, although very likely present there previously, considering it invasive is misleading. One hopes that the studies going on by her group will stimulate a search in other localities for this tick and the pathogens it may have. It is important to know if these ticks are transmitting to humans, domestic animals and wild birds or mammals, the pathogens with which they have previously been associated. Unfortunately, without a better understanding of the human and animal health consequences of pathogen transmission by these ticks, financial support for these needed studies will be difficult to obtain. - Mod.TY
