Conservation officers are considering an ambitious plan to halt the spread
of tuberculosis [TB] [_Mycobacterium bovis_] in lions and Cape buffalo in
one of the world's largest game reserves. The Cape buffalo began
contracting bovine TB [_Mycobacterium bovis_] by mingling with infected
cattle in the 1950s, before the park's southern boundary was fenced off.
The fatal disease spread north over the years.
The plan calls for Cape buffalo to be removed from a 12- to 24-mile-wide
strip across a northern section of Kruger National Park, Leo Braack,
Kruger's chief of conservation, said Wednesday. The strip would run across
roughly the northern third of Kruger. By separating buffalo herds in the
almost TB-free northern section from infected herds in the central and
southern areas, officials hope to stem the spread of the disease.
The zone could then be gradually moved south, with game rangers culling
infected buffalo and replacing them with TB-free animals from the northern
section, Braack said. This was an option and not a definite part of the
current plan.
Lions contract the disease by devouring infected buffalo. More than 90
percent of the lions tested in the southern part of Kruger National Park
are infected. TB is suspected of cutting the number of adult lions in one
area from 25 to 12 in less than 21/2 years.
A feasibility study on the plan, which Braack announced at a news
conference in Pretoria, is being conducted. Little, if any, opposition is
expected and the plan likely will be approved by year's end, Braack said.
Park officials rejected other options, including building a fence to
contain the infected buffalo. Doing so would interrupt other animals'
migratory patterns and access to watering holes, Braack said. Park
officials also rejected killing every infected buffalo in the park, which
encompasses an area the size of Israel.
