Poisonous moonshine kills 21 in Kenya
-------------------------------------
At least 21 Kenyans died after drinking an illegally prepared alcoholic
drink probably containing poisonous methanol, medics and witnesses said on
Saturday. The victims drank the locally brewed liquor on Friday evening at
a bar in the village of Makutano, about 30 miles south of Nairobi, and fell
ill within hours.

District medical officer Wako Dulacha told Reuters that by Saturday
afternoon, 21 people had died. A further 36 -- looking confused and in pain
-- were being treated in hospital, he said. Of those in hospital, 10 had
lost their sight and 8 more were in serious condition. "We suspect there
was methanol," Dulacha said. "Samples of the drink will be taken to the
government chemists in Nairobi tomorrow to confirm the actual contents."

[One 30 year old patient] described how he took one drink on Friday night
and woke up feeling awful. "A friend took me to a drinking den yesterday.
As normal, we ordered drinks. But immediately after drinking, my friend and
I left for home," he told Reuters from hospital. "This morning when I woke
up, I nearly died. I just lost my consciousness. My wife took me to
hospital...I'm lucky that I didn't lose my sight or die like my friends."
He said he suspected suppliers had added an illegal substance to a spirit
drink that locals had previously been drinking without any problem.

Illicit drinking dens selling strong, homemade brews known locally as
chang'aa, are common across Kenya. There have been sporadic outbreaks of
poisoning among chang'aa drinkers in recent years, with more than 100 dying
after drinking a toxic batch in Nairobi in 2000.

[As mentioned in the newswire, a prior episode in 2000 was associated with
more than 100 deaths (see ProMED-mail: Methanol poisoning, humans - Kenya
20001117.2011). Borrowing from Mod.TG's comment in that posting:

"Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of
wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of
methanol-contaminated whiskey. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites,
formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The elimination
rate depends upon the folate pool. In primates it is generally small and
consequently primates (including humans) are more sensitive to methanol
toxicity than other animals.

"Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze,
windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs,
various paints, paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline
additives.

"Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml (or 3 teaspoons) of
a 40 per cent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal
lethal dose. With aggressive medical care it is possible to survive the
ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may
cause blindness, with the amount varying with the individual. Methanol is
well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak levels occur
generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so
concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest
concentrations are found in the kidney, liver and gastrointestinal tract,
with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle and adipose tissues.

"Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently there
is a longer elimination half-life. Onset of symptoms varies between 40
minutes and 72 hours post-ingestion. Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay
the appearance of symptoms, but the absence of symptoms does not exclude
serious toxicity. The usual latent period is 12-24 hours.

"Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy and confusion,
which are common in mild to moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and
convulsions appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema.
Methanol produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.

"Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to
light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated
pupils, retinal edema and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical
findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms, though
visual defects have persisted in up to 25 per cent of severe cases.

"Methanol is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain, not unlike large doses of ethanol. Early in the clinical
course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may be indicated.
However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these patients may not
realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too late for this type
of treatment to be helpful.

"Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 per cent dextrose solution
may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol,
the treatment may take several days and the patient should be hospitalized.
Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well."

An additional comment on the treatment of methanol poisoning was submitted
by Dr Gary Greenberg (<Gary.Greenberg@Duke.edu> in prior ProMED-mail
postings as well: "Better than ethanol, Fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole,
Antizol) inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase and does not trigger delirium,
fetal risks, liver injury, gastropathy, or frequent vomiting.
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/344/6/424> Also, Folinic acid
(leucovorin) is recommended for restoration of 1-carbon metabolism,
especially for methanol exposure."

More information on this current episode from authoritative sources would
be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
