Disease outbreaks reported
27 July 1999
Plague in Malawi
--------------------
Since 18 June [1999 a number of sporadic suspect cases of
plague have occurred in Nsanje district, Southern Region. Up to 21
July [1999, 74 suspect cases had been reported from a total of 22
villages.
Six villages along the Mozambican border were the most affected
reporting around 3 to 4 suspect cases each. Some of the other
villages reported only one suspect case each.
The treatment of patients is under way as well as environmental
control measures which include spraying and dusting of affected
and surrounding housing areas, health education on proper
storage of foodstuffs and refuse disposal. The situation was being
handled effectively by the Ministry of Health but drug supplies have
been depleted and more may be needed. WHO has offered its
assistance to the national health authorities.
The last outbreak of plague in Malawi was in 1997 when a total of
582 cases were reported including cases in Nsanje, Chikwawa and
Ntchisi Districts, all in Southern Region.
