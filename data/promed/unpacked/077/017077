Serological and even clinical evidence of hantavirus infections in
India was documented already well before the 2005 Indian study
mentioned in the ProMED-mail post of Wed 2 Nov 2005 [see: Hantavirus
- India 20051103.3213].

From 1998 on, we studied the presence of hantavirus-specific IgG and
IgM antibodies by means of rNP ELISA for Puumala virus (PUUV) and SIA
(strip immunoblot assay) with recombinant PUUV and Seoul virus (SEOV)
antigens (B. Hjelle, New Mexico), in Indian sera of cases, suspected
for leptospirosis. These sera were kindly forwarded to us by Prof. M
Muthusethupathi from the Government General Hospital in Chennai,
India, and from Dr G. Nainan from the Medical Trust Hospital, Cochin,
India, thanks to the services of Prof. W. Terpstra and Dr. R.
Hartskeerl of the Tropical Institute of Biomedical Research,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands. However, all were seronegative for
leptospirosis in MAT testing in India, and negative in our hands with
a specific and probably more sensitive Patoc-IgG & IgM ELISA test.

The 1st serological evidence we found of SEOV-like and/or PUVV-like
antibodies in these Indian sera was presented as an oral presentation
at the 48th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH), end 1999, in Washington DC, USA.:
Clement J, Hinrichsen S, Crescente J, Bigaignon G, Yersin C,
Muthusethupathi M, Nainan G, Terpstra W, Hartskeerl R, Lundkvist A,
Van Ranst M. Title: Hantavirus-induced hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of
leptospirosis-suspected cases in the New and the Old World. Am J Trop
Med Hyg 1999; 61: 316-17.

As presented one year later at the 38th Annual meeting of the
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), in New Orleans, USA,
7-10 Sep 2000, no clinical cases of hantavirus infection had been
reported at that point from India. In a prospective study in the
Chennai and Cochin areas in Southern India, leptospirosis-suspected
but Patoc ELISA-IgM negative cases were investigated. Dengue
infection was likewise serologically excluded. IgG & IgM SIA testing
with recombinant PUUV and SEOV antigens was first performed. We found
7/60 (12 percent) positives for SEOV, i.e. showing a higher band
intensity for SEOV than for PUUV, and 3/60 (5 percent)
PUUV-positives. All IgG SIA-positive cases, except 1 SEOV, were also
IgM SIA-positive, thus confirming a recent hantavirus infection in at
least 9 Indian cases presenting as "leptospirosis." 2 cases were
fatal: one Chennai patient (male, 72 y) developed fever, confusion,
acute renal failure (ARF), jaundice, and low platelets (100 000/mm3),
and died after 1 day of peritoneal dialysis. In this case, the PUUV
IgG & IgM SIA-results were further confirmed by a positive ELISA IgG
(but not IgM) result for PUUV.

The 2nd fatal case was a Cochin female patient (64 y), who presented
with fever, myalgiae, dyspnea and abdominal pain. She developed
jaundice, very low platelets (7000/mm3), disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC), and dialysis-dependent ARF. An adult respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) picture with extreme hypoxia prompted
mechanical ventilation. The patient died in refractory shock on
hospital day 7. SIA IgG & IgM was clearly positive for PUUV-bands,
and PUUV IgM was likewise positive in ELISA, thus confirming for the
1st time and with 2 different tests a recent and fatal hantaviral
infection in an Indian patient. These preliminary results were
published as an abstract in: Clement J., Muthusethupathi M., Nainan
G., Van Ranst M. First fatal cases of hantavirus nephropathy in
India. Clin Inf Dis 2000; 31: 315.

As mentioned, Thottapalayam virus (TPMV) is the only indigenous
hantavirus with a documented presence so far in India, and was
isolated in 1964 from a shrew near Vellore in Southern India. To
date, no human pathogenicity for TPMV has been shown, and it should
be noted moreover that a shrew is an insectivore, not a rodent. So
far, human hantavirus pathogenicity has been linked to rodents only.
However, the rat-transmitted SEOV serotype is cosmopolitan, with a
documented presence also in India. SEOV can induce thrombocytopenia
with concomitant kidney and liver involvement, thus perfectly
mimicking leptospirosis. The clinical picture is most often of
intermediate severity. Although we found evidence of a SEOV-like
infection in 12 percent of the Indian "leptospirosis-like" cases ,
the more severe cases were suggestive rather of a PUUV-like
infection, which was surprising. Indeed, whereas in Europe and
Russia, PUUV-infections are spread by red bank voles, this rodent and
consequently also the virus carried by bank voles are absent from
India. We therefore believe that our positive PUUV-results may be
merely cross-reactions with TPMV or yet another unknown hantavirus
strain in India. In this hypothesis, the low yield in our screening
for hantaviruses in India may be explained by the fact that we were
using only or in part cross-reacting antigens. From a clinical point
of view, it is also unlikely that the severe hospital courses as
depicted above could be attributed to a true PUVV infection, which is
mostly rather mild. In fact, the fatal outcome of the 64-year-old
Cochin case with ARF, DIC, ARDS, and refractory shock leading to
death one week after admission is highly reminiscent of the severe
South American forms of the so-called "hantavirus (cardio-)pulmonary
syndrome" or HPS.

To elucidate this problem, we are now in the process of confirming
our results with neutralisation tests on the largest possible battery
of known hantaviruses, preferably also including TPMV. Without this
gold standard for hantavirus serology, no final decision can be made
about the exact nature and importance of hantaviruses in India.
