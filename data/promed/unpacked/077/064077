Chimp dies: mystery ailment strikes Lincoln Park zoo chimps
-----------------------------------------------------------
Lincoln Park Zoo officials are watching 6 ailing, quarantined
chimpanzees around the clock after an adolescent member of the group
died in the zoo's hospital earlier this week.

The 9-year-old chimp, a male named Kipper, died Tuesday [24 Mar
2009], a day after veterinarians brought him to the zoo hospital. He
and the other 6 members of his group, who are usually on exhibit in
the Regenstein Center for African Apes, came down with a mysterious
upper respiratory infection [19 Mar 2009]. The cause of the
respiratory ailment is still unknown, but there is no indication that
it has spread to the ape house's other chimp group or to its 2
gorilla families, said Steve Thompson, the zoo's vice president of
conservation programs.

The initial necropsy reports listed pneumonia as the cause of
Kipper's death, according to Thompson. The youngest member of his
group, Kipper had a congenital condition that may have limited his
breathing capacity, causing more serious problems for him than for
the others, Thompson said.

Great apes like chimpanzees and gorillas suffer from the same sorts
of respiratory diseases as humans, so zoos have been instituting
increasingly more rigid protocols to limit direct contact between
humans and apes. Even on a normal day at Lincoln Park Zoo, any human
coming into contact with the apes is required to wear sterile masks,
clothing, and footwear. It's possible the apes could contract disease
from wild animals that occasionally get into their outdoor habitats,
such as squirrels and birds, Thompson said, adding that it may be
impossible to learn how the chimpanzees were infected.

With the initial symptoms in the chimpanzee group persisting over the
weekend [21-22 Mar 2009], the zoo took the 7 chimps off display and
put them in quarantine quarters in the lower level of the ape house.
The facility has no true isolation ward, but ill and healthy animals
are kept on opposite sides of the building and keepers do a complete
clothing change when moving between groups.

After going into isolation with his group, which is headed by a male
named Hank, Kipper took a turn for the worse on Monday [23 Mar 2009],
showing pneumonia-like symptoms, Thompson said. "He was sounding like
he had trouble breathing, and he hadn't eaten or drunk much,"
Thompson said. "He was taken to the zoo hospital, where the vets
sedated him to treat with fluids and put him on antibiotics. He was
under round-the-clock observation and early Tuesday seemed improved.
He was moving around and knew his surroundings, recognized his
keepers and the vets. But at some point he was left alone for 15 to
20 minutes, and when somebody checked on him, he had stopped
breathing and couldn't be revived."

Kipper was born with a concave sternum on the left side of his chest
that reduced the size of his chest cavity and may have impeded his
lungs from expanding fully, perhaps putting him at a disadvantage in
fighting off the infection, Thompson said. "This is the kind of
pneumonia condition that is difficult to treat in humans [as well as]
non-human primates," he said.

Thompson said the other 6 chimpanzees in the group are not as ill as
Kipper was, but they also have not recovered, so the zoo has them
under around-the-clock monitoring in quarantine. "Unfortunately they
can't tell us how they feel, so we are trying every possible
precaution," he said. "Some seem to be well on the way to recovery;
others still have a serious respiratory condition, so we are watching
them very closely, with antibiotic treatments."

None of the other apes in the building has shown any symptoms of the
disease, he said.

The ape house remains open and its gorillas are on public view, but
the habitat usually occupied by Hank's group is empty. The zoo's 2nd
chimp group remains in the off-viewing quarters where it normally
lives.

which adds little except that they initially displayed "cold-like" symptoms.

Until there any laboratory results from samples taken from these
chimpanzees, the cause must remain uncertain. One might well consider
a normal human viral pathogen, as it appears the zoo veterinary staff
are doing. And so far it has proven to be not very contagious, from
one pen to another. - Mod. MHJ]
