[The newly laboratory confirmed infections with MERS-CoV above raise the total number of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported by Saudi Arabia to 371, including 107 deaths. The individuals with confirmed asymptomatic infections have been tested as part of contact tracing and represent probable person-to-person transmission. It would be useful to know what proportion/percent of the reported asymptomatic infections progress to symptomatic respiratory (or non-respiratory) infections during what would be considered the accepted incubation period for the disease, and what proportion of these individuals remain asymptomatic throughout the entire period until they no longer have evidence of active viral infection. Some of the information gaps in understanding MERS-CoV infections include the natural history of infections, including true proportion of symptomatic to asymptomatic infections and what is the period of high transmissibility of the virus (are there asymptomatic virus transmitters? Or does transmission primarily occur after symptoms occur?).

This moderator erroneously stated that it appeared as though all newly confirmed infections reported on 30 Apr 2014 (MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (45): Saudi Arabia 20140430.2437089) were person-to-person transmission. The actual thought process was that over the past several days, there has been no mention of history of travel or history of contact with animals (and especially camels or camel products), suggesting that perhaps most of the newly confirmed infections were felt to be due to either direct person-to-person transmission or indirect person-to-person transmission both in the healthcare environment and or community. The same thought process applies to those newly reported infections above. We await more detailed information on studies of apparent chains of transmission of the MERS-CoV confirmed since the middle of March 2014.

Jordan reports 7th case of coronavirus
--------------------------------------
A new patient tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday [1 May 2014], bringing to 7 the total number of patients affected by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Jordan since 2012, the Ministry of Health announced.

The patient, who is a healthcare worker, had come in contact with a Saudi patient who had tested positive for coronavirus last week [week of 21 Apr 2014].

[While the clinical status, age, or gender of this newly confirmed MERS-CoV infection in a contact of a recently confirmed MERS-CoV case are not mentioned, a media report mentioned that the case is a 28-year-old male medic who took care of the Saudi case admitted to Zarqa Hospital (see http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/middle-east/56960-jordan-records-new-mers-infections). The contact case mentioned in the press release above is a Saudi citizen who had previously been admitted to a hospital in Saudi Arabia, left the hospital, and sought medical care in Zarqa Jordan (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (40): Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan ex KSA, WHO, RFI 20140424.2424017 for more details). As a reminder, the 1st documented nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV infections occurred in Zarqa in 2012.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 1 May 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [26 Apr 2014], the Ministry of Health of Egypt reported the 1st laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the country.

The patient is a 27-year-old man who has been living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for the past 4 years. The patient had contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed case (his uncle) who died on [19 Apr 2014], and another laboratory-confirmed case (neighbour of his uncle) who is still under treatment in a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The patient became ill on [22 Apr 2014], returned to Egypt on [25 Apr 2014] and was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV on [26 Apr 2014]. The patient is currently in a stable condition.

WHO has mobilized a team to support Saudi Arabia to review the current situation, identify information gaps to better understand the public health risk associated with the current upsurge in cases, particularly in health-care settings, and to determine the type of further investigations to be conducted, in order to understand the transmission chain and health care associated transmission.

Saudi Arabia has provided information on 138 cases identified between [11 to 26 Apr 2014] in the country, including preliminary details of cases and deaths associated with the outbreak in Jeddah. WHO will update the global total of laboratory-confirmed cases of infections with MERS-CoV, including deaths, based on official information provided by Saudi Arabia as quickly as possible.

[The WHO update above provides details of the case in an Egyptian national who had been living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (43): Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE, WHO 20140427.2431453 for the earlier ProMED-mail report on this case) and returned to Egypt for treatment of MERS-CoV infection.

Of note is that the WHO report mentions 138 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia to WHO during the period 11-26 Apr 2014. According to Saudi MOH updates posted on the Saudi MOH website, since 26 Apr 2014 there have been an additional 32 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection.
