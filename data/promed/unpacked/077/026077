The World Health Organisation (WHO) in Geneva says: "This is a smart virus.
The virus is always ahead of us and whatever we do it will always be
around,'' said Dr Daniel Lavanchy, WHO's coordinator of epidemic disease
response.
The crisis has been caused by a virulent strain of the bug known as
Australian flu or Sydney H3N2. WHO experts correctly predicted the Sydney
strain was the one to fear this year. But Lavanchy complained: "Immunisation
campaigns have not achieved their
targets in many, many countries. The target groups are not well covered with
a few exceptions like France. Europe and North America are in the grip of an
epidemic.''
Mortality rates cannot be accurately calculated for up to two years after an
epidemic. But officials stress the latest wave of flu is still a far cry
from the 1918, 1957 and 1968 pandemics that killed millions around the
globe.
UNITED STATES: THE Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said flu
usually kills about 20 000 people a year in the United States. Although it
may seem that nearly every American has come down with a case of the flu,
medical experts stress that a serious epidemic is not underway there.
But, ironically, two newly approved flu drugs could be helping to spread
influenza by inadvertently discouraging people from getting the flu vaccine.
Tamiflu is a pill made by Swiss drug company Roche Holdings AG (ROCZg.S),
while Relenza, made by Glaxo Wellcome Plc (GLXO.L), is inhaled. Both reduce
flu symptoms by one day on average.
CHINA: the world's most populous nations, is reaping rich rewards from an
ambitious vaccination programme. A Ministry of Public Health spokeswoman
said the campaign had produced "good results.'' Many people, especially the
old, lined up at Beijing
hospitals for the flu shot.

FLU SWEEPS EUROPE
ITALY: Two million Italians are reportedly suffering from flu with 250 000
new
cases each week. This is the third consecutive week in which the number of
flu sufferers in Italian hospitals has increased.
SWITZERLAND: Georg Amstutz, a spokesman at the Swiss federal department of
health, said the number of influenza cases in the Alpine state could be
classified as an
epidemic and was approaching record numbers.
NORWAY: Oslo's main Ullevaal hospital is hiring extra nurses from nearby
Denmark
and delaying non-emergency treatment because beds are filled with influenza
sufferers.
FRANCE: Antoine Flahault, research doctor at France's National Institute of
Health
and Medical Research, INSERM, said: "At this stage the epidemic most
resembles 1989 that involved 5 million people in 13 weeks."
CZECH REPUBLIC: Many hospitals have banned visitors in an attempt to halt
the spread of the virus.
SWEDEN: Professor Annika Linde from the Infectious Diseases Protection
Institute said the situation was very serious with hospitals overcrowded
with flu patients and battling staff shortages.
UNITED KINGDOM: Health Secretary Alan Milburn told parliament "There can
hardly be a family in the land that has not been affected by the flu.'' One
in 500 people are gripped by the virus and worse is to come.
