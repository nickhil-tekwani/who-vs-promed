CHOLERA - ZAMBIA

I have just returned from a long holiday and found the cholera season well
under way in Zambia. After 5 years of repeated drought, the rains are
returning to what were normal levels in the past. As with the last good
rains in the 1992-1993 rainy season, cholera is also present. In 1992-1993
the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) Ministry of Health (MOH)
reported 15,000 cases with 1,500 deaths. As of 13 February 1996, the MOH has
reported 66 cases with 12 deaths. Cases began to be reported from Mpulungu
in the Northern Province on Lake Tanganyika. 50 cases are from Mbala
district which contains Mpulungu, and 5 cases from Kasama the Provincial
capital of Northern Province. 10 cases have been reported from Kabwe in the
Central province and the last case was reported in Kitwe (Copperbelt
Province), but is said to be imported from Kabwe. I have no information on
the laboratory isolates as yet.
