Testable hypotheses are inherently risky; one discards or modifies until
the remaining hypotheses become theories. I think Koch would be aghast at
the way that "Koch's postulates" are held as the necessary standard for
proving roles for infections in chronic diseases. Even "modified Koch's
postulates", based on correlations and other criteria, fail to account for
the likely interplay of host genotype and environment, infections,
immunity, and chronic diseases.
Rous was at least partly right about cancer and infections, and perhaps
largely right; infections generate liver and cervical cancers, and
minimally drive mutations in specific genes (often signal pathway genes)
that lead to cancer. Mouse models of multiple sclerosis indicate that the
condition arises certainly in some genetic backgrounds, only given
infection or immunization in others, and never in other genetic
backgrounds.
Asthma, premature aging of the immune system, and other phenomena are other
diseases influenced by antigen exposure including histories of infection.

I am sorry to "split hairs" in return, but the "sequestered clone theory"
is only one of several theories concerning the origins of autoimmunity.
Additionally, regardless of the initiating event (some theory does still
attribute the possibility of cross-reactivity or prokaryotic infection -
whether it be bacterial, viral or otherwise - such theories are currently
being investigated in the case of SLE or Lupus) an autoimmune process, once
triggered, becomes a self-escalating event (again theorized to be due to
many possible mechanisms, such as the formation of anti-idiotype antibody
cascades, etc.)
One example of a theory that wraps much of this together under one title is
the "altered antigen" theory, where due to chemical or physical means, a
"self-antigen" is modified or altered and instead recognized as foreign.
Such mechanisms may be physical or chemical injury to tissue, tissue
necrosis, or even temperature (such play roles in Paroxysmal Cold
Hemoglobinuria and Raynauld's Disease).
It is also possible that whether the antigen STARTS OUT as "self" or
"foreign", cross-reactive epitopes cause a cascade of now-auto-immune
responses. Hapten-carrier complexes generate completely NEW antigenic
epitopes, which may cause the body great distress.
Please forgive me if I in any way have exuded any tone of
"know-it-all"-ness, and any of my colleagues in this field please correct
me if I have misstated fact in any way. However this has simply been my
personal area of interest and involvement both in the clinical laboratory
as well as research for some time. My comments are meant strictly as
discussion and in no way in offense.
