Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Uganda - WHO Update 36
--------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 29 Dec 2000, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported the
following:
Gulu district: From 19-29 Dec 2000, there was a total of 5 new confirmed
cases and 6 deaths. The most recent laboratory confirmed case in Gulu died
on Fri 22 December. The cumulative total number of cases for Gulu is now 394
cases and 149 deaths.
Masindi district: From 19-29 Dec 2000, there have been no new confirmed
cases but 1 death has occurred. The last case was admitted to hospital on
Tue 12 Dec 2000 and the last death occurred on Thu 21 Dec 2000. There have
been no patients in the isolation ward for the last 7 days. The cumulative
total number of cases for Masindi is now 27 confirmed cases and 19 deaths.
Mbarara district: The cumulative total number of cases for Mbarara is 5
cases and 4 deaths.
The cumulative total number of cases for all affected districts in Uganda
is now 426 cases and 172 deaths. (In our previous report
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2000/december/19adecember2000.htm
l>, the cumulative total number of deaths was wrongly counted as 162 deaths
for all of Uganda; 165 deaths was the correct number).
Despite the significant improvement in the Ebola situation in the country,
social mobilisation programmes continue and members of the community are
being requested to remain vigilant and report any suspicious cases.
Investigation of reported suspected cases is ongoing as well as follow up of
contacts of suspected and confirmed cases.
WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from Uganda.
