Imported case of rabies in Germany from India
---------------------------------------------
An imported case of rabies was recently notified in Germany. At the
beginning of May 2004, a 51-year-old Bavarian man became ill 6 weeks after
returning from a 5-month trip to India. He had influenza-like symptoms,
exhaustion, fever and malaise. In India, he had been living in basic
conditions and had contact with wild dogs. He had previously travelled to
India in 2001, where he had been bitten by a wild monkey.
On 6 May 2004, the patient developed pain in his right shoulder and arm. On
7 May 2004, he developed hydrophobia, aerophobia, and pharyngeal spasms. By
9 May 2004, he was losing consciousness and vomiting blood. That day, on
suspicion that he was suffering from encephalitis or rabies, he was
admitted to the intensive care unit at a nearby hospital. Doctors treating
the patient suspected rabies at that point.
After admission to hospital, the patient quickly developed breathing
difficulties. While he was alive, various tests were done to try to confirm
the suspected diagnosis of rabies, but the results of these were all
negative. The patient died on 29 May 2004. A preliminary
pathological-anatomical diagnosis of rabies was made, supported by the
institute responsible for the post mortem. The diagnosis was finally
confirmed by 2 specialist rabies diagnostic laboratories, using direct
immunofluorescence as well as virus isolation in cell culture of brain
tissue samples.
Whether the monkey bite was the cause (there are cases in the literature
with incubation times of up to 7 years) or contact with saliva of an
infected wild dog, is unknown. This case highlights the importance for
travellers to get immunised against rabies before visiting countries where
there is widespread rabies in dogs, and to seek medical care if they are
bitten/have contact while there.
As with the case described here, it is not unusual for all diagnostic tests
for rabies carried out while the patient is alive to be negative. A
clinically suspected case is usually confirmed only after death by testing
brain tissue samples using direct immunofluorescence. Further tests on
tissue samples from this patient are currently still being carried out at
the Bundesforschungsanstalt fï¿½r Viruserkrankungen der Tiere, Wusterhausen
(German national research laboratory for viral illnesses in animals,
<http://www.bfav.de/>). Isolates of the virus obtained from the patient's
tissue are being typed and characterised using monoclonal antibodies. The
viral RNA is also being sequenced; this will allow geographical location of
the virus, and identification of the animal species that infected the man.
Rabies is unlikely to be spread from person to person. There have been very
few reported cases; all of which occurred when a patient had donated organs
while incubating rabies, or after death from unrecognised rabies [2].
The very real danger to travellers to exotic destinations was reinforced
with the recent case in an Austrian man who was bitten by a wild dog on a
beach in Morocco at the beginning of August 2004, and who died in hospital
in Austria at the end of that month [3]. A particularly high risk of rabies
exists in India (India reports at least 20 000 human deaths from rabies per
year) and Nepal.
