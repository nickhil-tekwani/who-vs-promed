2nd phase of anti-bird flu drive starts in eastern Nepal
--------------------------------------------------------
Authorities have launched a 2nd-phase program to prevent the possible
spread of bird flu in Jhapa district in eastern Nepal, where the
disease was traced in chickens.

Officials at the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives said
thousands of chickens and other birds were culled and poultry
products destroyed in Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa, some 320 km
[approx. 200 mi] east of Kathmandu, during the 1st phase of the
anti-bird flu drive.

The 2nd-phase, which will continue for 3 months, will include
cleaning programs in sensitive places like poultry firms and sales
stores.

The government had issued a bird flu alert in Mechinagar on 16 Jan 2009.

Meanwhile, as part of the anti-bird flu surveillance, the Home
Ministry has banned transportation of live birds and poultry products
in buses and other public vehicles.

The ministry said in a statement Saturday [24 Jan 2009] that police
officials can take action against anybody found carrying chickens and
other live birds while using public transport.
