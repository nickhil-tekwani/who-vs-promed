For the first time scientists at the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences have successfully developed the genetically-engineered clone of
the hepatitis E virus. The achievement is particularly significant as this
will not only now pave the way for development of a vaccine but will also
make it possible to identify a drug
which can inhibit this virus. At the moment there is no drug available to
contain this infection. Microbiologists in AIIMS are close to [developing]
a vaccine for this virus.
Hepatitis E along with other [hepatitis viruses] directly affects the
liver. Hepatitis E viruses is less well known than other hepatitis viruses,
and was discovered only 15 years ago.

In vitro-synthesized RNA from a cDNA clone of hepatitis E virus is

The clone is infectious.
Hepatitis E virus, recently shown to occur in rodents in the U.S., and
likely elsewhere, (Favorov MO; Kosoy MY; Tsarev SA; Childs JE; Margolis HS
{2000} Prevalence of Antibody to Hepatitis E Virus among rodents in the
United States. J Infect Dis 181:449-455), is endemic to the Indian
subcontinent, causes epidemics, and affects, on average, about 5 million
Indians each year; many of them die.
Just for clarity: Not all hepatitis viruses are related to each other.
Virus Family Genus
Hepatitis E Caliciviridae _Calicivirus_
Hepatitis A Picornaviridae _Hepatovirus_
Hepatitis B Hepadnaviridae _Orthohepadnavirus_
Hepatitis C Flaviviridae _Hepacivirus_
