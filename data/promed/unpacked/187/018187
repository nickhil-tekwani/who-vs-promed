The Ministry of Agriculture in Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen), Northern
Germany, has made it known that the discovery of bluetongue in a
sentinel cow in Osnabruck has definitely been a false alarm. A mix-up
of ear tags, leading to the testing of an animal that was not the
sentinel one, has caused this error, said the Ministry's spokesperson.
The tested cow in Osnabruck was indeed positive but it is not
possible to rule out 2006-origin antibodies.
Although this means that there is no indication for current
bluetongue-virus activity in northern Europe, so far it has not been
decided to cancel or alleviate the implemented control/preventive
measures. The Ministry of Agriculture in The Hague is planning to
consult other EU member states before taking a decision on the matter.
The Hague has not yet received notification from Hannover [capital of
Lower Saxony].

[The detection of a positive sentinel animal in Osnabruck, and the
application of the corresponding measures in the Netherlands, have
been reported in ProMED-mail's posting Bluetongue - Europe (06):
BTV-8 20070407.1170 of 7 Apr 2007.
The Dutch agricultural journal cited above has also published
information on the recently renewed activity of the _Culicoides_
midge vectors within the territory of the Netherlands. During the 2nd
week of April 2007, potential vectors were detected in 18 out of 20
surveyed areas, where traps have been operational. However, no
bluetongue virus has been found in 2007. See (in Dutch)
<http://www.zibb.nl/landentuinbouw/veehouderij/nieuwsbericht/asp/artnr/1390725/versie/1/index.html>.

The season of higher vector activity might be anticipated to commence
in June 2007. This is partly based on the following information:
Officially, the 1st bluetongue case was confirmed in the Netherlands
on 17 Aug 2006, affecting a holding in Kerkrade in the Limburg
province. On 18 Aug 2006, Belgium confirmed outbreaks of the disease
in its Liege and Limburg provinces, and on 21 Aug 2007, Germany
confirmed 2 outbreaks in the North Rhine-Westphalia region.
However, appendix 8 (Epidemiological analysis of the 2006 bluetongue
virus serotype 8 epidemic in north-western Europe: Results until 31
Jan 2006 on Role of human interventions
<http://www.efsa.europa.eu/etc/medialib/efsa/in_focus/bluetongue/bluetongue_report.Par.0010.File.dat/Appx8_bluetongue_S8.pdf>),
of EFSA's (European Food Safety Authority) "Report on Epidemiological
analysis of the 2006 bluetongue virus serotype 8 epidemic in
north-western Europe: provisional findings through 31 Jan 2007 (Last
updated: 11 Apr 2007)" (covered in ProMED-mail archive
20070414.1249), includes the following important observation:
"Retrospectively, the earliest date when clinical signs were
therefore observed in The Netherlands was on the 30-31 July 2006 (Ref
1). A report on the first observed BTV outbreaks in Belgium indicates
that the first BTV clinical signs were noticed around 17 July 2006
(Ref 2)."
