Uruguay - MGAP confirms 12 cases of equine encephalitis
-------------------
There are now 12 confirmed cases of equine encephalitis with 7 horses dead,
according to figures from the Ministry for Stockbreeding, Agriculture, and
Fishing (MGAP, Ministerio de Ganaderia, Agricultura y Pesca). Deaths were
reported in different slums in Montevideo, and the animals were found by
people picking through garbage.
Mr. Hipolito Tapie, Head of the Sanitation Department in the MGAP, pointed
out that the last case was reported in the El Cerro area. "The last report
of an animal with nervous system symptoms was on 5 Jan 2005 in the El Cerro
area, near Troccoli stadium, and this animal belonged to garbage
pickers. To date, we have registered 12 cases of disease and 7 dead
animals. The sources are Cerrito de la Victoria, Sayago, Malvin Norte,
Pantanoso and El Cerro," he explained.
Everything indicates that the disease is transmitted by mosquitoes and may
prove to be viral encephalitis, even though confirmatory results of the
sera samples sent to the US and Brazil are still awaited. Health
authorities said that if this disease were transmitted to humans, it would
not be lethal; instead, it would resemble flu.

Uruguay - Unexplained horse deaths
---------------------
The unexplained death of 6 horses in some slums has led to a joint
investigation by Stockbreeding and Health Ministries and the Veterinary
School. The animals died of encephalitis, and the aforementioned
institutions are trying to determine the causative agent; and above all,
whether there is any risk of infection for humans.
Julio Vignolo, Vice-Director at the Ministry of Health, told the local
newspaper El Pais that some samples have been sent to Rio de Janeiro and
the United States in order to identify the causative agent, but he also
stated that West Nile Virus and so-called "mad cow disease" have been ruled
out.
The 1st warning was given by the Veterinary School, which since early
December 2004, took care of 10 sick horses that were brought to their
offices by their owners, all of them garbage pickers living in slums. When
it was confirmed that all the animals had the same clinical condition whose
cause was still unknown, this led to a meeting at the end of December 2004
with the authorities from the Stockbreeding and Health Ministries.
Specialists from the Veterinary School stated that even though few cases
have been reported to date, it must be taken into account that most people
are unaware that they must report the death of any animal. Mr. Vignolo
emphasized that, though no deaths have been reported among the human
inhabitants of the slums, an epidemiological survey is to be carried out in
the health centers serving the areas where the cases occurred: Casavalle
and the neighboring areas of the Conciliacion community. A similar
investigation will be carried out by the Stockbreeding Ministry involving
the horse population of the aforementioned areas.
Fumigation: The Acting Director of Health and Social Programs of the
Montevideo City Council, Ms. Perla Vivas, pointed out that it was decided
to fumigate the premises the animals came from as well as the Veterinary
Faculty facilities. It was a preventive action, based on the hypothesis
that infection was transmitted by mosquitoes.
"Until results are available we are taking preventive measures. Local
residents must not be alarmed. The Director of Sanitation informed us that
after fumigation, the affected areas were completely free of mosquitoes,
which are the only vector capable of transmitting the infection to horses,"
Ms. Vivas stated.
On the other hand, Mr. Vignolo added that they are trying to rule out any
transmissible disease. "We must especially rule out eastern or western
equine encephalitis, or Venezuelan equine encephalitis", he stated. This
type of virus may affect humans only through wild birds, with mosquitoes
acting as vector.
"Mosquitoes, after biting the bird -- which carries the virus -- may bite
humans and also horses," explained Mr. Vignolo, who also emphasized that
there is no direct transmission from horses to humans. He indicated that
this might be the transmission cycle in the presumptive case if it proves
to be any of the aforementioned diseases.
Another hypothesis is that these cases correspond to a kind of mass
intoxication. "We have to reassure people. A working team has already been
set up, and all coordinated actions have been taken in order to reach a
diagnosis" Mr. Vignolo pointed out. The results from foreign laboratories
may arrive in a matter of hours.
Former cases of equine encephalitis: In 1972, encephalitis cases were
reported in horses. To diagnose these cases, the national authorities
worked jointly with the Pan-American Center for Zoonoses for nearly 2
years. That outbreak also involved both Brazil and Argentina. There were no
cases of encephalic disease in humans and there were no fatal cases amongst
horses.
According to specialists from the veterinary School, the disease may have
come from the Delta del Tigre area, where trade winds may bring infected
mosquitoes or birds.
Some years later, in 1983, there was another small encephalitis outbreak in
the Soriano area, but immediate action was taken and there were no further
complications. Mr. Vignolo recalled these outbreaks, but he stated that it
is still not known whether the current cases correspond to the same type of
encephalitis reported in the 1970s.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on these equine deaths from
knowledgeable sources. The above article does not mention the type of
encephalitis. The obvious concerns are the recognized equine
encephalitides such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis, western equine
encephalitis, and eastern encephalitis. The other significant possibility
is West Nile virus, which has been slowly journeying southward through the
Americas (see ProMED-mail posting West Nile virus update 2005 - Western
Hemisphere (01) 20050106.0033 discussing seropositive equines identified in
Trinidad).
The absence of human cases of encephalitis-like illness at present may or
may not be significant, as equine cases of encephalitis often present
earlier than human cases, especially where human exposure to mosquitoes may
be more limited, such as in more urban locales such as a capital city like
Montevideo. In addition, the possibility of having human disease that
isn't as yet coming to the attention of the health sector exists. Lastly,
the possibility that this is not due to infectious causes but rather is due
to a toxic exposure also exists. Again, ProMED-mail would appreciate more
information from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MPP]
