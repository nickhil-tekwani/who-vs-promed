More than 200 cattle have died in the western division of New South
Wales (NSW) over the past few months from a mystery disease.
The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) is investigating the as
yet-unidentified disease.
Senior regional animal health manager Greg Curran says cattle are
displaying a wide range of signs. "The 1st animals that are affected
usually are calves, they might show things like just being off color,
or there might be a bit of scouring [rather profuse diarrhea. -
Mod.TG] over a couple of days and then, you know, they'll die quite
quickly," he said. [Generally severe dehydration has a role here. - Mod.TG]
"The other signs we've been seeing, I suppose, are upper respiratory
tract signs or lung signs, or there might be some muck coming out
their nose or a bit of froth at their mouth, so it's been a real mixed bag."

[These are relatively non-specific signs. Scours can affect almost
any size and age of calf. Stress can cause it, so can an infection
with coccidiosis, which is not uncommon in calves. Calves that scour
may also be affected with a respiratory complex of organisms that is
collectively referred to as 'shipping fever'. This article does not
tell us if these animals have been shipped from one location to another.
The article implies that other ages of animals are eventually
affected. The clinical signs could be related to bovine viral
diarrhea, which can affect calves as well as mature animals.
Another possibility is malignant catarrhal fever, which has many of
these same signs.
What the article does not tell us is what diagnostics are being done.
What are the pathology and histopathology? What other tests have been
run? For that I would be grateful if one of the health officials
would give us an authoritative update. - Mod.TG
