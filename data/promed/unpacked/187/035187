About 138 carabaos [_Bubalus bubalis carabanesis_, a domesticated
subspecies of the water buffalo] in 9 barangays [villages] of Las
Navas in the province of Northern Samar died of hemorrhagic
septicemia over the weekend [13-14 Oct 2007].

The death of carabaos in Las Navas, which is known to be endemic to
hemorrhagic septicemia, was learned over the weekend but the
situation is already under control, Department of Agriculture
Regional Technical Director in the Region, Dr. Wilson Cerbito,
informed.

Dr. Cerbito said that when the Department of Agriculture in the
Region learned about the outbreak, it immediately sent treatments to
the area.

Dr. Cerbito also reported that Regional veterinarians will be
deployed to the area on 16 Oct 2007 in order to conduct follow up
treatments even as the Department of Agriculture has already issued
an advisory of "No movement, no slaughtering of carabaos" in the area.

Initial reports had it that several farmers hid their carabaos
instead of reporting the situation to the local veterinarian.

Dr. Cerbito called on the carabao owners to immediately report to the
proper authorities any cases of hemorrhagic septicemia so that the
situation will be readily and easily controlled.

The predisposing factor to the bacterial disease called hemorrhagic
septicemia is the causative agent _Pasteurella multocida_. The
disease often hits carabaos or cattle following extreme changes in
temperature that causes stress in them.

The affected carabao had manifested sudden fever, lack of appetite
that developed into loss of appetite, profuse salivation, diarrhea
but constipation in some cases, nasal discharges, bloating,
staggering gait, and reluctance to move as well as staring gaze.

[Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) is a major disease of cattle and
buffaloes characterized by an acute, highly fatal septicemia with
high morbidity and mortality. It is caused by certain serotypes of
_Pasteurella multocida_. HS is not zoonotic.

The disease has been recorded in wild mammals in several Asian and
European countries. In many Asian countries disease outbreaks mostly
occur during the climatic conditions typical of monsoon (high
humidity and high temperatures).

HS has been erroneously and widely used as a synonym for shipping
fever and other infections. The result has been that the disease has
been mistakenly reported in South America and elsewhere.

Massive epizootics may occur in endemic as well as non-endemic areas.
In the recent past, HS has been identified as a secondary
complication in cattle and buffalos following outbreaks of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Case fatality approaches 100 percent if
treatment is not followed at the initial stage of infection.

The diagnosis of the disease is based on the clinical signs, gross
pathological lesions, morbidity and mortality patterns, and
confirmation by isolation of the pathogens and their conventional and
molecular characterization.

Effective vaccines against hemorrhagic septicemia are formalin-killed
bacterins, or dense bacterins with adjuvants. The latter enhance the
level and prolong the duration of immunity. - Mod.AS
