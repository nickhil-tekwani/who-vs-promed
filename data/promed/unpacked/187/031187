An outbreak caused by hantavirus in the Black Sea region of Turkey,
January-May 2009

Health, Ankara, Turkey]

Abstract
--------
We present a preliminary report of 12 laboratory-confirmed cases of
haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Turkey, diagnosed
between January and May 2009 according to the clinical symptoms and
serological confirmation. Studies are still ongoing to better
understand the dynamics of the reservoir population as well as the
epidemiological characteristics and risk factors among humans.

Conclusion
----------
We confirmed 12 cases of HFRS reported in Turkey in 2009 using IFA
[immunofluorescent assay] and immunoblotting techniques. Our results
were serologically positive for Puumala subtype, but it should be
considered that among the subtypes of hantavirus, cross-reactivity is
frequently seen serologically. In addition, the generic hantavirus
RT-PCR was not positive; hence, sequence analyses have not been
performed. The reason for this might be that viraemia is very short
in hantavirus infections. Another limitation of the study was that
neutralisation tests have not been performed.

We found a 5.2 percent seroprevalence of hantavirus antibodies
amongst the healthy but at-risk population of one of the affected
provinces. These preliminary data show that the virus is circulating
in the area. Until now, asymptomatic or mild infections with
non-specific symptoms may have been the cause for the underestimation
of the real number of hantavirus infections. It is necessary to
finalise the statistical analysis of the seroepidemiological study to
plan further studies and surveys in Turkey. The plan is to inventory
the local rodent species, identify circulating hantavirus serotypes
in rodents, perform molecular characterisation of strains isolated
from rodents and humans and compare them with strains circulating in
the neighbouring countries, and investigate transmission mechanisms
and the time and space-distribution of human hantavirus infections.

Hantavirus causes a significant number of human illnesses, making it
a global public health threat. The presence of the virus in Turkey is
not surprising because it is circulating in the neighbouring
countries. In the affected area, a comprehensive preventive strategy
against hantavirus infection, including health education and
promotion activities, rodent control and surveillance, has been
implemented. For example, guidelines were distributed for public on
rodent proofing and trapping in and around homes, and the careful
disposal of dead rodents.

[The authors indicated that the IFA and immunoblotting techniques
they used indicated that the samples tested were serologically
positive for Puumala virus, but that cross-reactivity with other
hantaviruses could not be ruled out. In his 20 Apr 2009 communication
with ProMED-mail (archive no. 20090420.1495), Prof Heikki Henttonen
pointed out that "Dobrava virus in _Apodeus flavicollis_ is a
well-known severe pathogen in the Balkan region, and this rodent
species is common in Turkey. The severity of disease may suggest
Dobrava virus or a Dobrava-like virus. _Myodes glareolus_, the host
of Puumala virus, is found on the northern Black Sea coast in Turkey,
and, therefore, this virus is also a potential cause of the outbreak..."
