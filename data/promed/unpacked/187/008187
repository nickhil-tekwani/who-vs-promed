This host-specific parasite of freshwater fish was introduced into some
Norwegian river systems via infected fish in the early 1970's. It is some
0.5mm in diameter, is not native to Norway, and infests the skin & fins of
salmon, trout, and some other freshwater species. Infection is extremely
virulent for some strains of Atlantic salmon. After its introduction into a
river system, almost all the young salmon will die, and eventually most
susceptible fish species will disappear. While primarily a freshwater
parasite, it can live and breed in low salinity, brackish waters. It
quickly dies in sea water.
Infestations have spread to at least 40 Norwegian rivers thanks to the
release of infected fish stocks, by the transport of contaminated water,
and by the movements of naturally migrating infested fish in the brackish
water layers within the fjords. _G. salaris_ does not at this time occur in
the UK, but experimentally Scottish salmon are susceptible and are rapidly
killed by infections.
According to the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management (NDNM) the
only way to eradicate this parasite from infected rivers is to sacrifice
the host species. Without the latter the parasite quickly disappears. The
Norwegian method is to treat the infected rivers with rotenone. It is
extremely toxic to most fish species and some invertebrates, while snails
and freshwater mollusks are said to be only slightly affected. After so
treating an infected river, it is restocked with clean, artificially-raised
salmon and trout. By October 1997 23 rivers had been treated; 20
successfully.
The rotenone concentration used is low and does not present a risk to
humans, many other animals including otters (_Lutra lutra_) and piscivorous
birds. However it does inflict food shortages on fish-eating species.
Limited studies indicate that otters move away from treated rivers when the
prey-base was reduced. It is estimated by NDNM that there are some
10,000-15,000 otters in Norway; others give a lower number.
_G. salaris_ occurs naturally in the Baltic rivers of Finland and Russia,
and possibly in eastern Sweden, where the native fish, including Baltic
salmon, are tolerant of the parasite and are normally unaffected by it. The
parasite is very hardy and can be inadvertently introduced by fishermen. It
is capable of surviving for several days in damp conditions such as in
plastic bags, wet angling equipment (e.g. bags, waders, nets), and on the
wet skin of fish (e.g. bait fish). It has a direct life cycle and
reproduces quickly, so even a few surviving specimens present a real
hazard.
So what is an 'old' disease in one region, has the capacity to be a lethal
emerging disease in another. And as we have ecotourists, we also have
ecofishermen ...
