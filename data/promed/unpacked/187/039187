[Tick-borne encephalitis is an endemic disease in rural regions of
Russia and is a vaccine preventable disease. TBE illness is prevalent
during spring, summer and autumn, when ticks are most active and
present in greatest numbers. The prevalence of TBE is proportional to
the abundance of the tick vector.
