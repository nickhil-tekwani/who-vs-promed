In June 2004, potato plants of cvs. Bistra, Desiree, Discovery,
KIS94-1/5-14 and Psata, showing unusual virus-like symptoms, were
observed in a field in central Slovenia. Crops from different parts
of the country were planted in this field to compare the frequency
of virus infections. The symptoms were observed only on potatoes
originating from Rakican in northeastern Slovenia. Symptomatic plants
showed severe dwarfing, leaf curling and reduced leaf size; tubers
were very small and few in number. Brown spots were clearly visible
in cross-sections of tubers. Sap of symptomatic plants was used for
mechanical inoculation of test plants. Local and systemic symptoms
were observed on _Nicotiana benthamiana_, _N. clevelandii_, _N.
glutinosa_, _N. rustica_, _N. tabacum_, but only local lesions on
_Datura stramonium_. No symptoms were observed on _Chenopodium
quinoa_. Electron microscopy of negatively stained crude extracts
from symptomatic _N. benthamiana_, _N. clevelandii_ and _N!
. tabacum_ revealed numerous rhabdovirus-like particles.
During summer of 2003 tomato plants cv. Belle, showing unusual
symptoms of distinct chlorotic spots, wrinkles on fruits and narrow,
necrotic leaves, were observed in north-eastern Slovenia, about 16 km
from Rakican. Infected plants also showed size reduction, curling of
mature leaves, yellowing and chlorosis along the margins of younger
leaves. Electron microscopy of negatively stained crude extracts
revealed rhabdovirus-like particles. 3 weeks after mechanical
inoculation with extracts from symptomatic leaves, systemic yellowing
of veins and leaf curling was observed on _N. tabacum_ cv. White
Burley and necrotic spots, starting on the bases of the leaves on _N.
clevelandii_. These symptoms resembled those of the potato isolate.
Electron microscopy of crude sap extracts again revealed
rhabdovirus-like particles.
DAS-ELISA was used for confirmation of rhabdovirus infection of
potato, tomato, symptomatic _N. rustica_ infected with potato sap,
and symptomatic _N. tabacum_ cv. White Burley infected with tomato
sap. Antisera against Eggplant mottled dwarf virus (EMDV) and Potato
yellow dwarf virus (PYDV) were kindly supplied by Dr. S. Winter,
DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany. ELISA results confirmed infection of
tested plants with EMDV. No infections with PYDV were found. EMDV is
widespread in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East (Brunt et
al. 1996), and has recently been reported in mainland Spain
(Aramburu et al., 2005). To our knowledge this is the 1st report of
EMDV in Slovenia.

[A virus that is widespread in the Middle East has now been detected
in tomato and potato in Slovenia. It has previously been reported in
Bulgaria and Italy in pepper and cucumber and is known to infect
tobacco and cucumber in Greece and eggplant in Turkey. EMDV was
first reported in eggplant (_Solanum melongena_) in southern Italy in
1969. In addition to cucumber and pepper, the natural host range of
the virus includes black nightshade (_Solanum nigrum_), and _S.
sodomaeum_ that, in Morocco, may be a perennial source of infection.
The virus is transmitted by contact inoculation and grafting but not
by seed. It spreads in Algeria, Italy, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, and
the Canary Islands. The vector of ECMV is unknown, but because
percentage of infection is generally low, a polyphagous insect with
low vector specificity may be involved in transmission. Transmission
was achieved by the agallian leafhopper (_Agallia vorobjevi_) in a
study in Iran.
