New outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Northumberland -- 24 August
--------------------------------------
Three cows and their calves with clinical signs of foot and mouth disease
have been slaughtered on a farm near Hexham, Northumberland (county of
origin of the epidemic). This is the first evidence of the virus in that
county for nearly 3 months. Other animals on the farm, both cattle and
sheep, are also being slaughtered.
