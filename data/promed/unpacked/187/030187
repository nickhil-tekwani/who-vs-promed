The single bottle of carrot juice contaminated with botulism that paralyzed
2 patients was stored properly in their home, Toronto Public Health
confirmed yesterday, 13 Oct 2006.
"There was no evidence of lack of refrigeration by the cases," Dr. Barbara
Yaffe, Toronto Public Health associate medical officer, said. "Information
obtained from patient interviews regarding storage and transport of the
carrot juice did not confirm mishandling by the patients."
Bolthouse Farms in Bakersfield, California, told the Star that the carrot
juice could not have developed botulism if it was stored properly. "When
the product was on the market and it was properly refrigerated through the
distribution and sale it would be consumed safely," Bolthouse Farms
spokesperson Tim Warner said.
The USA's FDA and CDC launched an investigation of Bolthouse Farms after
the juice was voluntarily recalled by the company. Several bottles of the
company's carrot juice were tested for the toxin, Yaffe said, and all
bottles came back with negative results.
Following the recall, Toronto Public Health sent a sample of the carrot
juice that was left in the refrigerator to a lab in Ottawa, where it tested
positive for botulism on 7 Oct 2006, Yaffe said. The 2 Toronto patients,
who remain seriously ill in hospital, live together, and both ingested the
toxic carrot juice before falling ill, Yaffe confirmed.

[As mentioned in ProMED's last posting, this botulism outbreak takes on a
different perspective if the juice was stored appropriately throughout. -
