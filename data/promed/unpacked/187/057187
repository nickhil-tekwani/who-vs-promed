Officials at the San Francisco (CA) Department of Public Health announced today, 3 May 2013, that a local restaurant food handler was diagnosed with typhoid fever. The public health investigation is ongoing, but based on current information, health officials believe the infectious disease was acquired by the food handler during a trip outside of the USA.

Anyone who ate at the Nordstrom Cafe within the Nordstrom store in the Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco on 16, 17, 18, 20, or 27 Apr 2013 may be at risk. Health officials advise these individuals to see a healthcare provider right away if they start to experience symptoms such as fever, weakness, stomach pains, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite. In some cases a rash of flat, rose-colored spots may appear. Symptoms usually begin within 8 to 14 days after exposure, but could potentially appear for up to 30 days.

"Unfortunately, symptoms of typhoid fever can resemble other illnesses," said Tomas J. Aragon, MD, Health Officer for City & County of San Francisco. "Persons who are at risk because they dined at the Stonestown Nordstrom Cafe on one of those dates should see a healthcare provider right away if they are feeling unwell, and should tell their physician that they may have been exposed to typhoid fever. There is testing and effective treatment available. If you suspect you have typhoid fever, do not prepare food or drink for anyone and do not care for young children, hospitalized patients, or persons with weakened immune systems."

Typhoid fever is an illness caused by the bacterium _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi. Although death is uncommon, typhoid fever can be severe and life-threatening. In the USA, 300-400 cases of typhoid fever occur each year, and most of those are acquired during international travel. People are at risk of typhoid fever if they eat food or drink beverages that have been handled by someone who has typhoid fever, or if sewage contaminated with the bacteria gets into the water supply used for drinking or food preparation. Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it affects about 22 million people and causes about 200 000 deaths.

The only way to know if an illness is typhoid fever is by testing samples of stool, blood, and urine for the presence of _S._ Typhi. Typhoid fever can be successfully treated with appropriate antibiotics, and persons given antimicrobials usually begin to feel better within 2 to 3 days. Although untreated typhoid can potentially be fatal, deaths from typhoid fever are uncommon in the USA. However, persons with typhoid fever who do not get treatment can continue to have fever and feel unwell for weeks or months. Even if their symptoms go away, persons with typhoid fever may continue to pass typhoid bacteria to others, and so they should not handle food or care for children, hospitalized persons, or those with weakened immune systems until further testing proves that typhoid bacteria are gone from the body.

Nordstrom at Stonestown Galleria is cooperating with the Department of Public Health in the investigation to ensure that the public and their workers are informed and protected.

[Nordstrom is an upscale department store which could have been visited by visitors to the city. Clinicians should inquire regarding recent trips to SF when evaluating individuals with compatible symptoms.

The classical cluster of _S. typhi_ in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City of Oyster Bay, Long Island in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with Mary Mallon, "Typhoid Mary", an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier. A number of clusters have been reported in the USA in the 21st century including:

- New York City: In the summer of 2000, an outbreak of endemic typhoid fever involved 6 people in Queens, NY, and a 7th person in Manhattan, NY (boroughs of New York City). An investigation by the New York City Department of Health traced the likely source to an immigrant employee working at a local restaurant (1).

- Ohio: In August 2000, the Ohio Department of Health reported a cluster of men with typhoid fever who denied having traveled abroad. To determine the cause and the extent of the outbreak, an epidemiological investigation was initiated in which 7 people in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana with culture-confirmed _S._ Typhi infection and 2 people with probable typhoid fever were evaluated; all were men, and all but one reported having had sex with 1 asymptomatic male carrier (2).

- New York City: 2 cases of _S. typhi_ infections in 2005 were acquired domestically and linked to a chronic carrier Haitian traveler.

A more classical manifestation of both typhoid and typhus not generally discussed is the coma vigil or "typhoid state," which may also be found with a variety of potentially fatal infectious diseases, including smallpox, anthrax, plague, yellow fever, and miliary tuberculosis.

The "typhoid state" was reviewed historically, with quotations from William Osler, George Shattuck and Shakespeare, by Abraham Verghese (4). Verghese described it as a febrile state of semiconsciousness accompanied by a muttering delirium. Among the characteristic findings can be subsultus tendinum (the twitching of fingers and wrists), carphologia (picking at bedclothes), and floccillation (picking at imaginary objects).
