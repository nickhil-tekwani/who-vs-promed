Kenya says Rift Valley fever returns, 2 dead
--------------------------------------------
Rift Valley fever has killed 2 women in Kenya, the government said on Thu
20 Sep 2007, raising fears of another outbreak of the disease that claimed
more than 150 lives earlier this year.
Officials had first worried that the 2 women who died in Nakuru district, a
tourist hotspot, had [contracted] the Ebola virus, which broke out last
week [initially in April - Mod.CP] in the nearby Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
"This is not an Ebola outbreak, it is Rift Valley fever," government
spokesman Alfred Mutua told reporters in Nairobi. Transmitted to humans by
mosquito bites or close contact with contaminated animals, Rift Valley
fever can cause havoc in Kenya's important meat trade.
The movement of livestock was temporarily halted earlier this year [2007]
when the 1st outbreak spread from Kenya to Somalia and Tanzania, killing
more than 100 people in each country. In severe cases, the disease triggers
haemorrhaging in humans, causing the victim to vomit blood or bleed to
death. Outbreaks of the fever, named after the vast fissure running from
Syria down to Mozambique, are thought to be cyclical. A 1997-1998 outbreak
killed hundreds of Kenyans.

Disease probe starts
--------------------
Samples taken from 3 people who died of a mysterious disease in Molo have
been forwarded to Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) for analysis.
Rift Valley provincial medical officer [PMO], Dr John Odondi, said the
samples would be analysed to establish the cause of death. He said no new
cases have been reported.
"There are no new reports of people suffering from similar symptoms as the
deceased," Odondi said. Two women and a man, who died in the last 3 days in
Kuresoi and Sirikwa areas, complained of severe headaches, fever and
coughs. "We suspect these were isolated cases, but we have ruled out
Ebola," he said.
Speaking to The Standard in Nakuru, the PMO said they have directed
relatives of the 3 to bury them. This weekend [15-16 Sep 2007] 2 women
died, while a man succumbed to the mysterious illness on Monday 17 Sep
2997]. Odondi deployed inspectors to the affected areas after area MP, Mr
Moses Cheboi, told Parliament that 2 of his constituents had died of a
mysterious illness.
The Government on Wednesday [19 Sep 2007] ruled out that the disease could
be the deadly Ebola. Deputy Director of Medical Services, Dr Shahhanaaz
Shariff, said the mysterious disease could not be Ebola saying those who
died did not exhibit excessive bleeding.

[It is not absolutely clear that these 2 reports from the Reuters Africa
news agency and the Nairobi newspaper The Standard refer to the same 2
women. The place names are different (Molo, Kuresoi and Sirikwa), but the
description of the illness of the 2 deceased patients, reported in The
Standard newspaper, is compatible with a diagnosis of Rift Valley fever.
Clarification and laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis of Rift valley
fever in the Molo cases are awaited. - Mod.CP
