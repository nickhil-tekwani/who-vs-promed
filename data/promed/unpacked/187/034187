Apple growers fight fungal disease
----------------------------------
Apple growers in the Nelson region are fighting to control a fungal disease that they say has the potential to be as destructive as the PSA [_Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_] vine canker in kiwifruit [bacterial canker, see ProMED-mail post 20120304.1060778 for update].

The tree-killing disease European canker -- caused by a fungus -- has been found in the wetter parts of the North Island for years. But a run of wetter than normal seasons has sent infection rates skyrocketing in the Nelson area.

It has hit newer apple varieties such as Jazz and Envy, as well as new Royal Gala strains. Dwarf trees planted by some growers have also suffered heavy damage.

Simon Easton, Motueka Fruitgrowers Association, says growers have had to cut out thousands of trees and take other aggressive control measures. He says some growers are hoping that drier conditions last autumn slowed down the spread of the canker, but they won't know until spring when new leaf growth appears.

[European canker (also called nectria or apple canker) is caused by the fungus _Neonectria ditissima_ (previously _Nectria galligena_). The pathogen can also affect a range of other woody hosts, including fruit crops such as pear and walnut. Symptoms start as reddish-brown spots around wounds or leaf scars. Cankers develop as ring shaped cracks in the bark, which may appear swollen. Cankers girdling limbs or the trunk can lead to dieback of branches or death of the tree. Trees infected in the nursery exhibit poor growth and eventually die. A fruit rot caused by the fungus has also been reported in some apple growing regions. Infections are favoured by cool temperatures and moisture. Orchards with poor drainage are more at risk, and excessive vegetative growth makes trees more susceptible.

The fungus invades the host via injuries such as pruning wounds or leaf and fruit scars. Ragged pruning cuts and branch stubs increase the risk of cankers developing at these sites. Spores can be spread with water splash or wind, long distance spread occurs mostly with infected plant material (including twigs in fruit consignments) or nursery stock. Disease management may include cultural and phytosanitary measures (for example pathogen exclusion, removal of pathogen reservoirs such as alternative hosts or infected plant material), and pathogen free planting and grafting material. Fungicides have been reported to reduce the spread of cankers, but are not effective for curing existing infections.

European canker has been reported to cause large scale losses of apple and pear trees in Europe and North America. In Australia, the fungus was found in Tasmania in 1954 and a long term management programme was undertaken. In 1991, the pathogen was declared eradicated and Australia is currently worldwide the only region of commercial pome fruit production free of the disease.

Bark cankers on trunks or limbs of pome fruit and other trees can also be due to several other fungal or bacterial pathogens (see links below).
