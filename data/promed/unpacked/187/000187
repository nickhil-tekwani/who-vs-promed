Health officials on the South Pacific island nation are reporting an unspecified number of confirmed cases of the mosquito borne virus, Zika virus. This is the 1st time the island of Vanuatu has seen this disease.

Zika is a related virus to the more commonly known and more serious dengue fever virus.

This comes just weeks after Tropical Cyclone Pam hit Vanuatu on 14 Mar 2015.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus related to yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses; however, ZIKV produces a comparatively mild disease in humans. It was first isolated from an infected rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947.
It is relatively rare to see ZIKV outside of Africa and Asia. The virus is transmitted to humans via mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_.

Information regarding pathogenesis of ZIKV is scarce but mosquito-borne flaviviruses are thought to replicate initially in dendritic cells near the site of inoculation then spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream.

Symptoms may include a headache, a maculopapular rash covering the face, neck, trunk, and upper arms, which may spread to the palms and soles. Transient fever, malaise, and back pain may also develop.

In addition to the appearance of Zika virus on the island, mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue, and chikungunya are found in Vanuatu.

Vanuatu health officials have for the 1st time confirmed cases of the rare mosquito-borne Zika virus.

Zika is the "milder brother" of dengue fever, head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Vanuatu Jacob Kool said. The 2 illnesses share similar symptoms of fever, aching joints, and rash.

Although there were no recorded deaths from Zika [virus infections], health officials warned it can cause "very explosive outbreaks".

Like dengue fever, there is no cure for the Zika virus.

The WHO advises prevention through using mosquito nets, protective clothing and insect repellent, and removing breeding sites. Dr Kool told ABC's removing sites was "going to be very challenging" following the devastation caused by Cyclone Pam, which killed at least 11 people last month [March 2015]. "Breeding sites could be any cracked coconut, for example, and there's a lot of debris like that -- things that collect water where mosquitoes can breed," he said.

Zika was first discovered in 1947 in Rhesus Monkeys in Uganda's Zika forest. "Zika [virus] is a very strange story ... it had caused only about 20 known human cases until 2007, when there were suddenly 6000 cases on the island of Yap in the North Pacific," Dr Kool said.

The symptoms usually last 4-7 days. The mild symptoms and similarity to other illnesses may have been the reason for the low number of confirmed cases. "In hindsight, we think Zika [disease] has always been confused for dengue in many countries," Dr Kool said. "So Zika virus may have been around and always misdiagnosed for dengue."

In the aftermath of Cyclone Pam, medical teams reported several cases of pink eye to the WHO. "Pink eye, or red eye, is also a common symptom of Zika virus [infection]. So I wouldn't be surprised if those cases were [caused by] Zika virus as well," Dr Kool said.

[Zika virus transmission was active among the Pacific islands last year (2014). The 7 Mar 2014 edition of The Disease Daily (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140309.2322907) published a report on Zika virus, "highlighting current outbreaks on 15 different Polynesian islands including Tahiti and Bora Bora. More recently, according to local news reports and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, one confirmed and 40 suspected cases of the mosquito-borne virus were detected on Easter Island, also located in the [southeastern Pacific Ocean]."

The virus has appeared again in the Pacific, this time in Vanuatu Island. Zika virus is capable of causing explosive outbreaks such as the outbreak on Yapp in 2007 that resulted in 6000 cases in just a few short weeks. However, an outbreak of that extent is not expected on Vanuatu.
