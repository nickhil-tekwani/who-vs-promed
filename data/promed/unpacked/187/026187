[The etiology of this foodborne illness cluster in the Indian state of Odisha is unclear, as viral, bacterial endotoxin, bacterial infection, parasitic, and chemical etiologies can be present. The incubation time and presence or absence of fever can be helpful in the differential diagnosis.

Dahi bara is also known as dahi bhalla, thayir vadai, thairu vada, perugu vada, mosaru, dahi vada, and doi bora in various parts of India. It is prepared by soaking fried flour balls in thick yogurt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahi_vada).

Odisha is one of the 29 states of India, located in the east of India. It is surrounded by the states of West Bengal to the north-east, Jharkhand to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west and north-west, and Andhra Pradesh to the south and south-west and can be found on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha.
