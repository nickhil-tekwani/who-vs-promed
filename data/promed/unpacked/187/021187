Sylvan yellow fever in Brazil, 2007, 2008
-----------------------------------------
As of 25 Feb 2008, the epidemiological situation is that there have
been 59 notified suspected cases of sylvan yellow fever (YF). Of
these, 33 cases were confirmed, of which 17 were fatal (case fatality
rate of 52 percent). YF was ruled out in an additional 23 cases and 3
remain under investigation. The probable locations of acquisition of
sylvan YF [virus] infection were in forested areas in Goias, 61
percent of cases (20 of 33), Mato Grosso do Sul 18 percent (6 of 33),
Distrito Federal 15 percent (5 of 33), and Mato Grosso 6 percent (2
of 33).

The distribution of cases and deaths from sylvan YF by date of onset
of symptoms shows the 1st confirmed case on 16 Dec 2007 and the
latest suspected case on 14 Feb 2008.

Among the 33 confirmed cases of sylvan YF, 70 percent (23 of 33) are
males, with a mean age of 41 years, ranging from 15-69 years. Of
these, 91 percent (30 of 33) were proven unvaccinated and 9 percent
(3 of 33) had been vaccinated more than 10 years [previously].

Adverse events associated with the YF vaccine [administration]
--------------------------------------------------------------
From December 2007 until the present, the system for surveillance of
adverse events post-YF vaccination registered 52 occurrences of
suspected cases [of adverse reactions], all under investigation. Of
these, 23 patients were hospitalized. Of these [23], 7 were confirmed
as serious adverse events associated with the vaccine. Of these 7
events, one was classified as viscerotropic disease (involvement of
viscera by virus immunization) and died. The remaining 6 were
classified as systemic reactions to the vaccine, possibly
linked to a vaccine component, resulting in death.

Among the 16 adverse events not confirmed, 6 now have been discarded
and 10 cases are in the process of clinical investigation and
laboratory [testing].

All information on the hospitalized patients was analyzed by the
Adverse Events Advisory Committee on Post-Vaccination of the Ministry
of Health for classification of the events described above.

[Finally, we have an assessment of adverse events. If it really is
just one case of yellow fever [due to] immunization, the incidence
was low, and one would expect more cases, given the huge amount of
vaccine applied [recently in Brazil]. - Mod LJS

The YF cases in individuals vaccinated more than 10 years previously
underscore the prudence of the 10-year limit for revaccination.

[The data include information on 3 cases of YF with a history of
vaccination more than 10 years prior to onset of disease. As the YF
vaccine is a live virus vaccine, one might question the potency of
the earlier dose received. It would be interesting to know the year of
vaccination for the 3 "vaccine failures". Most live virus vaccines are
heat labile, so that if the vaccine is not kept at a specified
temperature range for the entire period encompassing production,
transportation/distribution to actual vaccine administration, there is
the real risk of the live virus being killed, thereby leading to a
loss of potency of the vaccine. The entire procedure of vaccine
storage at appropriate
temperatures is referred to as the cold chain. The likelihood of a
problem with cold chain more than 10 years ago is great, so that there
may be a significant number of individuals who were vaccinated with
non-potent vaccine.

An interesting study would be a serosurvey of individuals vaccinated
greater than 10 years ago and for those individuals with no detectable
antibodies, follow-up serosurveys to see the response to challenge
with vaccine, to determine if there is evidence of prior sensitization
with the antigen. - Mod.MPP]
