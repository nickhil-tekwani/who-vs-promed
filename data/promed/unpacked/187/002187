From: "Julie Rawlings" <Julie.Rawlings@tdh.state.tx.us>

Dengue has been confirmed in 2 Laredo residents; other suspect cases
are being investigated.
Dengue has also been reported from Nuevo Laredo on the Mexico
side of the border.
The Texas Department of Health Laboratory is using PCR to determine
which serotype(s) is/are circulating. DEN-3 has been detected in one
specimen to date.
Texas' last outbreak of dengue was in 1995 -- there were 29 cases,
mostly in travelers. However, there were 7 locally acquired cases in
residents of Cameron and Hidalgo Counties. DEN-2, -3, and -4 were
isolated from Texas patients.
In 1996 there were no locally acquired cases in Texas; in 1997
there were 3 locally acquired cases (Cameron and Hidalgo Co) and
in 1998 there was one locally acquired case (Cameron Co).

[We very much appreciate this report. It would be interesting to
have the dates of onset & travel histories also. It is not clear if
these are imported or locally-acquired cases.
Does any knowledgeable reader wish to stick her/his neck out and
forecast, given recent & projected weather conditions, whether this
presages an epidemic in Texas? - Mod.JW
