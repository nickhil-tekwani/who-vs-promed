Authorities are investigating another possible dog poisoning in northern Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources says a recent dog death in Forest County may be related to other animal poisonings in the area.

"The lab results are not in on the cause of death of the dog, but authorities suspect it may be related [to previous cases - Mod.TG]," reads a statement from DNR's Joanne Haas.

The dog's owners had been walking their German shepherd on a leash on public land in northern Forest County, near the Michigan border. The dog died on 1 Apr [2020]. The DNR says it is possible the dog ingested poison. The owners reported seeing dead ravens near the site.

The DNR wants the public to be aware and watch for possible dead wildlife as a sign.

"As the COVID-19 public health emergency is on, more people are practicing social distancing while walking outdoors with pets. The public is advised to use dog leashes and watch for signs -- such as dead wildlife -- that poison may be in the area," reads a statement from the DNR.

Again, lab tests are pending on the most recent case, but the DNR suspects the death to be related to other animal poisonings in northern Wisconsin.

In March [2020], the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported 2 confirmed poisonings of hunting beagles in Forest County.

The agency continues to investigate cases in Forest, Marinette, and Florence counties. They do not know if it has spread to other counties.

In addition to family pets, officials have discovered dead raptors, coyotes, weasels, raccoons, and wolves. Testing revealed the presence of "dangerous toxic substances" in all of these cases.

[Almost exactly a year ago, a similar situation occurred in Wisconsin. It was strychnine (see Undiagnosed poisoning - USA: (WI) dogs, wild animals 20190428.6445127). It is entirely possible this is a repeat.

There are no clinical signs listed here to provide a clue as to what these intoxications may be. Typical intoxication possibly affecting all these species is blue-green algae in the lake water; however, temperatures may be a little cool yet for the formation of blue-green algae.

Other possible toxins include things like strychnine, antifreeze, certain plants, and others. Avicides are not as likely, as they may cause the birds to fly into things and create avian mass hysteria, but they do not necessarily kill outright, especially mammals. While strychnine bait could easily kill mammals who eat it, only carrion birds, such as a raven or even a vulture, might be affected. Songbirds may not be affected. - Mod.TG
