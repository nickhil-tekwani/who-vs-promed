[2] Saudi Arabia, 2 new cases/fatal - MOH, 16 Feb 2016

As of 12 noon today [16 Feb 2016] a total of
1296 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported, including
554 fatalities,
740 recoveries, and
2 currently active cases [as of 16 Feb 2016]

Information on newly confirmed cases reported on 16 Feb 2016:
1 - a 75 year old non-healthcare worker Saudi male from Alkharj, who was reported as a fatality at the time of the initial confirmation report. This individual had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, and was reported to have had contact with camel(s) in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

2 - an 80 year old non-healthcare worker Saudi male from Alkharj, who was reported as a fatality at the time of the initial confirmation report. This individual had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. At the time of the report, possible transmission routes were currently under investigation although it was noted that he did not have a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

[In the past 48 hours, there have been 4 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, 2 of which were fatal. Of note, is that all 4 cases were from Riyadh province -- 2 were reported in Alkharj (located 77 miles [124 km] to the south of Riyadh city) and 2 were reported in Riyadh city. A question that arises is whether the 2 cases in Riyadh were exposed in Riyadh or perhaps in Alkharj and were then admitted to hospital in Riyadh. Any information on suspected location of transmission of these 2 cases would be greatly appreciated. If in fact they were potentially exposed in Alkharj, one begins to wonder if there is an ongoing outbreak of MERS-CoV infection in the camel population in Alkharj that might explain this increase in newly confirmed cases.

Another question that arises, is what is the working definition of a primary case? Both cases reported on 17 Feb 2016 were reported as primary cases, but neither case had a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Clarification of this would be greatly appreciated.

I have chosen to report the number of total cases as the total of the number of reported deaths, the number of reported recoveries, and the number of currently active cases, as that seems to be the safest manner to present this total. Given those criteria, the total number of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia is now at 1298.

In addition to the above newly confirmed cases, since the last MERS-CoV update on human cases, there has been an additional recovery reported on 13 Feb 2016 -- a 70 year old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Jeddah who was initially reported as a confirmed case on 2 Feb 2016 (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/Statistics-2016-02-13-001.aspx).

Maps showing the location of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths can be found with each MOH report at http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx.
