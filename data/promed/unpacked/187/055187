At least 40 children have died and hundreds have been admitted to hospitals
in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state in an outbreak of
[Coxsackievirus-associated] encephalitis, health authorities said on
Tuesday [25 Oct 2005]. More than 1000 people, mostly children, have died
also in the state since August 2005 from another form of the brain
inflammation known as Japanese encephalitis.

"40 children have died in the past few weeks due to human coxsackievirus
infection that leaves children with weeks of high fever, fits and
diarrhoea," said Dr. KP Kushwaha, Head of Paediatrics at the BRD Medical
College in the state's eastern Gorakhpur district. "In all, 400 children
stricken by human coxsackievirus infection have been admitted here. 10-15
children are being admitted every day."

Most of the Japanese encephalitis deaths have been recorded in the district
with 639 children dying at the BRD Medical College alone. Kushwaha told
Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa in a telephone interview that [whereas]
Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne viral disease, human
coxsackievirus infection is transmitted through contaminated water or food.
"Coxsackievirus encephalitis is different from Japanese encephalitis in
that its fever lasts longer and produces heart failure and other
complications," he said.

The virus is named after Coxsackie, a town in New York state, where it was
discovered. It [multiplies] in the human digestive tract and can spread
from person to person through unwashed hands. [Japanese] encephalitis,
which surfaces every year in Uttar Pradesh during and after the monsoon
season, can be prevented through vaccination [whereas coxsackievirus
infection cannot - Mod.CP].

[The human coxsackieviruses are a diverse group of enteroviruses, not all
of which have been associated with encephalitis. They are not related to
Japanese encephalitis virus, which is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus.
There are 9 serologically distinct human coxsackieviruses, which together
with human enterovirus 71, comprise the _Human enterovirrus A_ species, and
another 5 classified as members of the _Human enterovirus B_ species.
Several, but not all, human coxsackievirus have been associated with
encephalitis; these include human coxsackievirus A9, B3, B5, and B6. But
other enteroviruses including poliovirus and several echoviruses can be
responsible for encephalitis. Further information would be appreciated
concerning the specific coxsackievirus involved in this outbreak. - Mod.CP]
