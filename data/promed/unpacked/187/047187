OIE Disease Information: 20 May 2005; Vol. 18 - No. 20
---------------------------------------------------
(ICA), Bogota:
End of previous report period: 21 Apr 2005 (see Disease Information, 18
[16], 111, dated 22 Apr 2005). End of this report period: 13 May 2005.
Precise identification of agent: foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus
serotype A24 Cruzeiro. PANAFTOSA(1) characterised the virus using the
molecular method and found that the isolate showed a high level of homology
with the PANAFTOSA 'A24 Cruzeiro' reference strain (matching of 638
nucleotides out of 639 nucleotides analysed).
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: from the results obtained at
PANAFTOSA it can be assumed that the outbreak was caused by a laboratory
virus strain. As a result of laboratory testing and the epidemiological
investigations carried out around the outbreak and in in-contact farms, the
likelihood of a field origin has been ruled out.
Strict disinfection and quarantine measures were maintained for 2 months.
Details of outbreak (updated data):
Date of start of the outbreak
Species / Animals in the outbreak / susceptible cases / deaths / destroyed
/ slaughtered
25 Feb 2005
bov / 41 / 16* / 0 / 17** / 0
ov+cap / 39 / 5*** / 0 / 5 / 0
* 1 clinical case and 15 animals that tested positive using an I-ELISA
3ABC-EITB(2).
** Including 1 in-contact animal.
*** Sheep that tested positive using VIAA(3) immunodiffusion.
During the outbreak, only one animal presented clinical signs of FMD.
All the animals on the farm where the clinical case occurred underwent 3
rounds of serological testing: I-ELISA 3ABC-EITB(1) for cattle and VIAA(2)
immunodiffusion for sheep and goats. A total of 15 cattle and 5 sheep
tested positive. They, the clinically bovine and one in-contact bovine were
killed and destroyed by incineration.
4 sentinel animals (young unvaccinated cattle that tested negative to the
initial test using the I-ELISA 3ABC-EITB system) were kept inside the
affected farm in order to corroborate that the FMD outbreak had been fully
eradicated. The 3 sets of samples, taken at intervals of 9 days, yielded
negative results to the test.
The measures applied are those recommended for endemic areas.
(1) PANAFTOSA: Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center, Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil (OIE Reference Laboratory for FMD)
(2) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. EITB: enzyme-linked
immunoelectrotransfer blot
(3) VIAA: virus infection-associated antigen

[So far information on how this virus got from the laboratory to this
university farm in Bogota has not been revealed, though obviously -- from
the wording of the ICA report to Paris -- it is probably known. Fortunately
it travelled but a short distance. One can hope that the ICA authorities
will disclose what they know so that their lessons can be shared in these
dangerous times. - Mod.MHJ]
