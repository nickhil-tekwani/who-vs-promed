[1] Mushroom poisoning - Ukraine (Melitopol)

Mushroom poisoning -- (18 cases during a week) -- Ukraine (Melitopol)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Five people were hospitalized on 17 Oct 2009, soon after they had
eaten roast mushrooms. The symptoms of poisoning developed quite
fast, only 1.5 hours after the meal. All were admitted in a serious
condition. Currently they all are out of danger and have been
transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU) to an ordinary ward,
the doctors say.

The mushrooms that caused this poisoning were bought from a near road
trader on the way back from Crimea a month ago. The buyer stored the
mushrooms in the freezer of his apartment. The specialists think that
these mushrooms are definitively the cause of this outbreak but they
cannot take a sample for testing because everyone from that apartment
are in the hospital now.

There were 12 mushroom poisoning cases in Melitopol last year after 3
years without any poisoning cases.

The mother of a family got mushroom poisoning in Jitomir
--------------------------------------------------------
The 19th case of mushroom poisoning registered in Jitomir recently
from self gathered mushrooms. The Ministry of Emergency Situations
reports that the woman became of the victim of a "silent" haunt after
mushrooms in the forest. She is from the village Gladkovichi of
Ovruchskiy rayon and known to be an experienced mushroom picker.

She was admitted to the hospital on 16 Oct 2009 and considers that
mushrooms she gathered were of good quality and edible. However, she
cannot explain the poisoning otherwise. The doctors hope that this
will be her last mushroom poisoning.

Out of 19 mushroom poisoning cases in Jitomir a child died this year
[2009]. The Press Service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations
reports that there was only 1 mushroom poisoning case in Jitomir in 2008.

[Most of these case reports do not give us enough information to
understand what mushroom could be involved. One of the case reports
mentioned "Death Cap." It is a particular mushroom and is usually
_Amanita phalloides_. The toxic death cap mushroom resembles the
straw mushroom, a very desirable edible mushroom. And as one of these
reports indicates, even experienced mushroom hunters can and do make
mistakes. The similarity of these edible and non-edible fungus bodies
is remarkable. - Mod.TG]
