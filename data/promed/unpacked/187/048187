Bahamas: Bird Die-Off: Seagulls
------------------------------------
Reports surfaced on Monday [18 Jun 2007] that dozens of seagulls were
found dead in waters near Sweetings Cay and on nesting grounds near
Lightbourne Cay. Both Cays are located near Grand Bahama Island.
Witnesses reported that the birds did not show signs of trauma.
On Tuesday [19 Jun 2007], the Bahamas Department of Environmental
Health Services (DEHS) confirmed receiving reports of the incident.
DEHS has neither seen nor collected the birds, but has reported the
information to the Department of Agriculture. DEHS chief public
analyst asks the public to immediately report any additional dead
bird sightings. He notes that there have been similar dead bird
reports in previous years. The source reports that it attempted to
contact the Director of Agriculture in New Providence but could not
reach him for comment. No further information was provided.
An additional witness contacted the source on Wednesday [20 Jun 2007]
and reported a dead seagull that was floating in the Lucayan waterway.

Certainly we hope the birds are collected and properly necropsied with
appropriate testing conducted. It is possible if no other types of
birds are affected it may be a starvation condition related to adverse
weather conditions. However, unlike shearwaters, which have also been
dying, but feed far out in the ocean, seagulls feed coastally & inland
as well, so are unlikely to starve. It is disappointing to note that
the mass seagull die-offs previously reported on ProMED -- see refs.
below -- were never, as far as we know, resolved. - Mod.TG/JW]
