News Release -- Anthrax
-----------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed in South Dakota livestock for the 1st time this year [2014]. State Veterinarian Dr. Dustin Oedekoven has confirmed that a herd of unvaccinated bison in Dewey County was found to be infected on 31 Jul 2014.

Anthrax is a very serious disease of livestock because it may cause the rapid loss of a large number of animals with in a very short time. Affected animals are often found dead with no prior illness detected. Strict enforcement of quarantines and proper burning and burying of carcasses from livestock suspected to have died from anthrax is important to prevent further soil contamination with the bacterial spores.

Dr Oedekoven reports that anthrax spores survive indefinitely in contaminated soil and that much of South Dakota has the potential of experiencing an outbreak. Significant climate change, such as drought, floods and winds, can expose anthrax spores to grazing livestock.

Alkaline soils, high humidity and high temperatures present conditions for anthrax spores to vegetate and become infectious to grazing livestock.

Producers across the state should consult their veterinarians and vaccinate livestock, if deemed appropriate. Dr. Oedekoven advises livestock producers in the Dewey County area to continue to annually vaccinate cattle and other livestock for the next several years.

[Dewey County is in the central north part of South Dakota, north of Pierre; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/southdakota_90.jpg.

Plains bison form large herds made of individual mobs of related females and their calves. Because of the density of animals, especially as we are going into the breeding season, this outbreak will get much worse before it gets better. If you have the reinforced facilities and strong corrals, and trained staff, it is possible to vaccinate plains bison against anthrax. For example, this has been done for a number of years now on the Flying D Ranch in Montana with great efficiency. Anthrax is very sporadic in South Dakota, so it is not unexpected that these bison were not vaccinated, unfortunately. - Mod.MHJ
