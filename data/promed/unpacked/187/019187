The Washington State Department of Agriculture has reported that an unvaccinated horse from Mesa, in Franklin County, has contracted West Nile virus (WNV), the 1st equine case in that state this year [2014]. The horse is showing progressive neurologic signs, including hind end paralysis. It was not immediately known if the horse had traveled outside of the state recently.

The state veterinarian's office received the positive test result from the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Pullman on 19 Aug 2014. On Monday [18 Aug 2014], the state Department of Health reported a Walla Walla County man as the 1st Washington resident in 2014 known to have been infected with West
Nile virus in that state.

Acting State Veterinarian Paul Kohrs, DVM, noted Washington had 2 confirmed cases of horses with West Nile virus last year [2013], including a horse in Pasco and one in Outlook in Yakima County. Oregon had 6 equine cases and Idaho recorded 10 cases last year.

A viral disease, WNV is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional drowsiness; propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia (incoordination). Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

Kohrs recommends spring as the best time to vaccinate horses against WNV or obtain booster shots. Besides vaccination, horse owners can take steps to limit horse exposure to mosquitoes. For example, reduce or eliminate sources of stagnant or standing water, stable horses during peak mosquito periods (dawn and dusk), use equine-approved mosquito repellants, place fans inside barns or stalls to maintain air movement, and avoid using incandescent bulbs inside stables at night.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted disease that affects humans and other mammals. The virus' natural life cycle involves mosquitoes and birds. The cycle starts with infected birds which can travel long distances in a short amount of time. When a mosquito bites a bird carrying WNV, the mosquito then becomes infected. This infected mosquito then feeds on another bird, a horse, human or other mammal, which then becomes infected with WNV. Once a horse has been bitten, it may take only 5 to 15 days for signs of WNV to appear. Horse-to-horse transmission does not occur. The virus is most prevalent from May to October when mosquitoes are most abundant.

WNV established itself in the United States in 1999 and spread fast. In 1999, WNV appeared in New York for the 1st time in the Western Hemisphere and caused disease and some deaths in humans, birds and animals including horses. Previously, WNV was only reported in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe. In 1999, WNV primarily affected New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

The most common signs of WNV infection in horses include stumbling, uncoordination, weak limbs, partial paralysis, muscle twitching and in some cases, death. Fever has occurred in less than 1/4th of all confirmed equine cases.

From 1999 to present various clinical signs of WNV have been observed. Each horse may exhibit any combination of these symptoms, which include:

- Muzzle tremors. The muzzle will twitch sometimes for hours, sometimes for days. There will be no apparent reason for it -- no flies. Just a constant twitch.
- Muscle twitching. The horse looks like he is trying to get flies off his body.
- Behavior. Depression is common. Hyper-responsiveness such as flinging around a stall, and other anxieties. Sweating has been noted, but does not always occur.
- Head pressing, aimless wandering or circling,
- Facial paralysis. On one or both sides of face. The right ear may droop but the left ear stand up.
- The muzzle may be paralyzed on just one side or both sides so that the lips won't seal and the horse is constantly drooling.
- Vertigo/balance problems. The horse may actually lean on a wall to stand up. He stumbles a lot and is uncoordinated.
- Tongue paralysis. The tongue may lop out of the mouth. The horse doesn't seem to be able to pull its own tongue back into the mouth. And in some advanced cases, the tongue has to be pushed back into the mouth but if the muzzle is paralyzed, the tongue will just drop back out.
- Weak. Stiff walking. Tired.
- Impaired vision
- Convulsions
- Collapse. Usually in advanced cases. With some the horse will fall to its front legs as if praying and can't get up. In others, the horse may just sit down and may be unable to stand on the back legs. He'll dog sit. If collapse is on all 4 legs, this case probably won't make it because the horse can't stand on his own and these are the most difficult cases to care for.

Animals may show clinical signs in as few as 5 days or up to 15 days following a mosquito bite.

Treatment is vital for any horse with WNV. At the present time there is no specific "medicine" for a horse once he develops WNV, although there are some promising advances being made in that area.

However, your veterinarian will be able to provide supportive therapy that can save your horse's life if he does develop WNV.

For advanced cases, horses usually have to be hospitalized. For mild cases, home care may be adequate. But regardless, nursing care and treatment is important to the recovery process and each animal is assessed according to its age and health. And in cases of WNV, 33 percent will die, 50 percent will fully recover and 17 percent will have "problem recoveries" -- relapse or incomplete recovery.

Over the last few years, it has also been discovered that of those horses that recover, some will relapse within a few months or a year. Some of these will die also.

The focus of therapy is to decrease brain inflammation:

1) Treat the fever (if any), and provide supportive care, which may require 1-4 weeks of intermittent therapy. Common medications include flunixin meglumine (Banamine), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and dexamethasone.

2) Sometimes fluid therapy is needed for animals not able to drink.

3) Oral or intravenous feeding may also be necessary for horses unwilling to eat.

4) For horses unable to rise slinging is recommended 2 to 3 times per day to aid in circulation and to try to prevent pressure point sores (bed sores).

5) Head and leg protection is also frequently needed.

Recovery times depend upon the health and age of the affected horse. Many horses will improve within 5 to 7 days of displaying clinical signs; however, about 20-30 percent can exhibit severe neurological deficits for several weeks. After 3 to 5 days, horses that are recovering may exhibit a sudden recurrence of clinical signs. This may be of short duration or horses may become suddenly recumbent and either die or require prolonged treatment. If horse has clinical signs that last a long time, intravenous catheterization or hospitalization is recommended.

Horses with WNV sometimes develop other problems because they were weakened by WNV. Joint and tendon infections, sheath infections, pneumonia, and diarrhea can all occur as secondary events. Monitoring for appropriate fecal output is also important and horses may need to be treated with mineral oil during the course of disease.
