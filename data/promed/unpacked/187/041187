[According to the Palestinian Autonomous Territories' [PAT] annual OIE report for 2008, one LSD outbreak was reported during October 2008 in the West Bank; this related to a group of 10 susceptible cattle, of which one got infected (no death/culling/slaughter). Reportedly, 902 cattle were "ring vaccinated". No immediate notification about the said outbreak was submitted at the time, hence no further details, including the outbreak's exact location, are available. It may be assumed that the case was recorded in the southern part of the West Bank (Hebron sub-district?), adjacent to Israel's outbreak of 2007 (originating in Egypt through the Gaza strip; see postings 20071210.3982 and 20070613.1936). For geography, as well as for the locations of the current outbreaks, see the interactive map at the source URL.

The total number of cattle (mainly beef cattle) in the PAT is about 30 000. Their preventive vaccination is anticipated.

LSD, most probably originating in Syria/Lebanon, has been spreading since July 2012 from the north Golan in a southwesterly direction. Lebanon later notified the OIE about the presence of the disease within its territory; information from Syria is pending.

A map showing the accumulated distribution of LSD throughout northern Israel as of 13 Feb 2013 is available at http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/B1C817DD-2313-456D-8DD8-33DEB2B3A82B/0/kateret_or_20122013.pdf. Green dots stand for beef herds, white dots for dairy farms. As can be seen, the disease has reached dairy farms adjacent to the northern demarcation line between Israel and PAT's West Bank (Jenin subdistrict) and is now continuing southwards into the West Bank. - Mod.AS
