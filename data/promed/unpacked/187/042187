[Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) of the genus _Avulavirus_ belonging to the family _Paramyxoviridae_. There are 10 serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses designated APMV-I to APMV-10.

ND virus (NDV) has been shown to be able to infect over 200 species of birds, but the severity of disease produced varies with both host and strain of virus. The terms "birds" for species, and "poultry", applied in the OIE notification above, will gain by added specification. "Poultry" is defined in OIE's Terrestrial Code as "all domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose." It may be assumed that chickens (_Gallus gallus domesticus_) are the bird species affected in the outbreak described.

Velogenic strains of APMV-1 can cause conjunctivitis in humans, usually when the person has been exposed to large quantities of virus. Laboratory workers and vaccination teams are affected most often. Poultry workers are rarely infected, and handling or consuming poultry products does not appear to be a risk. The conjunctivitis usually resolves rapidly without treatment, but APMV-1 is shed in the ocular discharges for 4 to 7 days. All direct or indirect contact with birds should be avoided during this time. - Mod.AS]
