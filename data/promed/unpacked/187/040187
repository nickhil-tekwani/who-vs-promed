Tickborne encephalitis - Russia (Sverdlovsk Oblast)
---------------------------------------------------
Two residents of the Sverdlovsk Oblast [region], aged 49 and 71, have
died from tickborne encephalitis (TBE) during the week according to
the regional division of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer
Protection and Human Welfare]. Both cases had not been immunized
against TBE and did not receive emergency serum therapy. They remained
in an intensive care unit with assisted ventilation for one month but
recovered.

Since the beginning of the TBE season 42 488 people have sought
medical treatment following tick bites. This is 73.8 per cent more
than the average annual figure and 45.2 per cent more than the 2010
total.

So far 10 124 people have received full TBE immunization. So far in
2011 there have been 492 suspected TBE cases of which 19 were
confirmed by laboratory analysis. This is 10 per cent more than in
2010.

[Tickborne encephalitis is now a vaccine preventable disease. It is
caused by closely related but distinct flaviviruses. 3 subtypes are
recognised by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy: a
far-eastern subtype, a Siberian subtype, and a European subtype. The
Siberian subtype is associated with Russian spring-summer encephalitis
and is transmitted predominantly by the tick _Ixodes persulcatus_ (see
images at http://blass.com.au/definitions/ixodes%20persulcatus),
whereas the European subtype causes central European encephalitis and
is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_ (see images at
http://blass.com.au/definitions/ixodes%20ricinus). The former causes
the more serious disease, with mortality that can reach 25 per cent,
whereas mortality in the case of the latter seldom reaches 5 per cent.
Effective vaccines are now available against each subtype.

Sverdlovsk Oblast [region] is located in the Urals Federal District,
on the Eastern slopes of the Middle and North Urals and the Western
Siberian Plain. The highest mountains in the area are part of the
North Urals. Principal rivers include the Tavda, the Tura, the
Chusovaya, and the Ufa. The Sverdlovsk region borders on Perm Krai,
Komi Republic, Khanti-Mansiisk Autonomous Okrug, Tyumen Oblast, Kurgan
and Chelyabinsk Oblasts, and the Republic of Bashkortostan.
