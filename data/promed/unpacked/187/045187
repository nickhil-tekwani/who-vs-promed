Pig deaths in N China province confirmed to be caused by blue-ear disease
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The death of 1056 pigs in Hongdong County in north China's Shanxi Province
was caused by blue-ear disease, local authorities said on Monday [9 Feb
2009]. According to an official with the provincial agricultural bureau,
who declined to be identified, experts went to the scene Saturday [7 Feb
2009] to conduct autopsies. The lab of the Shanxi provincial center for
animal disease control and prevention reached its diagnosis on Monday.

More than 1000 pigs were found dead in Wan'an Township, Hongdong. The
animals belonged to 65 households in 10 villages. About 80 per cent of the
dead animals were less than one month old, said Qiao Yongsheng, deputy head
of Hongdong County.

A thorough inspection was carried out in the county. According to Wang
Zhijian, vice director of the Hongdong public security bureau, so far 637
pigs had been buried and 25 burned.

In 7 slaughterhouses around the county, 30 sick pigs were found, said Jing
Beiji, head of the Hongdong bureau of commerce.

[Earlier press reports mentioned the possible involvement of
eperythrozoonosis as an etiological factor in the described outbreak; see
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/09/content_10784480.htm>.

Blue-ear disease is one of the 1st names given to an infectious, viral
disease causing epizootics of a respiratory and reproductive syndrome
including abortions in domestic pigs. Other names were "mystery swine
disease" and "porcine epidemic abortion and respiratory syndrome" (PEARS),
eventually becoming "porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome" (PRRS).

PRRS is a severe viral disease in pigs, causing great economic losses
worldwide each year. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus, a virus
currently classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family
_Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_. The primary target cell of the virus
is the alveolar macrophage of the pig. Two major antigenic types of the
virus exist, the European and the American type. The virus is primarily
transmitted via infected pigs but also by faeces, urine, semen, and fomites.

PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world; it is
an OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) notifiable disease.

China has been suffering extensive outbreaks of the disease with very high
economic losses since the beginning of 2006. The disease was initially
named "swine high fever disease" until it was, eventually, diagnosed as
PRRS; a detailed description of the Chinese outbreak and its diagnosis is
available in the following source (Tian K, Yu X, Zhao T, Feng Y, Cao Z, et
al. Emergence of fatal PRRSV variants: unparalleled outbreaks of atypical
PRRS in China and molecular dissection of the unique hallmark. PLoS ONE
2007; 2(6): e526
<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1885284>).

In general, PRRS is characterised by reproductive failure of sows and
respiratory distress of piglets and growing pigs. In young piglets, high
mortality rates will occur and at the peak of an outbreak, losses from
death may reach 60-70 per cent.

According to the information available in OIE's WAHID (World Animal Health
Information Database) interface, the Chinese epizootic of PRRS is
"continuing"; the last follow-up report was submitted on 7 Aug 2007. See,
with map of outbreaks,
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5387>.

A formal confirmation (or otherwise) of the media-derived diagnosis and an
updated follow-up report with information on the evolvement of PRRS in
China since the previous report would be useful.

The disease spread to Viet Nam in 2007, and was reported there again in
2008. - Mod.AS]
