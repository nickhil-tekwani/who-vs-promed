EXPORT OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
==========================================
Date: Wednesday, 14 May 1997
From: Jim Petterson <jpetterson@usda.gov>

Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman today announced the opening of
export markets to Chile and China for California agricultural
products worth an estimated $60 million.
"After several intense negotiations, USDA has secured the export
of California kiwis, grapes, and lemons to Chile and grapes to
China," said Glickman. "We have been working hard to facilitate
the trade of these products and to assure both Chile and China
that there is no threat of pests and diseases."
Chile's Ministry of Agriculture has agreed to allow the
importation of kiwis, grapes, grapefruits, lemons, and oranges as
long as USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service can
certify the products are free of pests such as the Mediterranean
fruit fly and diseases such as citrus canker. California
producers can begin exporting these products immediately.
Industry anticipates the opening of these markets to be
worth $10 million.
Grapes from Fresno, Kern, Tulare, and Madera Counties in
California also can be exported to China as soon as the first
shipments are ready in mid- to late-July. This market is
expected to be worth roughly $50 million within a few years.
The opening of Chile and China's markets to these California
products follows an April 25 USDA announcement that California
tomatoes can now be exported to Japan--a market previously closed
for 46 years to fresh tomatoes. The lifting of Japan's ban is
expected to be worth $50 million.
"This administration is very committed to expanding U.S.
agricultural trade markets," said Glickman. "Efforts like this
bring us even closer to our goal of doubling U.S. agricultural
exports by the year 2000."
"We are pleased to note this progress in expanding access for
U.S. horticultural exports to Chile and China," said Michael
Dunn, assistant secretary for marketing and regulatory programs.
"The United States has formal understandings with both countries
that place these products--as well as others that cannot be
imported yet--in a group whose technical import requirements
will be reviewed and eased as soon as possible. The opening of
Chile and China's markets to these horticultural products offers
exciting new opportunities to a booming export sector for U.S.
agriculture."
