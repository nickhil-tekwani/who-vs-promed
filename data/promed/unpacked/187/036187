Viral hemorrhagic disease in Utah
---------------------------------
A telephone call from the Utah state diagnostic laboratory today informed
me of a confirmed case of viral hemorrhagic disease in a rabbitry in the
state. The diagnosis has been confirmed by testing at Plum Island.
Preliminary epidemiological work does not indicate a likely source. This
seems to be mirroring the previous outbreak in Iowa, for which no source
was ever determined. Tracing the movement of rabbits from the affected farm
is continuing.

Emergency management warning: rabbit calicivirus disease
--------------------------------------
Rabbit calicivirus disease (also known as viral hemorrhagic disease of
rabbits) has been identified in a rabbitry of about 750 rabbits in Utah
County, Utah. The owners have lost about 65 rabbits. The premises is
quarantined, and animal movements into and out of the premises [are being
traced.
Trace outs were found in Montana and Illinois. The Utah origin rabbits
remained on the Montana premises. Two other rabbits from the Montana
premises were destined for slaughter via a tractortrailer containing about
3600 rabbits. Movement restrictions were placed on the truck in Idaho. The
premises in Illinois is also under quarantine and no further movement of
rabbits has been identified from that premises; that owner has lost about
20 rabbits.
There is still no information on the source of the virus introduction. All
trace outs from the initial Utah premises are complete. Rabbits were sent
to only three other premises -- in Utah, Montana, and Illinois. Montana
traced the movement of rabbits from the premises that received the Utah
rabbits. Two other rabbits from that Montana premises, on route to the
truck for slaughter, were [in contact with rabbits destined for the
Montana state fair. The rabbits at the state fair were quarantined by the
state veterinarian.
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), veterinary
services, and the state departments of agriculture of Utah, Montana, Idaho,
and Illinois are working together to address the situation. Veterinary
services will assist the affected states in the depopulation and cleaning
and disinfecting of the premises. They also will investigate reports of
suspected rabbit calicivirus disease as part of the foreign animal disease
surveillance program and will continue to diagnose suspected cases at the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL).
A fact sheet and questions and answers are posted on the APHIS website:
.
The Utah State laboratory submitted samples to Plum Island on August 15.
Rabbit calicivirus disease or toxic hepatopathy was suspected on the basis
of the clinical history and microscopic lesions in the liver. On 17 Aug,
hemagglutination tests and electron microscopy carried out by FADDL
confirmed the diagnosis. The state and federal offices were notified and
foreign animal disease investigations began immediately. Epidemiological
information is being collected and additional samples are being sent to FADDL.
Rabbit calicivirus was first reported in 1984 in the People's Republic of
China. The first report of the virus in the western hemisphere was in
Mexico City in 1988. Mexico was successful in eradicating the virus. Rabbit
calicivirus disease is a highly infectious viral disease of the European
rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). This is the species from which all
domestic and commercial rabbits in the United States are derived. Rabbits
native to North America (cottontail rabbits and jack rabbits) do not
develop clinical disease and are not susceptible to rabbit calicivirus.
Humans and other mammals are not affected by the rabbit calicivirus.
Rabbit calicivirus is a highly contagious virus that can be transmitted by
direct contact with infected rabbits or indirectly by contact with objects
contaminated with virus. The virus damages the liver, intestines, and
lymphatic tissue and causes terminal blood clots. Infected rabbits die
within 6 to 24 hours of the onset of a fever, with few clinical signs.

[Checking records of the Office International des Epizooties records: "19
June 2000, Dr Alfonso Torres, deputy administrator, Veterinary Services,
United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC: End of previous
report period: 10 April 2000 (see Disease Information, 13 [14, 55, dated
14 April 2000). End of this report period: 13 June 2000. The investigation
of rabbit haemorrhagic disease in Crawford County, Iowa, was considered
closed as of 12 May 2000. An extensive epidemiological investigation failed
to determine how the rabbits became infected. No new cases of rabbit
calicivirus disease have been reported." Otherwise it has only been
reported from Cuba in the Americas. Mod.MHJ
