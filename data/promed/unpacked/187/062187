Abstract
----------
Members of the Simbu serogroup are arboviruses that are mainly transmitted by _Culicoides_. Akabane and Shuni viruses, 2 members of the Simbu serogroup, have been isolated from congenitally malformed ruminants in Israel. A recent serosurvey revealed that Israeli ruminants have been exposed to several additional Simbu viruses, including _Shamonda_ and _Sathuperi_, that seem to be circulating in Israel.

In April 2017, an apparently healthy one-month-old male calf was transferred to the Kimron Veterinary Institute. A few days later, the calf was reported to be slow to respond to its surroundings and was not able to feed on its own. Blindness was observed upon clinical examination. RNA of the small, medium and large segments of Simbu serogroup viruses were amplified and sequenced from the testis tissues and from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). During post-mortem examination, hydranencephaly was defined. Phylogenetic analysis of all 3 segments of Simbu serogroup viruses showed that the sequences detected in the Israeli calf were virtually identical to Peaton virus (PEAV).

PEAV was also detected in 2 pools of _Culicoides imicola_ trapped at 2 different locations in Israel. This is the 1st genomic detection of PEAV outside Australia and Japan. These results are of epidemiological significance, as they demonstrate that PEAV is circulating in Israel and affects cattle. Consequently, these results are also of relevance to a potential spread of Simbu serogroup viruses into Europe.

[Two members of the Simbu serogroup in the genus _Orthobunyavirus_ are known to have caused large-scale outbreaks of arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly [A-H] in domestic ruminants during recent decades: Akabane virus in Australia, Japan, Israel and Kenya, and Schmallenberg virus in Europe (Germany, Benelux countries, France and several other countries in northern and central Europe). These viruses are arthropod-borne. The potential of other viruses in the Simbu serogroup to infect pregnant ruminants and cause congenital changes in their offspring is yet to be determined for each of them.

The identification of the causative agent of the large-scale A-H event in Israel, during the early 1970s, became feasible when a similar syndrome was diagnosed in Japan, incriminating the Akabane virus as the causative agent. The Israeli investigators at the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI) benefitted from the experience and cooperation of their Japanese counterparts at the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH); see 20160417.4165684.

The continuous cooperation between the KVI (Israel) and NIAH (Japan) has been indispensable, contributing to the current findings. - Mod.AS
