The death of an 8-year-old child of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Sivasagar district [upper Assam state] on Friday [10 Jun 2015] has raised concerns about the rise in JE and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases with the onset of the rainy season.

Till June this year [2016], 5 people have already died of JE. Nalbari district accounts for 3 of the deaths, while Dibrugarh accounts for one. Sivasagar district alone has reported 6 JE-positive cases so far.

Last year [2015], the maximum number of JE-positive cases were reported from upper Assam districts, all of which are prone to floods. A total of 565 JE cases was reported from Assam last year and 132 of them proved fatal.

JE experts said mosquitoes breed more during the rainy season and consequently, vector-borne diseases spread rapidly during the months of June to August. "Temperature and rainfall are associated with the density of mosquitoes and occurrence of JE. Floods wash away the breeding grounds of mosquitoes, but JE cases could rise if the water stagnates," said a researcher.

The ambitious JE vaccination programme for children, which was launched in 11 districts a couple of years ago, has also taken a hit. Thanks to lack of awareness, many did not bother to immunize themselves against JE. "The situation is not alarming yet, but we are working towards continuation of awareness programmes," said Rathindra Bhuyan, director of health services.

"We are trying to fight against JE and AES through measures like fogging in affected areas," said Dibrugarh DC Manivannan.

[JE virus is endemic in northeastern India, including Assam, where the JE virus transmission season is beginning. Fogging is not an effective long-term approach to JE prevention -- vaccination is. The report above indicates that all the cases mentioned are JE, with just a brief mention of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), which may have other etiologies.

As mentioned in many previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, have been proposed. - Mod.TY
