Key points
Question: What risk factors are associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity among health care personnel (HCP) inside and outside the workplace?

Findings: In this cross-sectional study of 24 749 HCP in 3 US states, contact with an individual with known coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure outside the workplace was the strongest risk factor associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, along with living in a zip code with higher COVID-19 incidence. None of the assessed workplace factors were associated with seropositivity.

Meaning: In this study, most risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCP were outside the workplace, suggesting that current infection prevention strategies in health care are effective in preventing patient-to-HCP transmission in the workplace.

Abstract
Importance: Risks for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care personnel (HCP) are unclear.

Objective: To evaluate the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among HCP with the a priori hypothesis that community exposure but not healthcare exposure was associated with seropositivity.

Design, setting, and participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted among volunteer HCP at 4 large healthcare systems in 3 US states. Sites shared deidentified data sets, including previously collected serology results, questionnaire results on community and workplace exposures at the time of serology, and 3-digit residential zip code prefix of HCP. Site-specific responses were mapped to a common metadata set. Residential weekly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cumulative incidence was calculated from state-based COVID-19 case and census data.

Exposures: Model variables included demographic (age, race, sex, ethnicity), community (known COVID-19 contact, COVID-19 cumulative incidence by 3-digit zip code prefix), and healthcare (workplace, job role, COVID-19 patient contact) factors.

Main outcome and measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Risk factors for seropositivity were estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a random intercept to account for clustering by site.

Results: Among 24 749 HCP, most were younger than 50 years (17 233 [69.6%]), were women (19 361 [78.2%]), were White individuals (15 157 [61.2%]), and reported workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (12 413 [50.2%]). Many HCP worked in the inpatient setting (8893 [35.9%]) and were nurses (7830 [31.6%]). Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 per 10 000 in the community up to one week prior to serology testing ranged from 8.2 to 275.6; 20 072 HCP (81.1%) reported no COVID-19 contact in the community. Seropositivity was 4.4% (95% CI, 4.1%-4.6%; 1080 HCP) overall. In multivariable analysis, community COVID-19 contact and community COVID-19 cumulative incidence were associated with seropositivity (community contact: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.5; 95% CI, 2.9-4.1; community cumulative incidence: aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6). No assessed workplace factors were associated with seropositivity, including nurse job role (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3), working in the emergency department (aOR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3), or workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3).

Conclusions and relevance: In this cross-sectional study of US HCP in 3 states, community exposures were associated with seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2, but workplace factors, including workplace role, environment, or contact with patients with known COVID-19, were not. These findings provide reassurance that current infection prevention practices in diverse healthcare settings are effective in preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to HCP.

ref: Gohil SK, Huang SS. Community COVID-19 incidence and health care personnel COVID-19 seroprevalence. JAMA Netw Open. 2021; 4(3): e211575. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.1575

This study represents one of the largest assessments of COVID-19 seroprevalence among HCP in the USA, and its findings highlight the protective effects of PPE and protocols in the hospital setting. These findings help correct misperceptions that HCP remain at higher risk of communicable disease despite adequate PPE and infection prevention protocols. In the early phases of the pandemic, infection prevention programs across the nation spent significant time and effort to address HCP fears and provide education and reassurance related to PPE effectiveness. More data are needed on how to optimize HCP adherence to infection prevention protocols, including speaking up about symptoms and avoiding working while ill. Finally, the reassurance that infection prevention protocols and PPE are effective should not undermine the front-line contribution of HCP who are appropriately prioritized for PPE and COVID-19 vaccination given their critical role in pandemic response.

[The results of this study in no way minimize the daily risk HCP take while attending to patients or working in clinics and hospitals, but rather emphasize the need to take greater precautions in the community -- for example, continuing physical distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing -- even after being vaccinated. This is true not only for HCP but also for members of the community. The study also points to how important it is that HCP are prioritized for PPE (personal protective equipment) and vaccination, on which they are dependent to be safe while they do their work. While there remains a large population of susceptible individuals, the virus will continue to circulate and present a serious public health risk. As more people are immunized, the risk should diminish but likely will not disappear. - Mod.LK]

By the time his parents rushed him to the hospital, 11 year old [P] was barely eating and had stopped drinking entirely. Weakened by months of self-privation, his heart had slowed to a crawl and his kidneys were faltering. Medics injected him with fluids and fed him through a tube -- 1st steps toward stitching together yet another child coming apart amid the tumult of the coronavirus crisis.

For doctors who treat them, the pandemic's impact on the mental health of children is increasingly alarming. The Paris pediatric hospital caring for [P] has seen a doubling in the number of children and young teenagers requiring treatment after attempted suicides since September [2020]. Doctors elsewhere report similar surges, with children -- some as young as 8 -- deliberately running into traffic, overdosing on pills and otherwise self-harming. In Japan, child and adolescent suicides hit record levels in 2020, according to the education ministry.

Pediatric psychiatrists say they're also seeing children with coronavirus-related phobias, tics and eating disorders, obsessing about infection, scrubbing their hands raw, covering their bodies with disinfectant gel and terrified of getting sick from food. Also increasingly common, doctors say, are children suffering panic attacks, heart palpitations and other symptoms of mental anguish, as well as chronic addictions to mobile devices and computer screens that have become their sitters, teachers and entertainers during lockdowns, curfews and school closures.

"There is no prototype for the child experiencing difficulties," said Dr Richard Delorme, who heads the psychiatric unit treating [P] at the giant Robert Debre pediatric hospital, the busiest in France. "This concerns all of us."

Dr David Greenhorn said the emergency department at the Bradford Royal Infirmary where he works in northern England used to treat 1 or 2 children per week for mental health emergencies, including suicide attempts. The average now is closer to 1 or 2 per day, sometimes involving children as young as 8, he said. "This is an international epidemic, and we are not recognizing it," Greenhorn said in a telephone interview. "In an 8 year old's life, a year is a really, really, really long time. They are fed up. They can't see an end to it."

At Robert Debre, the psychiatric unit typically used to see about 20 attempted suicide cases per month involving children aged 15 and under. Not only has that number now doubled in some months since September [2020], but some children also seem ever-more determined to end their lives, Delorme said. "We are very surprised by the intensity of the desire to die among children who may be 12 or 13 years old," he said. "We sometimes have children of 9 who already want to die. And it's not simply a provocation or a blackmail via suicide. It is a genuine wish to end their lives. The levels of stress among children are truly massive," he said. "The crisis affects all of us, from age 2 to 99."

[The stress adults feel from fear of COVID-19, fear over looming loss of a job, economic uncertainties, and so much more also likely is picked up by their children who are at home with them all day. As the report stated, "the crisis affects all of us, from age 2 to 99." But children have fewer coping mechanisms and cannot put into words the stress they are feeling or even identify what they are feeling. In many cases, the grief they are experiencing following loss of beloved family members weighs heavily on the household. The importance of attention not only to the physical health of the family but also to their mental health cannot be overstated. - Mod.LK]

The Nigerian government on Monday [8 Mar 2021] said it has started distributing the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines to various states across the country. The executive director of National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, made this known at the weekly briefing of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19. He said adequate provision had been made to deploy the vaccines to all states and vaccination sites where people would be vaccinated according to set priorities, beginning with the health workers and other support staff. "All things being equal, the delivery of the vaccines will be completed tomorrow [9 Mar 2021]," Mr Shuaib said. He explained that the delivery of the vaccines to the states is predicated on satisfactorily meeting the conditions to keep them safe and potent. "We are designating vaccine accountability officers in the states and LGAs [local government areas] to closely monitor the management and utilization of the vaccines."

Mr Shuaib said the state launch of the COVID-19 vaccination for health workers is slated for 9 Mar 2021 at the state treatment centers, barring any prevailing local conditions. "Most governors have agreed to flag off on [10 Mar 2021] while the statewide rollout of COVID-19 vaccine will commence from [12 Mar 2021]," he said. Nigeria on Friday [5 Mar 2021] commenced the vaccination of its citizens against COVID-19, beginning with health care workers.

Health officials in Egypt have begun the 2nd phase of a nationwide vaccination drive. The elderly and those with underlying medical conditions are receiving their 1st doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against the coronavirus. There are 40 vaccination centres countrywide.

Health authorities have launched a website where beneficiaries can sign up to get jabbed. So far, over 150 000 people have filled the online request. "They should sign an approval consent letter (before getting vaccinated), then we measure the pressure, and sugar level in the blood, and review all medical reports related to the person, then a doctor explains what the vaccine is and how to get it. We also mention that the person should have the 2nd dose after 3 months, as we give people the AstraZeneca vaccine," said Dr Eman Mohamed, head of New Nozha Hospital in Cairo.

The north African nation began rolling out its anti-COVID-19 vaccination program in January [2021]. Shots were first given to frontline health care workers.

[The case count for COVID-19 in Africa continues to rise very sharply and is now at 3 964 055 with over 105 700 deaths as of 8 Mar 2021.

Several African countries have had the privileged to roll out vaccination campaigns for their citizens. Whilst some countries have benefited from the COVAX scheme, others have had the chance to procure their own vaccine. The COVAX scheme is a vaccine-sharing initiative from the WHO to help poor countries obtain their own vaccine with help from rich countries. Egypt started vaccination of its citizens in January 2021 that targeted frontline health care workers and essential workers. Now they are in the 2nd phase to vaccinate elderly people and others most at risk. It is hoped the vaccination campaigns will help stop transmission of the infection on the continent. - Mod.YA]

https://newsghana.com.gh/africa-ratchets-up-vaccination-as-covid-19-cases-surpass-4-million/


As of Friday [12 Mar 2021], the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Africa had reached 4 005 204, including 107 001 deaths and 3 589 067 recovered patients, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).

With confirmed cases passing the 4-million mark, vaccination on the continent gathers pace. China, among the leading countries, has provided a significant amount of doses to African countries in their quest to conquer the virus. [Note that Xinhuanet is a Chinese state-run news service. - Mod.MPP]

As African countries are scrambling to acquire vaccines from manufacturers, many of them have received doses from China, Russia, and the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX), an initiative spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines across the world. A total of 28 African nations have received the COVID-19 vaccines, 19 through the COVAX facility, 9 through bilateral agreements, and 16 of them have started vaccinating priority populations, according to a statement issued by Africa CDC on Monday [8 Mar 2021].

Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said 24 African countries are expected to receive their doses procured under COVAX in March [2021]. She also said that 600 million doses procured under the COVAX facility will be delivered to Africa in 2021.

Priority in vaccination is being given to medical front-liners, patients suffering from chronic diseases and the elderly. African leaders have also been at the forefront in receiving jabs, in an effort to boost public confidence in the doses.

"The arrival of the 1st batch of vaccines through the COVAX facility, in which China also participates, is a welcomed development," said Olu Bolarinwa, lead pharmacist at the Safeway Medical Center based in Lagos, Nigeria "We have less than 4 million doses, but this is a drop in the ocean in view of our population. However, it is a welcomed development," said Bolarinwa.

As countries on the continent step up procurement of vaccines, they also face challenges of the shortage of doses and inadequate health infrastructure. John Nkengasong, director of Africa CDC, believes that Africa faces several challenges in its vaccine rollout, the major one being timely access to the vaccines. "The 1st is how we timely access vaccines so that we can block the spread of this pandemic. Our number 2 challenge is that our populations have begun to face what is called pandemic fatigue. We have been doing this for one year and people are getting tired," he said.

"Very few African countries have so far already ordered vaccines because we can't produce them locally," said Cavince Adhere, an international relations researcher in Kenya.

WHO has observed that a successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccine in Africa largely depends on improving the knowledge of the continent's frontline health care workers in critical areas such as storage, supply chain management, and effective communication to the public. Ambrose Talisuna, emergency preparedness program manager at the WHO Regional Office for Africa, noted that a critical mass of trained health care workers is key to boosting COVID-19 vaccine preparedness and uptake in the continent. China has started to provide COVID-19 vaccines to 35 African countries and the African Union Commission and has provided close to 120 batches of emergency supplies to Africa and sent medical expert teams to 15 African countries to support their fight against the pandemic, he said.

Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone were the first 3 African countries to get donations of Sinopharm doses last month [February 2021]. The donation to Equatorial Guinea on 10 Feb 2021 was the 1st batch of vaccine aid provided by the Chinese government to African countries. As of Monday [8 Mar 2021], 35 761 frontline workers in Zimbabwe had received the Sinopharm vaccine, according to the health ministry.

[The rollout of vaccines is reaching Africa. The source URL of the above report has a map of Africa. An article from The New York Times mentions that the USA is partnering with Japan, India, and Australia to provide "financial support to help Biological E, a major vaccine manufacturer in India, produce at least one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines by the end of 2022", aimed at helping countries with difficulty securing vaccines (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/us/politics/biden-vaccine-diplomacy.html). There's also pressure for local production in countries in Africa (https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/africa/african-cdc-seeks-continental-capacity-to-produce-its-own-coronavirus-vaccines.html). "African CDC director Dr John Nkengasong said that at least 5 African countries, including South Africa, Senegal, Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt, appear to have the capacity to produce vaccines." It is hoped these agreements will come to fruition and these countries will have vaccine security. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, Brazil (84 047), the USA (67 521), India (27 512), Italy (26 790), and France (25 229) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 10 611 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 11 Mar 2021 to late 12 Mar 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include Brazil, the USA, India, Italy, France, Poland (18 873), Turkey (14 941), Mexico (13 213), Ukraine (12 946), Germany (12 786) and Czech Republic (11 274). A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 56 countries are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 9.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 5.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 12.5% decrease in daily reported cases and a 20.0% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases totaled approaching 504 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 119.60 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.65 million reported deaths. Europe and the Americas dominated in terms of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. - Mod.MPP]
