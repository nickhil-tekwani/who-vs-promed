Names of flu viruses appearing in the scientific literature have
undergone something of a mutation this year [2008]. The group of H5N1
avian flu viruses, once known as "Fujian-like," has morphed into
"Clade 2.3.4," and its "Qinghai-like" cousin is now called "Clade
2.2." They are part of a complete revision of H5N1 nomenclature
recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The system is now more politically correct. It avoids the
"stigmatizing labelling of clades by geographical reference,"
according to the WHO. In 2006, when scientists assigned the name
"Fujian-like virus" to a vaccine-resistant strain of H5N1 that spread
across Asia, China objected strongly to the name. Government
officials argued that the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian was
tainted by association as the virus spread.

But a WHO official told Nature [journal] that discussions for a
revised nomenclature were underway before the spat and that the
"impetus was scientific. We recognized that naming based on geography
was probably not a good idea for other reasons," she says.

Flu experts say that the new naming recommendations, which have been
posted on the WHO website [see reference below] and have been
submitted for publication in the journal Emerging Infectious
Diseases, make a lot of sense. They replace an ad-hoc system -- in
which researchers would invent their own names for newly isolated
groups -- with a systematic one in which names have greater
biological relevance.

H5N1 viruses are classified on the basis of their hemagglutinin
genetic sequence into 10 phylogenetic clades -- distinct branches of
the virus's family tree -- and the new system names the viral
subgroups according to their position in the tree. It aims to be more
logical. For example, Clade 2.3.4 viruses are not restricted to
Fuijan province, as they have caused cases in humans in China, Laos,
Myanmar and Viet Nam. Clade 2.1 viruses dominate in poultry and
humans in Indonesia, for example, whereas Clade 2.2 viruses have the
largest geographical spread, causing outbreaks in more than 60
countries from Azerbaijan to Nigeria and Pakistan.

"I find the geographical naming system rather confusing and
unspecific; this more precise numbering system is far more rigorous,"
says Edward Holmes, a flu genomicist at Pennsylvania State University
in University Park. The new system does not affect the naming of
individual H5N1 virus sequences -- held in the GenBank database --
that make up such clades. These will continue to display geographic
and species data on the sample. Geographic information is relevant,
says the WHO official, because it locates the sample's place of
origin.

But experts say that the location data in GenBank flu names is
woefully inadequate for serious spatial science, such as analyzing
the spread of virus genotypes or how spread relates to other spatial
data on land use, climate and trade. "There's nothing more
frustrating and useless to a phylogeographer than a perfectly
sequenced isolate labeled 'China,'" says Rob Wallace, an evolutionary
ecologist at the University of California, Irvine. "With Global
Positioning System (GPS) coordinates and fine enough sampling, we
would really be able to tease out how the virus evolves and spreads
across farms and wetlands."

Indeed, not one H5N1 sequence in GenBank currently contains GPS
coordinates, often because those submitting sequences have no use for
such data. "Given the importance of avian flu, I've been amazed to
find out how difficult it has been to get information on the
geographical distribution of essential variables," says ecologist
Marius Gilbert of the Free University of Brussels. The WHO official
agrees that the current sequence-naming system is not as useful as
GPS coordinates, but says that "the WHO doesn't see its business as
making that sort of requirement."

GenBank only introduced fields for latitude and longitude in
submitted entries in 2005, and few scientists have so far used them,
except in spatially aware fields, such as forest entomology and
biodiversity.
