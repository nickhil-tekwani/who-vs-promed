The Department of Epidemiology, Ministry of Health, confirmed another new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in a 35 year old woman who resides in the Carrizal community, Sona district of Veraguas province.

Ricardo Chong, epidemiologist of the Ministry of Health, said that to date [this year (2013)], 3 cases of hantavirus [infection] have been reported, all from the Sona district in less than one month.

The woman affected by [a] hantavirus remains hospitalized in the Doctor Luis Chico Rabrega Regional Hospital of Veraguas, with serious respiratory problems.

The health authorities maintain operations so that the owners of homes and businesses comply with sanitary measures in order to avoid more cases of hantavirus [infection].

[One hopes that the public education measures being carried out by the Ministry of Health will reduce rodent habitat and thus reduce the risk of acquiring hantavirus infections. Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, the one most likely responsible for this case is Choclo virus, as mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935. Of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_) a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
