[1] Switzerland, wild ducks, H5N8

A strain of bird flu has been detected in the corpses of 5 wild ducks found in Lake Constance (Bodensee). The Swiss Federal Office of Food Safety and Veterinary Affairs said it was taking steps to prevent the further spread of the virus. Final test results on the tufted ducks are still pending, but the federal office said studies carried out pointed to a H5N8 subtype of the virus.

Wild migrating birds can transmit bird flu to farmed poultry. Containment measures are being coordinated by the Swiss, Austrian and German authorities as the lake borders all 3 countries. Steps could include banning farmers from allowing poultry outdoors.

The Federal Office of Food Safety and Veterinary Affairs said there was no evidence the virus could be transmitted to humans. Further measures would be decided once it was clear how pathogenic the cases were. According to the World Health Organisation, highly pathogenic viruses result in high death rates (up to 100 per cent mortality within 48 hours) in some poultry species. Low pathogenicity viruses also cause outbreaks in poultry but are not generally associated with severe disease.

Hungary's food safety authority said last week it had found traces of bird flu at a poultry farm in eastern Hungary and would destroy 9000 turkeys to protect nearby populations from a strain it said was harmless to humans.

People who come across dead birds are being asked not to touch them but to report them to police or wildlife experts.

Today [8 Nov 2016], Austria's health ministry reported H5N8 in 5 wild birds, mainly tufted ducks, found dead near Lake Constance, near the borders with Liechtenstein, Germany, and Switzerland, according to an official announcement translated and posted by FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board.

The findings were confirmed at Austria's national reference lab. Officials said they are deciding the next steps to take, which could include establishing a protection zone around the lake and more biosecurity for poultry in the area. Officials are coordinating outbreak control measures with their counterparts in Germany and Switzerland.

Austria's statement said Croatia has detected the H5N8 subtype. If confirmed by Croatian veterinary officials, the number of countries affected in Europe would rise to 5.

3. FAO/EMPRES (repeated) warning
Date: Fri 4 Nov 2016

On 14 Sep 2016, FAO EMPRES issued a warning about an H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that had been found in Tyva in the Southern Russian Federation. It was expected (based on earlier events over the past 11 years) that this virus would likely be found in other locations to the west and south in the following months.

Events in the past week strongly suggest that this may be occurring with an H5N8 virus now detected in 4 states of India and also in Hungary (a dead swan in the south east of the country). So far, genetic information is not available on the viruses in these 2 locations, but the timing is generally consistent with previous events and corresponds broadly with the autumn migration and movement patterns of wild Anatidae (the family of birds that includes ducks, geese, and swans).

Four aspects of these developments are worth noting:

1. The 2 cases add additional evidence of the role of wild birds in the long distance movement of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.

This appears to be the 4th wave of intercontinental movement of H5 HPAI virus since 2005. The role of wild birds in the long distance movement of these viruses is now incontrovertible. Clearly, additional genetic information is required to confirm that the virus found in India and Hungary is essentially the same strain as that found in the Tyva Republic, but the pattern of cases in India and species involved in Hungary still support a role for wild bird introduction.

The precise origin of the Tyva 2016 H5N8 virus remains unknown, although available evidence suggests it was derived from earlier H5N8 viruses detected in eastern China (WHO 2016). The virus is readily distinguishable from strains of H5N8 virus found in Europe and North America in 2014-15.

2. Other countries should be on high alert for incursions of this virus and should adopt stronger biosecurity measures on all poultry farms and enhance surveillance.

A range of countries along migratory/movement pathways of Anatidae remains at risk. Although it is not possible to predict which countries will experience outbreaks in poultry or wild birds, any of the countries listed below should consider measures to curtail the disease and prevent spread of virus in poultry. The risk extends through to March/April next year [2017] for Europe and the Middle East. Testing of dead wild birds and poultry in areas near migratory concentration points should be increased.

The genes of all H5 viruses detected should be sequenced and results shared with the global community. This information is crucial in helping to understand how virus is spreading. It applies to viruses detected in India and Hungary as well as viruses elsewhere in the region such as those causing deaths of quail in the United Arab Emirates in early October [2016; see 20161005.4537271. However, UAE has not reported HPAI to the OIE during 2016; according to its annual OIE report for 2015, submitted 19 Feb 2016, "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (domestic and wild)," has never (0000) been recorded in the UAE.- Mod.AS].

Places at risk:

Countries in the Middle East;
Countries in the EU;
West Africa;
Countries in the former Soviet Union;
Countries in South Asia.

3. Action on wild birds is not recommended

There is no benefit to be gained in attempting to control the virus in wild birds through culling or habitat destruction. There is also no justification for any pre-emptive culling of endangered species in zoological collections. Control measures for captive wild birds in places where virus is detected should be based on strict movement control, isolation and, only when necessary, limited culling of affected birds. There is no long term carrier of H5 avian influenza. Use of disinfectants should be focused on areas with no accumulated organic matter that have been cleaned. Spraying with disinfectant of birds or the environment in which birds are found is ineffective and potentially counter-productive.

4. Public health significance

Available evidence suggests that the human health risk of the Tyva 2016 strain of virus is likely to be low. So far, no cases of influenza A in humans caused by avian influenza viruses have been associated with H5N8 viruses. Nevertheless, dead birds should not be handled or prepared for food. Authorities should be notified of any mortalities and proper disposal of carcasses conducted after sample collection. Standard hand hygiene practices should be followed by anyone who might come in contact with bird droppings or dead birds. Swimming in water that is potentially contaminated should be avoided. All poultry products for consumption should be cooked thoroughly at all times.

[HPAI H5N8 continues its FAO-predicted spread, confirming the once controversial issue of wild-migrating birds involved in the long-distance spread from eastern/central Asia.

On Tue 8 Nov 2016, the United Kingdom's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA] published an updated "Outbreak assessment avian influenza (H5N8) in Europe," concluding that since "there has been only limited trade with Hungary or Poland in live poultry (including hatching eggs) and none from the affected premises, there is a negligible risk of disease introduction into the UK via this route as a result of these specific outbreaks." The authors added: "Nevertheless, we will continue to report on any updates to the situation and in particular any changes in disease distribution or wild bird movements which may increase the risk to the UK. We would like to remind all poultry keepers to maintain high standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant and report any suspect clinical signs promptly. Poultry keepers should also remind themselves of the mild clinical signs of LPAI infection and be aware of any changes in egg production, feed and water intake or rise in mortality."
