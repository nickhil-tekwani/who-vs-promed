STREPTOCOCCAL FOODBORNE ILLNESS - ISRAEL (LOD) (02)

From what I could get from Israeli newspapers, there is such an outbreak
of 120 known cases and maybe up to 2000 cases of workers in the aviation
industry in Israel. The symptoms published in the local paper were high
fever, chills, headache, and sore throat.

It also said that 2 official doctors from the ministry of health were
involved. Yesterday evening strep was found in cultures of the 120 cases
(it didn't say which cultures, I assume throat). Strangely, it said that
it was not yet clear whether it was strep A or B(?). This is referred to as
the largest outbreak in the country.

The food supply to the factory is through a catering service, which is
being investigated for the possibility that an employee transmitted the
disease.
