A cluster of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1)2009 influenza cases with
onset between May and August 2011 has been detected in the Hunter
region of New South Wales (NSW), Australia.

Viruses from 25 of 184 (14 percent) A(H1N1)2009 cases from the Hunter
New England region exhibited highly reduced oseltamivir sensitivity
due to the H275Y substitution in the neuraminidase. The H275Y mutation
is a well-established substitution previously reported to confer
oseltamivir resistance in N1 neuraminidases and was present in the
widespread oseltamivir resistant pre-pandemic seasonal A(H1N1) virus.

15 of the 1st 16 cases lived within a 50-km radius of the regional
centre of Newcastle. 16 of the 25 patients have been interviewed, and
none had received oseltamivir prior to influenza specimen collection.
Only 5 were hospitalised at the time of specimen collection. None of
the 16 had a history of immune suppression; 3 cases were pregnant. No
one was admitted to ICU or had a fatal outcome. Further interviews
with cases and virological analyses are ongoing.

[ProMED-mail thanks Kate Hardie and colleagues for communicating the
discovery of this cluster of oseltamivir-resistance cases in the
Hunter region of New South Wales.

According to the most recent WHO weekly update on oseltamivir
resistance in influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses, dated 13 Jul 2011, the
cumulative total of cases since April 2009 was 565. It was concluded
that the overall incidence of viruses resistant to antivirals remained
very low, with no recent reports of case clusters. The preceding
report from New South Wales is significant in this respect.
