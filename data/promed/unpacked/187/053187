The Director of Health of the Federal District, Jose Leon Uzcategui, reported
that last week 49 cases of dengue were registered in the Federal District,
bringing the total for the year to 800. Counting the State of Miranda (567
cases since January), the total is 1,367 in the metropolitan area.
The increase in the number of cases in the Federal District and the national
incidence resulted in health authorities issuing a epidemiological alarm.
An increased effort to reduce areas supporting the growth of mosquitoes will
be initiated.
