[In the absence of nosocomial transmission, sporadic cases have been reported during the month of July 2019, and the 1st newly confirmed case was reported in August 2019, yesterday (4 Aug 2019).

During the month of July 2019, there were a total of 8 newly confirmed cases reported from 3 different regions: Riyadh (5 cases), Najran (2 cases) and Al Qasim (1 case). All 8 cases were classified as primary cases with 7 of the 8 with unknown camel contact history and one case with positive history of camel contact. Outcome information is known for 7 of the 8 cases reported during July 2019; 4 were reported to have died, and 3 were reported as recoveries.

Since 1 Jan 2019, there have been a total of 167 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia.

With the Hajj upcoming next week (9-14 Aug 2019), there is always increased concern re: transmission of the MERS-CoV, but since 2012, when the MERS-CoV was identified as a human pathogen, and 2012-2013, when it was also confirmed as a camel pathogen, there have been no cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in a returning Hajji. Camels are prohibited in the areas where Hajjis congregate and stay, and camel products are not sold in the Hajj area markets. In addition, there are separate Hajji-only health facilities available for healthcare of the Hajj attendees, reducing the risk of contagion in the healthcare setting.

Conclusion: MERS-CoV has not gone away, with low level but ever-present sporadic cases occurring in Saudi Arabia. While the risk of transmission to Hajjis is markedly reduced, the theoretical risk is always present, so severe respiratory infections in returning Hajjis should always have MERS-CoV infection considered as a possibility.
