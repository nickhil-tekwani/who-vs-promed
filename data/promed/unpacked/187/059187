Water testing has confirmed high concentrations of blue green algae at Camperdown's Lake Bullen Merri. Corangamite Shire is urging the public to avoid all contact with the water, including swimming and fishing.

Sustainable development director Ian Gibb said signs have been installed at the lake to warn people of the high levels of the toxic algae. "Council officers carry out regular inspections and collect samples for lab analysis if there is a visible change in the water," he said.

Corangamite Shire will post regular updates on the status of the lake via its website http://www.corangamite.vic.gov.au.

Mr Gibb said common symptoms of exposure to blue green algae include skin irritation, nausea and vomiting. "Avoid eating any fish caught in the lake, and don't allow pets or livestock to come into contact with the water," he said.

Deep Lake, Lake Tooliorook and Lake Purrumbete are currently considered safe.

[Blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, can be deadly to a number of animals and have been responsible for the deaths of livestock in other parts of the world (see ProMED postings below). Cyanobacteria can be found in water, soil, on rocks, and even in symbiotic relationships with some lichens. They can be found as single cells, colonies, filaments, sheets, and sometimes balls with a hollow center.

Cyanobacteria have several types of classification, but some produce cyanotoxins. Some of the toxins are known as anatoxin-a, anatoxin-as, aplysia toxin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, microcystin LR, nodularin R (from _Nodularia_), and saxitoxin. These toxins are neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, cytotoxic, and endotoxic. These toxins have been detrimental to a wide variety of animals, but can also be dangerous to humans.

Although this is Australia, the information on the Canadian website regarding human health is pertinent. Additional information about cyanobacteria, especially as they relate to human health, can be found at the Health Canada website at http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/water-eau/cyanobacter-eng.php.
