Indonesia: suspected bird flu siblings hospitalized in North Sumatra
-----------------------------------------------
Three Indonesian children have been admitted to hospital with suspected
avian influenza in a North Sumatran district where 7 members of an extended
family died from the disease in May [2006], officials said on Wed 2 Aug
2006. The 3 -- 2 siblings aged 10 and 6 and their 18 month old neighbor --
were admitted to the state-run Adam Malik hospital on Tue 1 Aug 2006 after
showing symptoms of bird flu, said hospital director Luhur Suroso. "We are
testing samples taken from them," Suroso told Reuters. He declined to give
further details.
Hariadi Wibisono, the Health Ministry's director-general of control of
animalborne diseases, said the patients lived in Karo district in North
Sumatra province, where bird flu killed as many as 7 people in an extended
family in May [2006]. The deaths in Karo were the biggest cluster of the
disease the country has recorded and sparked fears of a global pandemic of
bird flu infections in humans. The World Health Organization said in May
2006 that 2 members of the cluster, an Indonesian man and his son, might
have caught the virus in a case of direct human-to-human transmission, but
the virus did not spread very far if this did happen. "They are from the
same district but a different village," Wibisono said, referring to the 3
new suspected cases.
Indonesia has recorded 42 deaths from the H5N1 bird flu virus, equaling
Viet Nam, where no one is known to have died of the disease this year
[2006]. Human cases of bird flu have been rising steadily in Indonesia
since its 1st known outbreak in poultry in late 2003. Worldwide, the
disease has killed at least 134 people since it reemerged in east Asia in 2003.
Indonesia has been criticized for not doing enough to stamp out H5N1, which
still remains essentially an animal disease, but which experts fear could
spark a pandemic if it mutates into a form that can pass easily among
people. The government has so far shied away from mass culling of poultry,
citing lack of funds and impracticality in a country with millions of
backyard fowl.

[An WHO investigation concluded previously that the limited human-to-human
transmission of H5N1 avian influenza virus observed in a village in the
district of Karo in the north of Sumatra did not extend beyond the members
of a single extended family. Although the 3 children (2 siblings and a
neighbor) now under surveillance do not reside in same the village of Karo
district as the "North Sumatran cluster," it is perhaps a prudent measure
to place these children under hospital care until their avian influenza
virus infection status has been established.
