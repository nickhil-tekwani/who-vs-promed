According to information received at the National Institute of Public
Health in Oslo from the Norwegian Red Cross delegation to Murmansk and the
Norwegian Consulate in Murmansk:
The outbreak was first noted on December 20, 1997. It seems to be confined
to Murmansk city and the neighbouring towns of Kola and Sevoromorsk.
_Shigella flexneri_ serotype 3a has been isolated from patients.
As of January 5, 1998, 550 persons had been treated for diarrheal disease
in hospitals. Possibly 2,000 people have been infected. No deaths have been
reported.
Local health authorities state that the source of the outbreak was certain
dairy-products from the Tuloma dairy outside Murmansk. Contaminated water
seems to have been used for cleaning machinery in the dairy. On December 22
the products from this facility were withdrawn, but products remained on
the illegal market for some days.
The outbreak seems to be under control; however secondary cases still occur
and will probably do so for some weeks to come, we believe. We also believe
that if the dairy machines were really cleaned with fecally contaminated
water, one can expect other diseases such as salmonellosis,
campylobacteriosis and even hepatitis A. Maybe some of the hundreds of sick
people did not have shigellosis, but some other diarrheal disease. We don't
know.
We have not recommended restrictions on travel or trade across the border
between Norway and Murmansk county of Russia.

[According to the Davis et al. Microbiology text, clinical shigellosis can
result from ingestion of as few as 100 organisms. _S. flexneri_ is a
common cause of endemic diarrheal disease in underdeveloped countries. -
