A total of 29 poultry farms in Ontario are now under quarantine after H5 avian influenza was confirmed on a turkey farm.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said last week [week of 6 Apr 2015] that the disease was confirmed on a farm in Woodstock, Ontario, and placed it and 8 other farms under quarantine.

The agency now says 20 additional farms are under quarantine.

The CFIA says all the farms are in an avian influenza "control zone" which has been established to control the movement of animal products and equipment in order to minimize the spread of disease.

The zone consists of a 10-kilometre [6.2 mi] radius around the farm in Oxford County where avian influenza is confirmed.

Dr Abed Harchaoui, a senior staff veterinarian at the CFIA, says the additional farms have been quarantined as a precaution. He says there is no increased risk, nor is there any food safety concern.

"This move is an effective balance between strong disease control methods and the ability to resume trade," he said. "The agency is monitoring these additional premises closely for any sign of disease."

Harchaoui said the avian influenza control zone will be in place until the CFIA is confident the disease is no longer circulating in the area.

Avian influenza does not pose a risk to food safety when poultry and poultry products are properly handled and cooked.

The disease rarely affects humans who do not have consistent contact with infected birds.

[This article is somewhat non-specific. It only claims the strain of virus is H5. Given the other recent findings, it is very likely to be H5N2, a highly pathogenic strain.

Hopefully the control zones will allow the authorities to start breaking the cycle of this disease. It may allow for closer monitoring and earlier detection, since the control zone already implies that the disease is inside of the control zone.
