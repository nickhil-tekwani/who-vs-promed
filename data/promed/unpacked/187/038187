A case of anthrax has been confirmed in an injecting drug user in Lanarkshire. The area's health authority said the patient was being treated at one of its hospitals and was in a critical but stable condition.

NHS Lanarkshire believes the patient could have contracted the anthrax bacteria from a contaminated batch of heroin circulating in the area.

Dr David Cromie, consultant in public health medicine at NHS Lanarkshire, said: "It is possible that heroin contaminated with anthrax may be circulating in Lanarkshire and potentially other parts of Scotland. There have been recent reports of anthrax from contaminated heroin in other western European countries, the most recent reported outbreak being in Germany [see ProMED refs. below. - Mod.JW]. It is important that drug users are aware of the particular dangers involved when they are injecting heroin. ... If there is any pain or swelling around an injection site, drug users should seek urgent medical attention. It can take up to a week for symptoms to develop after a person comes into contact with anthrax."

Dr Cromie said injecting drug users known to Lanarkshire addiction services were being contacted to alert them to the problem.

"The advice to drug users is to avoid all heroin use, which we recognise may be very difficult for drug users to follow," he said. "Muscle-popping, skin-popping, and injecting when a vein has been missed are particularly dangerous. Smoking heroin carries much less risk than injecting it. If there is any pain or swelling around an injection site, drug users should seek urgent medical attention."

The worst outbreak of anthrax in the UK for 50 years occurred among drug users in Scotland between 2009 and 2010. A total of 119 cases were recorded with a total of 14 deaths during the outbreak.

UK case of anthrax in injecting drug user
-----------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) is aware of a single case of anthrax in an injecting drug user who has been hospitalised in Scotland.

The HPA is also aware of an ongoing outbreak of anthrax among people who inject drugs (PWID) affecting a number of countries in Europe. 5 cases have been identified since early June 2012: 3 in Germany, one in Denmark, and one in France [see ProMED refs. below. - Mod.JW]. The source is presumed to be contaminated heroin. It is unclear as yet whether the case in Scotland is linked to the outbreak in Europe but the HPA will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days and weeks.

These are the 1st cases of anthrax among injecting drug users in Europe since the outbreak during 2009/2010 which principally affected Scotland (119 cases), but with cases also reported from England (5 cases) and Germany (2 cases).

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) have jointly prepared a rapid risk assessment which concludes that heroin users in Europe are still at risk of exposure to anthrax.

Dr Fortune Ncube, an expert in infections among PWID at the HPA, said: "It is likely that further cases among PWID will be identified as part of the ongoing outbreak in EU countries. The Department of Health has alerted the NHS of the possibility of PWID presenting to Emergency Departments and Walk-in Clinics, with symptoms suggestive of anthrax.

"Anthrax can be cured with antibiotics, if treatment is started early. It is therefore important for medical professionals to know what sorts of symptoms and signs to look for, so that there are no delays in obtaining the necessary treatment. As part of the response to the 2009/10 outbreak, the HPA developed an algorithm for the clinical evaluation and management of PWID with possible anthrax. This algorithm specifies the kinds of presentations where anthrax should be considered, and outlines the actions to take."

Anthrax in drug users appears to be very rare -- prior to the 2009-2010 outbreak in Scotland, only one previous case had been reported, in Norway in 2000. Drug users may become infected with anthrax when heroin is contaminated with anthrax spores. This could be a source of infection if injected, smoked or snorted -- there is no safe route for consuming heroin or other drugs that may be contaminated with anthrax spores.

[The UK health authorities have been on standby for a number of weeks now in expectation of such a case. We await the genomic analysis of this recent infection in Scotland. The speculative hypothesis, singular, for the origin of these heroin-associated cases in France, Germany, and now Scotland is that it is from leftover, unsold heroin from 2010. As yet, no other explanation has been put forward. But there have been sufficient survivors to provide some evidence. It should be revealing.

For a map showing Lanarkshire, see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanarkshire.
It is close to Glasgow, where many of the previous injection cases were.

Our thanks to Bob for forwarding this BBC report, and to Sabine for the HPA report. I must admit I have been checking daily the various European news sources for new drug related cases for many months. I am glad to be pipped by friends. - Mod.MHJ
