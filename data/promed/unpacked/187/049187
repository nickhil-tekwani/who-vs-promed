Lassa fever victim from West Africa recovering in London hospital
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A case of Lassa fever is being treated in Britain, after a man walked into
a hospital for help. The man, who recently flew to the country from West
Africa, is only the 7th person in the UK ever to suffer from Lassa fever
virus infection, which is classed as one of the world's most dangerous
diseases. It can cause violent seizures, and internal bleeding, leading to
death.
Public health officials are now trying to track down people who came into
close contact with the patient, while refusing to release details of the
flight which brought him to the United Kingdom. The patient walked into
Barnet Hospital's Accident and Emergency Unit in north London complaining
of malaria-like symptoms.
He was moved to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead for monitoring then
transferred to their high-security isolation unit at nearby Coppetts Wood
Hospital. A spokeswoman for the infectious disease center said: "We can
confirm that a patient, who has recently returned from West Africa, has
Lassa fever. The patient was treated appropriately at a high security
infectious diseases unit in North London and has now recovered. As a
precaution, healthcare workers and close contacts, such as household
members, have been contacted and are being followed up, although the risk
of them having acquired the infection is low." The man has now been moved
back to a medium secure unit at the Royal Free Hospital, as he is no longer
contagious.
The spokeswoman added that, since 1976, there have been only 6 other cases
in Britain. The current victim is the 1st case in the UK since a soldier
was infected in Sierra Leone in 2003. At that time, around 90 people, who
came into contact with the soldier, were put under surveillance to prevent
an outbreak.
In August [2004], a 38 year old American returning from a trip to Liberia
died in New Jersey. It was the 1st Lassa fever case in the USA for 15 years.
Lassa fever is contracted by exposure to infected rats in parts of West
Africa. It passes to humans when they inhale air contaminated by rat
droppings, or, by eating food or water contaminated by rodent urine or
excreta. It can pass from person to person in bodily fluids, or through
airborne droplets from coughs and sneezes. The infection has an incubation
period of 21 days and kills 15 percent of those infected. Dr Sukhdev
Sharma, consultant in communicable disease control at Britain's Health
Protection Agency, said: "We reassure the public that they are not at risk."

[Lassa fever virus occurs as a persistent infection in its rodent host.
Asymptomatic infection of humans is frequent, and serious outbreaks of
overt disease may occur from time to time. Human-to-human transmission of
infection can occur, particularly in hospital settings. Because of the
serious nature of the disease, vigilance is required in assessment and
treatment of patients arriving with febrile symptoms from endemic areas.
The country of origin of the patient is not stated, but Nigeria or Sierra
Leone are likely candidates. The following information, with respect to
Lassa fever in Sierra Leone, is taken from the Gideon database (see: Lassa
fever - Sierra Leone (Kenema) (02): background 20040421.1110). "Lassa fever
is most common in the eastern region; one to 4 _Mastomys_ (a small
mouse-like African rodent) are found in every household in this area, of
which, 1-20 percent are infected with Lassa fever virus. In some areas of
eastern Sierra Leone, the disease accounts for 30 percent of medical deaths
in-hospital, 30 percent of deafness, and 70 percent of spontaneous
abortion. 8 to 52 per cent of the population are seropositive." - Mod.CP]
