An Oswego County resident has been diagnosed with eastern equine
encephalitis [EEE], a rare, potentially fatal brain-swelling virus spread
by mosquitoes.

It is the 1st reported human case of EEE in the area since 1983, according
to Gary Sauda of the Onondaga County Health Department. The individual is
an adult who has been hospitalized, he said. Sauda had no other information
about the person's condition.

Tests of mosquito pools have shown widespread EEE [virus] activity this
summer [2009] in Oswego and Onondaga counties. The Onondaga County Health
Department announced it plans to spray the Cicero Swamp and surrounding
areas to reduce the mosquito population after 6 p.m. Monday [14 Sep 2009],
weather permitting. Those affected in the spray area will be notified in
advance through the emergency notification reverse 911 system.

The spraying area is bounded on the north by Route 31, on the west by
Northern Boulevard, on the south by Taft Road and on the east by
Chittenango Creek. Roads included in this area are all or parts of Route
298, Bull Street, Eastwood Road, Island Road, Cicero Center Road, Fergerson
Road, Ferstler Road and Oxbow Road.

The county Health Department recommends residents in spray areas stay
indoors and keep windows closed during spraying. Windows can be opened one
hour after spraying. Pets should also be kept indoors during spraying if
possible.

[This summer 2009 has been one of very active EEE virus transmission in the
north eastern USA. There have been numerous equine cases and disease in a
few other species (llamas, alpacas, emus and pheasants) in the states that
neighbor New York to the north and east (see ProMED-mail archives below)
and a child case has been reported in New Hampshire. There is no vaccine
available for human use, but there is for equine animals. The best way to
prevent further human cases is to avoid mosquito bites by wearing long
sleeved shirts, long pants and applying insect repellant containing DEET.
If the spraying is not effective in eliminating foci of EEE virus vector
mosquitoes in the area, virus transmission will continue until killing
frosts occur.
