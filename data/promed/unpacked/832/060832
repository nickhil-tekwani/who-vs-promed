3 children sickened in a recent _E. coli_ outbreak in eastern North Dakota reported attending the Red River Valley Fair earlier in July 2015, prompting state health officials to investigate whether animals there were the source of the infection. Officials said it is still early in the investigation, but they're asking anyone who attended the fair, which ran from 7-13 Jul 2015, and developed diarrhea or bloody diarrhea for more than 24 hours within 10 days of the fair, to contact them.

The Shiga toxin-producing infection from _Escherichia coli_, or STEC infection [or EHEC for enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_], can cause nausea, cramping, diarrhea, vomiting and bloody diarrhea, symptoms that can be severe enough to require hospitalization. 1 of the children has developed a complication from the infection which can affect red blood cells and cause kidney damage and kidney failure [called hemolytic uremic syndrome], said Michelle Feist, a state epidemiologist with the Division of Disease Control.

"Although the cases reported having contact with animals at the fair, we are looking into other possible exposures as well," said Feist.

This type of _E. coli_ is shed in the fecal matter of infected animals and people. Undercooked meats, contaminated sprouts and petting zoos have all been implicated in past outbreaks in the USA.

Red River Valley Fair General Manager Bryan Schulz expressed shock at the announcement, saying he'd heard no details from health officials other than a call early Monday inquiring from where the fair's animals had come. "We haven't had a petting zoo for 3 years," Schulz said. "I'm not sure where they're getting this from." Schulz said while fair officials have been moving away from having petting zoos precisely because of concerns over _E. coli_, people at the fair could have reached through cage bars in the rabbit display area or petted baby pigs held by workers in the Ag Education Center.

All animals in the Ag Education Center came from North Dakota State University, he said, while other animals on display came there from private owners. The fair has a protocol of spraying down its barns after any horse or cattle shows and does not allow food vendors near the animal areas, Schulz said. "I don't know where these individuals could have gotten it," said Schulz.

[The weeklong fair located near Fargo, ND may not have a petting zoo, but the website lists sheep, goats, swine, beef, rabbits, poultry and horses. Direct exposure to the animal is not necessary, especially with cattle -- as the loose nature of the cow manure readily contaminates the surroundings.

The specific serotype of EHEC is not yet stated but the prototypic EHEC strain is, of course, serotype O157:H7. As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6).

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.
