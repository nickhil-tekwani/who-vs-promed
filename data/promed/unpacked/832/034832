Viet Nam: new suspected human case of avian influenza in the Chau Hoa commune
-----------------------------------------------
A middle-aged man from Viet Nam's central Quang Binh province has
been hospitalized on suspicion of having contracted avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection, according to the local newspaper "Youth" on
Wed 23 Mar 2005. The 41-year-old man from Chau Hoa commune, Tuyen Hoa
district, was admitted to a hospital in Hue central city on Mon 21
Mar 2005, after having a high fever for a week.
Last week [3rd week March 2005], a 5-year-old child from the commune
was confirmed to have contracted the H5N1 virus. He is now recovering
after being treated in the hospital since 15 Mar 2005. Recent local
media reports said his 13-year-old sister, who died on 9 Mar 2005,
was also infected with H5N1. However, this has not been confirmed by
Viet Nam's Health Ministry [because no clinical samples were
collected for laboratory testing - Mod.CP]
Since mid-December 2004, a total of 26 local people have been
reported to have contracted H5N1 virus infection, of whom 14 have
died.
