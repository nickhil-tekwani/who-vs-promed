In Egypt, as of 6 Apr 2015, the Ministry of Health and Population has reported 134 human cases of influenza A(H5N1), including 38 deaths. Since 2006, Egypt has reported 336 human cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

The number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in Egypt with onsets of illness from January to March 2015 is the highest reported for a 3-month period since the start of the epidemic in 2006. New cases have been reported every month since the surge that started in November 2014 (Figure). No similar surge in cases has been reported in any other country.

As communicated by WHO, during the recent surge (November 2014 to March 2015), cases have been reported from 21 of the 29 Egyptian governorates. Females represented 60 percent of the cases. The number of fatal cases in Egypt in 2015 is the highest ever reported (Table). The case-fatality rate for 2015 so far is 28 percent, although, for recent cases, the final outcomes may not yet be known. There appears to have been no discernible trend in the case-fatality rate between 2006 and 2015. According to the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO; see EMRO report in ProMED mail Avian influenza, human (89): WHO update, Egypt, H5N1 20150409.3287821), despite the recent surge in human cases, the demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the recently reported cases do not significantly differ from previous periods.

The increase in human cases in Egypt may be attributed to several factors, including increased circulation of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry, lower public health awareness of risks in middle and upper Egypt, seasonal factors such as closer proximity to poultry because of cold weather and possibly longer survival of the viruses in the environment. A high-level joint WHO/FAO/OIE mission to Egypt was conducted in March 2015 to assess the risks associated with the influenza A(H5N1) viruses and to recommend control measures.

ECDC assessment
----------------
This ongoing outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) among poultry and humans in Egypt has now caused more cases during one season than has been reported from any other country globally. The virus belongs to a clade [2.2.1] that appears to have been restricted to transmission in Egypt and neighbouring countries for several years. An emergence of a novel cluster within this clade was recently reported, which might explain the increase in poultry infections and/or human cases. No publicly available evidence is available to rule out ongoing human-to-human transmission in smaller clusters of cases, and detailed epidemiological studies are urgently needed.

The conclusions from the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment published on 13 Mar 2015 remain valid.

The increase in human cases of A(H5N1) infection during the winter months 2014-2015 may be due to an increase in the circulation of A(H5N1) among backyard poultry and exposure to infected poultry across Egypt. Identification of such sporadic cases or small clusters is not unexpected, as avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses are known to be circulating there among poultry. Strict implementation of control measures to reduce and eliminate infection in poultry is essential for reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission and human cases. Enhanced human infectivity of the circulating virus and the protection conferred by the poultry vaccines currently in use should be further investigated. Surveillance in poultry as well as in humans needs to be strengthened and, ideally, coordinated. Intervention programmes to reduce virus circulation in the country should be reinforced. Travellers visiting Egypt should avoid direct contact with poultry and birds or uncooked/untreated poultry products.

Cases of H5N1 avian flu have been surging in Egypt since the fall [2014]. Egypt has now passed Indonesia as the country with the most human cases in total since the virus was 1st found in Hong Kong almost 20 years ago. About 1/3rd of the 336 cases Egypt has reported to the World Health Organization since 2006 have been fatal. H5N1 avian flu still has killed more people in Indonesia. Despite the sudden unexplained increase -- Egypt has officially reported 125 cases since January 2015 -- the World Health Organization said the country's "current risk status" has not changed.

Nearly all cases still appear to involve contact with poultry; the disease has long been endemic in birds throughout Egypt, where many households have small poultry flocks. Transmission from birds to humans continues to be sporadic, the W.H.O. said.

Virologists have long feared that the highly lethal virus will mutate to become more transmissible among humans, but it is not clear exactly which mutations would do that. A study by Japanese and Egyptian scientists published last week in _mBio_, and noted by the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, looked at viral genetic sequences found in Egyptian H5N1 victims and the effects of 59 mutations detected in them. When replicated in the laboratory, some of those mutations appeared to make it easier for the virus to attach to human airways cells; other mutations made the virus better at reproducing there.

That means if the virus circulating in Egyptian birds infects enough human victims, "it could rapidly adapt to growth in the human airway microenvironment," the authors of the new study concluded.

"Abstract
--------
A change in viral hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding specificity from alpha2,3- to alpha2,6-linked sialic acid is necessary for highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) virus subtype H5N1 to become pandemic. However, details of the human-adaptive change in the H5N1 virus remain unknown. Our database search of H5N1 clade 2.2.1 viruses circulating in Egypt identified multiple HA mutations that had been selected in infected patients. Using reverse genetics, we found that increases in both human receptor specificity and the HA pH threshold for membrane fusion were necessary to facilitate replication of the virus variants in human airway epithelia. Furthermore, variants with enhanced replication in human cells had decreased HA stability, apparently to compensate for the changes in viral receptor specificity and membrane fusion activity. Our findings showed that H5N1 viruses could rapidly adapt to growth in the human airway microenvironment by altering their HA properties in infected patients and provided new insights into the human-adaptive mechanisms of AI viruses.

Importance
----------
Circulation between bird and human hosts may allow H5N1 viruses to acquire amino acid changes that increase fitness for human infections. However, human-adaptive changes in H5N1 viruses have not been adequately investigated. In this study, we found that multiple HA mutations were actually selected in H5N1-infected patients and that H5N1 variants with some of these HA mutations had increased human-type receptor specificity and increased HA membrane fusion activity, both of which are advantageous for viral replication in human airway epithelia. Furthermore, HA mutants selected during viral replication in patients were likely to have less HA stability, apparently as a compensatory mechanism. These results begin to clarify the picture of the H5N1 human-adaptive mechanism." ... -more

This is a significant advance elucidating at least one possible explanation for the increased level of transmission of H5N1 being observed in Egypt in 2015. Certainly, there may be other contributing factors as outlined in [1] in the ECDC report, but this is strong evidence of selection for genetic changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) in H5N1 virus strains isolated from infected humans that are associated with phenotypic changes in the virus. The investigators found that H5N1 clade 2.2.1 viruses can rapidly adapt to the human respiratory tract microenvironment by mutations that alter the balance of HA properties in H5N1-infected patients. The study provides new insight into H5N1 evolution in infected humans that needs to be followed up by experimental studies conducted with animal models in a biologically secure environment.

Because of concern over infection with H5N1, CDC advises travelers to Egypt to follow these recommendations to prevent being exposed to H5N1 (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/h5n1-avian-influenza-outbreak-in-egypt-prompts-cdc-travel-advisory-81499/):

Do not touch birds or other animals: Do not touch animals, whether they are alive or dead; avoid live bird or poultry markets and avoid other markets or farms with animals (wet markets).

Eat food that is fully cooked: Eat meat and poultry that is fully cooked (not pink) and served hot; eat hard-cooked eggs (not runny); don't eat or drink dishes that include blood from any animal and don't eat food from street vendors.

Practice hygiene and cleanliness: Wash your hands often; if soap and water aren't available, clean your hands with hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol; don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean; cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing and try to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging or sharing eating utensils or cups, with people who are sick.

Since its introduction in Egypt in 2006, avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has been circulating in domestic poultry in the country and has been the source of sporadic human infections. Almost all cases of H5N1 infection reported in humans in recent times have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments, WHO states.

H5N1 is a viral disease of birds. People rarely get H5N1, but when they do, it usually happens after close contact with infected birds (such as chickens, turkeys, geese, pigeons, and pheasants) or their body fluids. Human illness from H5N1 has ranged from mild eye infections and flu-like symptoms to pneumonia and death. H5N1 does not spread easily between people. The risk of H5N1 to travelers is extremely low, according to the CDC. - Mod.LK
