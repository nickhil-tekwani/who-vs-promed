Hand Foot and Mouth Disease in Viet Nam
---------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) is closely monitoring the current
situation of hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Viet Nam. Since 1
Jan 2011 to 4 Sep 2011, 98 deaths and 42 673 cases of HFMD have been
confirmed across the country. Three quarters of the deaths have been
in children aged 3 years or less.

Viet Nam has implemented precautionary measures in an effort to reduce
the spread of HFMD. The Prime Minister of Viet Nam has instructed all
provincial authorities and relevant ministries to strengthen
prevention and control measures against HFMD. In addition, formal
guidelines for surveillance, prevention and treatment of the disease
have been sent to all health care facilities. "The number of HFMD
cases might increase in the coming months when preschools and
kindergartens resume," said Minister of Health, Ms. Nguyen Thi Kim
Tien.

HFMD is a common viral illness among infants and children under the
age of 10 years but can also occur in adults. The virus causes fever
and sores in the throat and blisters on the hands and feet. The
disease is usually mild and patients generally recover in 7-10 days.
The disease is caused by a group of viruses known as Enterovirus
[Family _Picornaviridae_, Genus _Enterovurus_]. One of these is EV71
[Species _Human enterovirus A 71_] which on occasion can cause severe
complications, including neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory
problems. In Viet Nam, the epidemiology of HFMD is complex but EV71 is
responsible for nearly half of the infections in those who have tested
positive for HFMD.

Typically, HFMD sporadically occurs across Viet Nam but remains most
concentrated in the Southern and Central provinces. Higher rates of
infection occur from March to May and September to December.

The Ministry of Health has begun conducting 84 training courses on
surveillance, prevention and control of HFMD that include preventive
medicine staff at provincial, district and communal level as well as
pre-school teachers. There is also an ongoing nation-wide public
awareness campaign on television and other media to highlight these
preventative measures.

The World Health Organization (WHO) along with the United States
Center for Disease Control (CDC) is supporting the Ministry of
Health's General Department of Preventive Medicine (GDPM) efforts to
control the disease. "WHO and CDC are working closely with MOH to
determine the cause of the unusual increase in cases and deaths, and
investigate the epidemiological characteristics of HFMD in Viet Nam,"
Acting WHO Representative, Dr. Graham Harrison said.

The virus causing HFMD is spread from person to person through direct
contact with virus contained in nose and throat secretions, saliva,
blister fluids, stools of infected persons and asymptomatic carriers.
The virus is most often spread by virus-contaminated hands and through
contact with contaminated surfaces. Infected persons are most
contagious during the 1st week of the illness. The viruses that cause
HFMD can remain in the body for several weeks after a patient's
symptoms have gone away. This means that the infected person can still
pass the infection to other people even though they may appear to be
well.

Currently, there is no vaccine or specific medication against HFMD.
However, the risk of infection is lowered significantly with high
standards of personal and environmental hygiene. The Ministry of
Health recommends the following precautionary measures:
- Frequent hand washing with soap and water, especially after changing
diapers, before preparing food, before eating, and before feeding
children, and after using the toilet;
- Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing;
- Thoroughly clean contaminated surfaces and soiled items 1st with
soap and water and then with common disinfectant in homes, in child
care centers, kindergartens and schools, and maintain clean
surroundings;
- Avoid sending children to child care centers, kindergartens or
schools if they are suffering from HFMD;
- Follow safe food and water practices. Children should eat
well-cooked food and drink boiled water. Do not share feeding
utensils;
- Avoid close contact (kissing, hugging etc.) with infected people;
- Monitor children's health for early detection of symptoms and take
those who have persistent fever and blisters on hands, feet or mouth
to the nearest health facility for treatment as soon as possible;
- Ensure that kindergartens and pre-schools provide hand-washing
facilities, with soap and water, for young children, and have an
appropriate system for managing human waste.

It would be relevant to learn the identity of the other enteroviruses
found to be present during the course of this outbreak, and their
relationship to severity of disease. - Mod.CP]
