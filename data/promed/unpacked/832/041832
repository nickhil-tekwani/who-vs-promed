The number of whooping cough cases in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has more than doubled in the last year. So far this year [2015], 115 cases of the illness have been reported to ACT Health, compared with 49 for the same period in 2014.

ACT chief health officer Dr Paul Kelly said whooping cough, or pertussis, was a serious respiratory infection that could be life-threatening for infants. "In babies, the infection can sometimes lead to pneumonia and occasionally brain damage, and can be life threatening," he said.

"There has already been an increase in the number of pertussis notifications in the ACT so far in 2015. This has mainly been across the 0- to 14-year age group compared to the same time in 2014 (45 cases in 2015 to 13 cases in 2014). Especially children aged 10 to 12 (21 cases in 2015 compared to 3 cases in 2014)."

But Dr Kelly said it was usual for the number of cases to spike once every few years. "The increased number of notifications is expected, as pertussis notifications tend to increase every few years, as they last did in 2010-11," he said.

"One of the issues with the vaccine is that it's very effective but it doesn't last as long as previous vaccines we've had."

Dr Kelly said there were discussions with companies to develop a longer lasting vaccine. "We need to improve the immunogenicity as it's called of the vaccine so that it can last longer," he said. "[But] it is vital that parents ensure all their children are up to date with their scheduled vaccinations to minimise the risk of whooping cough circulating not only in their own families but in the wider community including schools."

From today, pregnant women in their 3rd trimester can access free whooping cough vaccinations. "I encourage all pregnant women to ensure they are vaccinated in their 3rd trimester, ideally at 28 weeks or as soon as possible after, as it offers the best protection for babies until they have completed their primary immunisation for pertussis at six months of age," Dr Kelly said.

"Family members and other adults in close contact with young babies should also discuss the benefits of the vaccine."

[A recently published paper in PLoS Computational Biology suggests waning immunity from the acellular pertussis vaccine as the main reason for the dramatic increase in pertussis cases:

Abstract
--------
Over the past 10 years, the incidence of pertussis in the USA has risen steadily, with 2012 seeing the highest case number since 1955. There has also been a shift over the same time period in the age group reporting the largest number of cases (aside from infants), from adolescents to 7-11 year olds. We use epidemiological modelling and a large case incidence dataset to explain the upsurge. We investigate several hypotheses for the upsurge in pertussis cases by fitting a suite of dynamic epidemiological models to incidence data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) between 1990-2009, as well as incidence data from a variety of sources from 1950-1989.

We find that: the best-fitting model is one in which vaccine efficacy and duration of protection of the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine is lower than that of the whole-cell (wP) vaccine, (efficacy of the first 3 doses 80 per cent [95 per cent CI: 78-82] versus 90 per cent [95 per cent CI: 87-94]), increasing the rate at which disease is reported to NNDSS is not sufficient to explain the upsurge and 3) 2010-2012 disease incidence is predicted well. In this study, we use all available USA surveillance data to: 1) fit a set of mathematical models and determine which best explains these data and 2) determine the epidemiological and vaccine-related parameter values of this model. We find evidence of a difference in efficacy and duration of protection between the 2 vaccine types, wP and aP (aP efficacy and duration lower than wP). Future refinement of the model presented here will allow for an exploration of alternative vaccination strategies such as different age-spacings, further booster doses, and cocooning."
