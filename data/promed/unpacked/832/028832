Outbreaks of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] seem to have doubled in Gujarat, the 1st state to have reported the prevalence of this tick-borne viral disease in the country.

In the last 3 years [2011-2013] alone, there have been 30 positive cases and 14 deaths due to CCHF, half of which were reported in a cattle-rearing community known as the Bharwads, stated experts who participated in the day-long conference "Healthy Gujarat: Agenda For Action," organised by the Gujarat Health and Family Welfare Department on Tuesday [3 Dec 2013].

"The 1st instance of CCHF was detected in Kolat village near Ahmedabad in January 2011. That year, there were 4 outbreaks of CCHF. The year 2012 was reportedly milder, with 2 outbreaks. However, in 2013, there were as many as 8 outbreaks," said Dr Kamlesh Upadhyay, a professor in the Department of Medicine at Ahmedabad-based BJ Medical College & Civil Hospital.

"In the last 3 years, there have been 30 positive cases of virus infection, 50 percent of which are from the Bharwad community," added Upadhyay, who was speaking on the topic of "Disease Burden" of Gujarat. "Today, there are 14 sites in Gujarat from where CCHF has been reported," he said.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40 per cent. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks harboured by livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of those infected. Infected domestic animals do not usually show signs of infection, which may contribute to the general lack of awareness of the disease even in endemic areas and a toleration of tick bites.

CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals.
