Pfizer acknowledges vaccine link to Bleeding Calf Syndrome
----------------------------------------------------------
Pfizer Animal Health has acknowledged evidence of a 'strong
association' between the use of its PregSure BVD vaccine and the later
development of 'Bleeding Calf Syndrome.' The company voluntarily
suspended sales of PregSure BVD in Germany in April 2010 and then in
other member states in June 2010. It said this action was initiated as
a precautionary measure in light of reports that the vaccine may have
an association with Bovine Neonatal Pancytopaenia (BNP), the disease
also known as 'Bleeding Calf Syndrome' that was 1st recognised in the
UK in 2009.

The product's European Marketing Authorisation was suspended by the
European Commission later in 2010.

In a recent letter to vets, Pfizer Ruminants business unit director
Paul FitzPatrick said that although PregSure BVD is no longer
available in Europe, it is continuing to investigate the 'adverse
events.' "While scientific investigations are still ongoing, Pfizer
recently became aware of independently conducted epidemiological
surveys which describe a strong association with the use of PregSure
BVD and the later development of BNP," Mr Fitzpatrick said. He said
laboratory-based investigations are also ongoing to try to understand
the pathogenesis of BNP.

"While investigations have looked at a wide range of different
causes, research suggests that the consumption of colostrum by the
calf may be a key triggering event for the occurrence of BNP," he
wrote in the letter. "At the moment, the most prevalent hypothesis
under discussion is an immunopathological reaction due to alloreactive
antibodies (antibodies to "self") which are transferred to the calves
via colostrum. Research has reported that these antibodies may be
being stimulated by cell components present in the vaccine as a normal
consequence of vaccine production."

He stressed that data collected by Pfizer and passed on the
Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) indicate that BNP 'remains a
relatively rare disease, with incidence rates varying by country'.

As of 28 Feb 2011, Pfizer had received reports of 4623 calves
described as affected by BNP out of 14 million doses sold in the EU.
There have been 445 calves reported from the UK. Mr Fitzpatrick said
Pfizer was 'very aware of the concerns and frustrations of farmers and
veterinarians regarding BNP' and that the company 'remain committed to
working with the regulatory agencies and other investigators to better
understand BNP.'

Pfizer is involved in a major scientific collaborative research
initiative with independent academic institutions and is carrying out
research in its own laboratories on the subject, he added.

SAC [Scottish Agricultural College], the Scottish research college
that 1st recognised the condition in 2009 [in the UK], welcomed the
announcement. Brian Hosie, head of SAC consulting, Veterinary
Services, said: "Farmers should not be deterred from using vaccination
to assist them control BVD as part of the Scottish Government's
campaign to eradicate this important disease of cattle from Scotland.

"They should discuss the appropriate use of BVD vaccines and the
control of BVD with their own vet. Likewise they should report any
unusual illness and unexpected losses to their vet who may arrange for
the submission of samples including carcasses to one of SAC's Disease
Surveillance Centres for detailed investigation."

born to cows previously affected with this condition. While the
condition may be rare on a statistical basis the events reported, see
below, are somewhat catastrophic for the affected herd, and affected
both beef and dairy herds. - Mod.MHJ]
