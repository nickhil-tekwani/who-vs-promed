Not less than 80 000 of Yellow [fever vaccination] cards that are issued to Nigerians as a proof of being administered with the yellow fever vaccine before travelling out of the country are now being sold in the markets and streets, without the travellers taking the vaccine, and causing the government to lose up to N200 million [USD 554 017].

This was revealed in a report of an investigation carried out by Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, a civil society organization working in the areas of accountability and anti-corruption.

The report revealed that some top officials of the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) carted away some of the e-yellow cards printed by the Federal Government which are meant to be issued to individuals after they must have taken the vaccine at the designated clinics, airports and border posts.

The card which officially costs N2,500 [USD 7] is sold to prospective travellers at prices as high as N5,000 [USD 14] without taking the vaccine, thereby undermining the objective of the yellow fever immunization.

The government has been making efforts to recover all the stolen cards with little success.

A copy of the yellow card obtained by PRIMORG undercover reporter was marked B947006 bearing the Nigerian coat of arms and a scan code to verify the card's authenticity while the medical detail in the card was pre-filled, indicating the type and milligram, the date and the official stamps of the "PORT HEALTH OFFICE, FMOH NIGERIA".

Earlier in February [2019], the federal government had approved the issuance of Yellow Card that could be read electronically to eliminate the incidents of forgery and sales of fake cards at designated locations.

[The sale of fake yellow fever (YF) vaccination cards has been a problem in Nigeria in the past. There has also been a problem of purchase of legitimate cards but without vaccination. Issuance of these new YF vaccination cards has been an effort to avoid the fake card problem. The theft of the new cards and their sale illegally to individuals who did not receive the vaccine was not contemplated. The theft and illegal sale of thes cards poses more than just a financial loss to the government. More serious is the threat that this illegal practice poses to the public's health in Nigeria and abroad. In Nigeria. possession of a vaccination card will not necessarily indicate that the owner has, in fact, been vaccinated. More serious still is that individuals infected in Nigeria but having illegally purchased cards without vaccination could travel to YF-free areas in the world that have abundant vector populations, such as Southeast Asia, and initiate ongoing transmission within a largely unvaccinated and hence susceptible population. The results could be catastrophic. One wonders if admission of Nigerians into these susceptible countries will be denied, as occurred in South Africa several years ago when there was a fake YF vaccination card situation. - Mod.TY
