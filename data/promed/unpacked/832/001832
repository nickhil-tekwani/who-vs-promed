Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, 1996:
As an important strategy for addressing emerging infections in the
United States, in 1994 CDC began implementing Emerging Infections
Programs (EIPs) in state health departments, in collaboration with local
health departments, academic institutions, and organizations of health
professionals. EIPs are sites that conduct special population-based
surveillance projects, emphasize collaborative epidemiologic and
laboratory projects, and pilot and evaluate prevention efforts.
The primary foodborne diseases component of the EIP is the Foodborne
Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), a collaborative effort
among CDC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug
Administration, and the EIP sites. The objectives of FoodNet are to:\
1) determine more precisely the burden of foodborne diseases in the
United States,
2) determine the proportion of specific foodborne diseases
associated with certain contaminated foods or with other exposures, and
3) provide the frame-work to respond rapidly and collaboratively to
emerging foodborne diseases.
This report summarizes preliminary results
from FoodNet for 1996, which document regional and seasonal differences
in the incidence of certain bacterial foodborne diseases, and presents
findings of the 1995 baseline survey of clinical laboratories, which
suggests that, for some pathogens, factors other than differing
laboratory practices accounted for regional variations in incidence.
