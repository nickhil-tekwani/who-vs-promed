Seal virus fears recede
---------------------------
The impact of a deadly virus that killed hundreds of seals in Scottish
waters could have been worse, according to experts. Scientists believe the
threat of the Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) has now receded, leaving
hundreds rather than thousands of dead animals.
Last time the virus hit the UK in the 1980s it killed almost 20 000
seals. Experts predicted a similar story when it appeared again last
summer. But while 2000 of the animals have died in England, about 800
carcasses have turned up on Scotland's coasts -- and not all the deaths are
due to the virus.
One theory is that because the disease arrived comparatively late in the
year, many seals were back in the water, where the virus is less likely to
spread. The current cold snap means they are likely to stay offshore, not
group closely together on land.
There is no known cure for the virus, nor any way of preventing it.
In 1988, an outbreak of the PDV virus caused the death of 17-18 000 common
seals and 300-400 grey seals throughout northern Europe. In Scotland, more
than 1300 common seals died.

[The PDV epizootic (2002) was terminated in Northern Europe during
October-November 2002. The accumulated number of dead seals, mainly on the
Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, German, and Dutch shores, was summarized on 6
Dec 2002 (Seal Report No 44 by the Common Wadden Sea Secretariat,
Wilhelmshaven ), totaling 18 504. The largest numbers were reported from
the Kattegat/Skagerrak waters -- Denmark, Sweden, and Norway (6927 dead
seals), followed by Lower Saxony (3851), Schleswig Holstein (3338), and the
Netherlands (2244). The seal die-off was officially considered over in
Lower Saxony, Germany as well as in the Netherlands at the end of November
2002. The vast majority of the reported mortalities related to Common
Seals. For further details refer to
<http://www.waddensea-secretariat.org/news/news/Seals/01-seal-news.html#44>.
The breakdown of the number of reported dead seals of each species in the
UK has been published on 09 Jan 2003 by the Sea Mammal Research Unit
(SMRU) in Aberdeen:
Species/ England/ Scotland/ Wales/ Northern Ireland/ UK Total
Common Seals/ 292/ 90/ 0/ 48/ 430
Grey Seals/ 85/ 435/ 149/ 21/ 690
Indeterminate/ 2386/ 321/ 3/ 24/ 2734
Total/ 2763/ 846/ 152/ 93/ 3854
During the period between 18 Dec 2002 and 07 Jan 2003, 101 dead seals were
still reported around the UK. For further details see SMRUs Status Report
No 20:
