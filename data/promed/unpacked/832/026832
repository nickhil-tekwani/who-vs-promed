'Yellow dragon' diseases detected in Costa Rica
-----------------------------------------------
Costa Rica, northern neighbour of Panama, announced today [21 Feb
2011] the detection of the most devastating disease affecting citrus
crops, huanglongbing (HLB) (which means "yellow shoot disease" in
Chinese, from the yellow colour of leaves).

The State Phytosanitation Service (SFE) reported the disease in
northern Costa Rica; however, for the time being, it is a limited
outbreak. Four citrus trees were found to harbour the causative agent
north of Alajuela near the Nicaraguan border. SFE increased
surveillance for additional cases and to [identify] affected crops
[for destruction]. [It is] still not known how this disease reached
the Americas.

This condition is a severe threat for the 25 000 hectares [61 800
acres] of orange crops. SFE indicated that it is suspected to have
came from Nicaragua, [probably with] contaminated [plant] material.
Since the disease appeared in Nicaragua, a control program in Costa
Rica was implemented.

In Panama, orange producers expressed their concern that this
condition may reach Panama, as it has occurred in Mexico, Nicaragua,
Honduras, and [now] Costa Rica.

[Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, caused by the fastidious
phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus occurs
throughout much of Asia. The pathogen was reported for the 1st time in
the Americas from Brazil in 2004 (ProMED-mail post 20040723.2012) and
from the US (Florida) in 2005 (ProMED-mail post 20050910.2683). Its
vector is the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is
also often spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission, and with
infected plant material to areas where the vector is already present
(as mentioned above for Costa Rica).

The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of
the narrow host range of the vector. 2 other related pathogens, _Ca._
L. africanus (including a subsp. capensis) and _Ca._ L. americanus and
their specific vectors exist in the respective areas. Citrus greening
has not been reported from the Mediterranean region or Australia.

HLB is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting
leaves and fruits. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of
leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel
and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient
deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season
flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable
fruit. Disease management requires an integrated approach including
use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use
of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control
of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Biological control by interplanting
of guava is being trialled (ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018).
