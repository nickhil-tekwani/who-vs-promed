114 cattle killed as mystery disease hits Makwanpur
---------------------------------------------------
As many as 114 cattle died of an unknown disease in the Kankada, a
remote VDC [village development committee] of Makwanpur district
[Central Region] within a week.

According to a local resident a total of 11 buffaloes, 22 cows and
oxen, 52 pigs, and 29 goats died of the disease in Garling of the VDC
by Tuesday [16 Aug 2011].

Similarly, dozens of cattle fell sick due to the unknown disease in
the village, said Nepal Chepang Association, Makwanpur secretary
Mahesh Chepang.

The cattle get high fever, woes in saliva, and other problems at the
beginning and die within 8-10 hours of their sickness

[This event of an undiagnosed die-off in domestic animals, apparently
characterised by a rapid course while reportedly involving a wide
spectrum of domestic animal species (buffaloes, cattle, swine, goats)
may be due both to infectious and non-infectious (mainly
toxicological) agents.

ProMED-mail's systematic publication of data and rumors on undiagnosed
die-offs and disease in livestock, particularly in ruminants and in
areas which were not "historically free", is encouraged by the recent
declaration of global rinderpest eradication. In a world declared free
of rinderpest, the earliest exclusion of even the slightest
possibility of rinderpest recurrence is essential.

This, in line with recommendation No 8 of the Joint FAO/OIE Committee
on Global Rinderpest Eradication (May 2011}, as follows:
"National authorities should ensure that:
a. Rinderpest remains a notifiable disease;
b. A surveillance system (including rumour tracking and early
detection) should be maintained to detect disease events;
c. Suspect cases be rapidly investigated (using existing mechanisms
or, where appropriate, the FAO/OIE Crisis Management Centre) and
necessary actions be promptly taken."

Information on the cause of the reported mortality is requested. -
