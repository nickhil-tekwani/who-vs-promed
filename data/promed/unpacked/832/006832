Democratic Republic of Congo: external situation report 2
---------------------------------------------------------
Situation update
----------------
WHO continues to monitor the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Likati Health Zone, Bas Uele Province located in the north east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Between 15 May and 16 May 2017, 2 new suspected EVD cases were reported in Azande (1 case) and Nambwa (1 case) health areas in Lakati Health Zone. As of 16 May 2017, 21 suspected EVD cases including 3 deaths (case fatality rate of 14.3 percent) have been reported. Most of the cases presented with fever, vomiting, bloody diarrhoea, and other bleeding symptoms and signs. The cases have been reported from 4 health areas, namely Nambwa (13 cases and 2 deaths), Mouma (3 cases and 1 death), Ngayi (4 cases and no deaths), and Azande (1 case and no deaths).

Two of 5 blood samples collected from the initial cases and analysed at the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) laboratory in Kinshasa tested positive for Zaire ebolavirus. Approximately 400 close contacts have been registered in Likati Health Zone and are being monitored.

Current risk assessment
-----------------------
The risk is high at the national level due to the known impact of Ebola outbreaks, remoteness of the affected area, limited access to health care, and suboptimal surveillance.
- Risk at the regional level is moderate due to the proximity of international borders and the recent influx of refugees from Central African Republic.
- The risk is low at global level due to the remoteness and inaccessibility of the area to major international ports.
The risk assessment will be revaluated by the 3 levels of WHO according to the evolution of the situation and the available information.
WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor reports of measures being implemented at points of entry.

WHO recommends the implementation of strategies that have proven to be effective in preventing and control of Ebola outbreaks. These strategies include (i) coordination of the response, (ii) enhanced surveillance, (iii) laboratory confirmation, (iv) contact identification and follow-up, (v) case management, (vi) infection prevention and control, (vii) safe burials, (viii) social mobilization and community engagement, (ix) logistics, (x) risk communication, (xi) vaccination, (xii) partner engagement, (xiii) research, and (xiv) resource mobilization. ...more

This Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was notified to WHO by the Ministry of Health on 11 May 2017. The cluster of cases and deaths of previously unidentified illness have been reported since late April 2017. Likati Health Zone shares borders with 2 provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and with the Central African Republic (Fig. 1). The affected areas are remote and hard to reach, with limited communication and transport networks.

[2] News
17 May 2017 Nigeria: FG [Federal Government] activates Ebola preparedness plan
http://allafrica.com/stories/201705170402.html
[In response to the renewed outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) the Nigerian Government has activated a preparedness plan by setting up the Ebola Preparedness Working Group, EPWG, even as passengers with fever arriving from a county where Ebola has been detected are to be investigated.
Disclosing this in a statement, Technical Assistant, Communications of Nigeria Center for Disease Control, NCDC, Dr Lawal Bakare, said the Ebola Preparedness Working Group was put together at an emergency meeting convened on [Mon 15 May 2017] by NCDC, to coordinate immediate risk assessment of the situation in the DRC and coordinate the strengthening of prevention and preparedness for any potential introduction of the Ebola virus into Nigeria.] ...more

16 May 2017 DR Congo: WHO notes 19 suspected Ebola cases in the DRC
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/05/who-notes-19-suspected-ebola-cases-drc
[Today the World Health Organization (WHO) said there were an additional 2 new cases of suspected Ebola virus disease in a remote northern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This raised the total number of cases to 19, with 3 deaths likely caused by the deadly disease.

In a situation report, the WHO's African regional office provided more details on the presumed index patient: a 39-year-old man who died en route to the Likati Health Center on [22 Apr 2017]. His motorcycle taxi driver subsequently died on [26 Apr 2017] after developing Ebola symptoms on [24 Apr 2017].

As of yesterday [15 May 2017], the WHO said the case-fatality rate is 15.8 percent. The cases reported are from 3 areas in northern DRC: Nambwa (10 cases and 2 deaths), Mouma (3 cases and 1 death), and Ngayi (6 cases and no deaths). A total of 125 contacts of the 19 suspected cases have been identified and are being followed daily. The external report said there are 6 patients currently hospitalized, and WHO and local health officials were working to disinfect materials and homes of patients and put in place safe burial practices.

Only 5 samples from suspected patients have been subjected to laboratory testing, with 2 confirming infection with the Ebola Zaire subtype.

There is no mention of a vaccine implementation plan in the external report. Today [16 May 2017], Stat reported that that GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, was preparing doses of the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV to deliver to the DRC. When asked by CIDRAP News if there were plans to vaccinate health care workers or those facilitating burials, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jašarević said the WHO and its partners are "completing the epidemiological investigation to better understand the extent of the current outbreak and who are potentially at risk of Ebola.

"If pertinent, ring vaccination, as used in the phase 3 study in Guinea, would be the recommended delivery strategy," Jasarevic said. Ring vaccination focuses on inoculating those who had close contact with a patient first, then moving out in concentric, widening circles of contacts.

In other Ebola news, there are 2 new developments that stem from the 2014 West African [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] outbreak, history's deadliest. Japanese researchers have developed the world's 1st self-donning system for surgical gowns, eliminating the risk of environmental contamination.

"The notable feature of this gown is that there is practically 'zero splashing' of infectious substances from the gloves as the wearer can take off the gown while wrapping the gloves inside-out at the same time, as opposed to a conventional gown where the wearer needs to take off the gloves first in order to undo the strings and the belt," said a press release from Osaka University.]

17 May 2017 As DRC Ebola cases grow, expert sees parallels to Guinea
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/05/drc-ebola-cases-grow-expert-sees-parallels-guinea
[In an external situation report released today [17 May 2017], the World Health Organization (WHO) said 2 new suspected Ebola cases are being investigated in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and a US expert says events are unfolding in ways reminiscent of Guinea in 2014 at the onset of a massive West Africa outbreak.

The new cases are in Azande and Nambwa, both in the Likati health district. There are now 21 suspected cases of the deadly virus, and 3 deaths.

A map accompanying the situation report shows Azande located far east of the Likati health district, on the border of South Sudan. But the written report only names Central African Republic as a country bordering the districts with suspected Ebola.

In addition to 2 new cases, the WHO's report says that 400 close contacts of patients are now being monitored, a steep rise from 125 contacts reported yesterday [16 May 2017]. 5 new blood samples are also being tested now at the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) laboratory in Kinshasa, and INRB is deploying 2 mobile laboratories to Buta and Likati.

For now, the number of confirmed Ebola infections remains at 2.

To date 3 countries have implemented entry screening at airports (Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe), and the United Kingdom and Rwanda are suggesting that travelers avoid unnecessary travel to the affected area.

Similarities to Guinea
----------------------
The case in Azande concerns Ebola expert Dan Lucey, MD, MPH, a microbiologist and immunologist with Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Lucey said that any potential case on the border of South Sudan is worrisome, because cross-border spread in that part of Africa could have great consequences for controlling and monitoring the outbreak.

Lucey said that he saw some similarities between what's happening in DRC and what happened in Guinea in 2014.

"Both outbreaks began in a remote location, and both had cases presenting without traditional hemorrhagic features," said Lucey in an interview. Moreover, Lucey said that a report from the WHO's African Regional Office dated 12 May 2017 denoted a cluster of illnesses in Bangbo, which is near Azande.

Lucey said his curiosity was piqued, and in searching Bangbo he discovered a FluTrackers post describing 34 deadly cases of diarrhea on 7 and 8 Apr 2017. FluTrackers is an infectious disease news message board. He is careful to note that the illnesses occur in a region familiar with cholera and meningitis, but if the cluster was indeed Ebola, the outbreak could be more widely spread than previously thought.

National budget of USD 8 million set
------------------------------------
Also in today's [17 May 2017] situation report was the 1st mention of the DRC government's working budget of about USD 8 million for the national fight the outbreak.

In addition, the WHO has donated 3000 sets of personal protective equipment (PPE) to Likati and 100 body bags. Its office in the DRC has finalized a response plan and USD 1.4 million budget.]

WHO preparation
16 May 2017: WHO prepares experimental Ebola vaccine for possible 1st use in Democratic Republic of Congo
https://www.statnews.com/2017/05/16/ebola-drc-vaccine/
[Excerpts.
" ... everything is being put in place to use the vaccine if it is requested or if it turns out the need accelerates."
The outbreak, reported to the WHO last week [week of 8 May 2017], has grown to 20 suspected cases. 3 of the infected have died.

It will also be challenging to get doses of vaccine to the area if the government decides to use it. The experimental Ebola vaccine must be stored at -80 deg C [-112 deg F], which would involve transporting it in freezers.

The vaccine, which goes by the working name rVSV-ZEBOV, is being developed by pharmaceutical giant Merck. Although there are other experimental Ebola vaccines at various stages of development, this is the only one so far which has been shown to protect people from the deadly virus.

That evidence comes from a clinical trial conducted in Guinea during the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2015. The trial showed the vaccine induced quick protection, a desirable characteristic for a vaccine designed for use in controlling outbreaks.

That study used what is known as a ring vaccination design, in which people who had been in contact with a confirmed case were vaccinated to prevent ongoing spread. The WHO has said if DRC uses the Ebola vaccine, it should vaccinate using the ring technique, said Tarik Jašarević, a spokesman for the WHO.

In an agreement with GAVI, Merck is required to have on hand at all times at least 300 000 doses of the Ebola vaccine. There is also currently a small number of doses -- around 800 or 1000 -- in Geneva, Berkley said.

A spokeswoman for Merck said the company is in contact with WHO, Doctors without Borders -- which has sent a response team to the outbreak site -- and other organizations about the outbreak.

"We stand ready to ship our investigational vaccine for Ebola Zaire ... once appropriate approvals are in place," she said in an email.
Berkley pointed out that because the vaccine has not yet been licensed, there are regulatory hurdles to clear before it can be used, and that can take some time.] ...more

15 May 2017: Ebola survivors have a 'unique' retinal scar
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-05/uol-esh051517.php
[Researchers from the University of Liverpool have conducted a study of Ebola survivors to determine if the virus has any specific effects on the back on the eye using an ultra widefield retinal camera.

Citation. Steptoe PJ, Scott JT, Baxter JM, et al: Novel retinal lesion in Ebola survivors, Sierra Leone, 2016. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(7) doi: 10.3201/eid2307.161608 https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/7/16-1608_article

Abstract. We conducted a case-control study in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to investigate ocular signs in Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors. A total of 82 EVD survivors with ocular symptoms and 105 controls from asymptomatic civilian and military personnel and symptomatic eye clinic attendees underwent ophthalmic examination, including widefield retinal imaging. Snellen visual acuity was less than 6/7.5 in 75.6 percent (97.5 percent, CI 63-85.7 percent) of EVD survivors and 75.5 percent (97.5 percent, CI 59.1-87.9 percent) of controls. Unilateral white cataracts were present in 7.4 percent (97.5 percent CI 2.4-16.7 percent) of EVD survivors and no controls. Aqueous humor from 2 EVD survivors with cataract but no anterior chamber inflammation were PCR-negative for Zaire Ebola virus, permitting cataract surgery. A novel retinal lesion following the anatomic distribution of the optic nerve axons occurred in 14.6 percent (97.5 percent CI 7.1-25.6 percent) of EVD survivors and no controls, suggesting neuronal transmission as a route of ocular entry.
