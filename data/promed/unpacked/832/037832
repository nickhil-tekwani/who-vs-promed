CANINE DISTEMPER - USA (CALIFORNIA)

An outbreak of canine distemper is killing dozens of foxes, skunks and
raccoons in San Mateo County parks, where dying animals have entered
campsites. [Canine distemper is not a human pathogen but park] rangers are
warning visitors to Memorial, Pescadero or Sam McDonald parks in rural
Loma Mar to immediately report and avoid animals that appear to be ill.
Distemper is a cyclical disease that is always present in the wild animal
population, but seems to peak in outbreaks every three to five years,
according to wildlife experts. San Mateo County appears to be a hot spot in
the current distemper outbreak, but state biologists stressed that animals
throughout California harbor the disease.

Reports from campers about strange animal behavior began last month, but park
rangers first saw evidence of the disease August 9 after they trapped a red
fox that was acting abnormally. When they found a dead skunk the next day
and two dead raccoons and another skunk the day after that, they called in
wildlife experts in an attempt to determine what was happening.
Studies of the dead animals quickly ruled out rabies, and Monday it was
confirmed that canine distemper was the cause of the deaths. Because no
stricken animals have been found in the past few days, it is possible the
[outbreak has peaked].
