HANTAVIRUS: PERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION CONFIRMED (02)

From: Kelly McKee <kmckee@foto.infi.net>
I agree with Charlie Calisher ...... just what constitutes genetic identity
for Andes hantaviruses ... and for that matter, how many isolates have been
examined (or should be) to determine the degree of intrinisic genetic
variability? On the other hand, unless there's a big piece missing from
the puzzle, the evidence available makes a pretty compelling case for
interpersonal spread in the case of the physician.

[That Kelly calls these "Andes hantaviruses" suggests we are either talking
about a complex of viruses that are sufficiently distinct to each have its
own name or we are talking about viruses from Andean areas. "How much is
enough?" is a question that has not yet been answered. In any event, this is
a small matter relative to the apparent person-to-person transmission of
this/these viruses. For additional information, see Science 275:605, 1997.
So what is there about this/these particular viruses that allows them to be
transmitted from person to person? Higher titers? Not likely, as the chain
of transmission appears to die out rather quickly. -- Mod CHC]
