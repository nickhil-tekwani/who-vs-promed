Kampala - Blood samples from Moroto District have been sent to French and
Kenyan medical laboratories for Rift Valley Fever (RVF) testing.
Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) last week took the blood samples from four
patients with RVF symptoms in Karamoja.
"We have sent blood samples to a medical laboratory in Paris and KEMRI
(Kenya Medical Research Institute) in Nairobi for the rift valley fever
tests," Joan Liu, an MSF medical worker told The New Vision on the phone
yesterday.

[At the same time Uganda is suffering an extensive lack of blood for
transfusions. - MHJ

[2 "The East African" 16th February, and from "New Vision" 17th February.
Kampala - Uganda is experiencing a serious blood shortage as a result of El
Nino-induced epidemics of malaria and other fevers that have spread to all
areas of the country since last November.
Health officials say demand for blood has trebled in the past three months.
The director of the Uganda Blood Transfusion Services/Nakasero Blood Bank,
Dr Peter Kataha, said that an increase in blood collections had not been
able to keep pace with rising demands for transfusions, especially among
children and expectant mothers.
Said Dr Kataha: "There's a shortage of blood across the country. We are just
overwhelmed. There is an extraordinary increase in blood transfusions," he
said. "Our main problem now is children and expectant mothers because they
are the ones who are succumbing to malaria. The situation is bad because the
usage of blood has more than trebled because of the epidemic of malaria."
Pregnant women and children, who have lower immunity and were thus more
susceptible to malaria, were consuming 75 per cent of blood collected by the
bank. "More than 50 per cent of the blood we collect is used by children
because they are the main victims of malaria and 25 per cent is used up by
women who have got complications in childbirth and the other 25 per cent for
accident victims and other emergencies."
[Last year The blood bank collected a record 50,000 units from voluntary
and replacement donors, up from about 43,000 in 1996. Blood donation has
increased yearly since 1989 when only about 8,000 units were collected. The
country needs about 70,000 units of blood this year in order to be on the
safe side. The blood bank target for this year is 55,000 units.
Dr Kataha said that since November and December last year, most of the blood
donated had gone to treating malaria victims. At the National Referral
Hospital, Mulago, in the middle of 1997, the demand for pediatric blood was
only 10 to 15 units a day; this had now increased to more than 50 units. On
February 6, the bank supplied 53 packs of blood for children to the hospital
and this was still not enough.
Dr Kataha said the situation had worsened following the heavy El Nino rains
experienced from last November, which were accompanied by cholera and fever
pandemics which caused anemic conditions in sufferers and hence need for
more blood.
The director said there had been a steady decline in HIV prevalence in
donated blood from 14.4 per cent in 1989 to 4.3 per cent in 1996. The HIV
prevalence from donors in schools had dropped 5.2 per cent in 1989 to 1.2
per cent in 1996 while in the non-school donors it fell from 14 per cent to
3.9 per cent in the same period. For replacement donors it was at 7.6 per
cent, down from 24 per cent.
He ruled out the possibility of infected blood being transfused
accidentally, saying: "When we bring in blood, we test it and the one which
is HIV positive is destroyed immediately."
Blood was also screened for Hepatitis B, syphilis and other diseases. The
prevalence of Hepatitis stands at about four to six per cent in Southern,
Central and Western Uganda while in the Northwest, Northeast and North it is
eight to 13 per cent. Dr Kataha said the reasons for this were climatic and
that Hepatitis increased as one went towards Sudan.
