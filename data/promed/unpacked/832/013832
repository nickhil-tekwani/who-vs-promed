Foodborne diseases acquired in Bali
-------------------------------------
A 35-year-old male traveler from Sweden was recently admitted to an
intensive care unit in a hospital in North Queensland, Australia,
with life-threatening typhoid following a 3-day visit to Bali in late
October 2003. He stayed there in a hotel-resort and ate at local
restaurants. He was not vaccinated.
The severity of his illness was due to a severe pneumonia, presumably
caused by the typhoid bacterium. He required mechanical ventilation
to manage his respiratory failure, and although the organism was
sensitive to 3rd-generation cephalosporins, his clinical condition
only improved once ciprofloxacin was added to the ceftriaxone therapy.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Hanna for contributing this first-hand report on
another enterically transmitted disease acquired in Bali (see
Shigellosis - Taiwan ex Indonesia (Bali) 20031124.2915.)
Respiratory manifestations of typhoid fever, although not generally
considered, are not uncommon. In Stuart and Pollen's classical
review of 360 cases of _S. typhi_ infection from New Orleans, LA, USA
(1), 87 percent of the patients had coryza, 86 percent had cough, 84
percent had sore throat, and 64 percent were found to have rales on
ausculation. 11 percent of the total were found to have pneumonia.
Although non-salmonella secondary bacterial infections can occur,
salmonellae can be isolated from respiratory secretions. Non-typhi
salmonellae may also cause lung involvement. This is particularly
the case in individuals who are infected with HIV (2,3).
A more classical manifestation of both typhoid and typhus not
generally discussed is the coma vigil or "typhoid state," which may
also be found with a variety of potentially fatal infectious
diseases, including smallpox, anthrax, plague, yellow fever, and
miliary tuberculosis.
The "typhoid state" was reviewed historically, with quotations from
William Osler, George Shattuck and Shakespeare, by Abraham Verghese
(4). Verghese described it as a febrile state of semiconsciousness
accompanied by a muttering delirium. Among the characteristic
findings can be subsultus tendinum (the twitching of fingers and
wrists), carphologia (picking at bedclothes), and floccillation
(picking at imaginary objects).
