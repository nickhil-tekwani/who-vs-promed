FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - TAIWAN (04)
==================================
Date: Wed 25 Mar

>From various news sources in SE Asia:
Since this disease was found on the island early this month, the crisis
concerning foot and mouth disease has worsened. Pigs in farms of over 12
counties and cities have been infected. The number of infected premises has
continuously increased. This disaster damages the agriculture and economics
in Taiwan,and also explores the weakness of animal epidemic prevention and
the inadequate animal quarantine in Taiwan. The disease had been absent from
the island for 68 years.
In order to control the spread of this disease, the Taiwanese government
decided to kill all pigs in all infected areas and to vaccinate all healthy
animals. Millions of pigs need to be slaughtered within a month. The market
will be closed about 10 days. The Pig association in Taiwan has even
suggested to totally stop pig farming for over one year.
Farmers, veterinarians, and the government have never met such a disaster.
The lack of experience causes panic, especially when slaughtering numerous
animals and disposing of their carcases. Such crises result in animal abuse.
These have been amply documented on local TV news programs. Some farmers
buried their animals alive. Some used electric shock, some used poison, but
the lack of expertise caused animals suffering. [It appears that the
inexperienced military involvement may have added to this abuse problem.
MHJ] Some animals were apparently sent for cremation before they had died.
Some other farmers just simply abandoned their pigs on the fields or on the
streets.... Breeders fearful of huge income losses yesterday threatened to
set free hundreds of diseased hogs in Taipei to protest against what they
viewed as the Government's failure to control the disease.
"If the Government fails to give us reasonable subsidies and offer us
financial and technical aid to slaughter the diseased pigs, we will not rule
out setting free hundreds of pigs in Taipei," a Hog Breeding Association
official said.
Since the massacre is inevitable, Life Conservationists Association (LCA)
and all other animal protection organizations and environmental protection
organizations are monitoring and assisting the government to seek more
humane determination. Gun shot has been suggested to the government, but the
government has not responded to the animal protection organizations yet.
A Hog Breeding Association official said that a weekend meeting of breeders
had decided the government needed to provide NT$3,000 (HK$820) per kilogram
in compensation for each pig slaughtered. The Government's Council of
Agriculture has agreed to pay NT$2,400 per kilogram for each meat hog
slaughtered. The Finance Ministry has appropriated NT$10 billion (S$500
million) in loans to pig farmers and pork processers hit by the outbreak.
The Economics Ministry has also offered up to US$30 million (S$52 million)
to help tide pig farmers over the period. Agricultural authorities have
agreed to compensate farmers to the tune of 60 per cent of the value of each
pig. Domestic prices for hogs have plummeted by 70 per cent to US$1,500 per
head.
Council figures showed that 37,569 pigs in 5,919 breeding farms in 12 counties
had contracted the disease, while 11,943 had died of it as of Saturday.
Breeders put the number of infected hogs at more than 150,000, out of a
total population of 14 million. Twelve of Taiwan's 26 constituencies have
been declared infected areas. The number of infected pigs in these wards
numbers 9.42 million.
The outbreak has halted pork product output by leading food processors.
But perhaps the hardest hit are pork exporters. Taiwan pork exports were
US$1.55 billion (HK$12 billion) last year, according to the Board of Foreign
Trade. A government official said the lost exports would cut this year's
Gross Domestic Product forecast by 0.5 percentage points to 5.78 per cent.
Government statistics show the export ban may cost as many as 50,000 jobs.
The Economics Ministry said if all 14 million hogs were infected, GDP growth
would be cut a further 1.4 per cent with direct losses of NT$270 billion to
the 100 related industries. Taiwan had expected an economic growth of 6 per
cent this year. Chien Chin-ching, chairman of the Taiwan Agriculture
Association, said about one million people were involved in pork-related work.
People have stopped buying pork, sending the price of chicken shooting up 30
per cent at supermarkets and the traditional open markets.
