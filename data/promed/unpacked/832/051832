Yuri Fyodorov of the epidemic-prevention department of the Minstry of
Health, Russia, said the bacteria discovered in the Moscow river on 11 July
1997 are cholera O139 Bengal. They have not been able to identify any
human cases. The Moscow suburbs affected by the sewage discharge are
Voskresensk and Yegorievsk.
[Cholera O139 is a new strain affecting Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia,
Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka & Thailand in addition to the El Tor type, with
occasional importations into Europe. This report suggests that there may
be a number of Asian immigrants living in the suburbs from which the sewage
is coming. The meningitis outbreak in Moscow in early 1996 was said to
have involved Asian immigrants, mainly Vietnamese; see: Meningitis - Russia
