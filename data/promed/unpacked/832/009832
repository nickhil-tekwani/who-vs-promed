Germany's national disease control center says the number of people
reported sick in a deadly bacterial outbreak is still rising even
though German officials say there is hope the epidemic is abating.

The Robert Koch Institute told The Associated Press on Wed 8 Jun
2011, that another person has died in Germany from the _E. coli_
[O104:H4] infection, raising the toll to 24 in Germany, plus 1 in
Sweden. The number of reported cases is up by more than 300 over the
previous day to 2648, including nearly 700 suffering from a serious
complication that can cause kidney failure [hemolytic uremic
syndrome].

Even though the reported cases are going up, there is often a lag in
the reporting time and German health minister Daniel Bahr says the
number of new infections "are clearly going down."

[300 more infections are reported which is more than the 94 reported
yesterday (7 Jun 2011).
The absolute numbers reported per day do not necessarily reflect when
the illness began so that new onset cases (reflecting further spread)
can still be decreasing. - Mod.LL]

EHEC outbreak: update 11
------------------------
The outbreak remains primarily centred in Germany, and investigations
continue into the nature of the unusual _E._ coli serotype and its
source.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
-------------------------------
As of 7 Jun 2011 at 15:00 CET, Germany had reported 689 HUS cases
(including 18 fatalities): 47 more cases and 3 additional deaths than
the previous day. 69 percent of cases were in females and 87 percent
in adults aged 20 years or older, with the highest attack rates per
100 000 population in the group aged 20-49 years. Case-onset dates
ranged from 1 May to 4 Jun 2011.

Enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ (EHEC)
---------------------------------
As of 7 Jun 2011 at 15:00 CET, 1959 cases of EHEC infection (without
HUS) had been reported in Germany (6 fatal, as 1 death reported on 7
Jun 2011 had not been confirmed): 276 more than the previous day. 60
percent of cases were in females and 88 percent in adults aged 20
years or older. Case onset dates ranged from 1 May to 4 Jun 2011.

The Robert Koch Institute, in Germany, states that the current HUS
and EHEC notification data, as well as data from the surveillance of
bloody diarrhea in emergency departments, show an overall decreasing
trend in the number of cases. It is uncertain whether this decline is
due to changes in consumption of raw vegetables and/or to the waning
of the source of infection.

Other countries
---------------
As of 7 Jun 2011 at 23:00 CET, 12 other European countries had
reported a total of 33 HUS cases (1 fatal) and 64 EHEC cases (none
fatal). There were 2 more HUS cases and 9 fewer EHEC cases reported
than the previous day. As the revised European Union (EU) case
definition is being applied, a number of cases reported earlier have
been excluded:
Country / HUS / EHEC
Austria / 0 / 2
Czech Republic 0 / 1
Denmark / 8 / 12
France / 0 / 2*
Luxembourg / 0 / 1
Netherlands / 4 / 2
Norway / 0 / 1
Poland / 2 / 0
Spain / 1 / 1
Sweden / 15 / 31
Switzerland / 0 / 3
United Kingdom / 3 / 8
*7 cases of bloody diarrhea have yet to be confirmed.

In addition, the CDC in the USA have published information on 3 HUS
cases (1 confirmed and 2 suspected) and 1 suspected EHEC case (without
HUS) in the USA linked to this outbreak. On 7 Jun 2011, the Public
Health Agency of Canada reported on 1 suspected case of _E. coli_ O104
infection (without HUS), in a person with travel history to northern
Germany and with links to a confirmed case of _E. coli_ O104 infection
in Germany.

All but 1 of the HUS and EHEC cases above were in people who had
traveled to or lived in Germany during the incubation period for
infection, typically 3-4 days after exposure (range: 2-10 days). An
increasing number of cases is laboratory confirmed as EHEC serotype
O104:H4, or more precisely a strain of enteroaggregative
verocytotoxin-producing _E. coli_ (EAggEC VTEC) O104:H4.
Investigations continue into the source of the outbreak.

Note
----
EHEC and HUS have exclusive notification categories, so case numbers
should not overlap. The figures in any rapidly evolving outbreak,
however, are provisional and subject to change for a variety of
reasons. In providing the information above, WHO wishes to recognize
the contribution of its Member States, and technical partners such as
the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control and a number of WHO collaborating centers.

[3] A cucumber reprise
Date: Wed 8 Jun 2011
Source: The New York Times [edited]
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/world/europe/09ecoli.html


As Germany's tally of deaths increased in what has become one of the
world's most lethal infections of _E. coli_, new elements of confusion
surfaced Wed 8 Jun 2011, with conflicting signals about whether the
outbreak is abating and what caused it.

Initially, the German authorities blamed cucumbers, tomatoes, and
lettuce from Spain for the infection, which has been spreading since 1
May 2011. Then, last weekend [4-5 Jun 2011], investigators switched
their attention to sprouts grown in northern Germany as a potential
cause.

On Wed 8 Jun 2011, even as the authorities said the sprouts were
still prime suspects, the hunt took a new and apparently baffling turn
when the state authorities in Magdeburg, in eastern Germany, far from
the original epicenter of the infection in northern Germany, said
traces of the pathogen identified in the outbreak had been found on
discarded cucumber leftovers in a garbage can belonging to a family
among those sickened by _E. coli_.

Holger Paech, the state health ministry spokesman in Magdeburg, said
it was unclear how the bacterium got onto the cucumber at the home of
a family where 3 people had sickened, 1 of them with hemolytic-uremic
syndrome whose treatment has strained intensive care units in many
other parts of Germany. The 3 family members had no known contact with
the worst infected areas of northern Germany, he said.

The discarded cucumber had been in the garbage can for a week and a
half, he said, and "there will always be an element of doubt" about
how it had become contaminated.

On a broader scale, differences emerged Wednesday [8 Jun 2011]
between the federal Health Ministry and the Robert Koch Institute over
the status of the outbreak.

Mr Bahr struck a cautiously optimistic tone on Wednesday during an
emergency meeting in Berlin of health officials from Germany and the
European Union. "There is much to suggest that we have put the worst
behind us," he said. While this did not mean the outbreak was fading,
he said, it seemed that fewer people were being diagnosed.

The Robert Koch Institute, however, was far from certain that the
worst was over. "There is a declining trend in new cases but it is not
clear that it is because the outbreak is really waning or whether it
is because the population are being more careful in what they eat," it
said in a statement.

[4] Neurological symptoms
Date: Mon 6 Jun 2011

Science (AAAS) [edited]

Researchers are now analyzing the genome of the _E. coli_ O104:H7
bacterium to understand its evolutionary history and possibly identify
its source. Closer analysis of the genome might also offer some clues
to how the Shiga toxin made by the bacterium is attacking the brain.
This toxin normally targets the kidney, triggering the sometimes fatal
development of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Usually neurological
symptoms are seen in only a few percent of HUS cases, but in the
current outbreak "about half the patients with HUS are developing
neurological symptoms," Christian Gerloff, head of the neurology
department at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, told
ScienceInsider.

Alarm bells started going off when some patients showed problems
finding words or giving the date, Gerloff recalls. It quickly became
clear that a lot of patients were developing problems reading or doing
simple calculations. "Patients were mixing up words and were
disoriented. Later they developed muscle twitching and then
progressing to epileptic fits," Gerloff says.

At the clinic in Hamburg, a team of neurologists now screens all HUS
patients once a day to look for any unusual signs and treats any
patients with neurological symptoms with anticonvulsants to prevent
epileptic fits. But the most surprising thing to Gerloff was that the
bacteria do not appear to cause strokes. "That is what we were
expecting mostly," Gerloff says. But patients with neurological
symptoms showed no signs of structural brain damage when examined with
magnetic resonance imaging. "It is usually assumed that the Shiga
toxin binds to the endothelium and leads to swelling and clotting,
obstructing the vessels," Gerloff says. "So why are we not seeing any
strokes?"

Autopsies of 2 patients could lead to new insights in the next few
days, the neurologist says. But for the time being, it is just one
more perplexing detail of a pathogen that has sprung quite a few
surprises already.

[Most of the reports have focused on the renal complication of HUS
with just peripheral mention of neurological complications. Overall,
anywhere up to 50 percent of cases of HUS (with most cases in children
in contradistinction to this series) have had neurological involvement
(1,2). The most common clinical manifestation is seizures, either
generalized or focal. Other manifestations include altered
consciousness without seizures, personality changes, coma, and
transient hemiplegia. Although metabolic alterations or hypertension
occur, these factors are not likely able to explain the disturbances.
Overall, and as seen in the current outbreak, neurological symptoms
seem to suggest a more severe HUS, with higher mortality.

A disease similar to HUS which occurs primarily in adults is
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and is much more likely to be
associated with neurological symptoms rather than the opposite in
HUS.

The higher rate of neurological symptoms in this outbreak may be
related to the amount of toxin produced or other factors related to
the relatively unique organism.

[5] Commentary
Date: Wed 8 Jun 2011

The stream of news from the _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in Germany has
been so steady that it's been hard to catch my breath long enough to
post on it. The Robert Koch Institute in Germany said today, 8 Jun
2011, that they think the epidemic curve is cresting, which makes me
unusually late to the party. Nevertheless, since there are likely to
be more cases and more deaths, and a long struggle still to understand
what happened, I thought it would be useful to count the things that
we can say for sure, and those that remain puzzlingly open questions.

First: Is this the largest _E. coli_ outbreak ever? According to
food-safety uber-attorney Bill Marler, this outbreak, more than 2600
victims, 13 countries, 26 deaths, is dwarfed only by a 1996 epidemic
in Japan. If it's not the largest, it is likely to have produced the
largest percentage of serious illness: as of today, 8 Jun 2011, there
are 725 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (689 in Germany, 33 in the
rest of Europe, 3 in the United States), according to WHO.

Those case counts pose a 2nd question: Is there something different
about the strain in this outbreak? As Richard Knox of NPR [US National
Public Radio] points out, the outbreak has put about 1 out of every 3
victims in the hospital, compared to 1 in 10 for previously known
toxin-producing strains. That raises 2 possibilities: either the
strain is different, more on that in a moment, or the case-finding has
not turned up the mild cases that would change the denominator and
therefore dilute the percentage back to something more normative.

So, then, 3rd: Is this strain different? In certain key ways, yes,
and we know that thanks to a global, largely volunteer, crowd-sourced
genetic analysis, which by itself is something new. And which is
spread across many blogs and sites, but the best round-ups are
probably at Mike the Mad Biologist
[http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2011/06/some_more_thoughts_about_the_g.php],
who has added some crucial analysis of his own, and The Alignment Gap
[http://phylogeo.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/some-updates-on-the-crowd-sourcing-around-husec41-genome-analyses/].
Among the differences noted between this strain and its apparent
recent ancestor, isolated in Germany in 2001, is a change in the gene
for the adhesion protein that makes the bacterium "sticky" in the gut,
prolonging the course of illness.

>From my point of view, the most important difference between this
strain, its 2001 ancestor, and just about any previously known
outbreak strain of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ or STEC, including
any of the O157 outbreaks dating back to the 1992-3 Jack-in-the-Box
one that made O157 a household name, is that this one is massively
drug resistant. The Guardian was kind enough to ask me to write a
piece about this on Sunday [5 Jun 2011;
http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/05/deadly-ecoli-resistance-antibiotic-misuse
(which on Monday was named one of The Atlantic's "Five Best Monday
Columns"; thanks, Atlantic!).

It's not fair use or good blogging to quote myself lavishly, so
here's the key point. According to the Koch Institute, the German O104
strain is resistant to at least a dozen antibiotics in 8 different
drug classes: penicillins; streptomycin; tetracycline; the quinolone
nalidixic acid; the sulfa drug combination
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; 3 generations of cephalosporins; and
the combination drugs amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,
piperacillin-sulbactam, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Put all those
together, and what they signal is that O104 possesses what is called
ESBL resistance (for "extended spectrum beta-lactamase"). According to
the Koch Institute's analysis, the strain has acquired 2 genes that
confer that resistance, TEM-1 and CTX-M-15. if this were a strain that
needed to be treated with antibiotics, there are only a few
antibiotics that would work, notably the carbapenems, the drugs of
last resort for Gram negative bacteria.

If there is any good luck in this outbreak story, it is that STECs
are not usually treated with antibiotics, because killing the
organisms causes them to release their toxins, which then starts a
cascade that brings on HUS. So the finding that this strain is
resistant is not clinically relevant. But it's of huge microbiological
significance, because it underlines yet again how resistance DNA is
moving between bacteria in a largely untracked fashion. ESBL
resistance has been spreading through Europe for a decade in hospital
organisms such as _Klebsiella_, but a community outbreak of this size
is surely unprecedented.

Some questions that still need answers:
What's the source? The suspect food has been cucumbers, then sprouts,
then not sprouts, then cucumbers again just today [8 Jun 2011], and
also today, maybe sprouts again. Related question: with so many cases,
and therefore presumably so many interviews of victims going back
several weeks, why hasn't the source been narrowed down?

Where is Europe's traceability system? In the wake of the 2006 US
outbreak of O157 in fresh spinach, a lot of attention was paid to
creating more complete records of chains of custody of produce, so
that a harvest batch could be tracked through the entire distribution
system instead of just from its last stop to its next one. Wasn't
Europe supposed to do this better?

How many steps away from agriculture is this outbreak? As Mark
Bittman emphasized today, sooner or later it all comes back to manure,
because _E. coli_ is a gut bug. Is the source wildlife, as it may have
been in 2006? Sick farm workers, as the German government has
asserted? Can the newly acquired resistance genes throw any light on
its source? CTX-M-15 has been found in _E. coli_ in chickens.

Poland's Chief Sanitary Inspectorate has confirmed that a 29-year-old
Polish woman who lives in Germany had contracted _E. coli_ [O104]. The
woman was taken to a hospital in Szczeczin, northwestern Poland.

Authorities are now awaiting test results to confirm 4 additional
suspected cases. These 4 cases are also people who were recently in
Germany, said Jan Bondar, Chief Sanitary Inspectorate spokesperson.

The exact source of the disease has not been identified, and Polish
as well as European authorities expect that further possible cases of
infection will continue to appear.

Swiss health authorities reported new 5 _E. coli_ bacterial
infections on Wed 8 Jun 2011, which they linked to the outbreak that
has killed 25 people, almost exclusively in Germany.

The Federal Office of Public Health said on its website that of
Switzerland's 27 confirmed cases of EHEC _E. coli_ in 2011, including
13 since early May 2011, "5 are of the same bacterial strain as in
northern Germany."

It said the 5 victims, who had travelled to Germany before the
outbreak began, were in stable condition and showed no signs of
complications.

The Health Protection Agency [HPA] announced the 12th confirmed case
in this country as the authorities on the continent continued to
search for the cause of the outbreak.

All of the cases in England have been "related to recent travel to
Germany," where hundreds of people have suffered food poisoning in
recent weeks, and travelers to the country are being reminded not to
eat raw tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce.

The HPA said that the new case in England caused by the previously
unseen strain of _E. coli_ O104 bacteria was of "bloody diarrhea",
making it the 3rd with this particular symptom. The other 9 have
developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
