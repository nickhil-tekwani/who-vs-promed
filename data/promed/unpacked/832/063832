In the past 6 months Russia's Altai territory reported 48 encephalitis
cases, including two fatalities. Local epidemiologists have said that the
situation is tenuous and that 120 people were under treatment for diseases
diagnosed as those transmitted by ticks. None of the ill people had been
vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis, caused in this region by
Russian Spring-Summer encephalitis virus. The report said that local
medical centres do not have adequate stores of the vaccine because only a
third of the supposed allocations have been provided for the territorial
program.

[This is the third report we have received regarding tick-borne
encephalitis outbreaks in far eastern Russia. Adequate vaccines exist.
Whether adequate funding exists to purchase these vaccines is another
question. - Mod.CHC
