CUTANEOUS ABSCESSES - MIDDLE EAST EX FIJI (02)

A few months ago, the Scottish MRSA Reference Laboratory was sent a
(methicillin-sensitive) _Staphylococcus aureus_ isolated in Scotland from a
patient (male, aged about 30, a soldier) who had been in Fiji and the
Middle East and who presented with abscesses (details not known to me at
present). This isolate was PCR positive for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin
gene. We inferred from its PFGE pattern that it belonged to a group of
isolates others of which are ST30. Other ST30 isolates include the "South
West Pacific" group of MRSAs (PVL positive, SCCmec Type IV).
PVL positive _S. aureus_ are certainly a plausible explanation for the
cases described and some at least could be MRSA (community type).
