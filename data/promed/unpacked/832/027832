In Madang [province], agriculture officials quarantined the popular tourist port to combat the spread of the Bogia coconut syndrome, a disease that threatens coconuts and other related plants such as oil palm and betelnut.

Copra is a major cash crop in PNG [Papua New Guinea] and the government must be serious to combat this syndrome. Already around many coastal areas in PNG, coconut trees are defoliating and dying.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the respective areas and can also affect a large number of other palm species. Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually within 4 to 6 months.

The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the pathogens cannot be excluded, and some weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Jumps of LY across apparently unaffected coconut populations have been observed possibly due to aerial spread of infectious vector insects or human activities.

Commercial control of LY diseases relies on replanting with resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used Malayan Dwarf hybrids is causing great concern. Reasons for the resistance breakdown are still uncertain.

In 2011, a phytoplasma of the LY group was identified as the cause of the Bogia syndrome in PNG (ProMED-mail post 20110223.0592) representing the 1st report of a LY-like disease of coconut in Oceania. Symptoms appear on both newly planted and old palms and resemble LY in other areas, except that necrosis of inflorescences is absent. The disease is reported to spread rapidly and to have caused losses of over 5000 trees. It is considered a threat to regional coconut production as well as the economically important national oil palm industry.
