Guidelines for treatment of patients with Ebola virus diseases are urgently needed

The Ebola virus diseases, EVD, epidemic is still unfolding in West Africa with Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia most severely affected. This week it was estimated that there are at least 500 new cases every week and the total number of cases has passed 16 000, but there is probably a substantial underreporting of both cases and fatalities (1). There are some doubts about the mortality rate, but one recent case series reported a mortality of 72 percent (2).

The outbreak is unprecedented in magnitude and few would have predicted that such an outbreak was possible. However, it seems clear that it is not due to a more pathogenic version of the Ebola virus and indeed low virus genetic diversity has not been observed in person-to-person virus transmission (3, 4). Therefore, the current situation is most probable due to the poor status of the health care systems especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone, which have both recently suffered long civil wars that have left the countries drained for educated health care staff and with dilapidated health infrastructure.

There is no approved, specific treatment of EVD. Several experimental anti-virals, immune-therapy (5) and use of hyperimmune plasma from survivors have been proposed, but data from controlled clinical trials are lacking (6).

After a slow start, the international community, including many non-governmental organizations, NGOs, are managing treatment facilities in West Africa.

But what are these treatment facilities offering?

Very little data has emerged. One published study reported a mortality of 72 percent, but astonishingly the study contained no information of any treatment (2). Thus the question remains if the patients included in that study received any treatment at all. These patients were all from Sierra Leone and in contrast, nationals from industrialized countries are evacuated and treated in their home country and survived (7, 8). In particular, the case evacuated to Germany (7) shows very clearly that the treatment with classical tools used for patients in severe shock (bacterial septicemia, severe malaria) is expected to substantially reduce mortality. The patients received 30 liters of fluid intravenously over the 1st 3 days, had paralytic ileus and thus could not take oral fluid, had a fecal output of 14 liters over 3 days and severe hypokalemia. The same problems were seen in the 2 patients evacuated to the United States and one of these also had malaria (8).

Is this a proper level of inpatient care in the Ebola treatment facilities or should we aim higher?

A mortality of 43 percent was reported in a case series of 80 patients with EVD from Guinea where 76 percent of the patients received intravenous fluid even though only 1 liter over 24 hours on average (9). If the difference in mortality between the report from Sierra Leone (72 percent) (2) and Guinea (43 percent) (9) are due to the use of intravenous fluid and even though one liter intravenous fluid seems very modest in view the need in the 3 expatriated cases (7, 8), it seems that intravenous fluid replacement may significantly reduce mortality in the treatment centers perhaps by as much as 50 percent. This can be done in the conditions prevailing in West Africa using pulse, blood pressure, body weight and urine output as guidance and using simple point-of-care tests for measuring electrolytes, but require intravenous access, abundant fluid for intravenous administration and trained staff.

It is telling that the NGOs have not published any treatment results and it is unclear if there is any control of treatment outcomes in EVD treatment facilities. Simply notifying confirmed cases and outcomes (fatal or not) and publishing weekly updates broken down to different NGOs would allow quality control and allow adjustment of treatment algorithms adopting procedures resulting in the highest survival rates. The difference in mortality between the 2 published case series (2, 9) indicate that this is urgently needed.

We must ensure that treatment is not palliation and that the so-called "Ebola hospitals" are hospitals and not hospices for untreated cases with the sole purpose of isolating cases from the community.

It is estimated in a study from Liberia that only 25 percent of known Ebola patients had been admitted to an Ebola treatment facility as of 14 Aug 2014 (10). The reasons for this low number are many, but a key point is probably that the chance of survival in these units does not differ significantly from patients staying at home.

The national governments in the affected countries do not have the resources nor the manpower to ensure the quality of the care provided by NGOs and others. Thus the World Health Organization or others with the necessary resources should establish a notification system, to ensure that facilities are providing treatment and not only palliation and publish, for instance, weekly updates of survival figures broken down for each NGO to ensure quality control, transparency and optimization of treatment algorithms.

The German patient (7) had septicemia and one of the American patients had malaria (8). Both diagnoses can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation and will thus easily be confused with Ebola. If diagnostics are not available perhaps every patient in this highly endemic malaria area should receive a malaria treatment course and an infusion of a broad spectrum antibiotic, for instance ceftriaxone.

It is important to know if a patient is HIV positive, as a low CD4 T cell count is expected to increase the risk of a fatal outcome, and thus treatment efficacy if at all possible should be stratified according to HIV status.

It is urgently needed to develop guidelines for treatment of EVD patients and to distinguish treatment from palliation and hospitals from hospices.

We suggest that the World Health Organization take the leadership and develop guidelines for treatment including:

1. Diagnosis of EVD
2. Principles for intravenous fluid replacement
3. Principles for measurement of electrolyte imbalance
4. Principles for correction of electrolyte imbalance
5. Diagnosis and treatment of concomitant malaria
6. When to administer antibiotics based on suspicion of septicemia
7. HIV testing
8. Implement a reporting system for all EVD treatment facilities

These measures can all be implemented under the field conditions in West Africa, provided the staff are trained in high volume fluid replacement. Participating should be a prerequisite for receiving financial support from governments and receiving permission to manage EVD treatment facilities.

The staffing of the treatment facilities is a crucial issue and it can be speculated that the NGOs do not have access to physicians and nurses with knowledge and experience in high volume fluid replacement and correction of electrolyte imbalance.

One solution could be twinning with hospitals in industrialized countries where these hospitals adopt an EVD treatment facility and ensure staffing and training. This of course would need support from the national health authorities. Such a program would ensure effective intravenous fluid replacement therapy were provided, most probably significantly reduce mortality, ensure confidence in the treatment facilities from the local population and thus increase the use of these facilities (earlier admission and higher proportion of cases treated, isolated and recovered).
