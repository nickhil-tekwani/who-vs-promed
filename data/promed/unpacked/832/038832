Influenza A viruses of high pathogenicity (infection with) (non-poultry including wild birds) (2017-), USA
----------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 30 Dec 2021
Confirmed: 13 Jan 2022
Reported: 14 Jan 2022
Reason for notification: new strain in a zone or a compartment
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [HPAI]
Serotype: H5
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory test
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Colleton County, South Carolina
Started: 30 Dec 2021
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
American wigeon (_Anas americana_): Anatidae-Anseriformes/ - / 1 / - / - / - / -

Affected population: wild hunter-harvested American wigeon (_Anas americana_)

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: migratory waterfowl.

Epidemiological comments: On [13 Jan 2022], the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed goose/Guangdong lineage H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) by partial sequencing of the HA gene from a sample collected as part of the APHIS Wildlife Services Avian Influenza Surveillance in wild birds. APHIS WS collected the sample on [30 Dec 2021] from a hunter harvested American wigeon in Colleton County, South Carolina. The Clemson Veterinary Diagnostic Center (a member of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network) initially tested the sample and forwarded the non-negative H5 sample to NVSL for confirmation. Full genome sequence is in process. According to article 10.4.1.4 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code, member countries should not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notification of infection with any influenza A viruses in birds other than poultry.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), Ames, Iowa (National Laboratory) / American wigeon / 1 / Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 13 Jan 2022 / positive

[Readers will be interested to review a webinar titled "US poultry industry stakeholder update: H5 HPAI in North America", that the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service hosted recently (January 2022). This webinar consists of a panel of avian health experts who discussed the recent Canadian highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) detection, APHIS communication and current agreement with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), new HPAI restrictions for pet birds from Canada, 2022 US wild bird avian influenza (AI) surveillance plans, as well as US poultry AI surveillance and the importance of biosecurity for prevention of AI outbreaks.
