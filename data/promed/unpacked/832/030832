The health authorities of Aragon [Spain] have opened an investigation to determine the source of an outbreak of salmonellosis that has affected 9 people, several of whom have had to be admitted to hospital centers. Sources have informed, according to the Department of Health, that the contagion occurred during the past Fiestas del Pilar, at the end of last week [week ending 12 Oct 2014].

The same sources have explained that 9 people in a group of friends who had left the feast eve presented with the same symptoms of gastroenteritis. 3 of the patients had to be hospitalized. 2 have been discharged, but the other continues to be in the hospital.

Testing showed these 3 patients were identified who were suffering from salmonellosis so an investigation has begun to determine the source among the various establishments catering to the group.

[Given the size of the festival, cases of salmonellosis related to this cluster may be widespread.

In October, Zaragoza celebrates the Pilar Fiestas (http://www.spain.info/en_US/que-quieres/agenda/fiestas/zaragoza/fiestas_del_pilar.html). These are the main annual fiestas in the regional capital of Aragon, characterized by a broad range of activities that fill the streets with fun, colour and entertainment for a week at the least. The programme brings together theatre performances, concerts, children's entertainment (puppet shows, clowns, magic...), shows, dance, bullfights, craft exhibitions, all kinds of music (from regional folk to pop-rock and electronic sounds at the Independent Music Festival) and many more events. There are also fireworks, the traditional "Giants and Big-heads" parade, sports competitions and exhibitions. The "penas" (fiesta associations) also play a vital role at the celebrations, which get underway with an opening speech at the Town Hall.

The most important day is 12 Oct, the feast of La Virgen del Pilar, patron saint of the city. A mass Floral Offering takes place from early that morning: thousands of people from all over the world, dressed in traditional costumes, come to Plaza del Pilar Square to leave flowers before the Virgin. Meanwhile, 13 Oct sees the Offering of Fruit. And at dusk, the Rosario de Cristal takes place. It is a procession of carriages and glass lanterns that runs through the streets of Zaragoza. - Mod.LL
