Over 2000 cows die of foot-and-mouth disease in Uganda
-----------------------------------------------
Over 2000 cows are reported to have died of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
Nakasongola district, some 130 km north of Kampala, in the last 3 months,
reported The New Vision newspaper on Wednesday [1 Dec 2004].
Livestock farmers in the district are worried of the local authorities'
failure to impose quarantine measures in the district. "We are perplexed
with the local leaders' opening of the cattle markets, which they had
closed because of the outbreak of the disease. Continued trading in
infected cattle will spread the disease to other areas in the country,"
Mugisha, a resident of Kolongo, told the newspaper.
FMD has been reported in 15 out of the 56 districts in Uganda and has
affected more than 50 000 animals, the newspaper said.
It reported that vaccination has been used only to a very limited extent
because of the slow and inadequate release of funds to procure vaccines.
Minister of State for Agriculture Kibirige Sebunnya was quoted as saying
that, in the last financial year [2004], only 60 million shillings [USD 34
300] were released from the treasury, compared to the 400 million shillings
[USD 229 000] required to purchase the vaccine.
