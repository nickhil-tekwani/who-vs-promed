Plague was detected in ground squirrels in the Russian southeastern Republic of Tuva last month [July 2020], the country's consumer rights and human welfare watchdog [Rospotrebnadzor] said on Tuesday [11 Aug 2020], adding that the entire population engaged in livestock breeding in the area was subject to vaccination.

"There is an epizootic activity of Tuva mountain natural plague foci recorded almost every year since 1964. In July 2020, local epizootics in the habitat of long-tailed ground squirrels were registered on the territory of Mongun-Tayginskiy and Ovyursky [districts] of the Republic of Tuva. An active epizootic process was registered at one of the sites," Rospotrebnadzor said.

The watchdog added that as many as 4810 people had been vaccinated in the republic's affected areas.

"Field deratization has been carried out on 3.9 hectares [9.6 acres] of land. Medical institutions' epidemic readiness has been checked and training sessions to identify patients with plague have been carried out. Health education is also underway," Rospotrebnadzor noted.

In early July [2020], the republic's Agriculture Ministry called on the residents to observe preventive measures in connection with the bubonic plague outbreak in Mongolia. Since 2016, Russia has registered no cases of plague in humans.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. Humans are at risk of becoming infected if they are exposed to rodent fleas.

In the natural foci of Tuva, the vector is the flea _Citellophilus tesquorum altaicus_ and the mammal host is the long-tailed ground squirrel (_Urocitellus undulatus_). For a picture see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tailed_ground_squirrel#/media/File:Spermophilus_undulatus1.jpg. - Mod.PMB
