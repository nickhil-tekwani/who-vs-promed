Indonesian doctors are investigating the outbreak of an unknown
illness that has killed 8 people and infected 22 in a Javan village,
a health ministry official said on Thursday [26 Jul 2007].
"This is not SARS nor bird flu, but it is certainly as worrying,"
Marwan Nusri of the Disease Control and Environmental Health
Department told Reuters. "At first we suspected poisoning, but after
checking their food and water we didn't find any toxic substance."
Nusri said around 30 people in the remote Kanigoro village, in
Central Java province, had been hospitalised in the past 3 days with
similar symptoms such as severe nausea and seizures.
The 1st batch of 8 people died because of delayed treatment, he said.
Nusri added the Health Ministry was looking at the possibility of a
virus or bacteria that targets a specific internal organ, but
declined to give details. Another Health Ministry official said the
illness had spread fast through the village, but does not appear to
have any obvious infection pattern. "Initial findings indicate the
virus or bacteria causes liver dysfunction," said the official, who
refused to be named. So far, the hospital has released 9 people, and
of the 13 people still undergoing treatment, 2 are in critical
condition, he said. Both officials said tissue samples from the
victims would be sent to Jakarta this week for further examination.
Local officials initially linked the outbreak with bird flu, a
disease endemic in bird populations in most parts of Indonesia, media
reports said. Indonesia has had 81 confirmed human deaths from bird
flu, the most of any country in the world.
Several local media said the victims were targets of "dark magic".
Indonesia is predominantly Muslim, but mysticism is an integral part
of local culture.

[The description of this so far limited outbreak of a highly lethal
disease in the Central Java province of Indonesia is confused and the
accounts from different sources are contradictory. There seems to be
agreement that the victims have not contracted a specific respiratory
infection, such as, SARS or avian influenza, but rather had
contracted infection by an organism attacking a specific internal
organ, possibly the liver.
Further information on the progress of analysis of this outbreak and
the identity of the infectious agent (if any) is awaited with interest.
