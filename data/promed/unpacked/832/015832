The New Mexico Department of Health announced today, 26 Sep 2013, a confirmed case of plague in a 52-year-old man from Santa Fe County. Confirmatory testing was performed at the Department's Scientific Laboratory Division. This is the 3rd human case of plague in New Mexico and in the USA in 2013. An environmental investigation will take place at the man's home to look for ongoing risk to others in the surrounding area.

"Whenever there is a human case of plague the Department takes several steps to ensure the safety of the immediate family, neighbors, and health care providers," said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. "We inform neighbors door-to-door about plague found in the area and educate them on reducing their risk. We determine whether individuals close to the patient may also have been exposed to the plague and recommend preventative treatment when necessary."

Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, but can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets.

"We are seeing plague activity in several different locations of north-central New Mexico," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian at the Department of Health. "Everyone needs to be aware of the situation and take precautions to avoid rodents and their fleas."

Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report to the New Mexico Department of Health.

The 1st 2 human plague cases in New Mexico this year [2013] were in a 15-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl, both from Torrance County. Both have recovered. There was one human plague case in New Mexico in 2012, 2 human cases of plague in 2011, no cases in 2010, and 6 human cases of plague in 2009, one of them fatal.

[ProMED once again thanks Dr Paul Ettestad, New Mexico State Veterinarian, for this posting. Dr. Ettestad added:

"All 3 of the human cases in New Mexico this year presented with inguinal buboes [enlargements of the lymph nodes in the groin area]. All 3 have recovered. The peak of cases in New Mexico is usually in the summer months of June and July, but with all of the recent rains in the area, fleas are able to survive longer outside of rodent burrows while questing for a blood meal." - Mod.LL
