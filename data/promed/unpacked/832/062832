Trichinellosis, Buryatiya, Russia from bear meat
---------------------------------
12 inhabitants of the Severobajkalskiy district of the Republic of
Buryatiya, including 7 children, have contracted trichinellosis. The
patients had all eaten meat from a bear, which had not been properly
cooked, stated the territorial management of the Russian consumer
supervision of the Republic of Buryatiya.

Children and relatives of one hunter have been infected and are now
hospitalized in the infectious branch of the Severobajkalsk station
hospital. The bear was killed without the hunter having obtained a
hunting licence and was not submitted for veterinary inspection.

the infection could have been prevented by thoroughly cooking the
meat before eating it. - Mod.EP]
