SCRAPIE - CANADA
****************

An outbreak of scrapie has, according to this story, forced the Canadian
federal government to slaughter almost 5,000 sheep in Quebec over the past
14 months.
Only a small number of the animals tested positive for scrapie but entire
flocks have been destroyed to prevent it from spreading further. Normally
Canada reports about five flocks a year, but in 1997 and early 1998 infected
sheep were discovered in 17 Quebec flocks, as well as two small herds in
Ontario. In the Maritimes, more than 65 animals were traced back to Quebec
farms and destroyed.
The story adds that while government officials played down the public-health
impact, saying scrapie poses no proven risk to humans, the outbreak has bad
a dramatic economic impact on some cash strapped farmers. Georges Parent, a
breeder in Saint-Gabriel-des-Hauteurs, Que., has seen his entire flock of
1,200 animals destroyed since the beginning of the year, a loss of more than
C$500,000.
He was cited as saying yesterday that he was too devastated to discuss the
issue, but hoped that compensation will be sufficient to ensure that he can
resume his operations. Mr. Parent added the government has offered between
C$150 and C$300 for each animal that was slaughtered, while he estimates
that each animal was worth between C$175 and C$600.
The Canadian food inspection agency has adopted the practice of destroying
all sheep that may have been exposed to this disease, by tracing farm
records and animal registrations. If the records aren't available, the
entire flock is depopulated. Ron Rogers, acting chief of epidemiology for
the food inspection agency, was cited as saying the Canadian control program
is drastic.
The incidence of scrapie remains low in Canada, and only a tiny fraction of
the country's 12,000 flocks - 1,100 of which are in Quebec - ever turn up
with disease.

Robert LaBudde reports:
>>Mr. Parent added the government has offered between $150 and $300 for each

between $175 and $600.<<
Smart move. At that rate it won't take long to "eradicate" scrapie from
Canada. It's also a remarkably silly way to try and do it.
If you really want to eradicate scrapie then you do it by only allowing
breeding rams that carry resistant (or at least not susceptible) genes. The
test only costs $50 (per ram) and this should effectively eradicate scrapie
within a few years. It only requires a law to state that only rams showing
particular genotypes should be used for breeding. The cost is MINUTE even
for the sheep farmer, and almost zero for the government.
