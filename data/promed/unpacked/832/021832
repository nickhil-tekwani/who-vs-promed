Infections with the class of highly drug-resistant bacteria known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) increased 5-fold over a recent 5-year period in 25 community hospitals in the southeastern United States, according to a study in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (ICHE) [1, 2]. [All hospitals were members of the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network (DICON) (3).]

CRE are resistant to most commonly used antibiotics and have been called "one of the 3 greatest threats to human health" by the World Health Organization, according to the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), publisher of ICHE. In a press release, the group said at least 48 percent of CRE infections are fatal [4].

In the study, researchers from Duke University and other institutions prospectively collected data on CRE isolates at the 25 hospitals from January 2008 through December 2012. A total of 305 CRE isolates were identified at 16 hospitals. Of the affected patients, 180 (59 percent) had symptoms and the rest had asymptomatic colonization. _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ was by far the most prevalent CRE species (277 cases, 91 percent).

The frequency of CRE detection rose more than 5-fold from 2008 to 2012: from 0.26 to 1.4 cases per 100 000 patient-days. Only 5 hospitals had adopted the most recent and more sensitive [Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)] guidelines for detecting CRE [5]; the detection rate in these hospitals was more than 3 times higher than in the others.

Given the low adoption rate of the latest surveillance guidelines, the authors say their findings probably underestimate the true level of CRE in the hospitals.

They say factors that are contributing to increased CRE include greater use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, easy transmission of CRE enzymes among bacteria, and increased transmission between long-term acute-care facilities and community hospitals.

"A CRE epidemic is fast approaching," lead author Joshua Thaden, MD, commented in the press release. "We must take immediate and significant action in order to limit the transmission of these dangerous pathogens throughout our hospitals and acute care facilities."
