A major pharmaceutical company has announced an "urgent recall" of all
serial numbers of its West Nile virus vaccine for horses, the American
Veterinary Medical Association [AVMA] announced on its website on Tuesday
[4 May 2010].

The recall, which was voluntary, was instigated by the drug company,
Intervet Schering-Plough, on Monday [3 May 2010], "due to an increased
number of adverse event reports associated with the use of these vaccines,"
the AVMA said.

The pharmaceutical giant has recalled all 1-dose and 5-dose vials of the
PreveNile West Nile virus vaccine for horses. "Schering Plough reported an
increased number of adverse reactions to the vaccine," said Dr Kimberly
May, assistant director of professional and public affairs at the AVMA,
"but unfortunately there were no statements as to severity, or what the
number of horses affected was."

"The word 'urgent' was in the actual letter Schering Plough had sent," Dr
May said, adding, "'Urgent' in the recall world means, 'Check your stock
right now.'"

As of late Tuesday morning [4 May 2010], Intervet Schering-Plough had not
posted a recall notice on its website, or returned a phone message from
ZooToo.com. Dr May noted that it is not unusual for companies not to post
recall information on their websites. But she said the company "has
contacted all the veterinarians affected by this, as well as the distributors."

Intervet informed the USDA and the American Association of Equine
Practitioners on Monday [3 May 2010] of its recall decision.

[More information as well as copy of the letter from Intervet
Schering-Plough may be found at the AVMA website at

An adverse event may be anything from swelling at the injection site,
colic, fever, or a host of other negative issues. The letter by Intervet
Schering-Plough did not specify what the adverse reactions were or what
owners and veterinarians should be on the look out for, in the event they
have already administered this vaccine. The letter from the company was
issued on 28 Apr 2010. ProMED-mail would welcome further clarification of
the number and nature of adverse events.

Currently this recall seems to be USA centric but it may be more widespread
than that. - Mod.TG]
