From: "Gregor Caspari" <Gregor.J.Caspari@viro.med.uni-giessen.de>

I am referring to a statement on food-borne disease outbreaks (world-wide)
from the GIDEON software which is quoted by the moderator as [an excellent
reference (message from August 26 from Dr. Steve Berger). For hepatitis E
virus I read: "Antibody is present in 0.54% of blood donors."
Many of the studies giving this or similar results have been done in
countries were there is no epidemiological background for 1 in 200 blood
donors infected with hepatitis E virus. Almost every virus antibody ELISA
would, in a blood donor population, give a repeat reactive rate between 0.2
and 0.6 percent. The true prevalence is determined by the so-called
confirmatory tests. I have no personal experience with confirmation of an
initially or repeat reactive hepatitis E virus screening test, but
confirmation seems to be more difficult and less reliable than for other
virus antibodies. My question is now whether a 0.54 percent positivity
rate for antibodies to hepatitis E virus, in view of a lack of other
epidemiological evidence, could possibly reflect a specificity of the test
of 99.44 percent rather than true prevalence of infection or past infection.

Response from Dr. Berger.
Dr. Caspari's point is well taken. Although I no longer have the primary
reference for this figure, the data in GIDEON must often quote studies in
peer review journals without editorialization. Unfortunately, many
hepatitis serosurvey studies simply present such figures without analysis
of test specificity.
