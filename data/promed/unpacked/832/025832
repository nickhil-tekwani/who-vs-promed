A total of 20 patients in Bussi and Butembe islands on Lake Victoria are being monitored by health specialists after presenting symptoms of the deadly bird flu. The ministry of health has [obtained samples from them and taken them] to the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe for further investigations.

Bird flu [in domestic and wild birds] was confirmed in Uganda this week following a mass death of birds at Lutembe beach in Entebbe and ducks in Masaka.

[ProMED-mail has received the following responses to the request for information in archive no. 20170117.4771686 from 2 EpiCore members who requested anonymity:

1. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 (the N subtype not yet confirmed), was confirmed among domestic and wild birds in the district around Lake Victoria in Uganda. Affected districts include Masaka, Wakiso, and Kalangala. Reports of dying and sick migratory birds (white winged black terns) on the shores of Lake Victoria 1st emerged among the fishing communities in Lutembe Landing Site, Kajjansi Town Council, Wakiso District on [2 Jan 2017]. A team from NADDEC [National Animal Disease Diagnostics and Epidemiology Centre], Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries; Uganda Wildlife Education Centre, and Uganda Wildlife Authority visited the site, assessed and picked samples for testing at NADDEC and Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) Laboratory. These samples turned positive for HPAI and were reported on [5 Jan 2017]. Reports from locals indicated that the birds had been dying since early December 2016. The deaths of domestic birds (mainly ducks) and of domestic animals (pigs) was reported from Bukakata sub-county, Masaka District. The district officials indicated that up to 8000 ducks had died as of [20 Jan 2017]; testing at NADDEC laboratory and UVRI confirmed HPAI H5.

There are no identified human cases; however, surveillance has been enhanced in the 3 affected and other neighbouring districts.

Newspapers have reported the burn of poultry products from Uganda by Kenya and Rwanda.

2. Below I reproduce verbatim a public information note that was sent out by the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries and was 1st published on [15 Jan 2017]:

"The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) is alerting the public on confirmed cases of avian flu in wild birds.

"The MAAIF is informing the public that: fishermen reported to the management of Uganda Wild Life Education Center Entebbe about the massive death of wild birds around Lutembe beach. The report was received by the Commissioner of Animal Health of MAAIF on [2 Jan 2017]. This prompted an integrated team from MAAIF, MoH, Ministry of Water and Environment, Ministry of Internal Affairs Government analytical laboratory, Uganda Wildlife Authority, Walter Reed Project Makerere University, and UWEC [Uganda Wildlife Education Centre] to immediately visit the area to establish the cause of this death and collect samples for laboratory analysis and disease detection. On [13 Jan 2017], another report was received from Masaka about the death of wild ducks and wild birds in Bukakata sub-county, Bukibanga Parish, Kachanga village, and carcasses of dead wild birds were delivered to the National Veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Entebbe, and all results have been positive. There is still continuous death of wild ducks and other wild birds along the shores and Islands of Lake Victoria in Masaka and Wakiso districts, according to the reports and sites visited. This is already a big threat to over 30 million domestic poultry in the Uganda. We suspect that the avian flu has been brought about by migratory birds from Europe or the Americas, where cases of avian flu have been recently reported."

The information in this report pertains to a considerable number of suspected human cases being monitored for infection with avian influenza.

Further information on relevant exposure, work practices of suspected individuals and the laboratory diagnosis was requested through the EpiCore network and both the responses pertain to H5 activity in poultry with the 1st one referring to some suspected but not laboratory confirmed human cases.

So far, it seems that no human cases of avian influenza A/H5 have been confirmed thus far in the latest outbreak in Uganda. We would be grateful for further information from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.UBA
