Courtesy of Bernie Husbands, we have received three messages about dengue
control in the Philippines. In summary, they indicate that the Philippines
is using a computerized system to track the occurrence of dengue and to
immediately notify local health officials, who then carry out education and
control campaigns (removal of potential mosquito breeding habitats, keeping
homes clean and free of containers of standing water, larvaciding) in their
districts.
Although there have been claims of great success, we have not seen the data
and cannot comment further.
