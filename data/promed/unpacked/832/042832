LPAI in the Netherlands
-----------------------
In a item on an outbreak of H7 in Denmark [see ProMED-mail post 20130603.1753285] you requested more information about the species and type of farming of a LPAI H7N1 outbreak in the Netherlands.

LPAI H7N1 was detected in free ranging chickens in Leusden in the Province of Utrecht. The suspicion was raised when blood samples scored positive in the avian influenza ELISA and the infection was subsequently confirmed by Influenza A and H7 RT-PCR. The subtype H7N1 was confirmed by an influenza array test. The array also confirmed the LPAI genotype. Moreover the LPAI genotype was confirmed by sequencing. Sequencing of HA and NA gene is pending.

The infection was most likely caused by a new introduction from wild birds as the subtype is different from outbreaks that were detected earlier this year [2013] in the Netherlands and Germany.
