[Tamas Torok is at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, and why ProMED is so successful. Our members have friends and share information. Thank you, gentlemen.

With 41 human cases in the first 6 months of 2012, it probable that the annual total will be similar to 2011. The average annual number for the previous 10 years, 2001-2010, was merely 34. Thus the Azerbaijanis have cause for concern that the infection may spread over the border and impact their livestock. It was an unfortunate characteristic of the old Soviet system to only report human cases accurately; livestock outbreaks an cases were significantly under-reported. That unnecessary habit continues today in the now independent member countries. It is also expensive as it under-recognises the threat posed by sick livestock in the persistence of this disease if it is not effectively controlled. Treating this disease in humans, however successfully, does nothing to reduce the risk to humans or livestock. - Mod.MHJ]
