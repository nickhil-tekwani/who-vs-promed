Opticians have been banned from using optical equipment on more than 1
person following fears that it could aid the spread of the human equivalent
of mad cow disease, variant CJD (vCJD). There is a theoretical risk vCJD
can be spread by contact with infected eye or central nervous system tissue.
The ban, announced by the Department of Health, will apply to optical
equipment coming into direct contact with patients' eyes. It follows a
precautionary ban on the re-use of trial contact lenses announced in June.
The measure, which could cost the optical industry millions of pounds,
follows advice from government experts on the Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee (SEAC), who are monitoring the spread of BSE.
SEAC has advised surgeons "wherever possible" to use disposable instruments
on operations involving the central nervous system, eye tissue or tissue
from the lymph system.
The committee is seeking a blood test enabling v-CJD to be detected before
death, and allowing scientists to determine its incidence in the population
at large.
Deputy Chief Medical Office Dr Pat Troop said there was only "a theoretical
risk" of the fatal brain disease spreading between people, but said the
government was committed to minimising that risk.

CJD causes the brain to develop a spongey appearance. The College of
Optometrists said there had been no reported cases of CJD being transmitted
via a contact lens fitting anywhere in the world, and argued the ban would
not improve public safety.
Stopping the re-use of equipment used daily in clinics around the country
for the diagnosis and treatment of many eye problems would cause"chaos" and
result in greater waiting times.
Gwyneth Morgan, president of the college, said: "We are surprised the
Department of Health has taken this stance in the light of its continued
call for the use of evidence based medicine. We believe in these
circumstances, actions of this nature do not make any sense at all.
"The public, and especially contact lens wearers, should be assured their
safety has always been, and will continue to be, paramount to every
optometrist in this country."
Most of the equipment now banned is used in hospitals, but one machine, the
tonometer, used to check for the debilitating eye condition glaucoma is
commonly used by high street opticians.
One solution could be to develop disposal membranes fitted to machines and
thrown away after use.
SEAC said 47 people had now died of new variant CJD. However, SEAC's
acting chairman Professor Peter Smith warned it was too early to estimate
the eventual death toll.
Professor Smith, of the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,
said: "Much depends on how many cases there are going to be as a
consequence of exposure to BSE-contaminated meat.
"We just cannot know how many that is going to be. The estimates vary from
less than 100 to hundreds of thousands, depending on assumptions you make
about how long the incubation period is going to be.
Britain could be at the start of the epidemic, he said, but there had not
been a rapid increase in cases. The longer the number stays relatively low
then I think the more reassured people will be that the epidemic will be
relatively small."
