Mystery virus threatens Hong Kong racing
-----------------------------------------------
Hong Kong racing is in danger of being shut down if officials are
unable to contain an outbreak of a highly contagious virus.
The stable of trainer John Moore has been hardest hit, with 4 of his
horses scratched from Tuesday's [20 Feb 2007] Chinese New Year
meeting after displaying symptoms of the virus.
Another 5 horses in his stable have also shown signs of the mystery
virus along with 3 of the Hong Kong Jockey Club's lead ponies. All
affected horses have been isolated.
"My feeling is it could be from the lead ponies. Three of my horses
which have it, One World, Able Prince and Tiber, have all been led
down to the barriers by lead ponies in the past 14 days for races or
trials," Moore told the South China Morning Post. "The Jockey Club
has to be very serious about this, and nobody should think it will be
okay and will go away. This could bring racing in Hong Kong to a
standstill. I've briefed my staff, and we've disinfected everything
there is to disinfect, but it can spread very quickly. I'm worried
that, if it has spread to other horses, it could get worse by working
them before they show signs."
The Jockey Club's chief executive Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges played
down the threat to racing and said that while the club had to be
vigilant, it was not looking at an epidemic.
"The affected horses are being isolated in order to contain whatever
it is, but stables all around the world have viruses from time to
time, and it is not unusual," Engelbrecht-Bresges said. "On Wednesday
[21 Feb 2007], we hope to have test results back to tell us what it
is that we are dealing with. People are asking if this has any
implication for the staging of the Olympic equestrian events next
year [2008], and the answer is simply no."
Chief steward Jamie Stier issued a release on Saturday [17 Feb 2007]
afternoon to explain the withdrawal of Moore's 4 runners and said on
Monday [19 Feb 2007] the situation had not worsened.
"The veterinary department was initially concerned after the ponies,
and then a number of John Moore's horses showed symptoms last week,
but the vets have put into place the appropriate procedures,
including isolating known cases, and it does not appear to have
spread," Stier said. "We are of course monitoring the entire horse
population for any elevated temperatures and especially those horses
due to race."
In 1992, the Hong Kong Jockey Club was forced to postpone 7 race
meetings after an outbreak of the Equine-2 influenza virus A (H3N8).
The outbreak originated from imported horses, and close to 75 percent
of Hong Kong's horse population became infected.
