A mass die-off of young foxes has occurred in a government-owned fox farm
in Khantia-Mansia autonomous okrug [district]. Since May 2010, about
1700-1900 out of 3000 red and black-silver young foxes have died in the
farm. All the animals were less than 1 year old. The cause of this incident
is not clear yet.

An immunisation [the source does not mention the antigen] was carried out
in an attempt to stop the mortality. The managers consider that the danger
has gone because the die-off has stopped and the adult vixens remained
alive. There is a possibility that contaminated feed caused this die-off. A
regional veterinarian said that there is a reason to believe that
_Clostridium perfringens_ caused all this trouble because some tests
reacted positively for this bacterium. Another hypothesis is the presence
of fungal toxins, such as aflatoxin.
