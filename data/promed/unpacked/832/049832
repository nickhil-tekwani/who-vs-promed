BSE/CJD (NEW VARIANT), HUMAN FATALITY? - USA EX UK

[The media has finally come out with this story. I believe that the
official diagnosis is CJD but it remains to be determined whether it has
anything to do with nvCJD. The victim was very young at onset, 19, and the
course of illness was quite long, 7 years. There was some possible exposure
to UK BSE but much less than many still-healthy people. It sounds like
tests for 14-3-3, florid plaque, and glycoform ratios. - TP]

The death of a Rochester, N.Y., woman may be the first nv-CJD fatality in
the United States. The twenty-six year-old will be buried today in Palmyra,
N.Y., near Rochester, N.Y.
The woman's parents say their daughter was an intelligent, athletic and
healthy student who attended college on a tennis scholarship before she got
sick seven years ago. They recall receiving a gift of beef from Great
Britain in 1987, one year after the disease was first identified.
The degenerative illness baffled the woman's physicians, but two years ago,
Dr. James Ghertner suspected nv-CJD. At first, the woman's parents thought
their daughter had Alzheimer's disease, because she started acting
strangely and forgot how to drive. The couple began to suspect nv-CJD was
addling her brain after watching a television program about the illness and
its symptoms, conditions that matched the young woman's.
The woman's brain and spinal fluid samples are being sent to nv-CJD disease
researchers.
