The Stormont executive has approved a week-long suspension of the
import of breeding animals into Northern Ireland from bluetongue
affected areas.

Agriculture Minister Michelle Gildernew said the move was designed to
keep "our bluetongue disease free status intact."

The disease has been detected in imported cattle on a County Antrim
farm. But it is yet to be detected elsewhere, so Northern Ireland
remains officially bluetongue free.

The Republic's Agriculture Minister Mary Coughlan announced a similar
move last Friday [see item 2].

"These controls bring us into line with the south and are in response
to emerging science around how the bluetongue virus might be
transmitted and additional risks that might be posed by pregnant
animals," said Ms Gildernew.

"The import controls are a proportionate response, and we will
continue to maintain our rigorous testing system on those animals
already imported.

"In terms of the industry, I will leave it to them to consider
carefully whether they should adopt a complete voluntary ban in order
to protect farming here. I would strongly advise and welcome that
action."

It is thought an outbreak of bluetongue disease would cost the
Northern Ireland agriculture industry millions of pounds in lost
revenue.

The Minster for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mary Coughlan TD,
today [28 Feb 2008] reminded farmers and livestock traders of the
risks to the Irish livestock sector through the importation of any
cattle and sheep from bluetongue restricted zones.

This follows the discovery of animals during routine post-importation
tests by the Department, which had been exposed to the bluetongue
virus in the past. These animals are now free of the virus and had
developed a natural immunity and accordingly are not a threat to
animal health.

The Minister repeated her message in the context of the department
recording the 1st sero-positive, but more importantly PCR-negative,
cases in imported cattle since the adoption of the bluetongue trading
rules last November [2007]. PCR-negative means that the animals are
free of virus and pose no threat to animal health (although the ELISA
sero-positive test indicates that the animals had been exposed to the
virus in the past and have developed a natural immunity).

Since the revised trading rules began in November 2007, a total of
512 imported animals have been tested, with 24 animals (in one
consignment) showing sero-positive to ELISA but negative to PCR in
the last few days. Minister Coughlan pointed out that this shows the
need for all livestock farmers and traders to be conscious of the
risks involved in importing cattle and sheep, even high genetic
breeding stock from bluetongue zones.

The Minister added that she had taken unilateral action last week to
suspend the importation from bluetongue restricted zones of female
breeding and production cattle aged over 12 months and female sheep
aged over 6 months. This was a precautionary measure based on new
scientific information and consistent with her commitment to keep the
level of risk to Ireland under review.

[The above press release was accompanied by the communicator's
commentary, indicating that "if the 1st findings are confirmed, that
would mean that many countries might be at a high risk of BTV 8
outbreaks due to the import of in-calf, seropositive but virus
negative cows or heifers. No one can tell at the moment if, and how
long, these calves might be viremic and will pose a source of
infection for indigenous vector populations. ... To adapt trade
measures and vaccination strategies accordingly, any scientific
information should be made available publicly as soon as possible." A
similar observation has been received from Dr Paul Sutmoller, who
referred to the need to publish the "new scientific information"
mentioned by Ireland's Minister of Agriculture as background for her
"unilateral action to suspend the importation from bluetongue
restricted zones of female breeding-and-production cattle aged over
12 months and female sheep aged over 6 months."

Both remarks are appreciated and seem perfectly valid; we hereby
request available scientific evidence on BTV-8 viremia observed in
bovine and/or ovine fetuses, its duration and any additional findings
pertaining to the said observations. - Mod.AS]
