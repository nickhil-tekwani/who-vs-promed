The incidence of dengue, which is quoted as 182 per 100 000 [population],
represents the cumulative incidence as of the end of week 37 [8-14 Sep] of
2008 (WHO, 2008). If there were 3832 reported cases at the end of week 52
[22-28 Dec 2008], then a conservative estimate of this disease's cumulative
incidence for 2008 would be around 293 new cases for 100 000 of the population.

In 2002, WHO's estimate of this country's cumulative incidence was 480 new
cases for 100 000. For 2002, of all the countries in the Americas, only
Brazil and Honduras recorded more new cases of dengue than Trinidad. By
week 37 of 2008, again Trinidad and Tobago was 2nd only to Brazil in this
regard.

The case fatality rate for this preventable infection was estimated to be
1.26 per cent (WHO, 2008). This tells us that roughly 48 persons quite
likely would have died from dengue in this country during 2008 using the
ministry's figures.

In 2007, PAHO [Pan American Health Organisation] member states in the
region adopted Resolution CSP27.R151, which urged that dengue be considered
a "problem that reaches beyond the health sector". Thus PAHO/WHO have
sought to promote the implementation of their "Integrated Management
Strategy for Dengue Prevention and Control (IMS-dengue)" within member
countries, focusing on the conditioning factors associated with the social
determinants of this disease such as, uncontrolled or planned urbanisation,
environmental degradation, the lack of a reliable water supply, improper
solid waste disposal, and the growing presence of dumps filled with
discarded junk, tyres, and plastic containers."

Dengue has been on the rise for 25 years in the region of the Americas,
with cyclical epidemic outbreaks every 3-5 years, the last major one
occurring in 2002, with more than one million cases reported.

The PAHO/WHO report states that "to date, 14 countries in the Hemisphere
have prepared their national IMS-dengue." The only Caribbean country on
that list is the Dominican Republic!

The Cayenne prefecture said that Guyana was entering into "an epidemic
phase of dengue" in a communique issued on Thursday evening [5 Feb 2009].
"The upsurge of cases of dengue and malaria in Guyana [French Guiana] since
the beginning of January [2009] has intensified over the last 2 weeks,"
according to the prefecture in its communique. "For dengue, the number of
laboratory confirmed cases is steadily increasing throughout the country."

In Cayenne and surrounding areas "this increase is described as "sensitive"
and "particularly important in Kourou and Saint Laurent du Maroni." 425
people were infected with dengue virus in January [2009] the health
authorities pointed out.

In mid-January [2009], one infant died of this disease in western Guyana
according to the newspaper France-French Guyana at the end of last month.
On Thursday [5 Feb 2009], the committee that monitors human diseases
transmitted by insects confirmed that "Guyana had passed into the phase of
a dengue epidemic," said the prefecture.

Coronel Fabriciano, the city with the 3rd highest rate of infestation of
_Aedes aegypti_ in Minas Gerais state (6.9 per cent [house infestation
rate]), added 2 deaths of suspected DHF (dengue hemorrhagic fever), causing
the Municipality of Coronel Fabriciano to take more energetic measures to
contain a possible epidemic. The betting is on homeopathy. Joint efforts
will be made starting tomorrow, across the city, so that the population of
about 105 000 inhabitants, take without charge the 2 drops of a homeopathic
remedy that promises to decrease the body's susceptibility to dengue [virus
infection], and mitigate the effects of the disease.

The novel [treatment] comes from the city of Macae (Rio de Janeiro),
[carried out at] the hands of homeopath and medical coordinator of the
Public Health of the Municipality of that city, Leila Nunes. According to
specialists, while the neighboring cities recorded up to a 300 per cent
increase of the disease, Macae had a significant reduction in its [dengue]
indices. "After distributing the product, reported dengue cases were
reduced by up to 65 per cent in 2008, compared to the previous year [2007].
In the 1st 3 months of 2008, compared with the same period of 2007, the
rate of dengue cases fell by 93 per cent. We started the application [of
the drug] in the population during the peak of the epidemic. We noticed the
drop in cases that still occurred that year [2008], but was much more
abrupt than in years earlier," said the doctor. The medicine helps to
reduce bleeding. The remedy consists of 3 substances: phosphorus,
_Eupatorium_, a North American plant, and extract of _Crotalus horridus_
rattlesnake venom.

"We created a volunteer cleanup force, for "project clean up stuff",
[public] awareness campaigns, and the dial-dengue [information telephone
line]. We have more health workers than recommended by the Ministry Health
and most recently passed a law authorizing the city government to impose
fines of BRL 680 to BRL 1380 [USD 300-609] for people who do not cooperate
in the elimination the focus [breeding sites] of _Aedes aegypti_. Still,
the index of infestation is high. Lack of awareness in the population and
this will take time to change. Dengue in Fabriciano may worsen still
further, " concluded Chico Simoes, prefect of the city.

The advice of the State Secretariat of Health reported to the municipal
departments is that they have autonomy to adopt solutions or measures they
consider best suited to resolve their issues.

Military Armed Forces will also tackle the mosquito transmits dengue
[virus] in the state. Today [8 Feb 2009] ends the training course given by
the state Secretariat for 100 soldiers of the 12th Infantry Battalion (IB)
of Belo Horizonte. Another 200 soldiers will be trained in next 2 weeks to
participate in activities in the region or in other cities in the state.
The participation of the Armed Forces to fight _Aedes aegypti_ was through
an agreement between the Ministries of Health and Defense. The idea is to
train 2000 soldiers in Brazil.

This 1st group of soldiers must act initially intersectorially in the 9
regions of the Belo Horizonte prefecture and in surrounding towns that have
registered large numbers of mosquito infestations or that have few staff
for health and zoonoses control [available] to make visits and to combat
outbreaks. In training, the military were introduced to [diflubenzuron], a
new insecticide that will be adopted, that is more effective and less toxic.

[This report asserts that the homeopathic treatment reduces incidence of
dengue disease and is aimed at reducing hemorrhage. The cited example of
use in Macae city is anecdotal. Unfortunately, there is no satisfactory
animal model for dengue to test this treatment experimentally. A
well-designed double-blind drug/placebo field trial would be required to
make a convincing case for the efficacy and safety of this treatment.

Dengue is a serious problem in Coronel Fabriciano city. The UAI of 4 Feb
2009 (in Portuguese,

cited by ProMED-PORT, indicated that just in January 2009, there were 257
reported suspected cases of dengue. Throughout 2008 there were 1596 cases.
According to the director of Siderurgica Hospital, Marcos Vinicius da Silva
Bizarro, the situation in the city is worrying. The hospital attends more
than 20 suspected cases of dengue daily.

Dengue is also a problem in Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais. G1

The mayor of Rosario Oeste (128 km/80 mi north of Cuiaba), Jose Joemil
Balduino de Araujo, asked the government to declare a state of emergency in
the city because of an outbreak of dengue. Between December 2008 and
January this year [2009] there were 226 reported cases of the disease. Of
these, 19 were confirmed as dengue fever and 3 as the most severe DHF,
which can kill, while another 3 cases of this type are being analyzed.

Rosario Oeste has about 18 000 inhabitants. According to the coordinator of
Epidemiology of the Municipal Secretariat of Health, Maria da Penha de
Jesus, the reports that are released by the 9 districts of the city, are of
even more concern, because they do not indicate that these are isolated cases.

To avoid the picture becoming even more critical, a serological survey was
made in the neighborhoods, to detect which type of virus is circulating in
municipality. The result should l be available in 20 days and will allow
isolation [of virus? Quarantine? - Mod.TY], if necessary.

In 2005 and 2006, Rosario Oeste had its 1st [dengue] outbreak, with 218
reported cases of classical dengue fever, a number that has already been
exceeded currently. Because of this, the concern is the risk of recurrence
of disease in people who have had dengue in the past. When a person has a
dengue [virus infection] for the 2nd time, there is a risk of having
hemorrhage.

The coordinator considers that the public had become used to a period of
[dengue] tranquility in 2007, when there were not a high number of recorded
dengue [cases] in the city. This, in his opinion, diminished preventive
actions in 2008.

The Secretariat for Health of the state of Acre (SESACRE) announced
yesterday afternoon [6 Feb 2009] the 1st death caused by DHF in the state
in 2009. The victim was 31 years old and was resident of the 6 de Agosto
neighborhood. The case was among 11 that were under investigation by the
Municipal Secretariat of Health (SEMSA) -- 3 of these have been discarded
and 8 are still under clinical and medical evaluation.

According to the deputy secretary of health, Thor Dantas, the cases where
there is suspected [dengue] disease the [care givers] are examined by the
medical team of the Secretariat and the patients do not exhibit severe
[dengue] symptoms. "It is with much regret that announce the loss. The
victim died in the emergency unit but received all necessary assistance.
For the other cases, we are optimistic in relation to the manifestations of
the disease, the treatment for which is evolving, without serious damage to
the health of these patients," he said.

He ensures that the health and epidemiological surveillance of SEMSA is
gathering all the data to define the diagnosis these patients. "All the
clinical tests are being performed. We are treating the matter very
seriously and respecting the people. We still have 2 months of rain and our
work must be further intensified," he said.

The population in the [state] capital has 3 centers of specialized care for
cases of dengue, as well as a task force that serves to combat the mosquito
_Aedes aegypti_. "We will determine the need to open an additional health
center for cases of dengue, and in this analysis we recognize the work of
the people, the government teams, municipality, and entity partners that
are working hard on the destruction of the mosquito breeding sites. Without
such action, we believe that we will be facing a even worse situation,
because fighting a disease [virus] caused by a mosquito [vector
transmission] in the Amazon region is too great a challenge," he declared.

The municipal secretary of health, Pascal Khalil, said that all cases are
being detected where they originate, thereby detecting all neighborhoods
with foci of the disease. "The neighborhoods that are receiving priority
action by epidemic health agents and other volunteers and partners, such as
Conquista, Estacao Experimental, Placas, Taquari, Mocinha Magalhaes, and
Esperanca, are those with the largest number of cases reported with
suspected [dengue] disease," he emphasized.

According to the secretaries, the efforts against spread of disease will be
reinforced in the months of February, March and April, with total funds
available from the state to strengthen the actions to combat dengue.

Children up to 9 years of age account for almost 70 per cent of dengue in
Itabuna, Jequie, and Porto Seguro. The worst situation is in Porto Seguro,
where 2 children have died because of disease and Itabuna where 6 children
are hospitalized daily with symptoms of the disease.

According to Sabrina Menezes, a technician of Epidemiological Surveillance
of Porto Seguro, of the 74 cases reported in 2009, 60 per cent are
children. Samples tested by the municipal laboratory have now confirmed 36
[as dengue cases].

In Itabuna, the situation is also considered alarming. As of the 3rd week
January [2009], 131 people had been hospitalized with suspected dengue, 3
with DHF, with 80 per cent of the total being children between 2-9 years.
According to Antonio Vieira, secretary of health of the city, there was a
fatal case of dengue -- serotype 2, a child of 4 years, last week in the
Maria da Penha neighborhood, that is being studied by LACEN (Central
Laboratory). Moreover, in the 3 city hospitals that serve children, there
are 6-8 new admissions per day.

The municipality of Jequie is experiencing an outbreak of the disease since
early this year [2009]. Besides the death of a boy of 7 years, 2700 cases
of the disease have been reported in the city (which is more than 64.4 per
cent of all reported [cases] in the state this year).

Outbreaks of the disease in Itabuna are concentrated in 4 peripheral
neighborhoods in the city (Sao Caetano, Urbis 4, Sandoval Palmeira, and
California). According to Menezes Sandovaldo Carvalho, city coordinator to
combat dengue, 80 per cent of [mosquito] breeding sites are
intra-domiciliary (majority in the [house and] yard) and only 20 per cent
are in vacant lots and abandoned buildings. Because of this, the city is
studying the possibility of following the example of Cuba, where the
population was fined where mosquito [breeding sites] were found in houses.

Unlike other cities, in Barreiras -- west of the state -- children account
for only 16 per cent of cases of the disease. In the municipality, 98 cases
were reported in 2009, of these, there is now one confirmed case of DHF in
a child of 7 years -- and 2 of classical [dengue], according to Alline
Santana Lima, of Epidemiological Surveillance of Barreiras.

According to SESAB this (2009) there have been 1955 reported cases of
classic dengue. Of these, 48 were in the capital. The worst situation is in
Jequie, which has 64.4 per cent of the cases of the state with 1247. DHF
was recorded in 12 people (5 in Jequie, 1 each in Apuarema, Barrieras,
Camacari, Castro Alves, Itabuna, Manoel Vitorino, and Salvador).

Bolivia reports 1000 new dengue cases per day, in the most serious epidemic
of the last decade, which has left 5 people dead and more than 12 000
individuals infected, reported the Ministry of Health, cited this Saturday
[7 Feb 2009] in the local press.

According to the latest medical report from the Ministry of Health, up
until Friday [6 Feb 2009], 12 2372 cases of classical dengue have been
reported, of which 75 per cent are recorded in the tropical department
[state of province equivalent] of Santa Cruz (eastern [Bolivia]), with 8200
reported up to Tuesday [3 Feb 2009].

The medical report signals that in the 9 departments in Bolivia, dengue
illnesses reported are: 9306 in Santa Cruz (eastern [Bolivia]), 820 in Beni
(north east), 738 in Cochabamba (central), 492 in Tarija (south), 460 in
Pando (north), 229 in Chuquisaca (south east) 283 in La Paz (east), 35 in
Oruro, and 9 en Potosi.

The national director of epidemiology, Juan Carlos Arraya, indicated on
Friday [6 Feb 2009], "When we reach the peak of the epidemic we could have
more than 50 000 [dengue] cases in the entire country, without including
the sick individuals who do not report to the medical authorities."

The government has declared a "health emergency' in the departments of
Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando and Cochabamba, where the greatest number of cases
have been reported.

The forested region of Ucayali, on the border with Brazil, was declared in
emergency status due to an outbreak of classical dengue and DHF, according
to an article published today [4 Feb 2009] in the official newspaper, El
Peruano.

The Ucayali Regional Council reported a shortage of personnel and equipment
to combat the propagation of this disease, [attacking] the mosquito vector
of [the virus], _Aedes aegypti_ , which reproduces easily in wet areas.
Thus, there was a ruling to adopt corresponding actions in order to finance
measures with the goal of avoiding greater spread of this disease.

The rainy season in the mountains and savannas in Peru falls between the
months of December and March, and during this period many populated areas
[in downstream lowland areas] are isolated by floods [making surveillance
