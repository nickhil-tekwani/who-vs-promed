2 districts in Phang Nga have been effectively quarantined following the
death of almost 100 water buffalo over the past week.
Livestock authorities declared an epidemic in the 2 areas as they try to
contain the spread of a disease called haemorrhagic septicaemia.
All cattle and buffalo slaughterhouses in 4 areas in Takua Pa and Thai
Muang districts have been shut for at least 30 days and indefinite bans
have been put on the movement of animals to and from the areas, Phang Nga
Governor Vinai Buapradit said Sunday [22 Jan 2006].
Lab results had shown that about 90 water buffaloes in the areas had died
of haemorrhagic septicaemia, a disease which spreads among cattle through
excreted body fluids, he said.
Normally, the disease spreads around the end of the rainy season, said
Rawiwan Yingwansiri, the province's chief livestock officer.

[The following explanatory text is derived from OIE's Manual of Diagnostic
Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, updated July 2005:
Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is a major disease of cattle and buffaloes
occurring as catastrophic epizootics in many Asian and African countries,
resulting in high mortality and morbidity. The disease has been recorded in
wild mammals in several Asian and European countries. In many Asian
countries disease outbreaks mostly occur during the climatic conditions
typical of monsoon (high humidity and high temperatures). The disease is
caused by _Pasteurella multocida_ , a Gram-negative coccobacillus residing
mostly as a commensal in the upper respiratory tract of animals. The Asian
serotype B:2 and the African serotype E:2 (Carter and Heddleston system),
corresponding to 6:B and 6:E (Namioka-Carter system), are mainly
responsible for the disease. In wild animals, serotype B:2,5 is
predominantly present. The association of other serotypes, namely A:1, A:3
with a HS-like condition in cattle and buffaloes in India has been recorded.
HS has been erroneously and widely used as a synonym for shipping fever and
other infections. The result has been that the disease has been mistakenly
reported in South America and elsewhere. There was similar confusion in the
1940s, and the differences between the diseases have been clarified. HS and
shipping fever are separate conditions caused by different bacteria
(_Pasteurella multocida_ vs _Mannheimia haemolytica_). Unlike HS, shipping
fever is not septicaemic nor does it cause multisystemic petechial
haemorrhages.
The clinical manifestations of the typical disease caused by B:2 or E:2
strains include a rise in temperature, respiratory distress with nasal
discharge, and frothing from the mouth, and leads to recumbency and death.
Infection with serotypes A:1 and A:3 predominantly involves pneumonia
resulting in mortality. Septicaemia is the characteristic feature in all
the disease conditions. The incubation period varies from 3 to 5 days. In
peracute cases, there may be sudden death with observable clinical signs.
Buffaloes are generally more susceptible to HS than cattle and show more
severe forms of disease with profound clinical signs. Subcutaneous oedema
from the mandible to the brisket is one distinctive feature of the disease
in endemic areas; most deaths are confined to older calves and young adults.
Massive epizootics may occur in endemic as well as non-endemic areas. In
the recent past, HS has been identified as a secondary complication in
cattle and buffalos following outbreaks of foot and mouth disease (FMD).
Case fatality approaches 100 percent if treatment is not followed at the
initial stage of infection.
The diagnosis of the disease is based on the clinical signs, gross
pathological lesions, morbidity and mortality patterns, and confirmation by
isolation of the pathogens and their conventional and molecular
characterisation.

Requirements for Vaccines and Diagnostic Biologicals, refer to chapter
2.3.12 of the Manual at <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00063.htm>.
The disease is endemic in Thailand, affecting mainly buffaloes; preventive
vaccination is practiced. - Mod.AS]
