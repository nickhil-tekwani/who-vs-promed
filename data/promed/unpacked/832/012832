With the deadly canine distemper virus (CDV) killing tigers, leopards and lions in many forest areas and zoos across the country, the scientists at Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) will recommend officials to use recombinant CDV vaccine available in US.

As currently there is no vaccination available for CDV in India, big cats of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, Delhi Zoo, Etawah Lion Safari, and Sakkarbaug Zoo died after they were infected with the virus.

Red Pandas in Gangtok were also found infected with this virus.

CDV is a common disease in dogs. The source of CDV in big cats is primarily dogs, but it can be transmitted from foxes and wild cats.

CDV can spread from one animal to another, and the animal infected with it will excrete virus in all body fluid, including urine and [saliva]. Principal scientist and in-charge of the Centre for Wildlife AK Sharma said: "After 6 lions at Etawah Lion Safari were infected with CDV, a vaccine from the US was given to lions here. The test showed that after vaccination, the immunity in lions became stronger. Even Delhi Zoo also used this vaccination after a tiger was found infected with it."

"However, the vaccination available for dogs is not recommended for big cats. We have decided to recommend this US vaccination to others for protection of big cats," said Sharma. It can be mostly given in zoos, as it will be difficult to vaccinate big cats in the wild."

CDV affects different systems of the body, including the nervous and respiratory systems, in these animals. It breaks down the immunity system and causes various secondary bacterial infections, which lead to their deaths. "The virus affects the immune response of the body and makes the animal susceptible to other diseases," said Sharma.

"As this disease damages the brain, it badly affects their decision-making powers. Due to this, the animals go beyond their natural habitat and enter human settlements. It leaves them easy prey for poachers," said a scientist.

[The pathogen flow at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface is a major conservation concern, especially where feral dogs are abundant. Documentation of outbreaks in wild carnivores due to exposure to cat and dog pathogens abound throughout the world.

Control of feral dogs and vaccination of owned ones would reduce the sources of the virus.

It is important to consider that canine distemper is not the only pathogen that domestic carnivores can transmit to big cats, and thus conservation efforts should take into account all infectious agents that are potentially flowing at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface in the region. - Mod.PMB
