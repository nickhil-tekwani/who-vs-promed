SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY - US & CANADIAN DEER
In a recent issue of La Semaine Veterinaire, Dr. Francois Moutou, using data
supplied by the University of Colorado, reports that 41 cases of a "disease
similar to BSE" have been recorded in US and Canadian deer. The three
species involved are wapiti, mule deer and white-tailed deer. In 12 of the
cases an abnormal prion of the kind found in scrapie was identified.
The latest case, reported the first of this year in Canada, was a wapiti that
had been imported from the US in1989.
According to Dr. Moutou, "In none of the cases is there any explanation
for the origin of the disease. Wild herds may have grazed in the vicinity
of flocks of sheep. But that situation occurs in other parts of the world
without there having been cases of the disease in local deer."
Moutou adds "Between the moment when the first case came to light in
the United States and the present time, the consumption of game does not
seem to have been banned or regulated. People eat at least 2.5 to 3 million
American deer shot by hunters each year. The possible risks involved are
unknown. In the west of North America there are also pumas which also
hunt deer. What do they risk?"

[- See Torsten Brinch's post archive.960606 "BSE & TME (3)" for a discussion
on the relationships of this disease with scrapie and TME. It appears to be
not scrapie but whether it is related to TME or the Cow-adapted TME is unknown.
Whether it is epidemiologically important that some of these affected deer
were being kept in captivity is also unclear. MHJ]
