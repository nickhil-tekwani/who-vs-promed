[This case should have been notified to WHO within 24 hours, not 10 weeks.
In an effort to track cholera O139 & to discover cholera outbreaks in
countries that do not declare them, ProMED-mail would be glad to receive
information on the type of cholera involved & the country from which this
case was imported. It is still not too late to be of some use. - Mod. JW
