A Montreal hospital has been battling for the last year to extinguish
an outbreak with worrisome and highly drug-resistant bacteria. The
outbreak at the Jewish General is the first in Canada caused by this
strain of the bacteria, a bug that has sparked serious concern because
of how easily it spreads and its ability to transfer resistance to
other bacteria.

A report on the outbreak was presented in Chicago on Sunday [18 Sep
2011] to the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy, a major annual gathering of infectious diseases
specialists. Dr Mark Miller, head of infection control at the Jewish
General, said the outbreak has been brought under control, but a few
patients with the bacteria are still being treated in the hospital.

The outbreak was caused by _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, which is normally
found in the human intestine. In healthy people, these bacteria can
live in the intestine without causing illness. In hospitals, however,
they can cause a range of infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream
infections, and urinary tract infections.

_K. pneumoniae_ traditionally have been treated with antibiotics
called carbapenems. But in the last decade or so, a strain of the
bacteria has developed that is resistant to this class of drugs. To
make matters worse, the genetic component that gives _K. pneumoniae_
this resistance has the capacity to transfer into other bacteria,
making them resistant to these drugs as well.

The strain with this component is called KPC-producing _K.
pneumoniae_, and it has even more tricks in its arsenal. The gene that
makes it resistant to carbapenems is packaged in a cassette of genes
that confer resistance to a number of other antibiotics. Miller said
the version that slipped into his hospital could only be treated with
2 antibiotics -- an old drug with serious side-effects and a newer
drug. He and others worry about the day they will find KPC that
responds to no drugs at all.

That has happened. In fact, the Ottawa Hospital had 3 cases of
KPC-producing _K. pneumoniae_ in 2008, one of which was resistant to
all antibiotics. Microbiologist Marc Desjardins said the Ottawa
Hospital was lucky -- the 3 cases didn't spark an outbreak. (One
patient caught the bacteria from one of the other 2, but there was no
sustained spread in the hospital.) But the patients were hard to treat
and for one, nothing worked. "The bug was resistant to everything.
There was absolutely not a single antibiotic we could give that
patient," Desjardins said. The woman, who had other grave health
problems, eventually died. Battling bacteria that are not susceptible
to any antibiotics is a nightmare scenario, he admitted. "At least in
serious infections, there is hope to actually treat the infection.
With KPCs, if your organism is resistant to everything, currently in
our baggage of antibiotics we have nothing available to treat them,"
Desjardins said. "The only thing to do is to use combinations (of
antibiotics) and hope."

KPC was first spotted in North Carolina in 1998. Since then, bacteria
with this factor have spread widely. Hospitals in Israel and Greece
have battled the problem. In the United States, New York State has
experienced a lot of KPC outbreaks. Canada first started to look for
KPC in 2009, said Dr Michael Mulvey, head of the division of
antimicrobial resistance and nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections
at the Public Health Agency of Canada. Since then, surveillance has
spotted 80 cases, a figure Mulvey thinks is probably an underestimate.


Most have been isolated cases, though another Quebec hospital has
battled an outbreak, Mulvey said. He would not disclose the location
or the name of the facility. "The risk to Canadians right now is very
low," Mulvey insisted. "But in the hospitals, we're always concerned
about antimicrobial resistance, especially in the very ill patients
that are immunocompromised. And the fact that these are multi-drug
resistant and the odd one is now pan-resistant, it certainly is a
concern in the hospitals." At the Jewish General, the 1st KPC case was
discovered in August of last year [2010]. Since then, 27 patients have
tested positive for it. Some died, though Miller said it was a
judgment call as to whether the bacteria caused their deaths or merely
contributed to their decline. He would not say how many KPC patients
had died.

"We've been truly impressed," Miller said of the bacterium's ability
to spread from person to person and the facility with which it shares
its resistance capabilities with other bacteria in its general class.
His laboratory spotted the resistance cassette in other bacteria
isolated from patients in the hospital, including _Serratia_ and
_Enterobacter_.

Another concerning feature of KPC-producing _K. pneumoniae_ is the
rate at which it causes illness. With any hospital-acquired bacteria,
a portion of people who pick them up won't develop an infection. They
are said to be "colonized." With some hospital bugs, there might be
150 carriers for every person who actually develops an infection from
them. But with these bacteria, the ratio is more like one infection
for every 10 people colonized, Miller said.

Another problem: it takes months for people carrying the KPC-strain to
"clear" it from their systems. That can be a concern if someone
carrying it is released from hospital and goes home to an elderly
spouse, or one with a chronic illness. Getting the Jewish General's
outbreak under control took Herculean efforts. The normal approaches
to outbreaks of hospital infections -- isolating colonized patients
and requiring anyone going into their rooms to don gloves and gowns --
didn't work.

Miller said his hospital eventually had to open a dedicated KPC ward
to house all the patients. Staff taking care of those patients was not
allowed to work elsewhere in the hospital. The ward was a drain on
resources and expensive to operate, but there was no alternative, he
suggested. Desjardins agreed. "Bringing these outbreaks with KPCs
under control is a fairly difficult thing to do and you need more
aggressive measures to do that than just telling people to wash their
hands and to put the patient under isolation."

[Carbapenemases are beta-lactamases that degrade carbapenem
beta-lactam antibiotics, and fall into molecular classes A, C, B, and
D. Classes A, C, and D have serine at the active site and class B,
zinc at the active site. KPC are class A carbapenemases; IMP
(plasmid-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase), NDM-1 (New Delhi
metallo-beta-lactamase), and VIM (Verona integron-encoded
metallo-beta-lactamase) are class B carbapenemases; and OXA-types are
class D carbapenemases.
