[This follow-up report addresses a 2nd outbreak of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) at the same location of the initial outbreak notified by Morocco to the OIE earlier this month (July 2015) and which reportedly had started 16 Jun 2015. PPR is occasionally suspected by vets in various parts of Morocco and might be wider spread than reported. Curiously, the disease seems rather mild and is seen chiefly in goats. Vaccination is routinely practiced; the vaccine is manufactured locally by a Moroccan vaccine production plant. The outbreak is, reportedly, "continuing". As the vaccination campaign is going on, it should taper off in the coming few days or weeks. Other foci are likely to appear here and there in other parts of the country.

Following the accomplished global eradication of rinderpest, PPR has become one of the priority diseases indicated in the FAO-OIE Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs) 5 Year Action Plan. Subscribers are referred to the recent, useful FAO publication "empres 360 animal health" Bulletin No. 45/2015, dedicated to "Overview of FAO's coordination of peste des petits ruminants control activities"; available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4484e.pdf (28 pages). The PPR Global Control and Eradication Strategy has been presented at the FAO and OIE International Conference held in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire), from 31 Mar to 2 Apr 2015. See also OIE's recent editorial "Towards global eradication of peste des petits ruminants" at http://www.oie.int/for-the-media/editorials/detail/article/towards-global-eradication-of-peste-des-petits-ruminants/.

It is believed that more and more reports on PPR from various African and Asian countries are to be expected due to the raised awareness of national veterinary services.

In this context, we would wish to make the following comment in relation to the recently notified PPR in Zambia (archive no. 20150707.3489701). The Zambian authorities have notified the OIE of 4 outbreaks affecting goats. As "manifestation of disease", the report indicated "sub-clinical infection". It is therefore of importance to definitely clarify if this event can be viewed as a locally acquired (sub-clinical) infection, or the detection of antibodies acquired elsewhere, either by infection or by vaccination. In this respect, it deserves to be mentioned that PPR vaccination has been applied in 2 of Zambia's northern neighbors, namely Tanzania and DR Congo. Could the animals, found seropositive in Zambia, have been vaccinated animals that crossed the border from the mentioned countries? - Mods.AB/AS
