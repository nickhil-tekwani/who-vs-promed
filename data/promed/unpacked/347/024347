The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is reporting that in 2017, 7466 new cases of valley fever were reported, making 2017 the highest annual incidence reported in California since coccidioidomycosis became individually reportable in 1995 [1]. It was also the 2nd consecutive record year for reported valley fever cases.

Consistent with previous years, the highest coccidioidomycosis incidence in 2017 were reported in counties in the Central Valley and central coast regions, including Kern, Kings, San Luis Obispo, Fresno, Tulare, Madera, and Monterey counties. Nearly 64 percent of the 2017 case-patients resided in one of these counties, with 37 percent residing in Kern county.

"With the continued increase in valley fever, people living and working in the Central Valley and central coasts regions should take steps to avoid breathing in dusty air," said CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer Dr Karen Smith. "If individuals develop flu-like symptoms, such as cough, fever, or difficulty breathing, lasting 2 weeks or more, they should ask their health care provider about valley fever."

It is unclear why there has been such a large increase in reported valley fever cases in California since 2014. Possible contributing factors include heavy rainfall after years of drought as well as other climatic and environmental factors, increased number of susceptible people in areas where the fungus is present, and increased awareness, testing, and diagnosis by health care providers.

Valley fever, also known as coccidioidomycosis, or cocci, is caused by breathing in the spores of a fungus that grows in certain types of soil. The fungal spores can be present in dust that gets into the air when it is windy or when soil is disturbed, such as through digging in dirt during construction.

Most infected people will not show signs of illness. Those who do become ill with valley fever may have flu-like symptoms that can last for 2 weeks or more. While most people recover fully, some may develop more severe complications which include pneumonia, or infection of the brain, joints, bone, skin, or other organs. There is currently no vaccine, but antifungal medications are available. Individuals should specifically ask their health care provider about valley fever if they think they may be infected.

While anyone can get valley fever, those most at-risk for severe disease include people 60 years or older, African-Americans, Filipinos, pregnant women, and people with diabetes or conditions that weaken their immune system. People who live, work, or travel in valley fever areas are also at higher risk of getting infected, especially if they work outdoors or participate in activities where soil is disturbed.

[Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as valley fever, is a fungal disease caused by inhalation of spores of _Coccidioides immitis_ or _C. posadasii_, dimorphic saprophytic fungi that grow in soil as a mycelium that break off into airborne spores. The spores, known as arthroconidia, become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. In the host organism, the inhaled arthrospores develop into spherules.

In the referenced article, the California Department of Public Health recommends (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR18-041.aspx):

"A person can reduce the risk of illness by avoiding breathing in dirt or dust in areas where valley fever is common. In these areas, when it is windy outside and the air is dusty, stay inside and keep windows and doors closed. While driving, keep car windows closed and use recirculating air conditioning, if available. If individuals must be outdoors, they should consider wearing a properly fitted mask when the air is dusty (such as an N95 respirator mask which is widely available in retail stores), and refrain from disturbing the soil whenever possible.

"Employers should train workers about valley fever symptoms and take steps to limit workers' exposure to dust, such as watering down the soil before digging.

"It is unclear why there has been such a large increase in reported valley fever cases in California since 2014. Possible contributing factors include heavy rainfall after years of drought as well as other climatic and environmental factors, increased number of susceptible people in areas where the fungus is present, and increased awareness, testing, and diagnosis by health care providers. It is unknown if or how the relatively dry 2017-2018 winter in California will impact the number of valley fever cases this year."
