State health officials say 3 cases of mumps have been confirmed at
the State University of New York in Plattsburgh. They say that all
students who haven't had 2 doses of mumps vaccine should be excluded
from returning to school from spring break [13-22 Mar 2010] until
they're fully vaccinated. Inoculation clinics have been scheduled for
today -- Wednesday [17 Mar 2010] -- and Monday [22 Mar 2010] on a
walk-in basis at the university health center.

Symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle weakness, and loss
of appetite along with the characteristic swelling and tenderness in
salivary glands. It rarely leads to serious complications.

Officials say they haven't found any connection to an outbreak of
mumps that began last summer [2009] in Orange and Rockland [New York].

[This report suggests that there is no connection between these 3
cases and the earlier mumps outbreak in New York in 2009. It would be
of interest to know when these 3 cases became infectious. If they had
infected other students before they dispersed during spring break,
there would have been a risk of spread to other places, many of them
distant from Plattsburgh.
