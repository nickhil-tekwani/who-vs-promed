Some 1,500 pigs were culled and burnt in two large pits near the beach in
Gertak Sanggol [Penang state yesterday, Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu
Koon said.
He said the pigs were among 5,600 pigs from a farm in Gertak Sanggol which
would be culled and burnt until tomorrow. Another 600 from another farm in
Sungai Tiram would be culled from Thursday.
"Our priority has always been to cull within the farm itself but in this
case we cannot do so as the area is very congested," he told a press
conference at Penang Development Corporation yesterday.
"If we were to transport the pigs to a culling area far away from the
infected farm, we will be exposing more people to greater danger," he said,
adding that affected residents should bear with the inconvenience during
the three days of culling.
Over 200 residents who were evacuated from their homes yesterday protested
over the burning of carcasses "almost at their doorsteps." During a
dialogue on Sunday, residents from 21 houses were ordered to evacuate their
homes. Many said the pigs should have been burnt and buried at the affected
farm instead of at the site 1km away from the farm.
Dr Koh said 11 pigs from a farm in Gertak Sanggol were found infected with
the Nipah virus while more than three were detected in Sungai Tiram. He
said the 11 tests were done on 24 blood samples taken from the Gertak
Sanggol farm in June and the results were ready on Thursday. He said the
authorities were still awaiting the results of the blood tests from five
more samples.
Dr Koh also said the main reason he had asked that the media only get the
news of the Nipah virus from official statements issued by him or the state
secretary was to safeguard the pig farming and tourism industry in the state.
"It is not a cover-up. Farms that are involved are localised, so we can
contain it locally and the losses are suffered by a small number of people.
We contained the news because it is not necessary to alarm the public."

[We now understand why there has been a conspicuous absence of news on the
Nipah virus outbreak especially of human infections coming out from
Malaysia through the media although infection is still being detected among
pigs in pig farms in certain states. The answer lies in the last sentence:
"We contained the news because it is not necessary to alarm the public" in
the Penang Chief Minister's statement. I suppose this is the official stand
of the Malaysian government on the matter. - Mod.CYC
