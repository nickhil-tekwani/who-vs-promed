[Cases of encephalitis are common in Uttar Pradesh state at this time of the year. Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in northeastern India and more cases can be expected over the remainder of the transmission season. The Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh state has been an active focus of JE cases annually.

Although JE virus is likely involved, the above report does not indicate the etiological agent responsible for these encephalitis cases. The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, lychee consumption, sun stroke, and enterovirus infection have been proposed. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts of JE virus and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors.
