New Jersey officials say 2 premature infants with a bacterial infection have died. The Health Department is investigating the [_Acinetobacter] baumannii_ outbreak at University Hospital in Newark and said Tuesday [27 Nov 2018] that the infants had confirmed cases of the bacteria. They died last week and were not identified.

A 3rd infant with the bacteria was previously reported to have died.

The department says the 2 infants contracted the infection 6 weeks ago but had other medical conditions due to being born premature, meaning the bacterial infection may not be the cause of death.

The department says a survey team is on site and investigating the hospital's policies.

State officials 1st became aware of the infection last month [October 2018] when 4 cases were confirmed. The 4th infant was discharged last month.

A pair of premature infants died last week after contracting a bacterial infection in the neonatal intensive care unit of University Hospital in Newark. A 3rd baby passed away last month [October 2018] after catching the same bacteria at the hospital, state health officials announced Tuesday [27 Nov 2018].

Due to other medical conditions related to being born premature, the bacterial infection may not have been the cause of death, New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) officials said.

Despite the unclear role of the bacteria in the infants' deaths, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka issued a scathing statement on Tuesday [27 Nov 2018], calling the fatalities "stark reminders that an overhaul of the quality of care and the leadership of the hospital is urgently needed." (Read Baraka's full statement below.)

The bacterium, _Acinetobacter baumannii_, causes a variety of diseases ranging from pneumonia to serious blood or wound infections. Symptoms vary and usually pose "very little risk to healthy people," but people who have weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease, or diabetes may be vulnerable, according to the CDC.

The hospital's own infection control program hadn't been aware of the 2 recent infant deaths until staff were contacted by state officials on Monday [26 Nov 2018], according to the DOH. A University Hospital spokesperson provided Patch with the following statement about the investigation on Tuesday [27 Nov 2018]:

"We have worked diligently since the _Acinetobacter baumannii_ bacteria were discovered in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to control the outbreak, and there have been no new cases in the NICU since October [2018]. We continue to reinforce proper procedures and protocols with our team."

DOH officials said that they 1st became aware of a "bacterial outbreak" at University Hospital on 1 Oct [2018], when 2 cases of _A. baumannii_ were confirmed in the NICU. Two additional cases were confirmed in lab tests later in October [2018].

On 25 Oct [2018], the DOH reported that one of the infants was transferred to another facility and passed away at the end of September [2018]. The death took place before the department was notified of the infections at the Newark hospital's NICU, officials said.

"Due to the other compounding medical conditions, the exact cause of death is still being investigated," DOH officials previously said.

Newark Department of Health and Community Wellness Director Mark Wade said that the bacterium doesn't pose a risk for local residents.

"Unfortunately, the infant had a variety of other compounding medical conditions," Wade said. "_Acinetobacter_ is a hospital-acquired infection with no community transmission. Rest assured, this does not pose a risk to the Newark community."

No new NICU infections have been confirmed at University Hospital since October [2018]. However, "major infection control deficiencies" were found during an inspection last month [October 2018], officials stated.

The department ordered a Directed Plan of Correction on 25 Oct [2018] that required University Hospital to hire a full-time Certified Infection Control Practitioner to guide remediation efforts. A DOH survey team is investigating the hospital's internal notification policies, governance, and other factors that relate to reporting of deaths of cases during an ongoing outbreak, state officials said.

On Tuesday [27 Nov 2018], Mayor Ras Baraka issued the following statement about the outbreak at University Hospital:

"The deaths of 3 premature infants with an _Acinetobacter_ bacteria and the infection of a 4th, all cared for at University Hospital, are stark reminders that an overhaul of the quality of care and the leadership of the hospital is urgently needed. The infants had a variety of other medical conditions, but the fact remains that they contracted the bacteria in the hospital's neonatal ICU. The Newark Department of Health and Community Wellness will work collaboratively with the New Jersey State Department of Health to continue careful monitoring of the situation in that unit."

"In July 2018, Governor Murphy acted swiftly and decisively in appointing a monitor for University Hospital. Today, more action is needed. The hospital is central to providing health care to Newark residents, and I have been very concerned about its quality of care, its leadership's failure to live up to the Newark Agreement negotiated when the hospital was created, their insensitivity to the opinions of residents, their attempt to reduce the number of pediatric beds without consulting myself or the Governor, and the failing grade they received on their level of care from the Leapfrog Group."

"The time has come for the State of New Jersey and the Newark community to collaborate in setting a new direction for University Hospital. The hospital needs to become more responsive to the people it serves and sensitive to their needs. This requires more community input with new leadership, including a new board with adequate representation of Newark residents and a new President/CEO with a history of sensitivity to community."

"State and federal investment is needed to enable University Hospital to become the 1st-class teaching hospital that it was intended to be, including an overhauled emergency room, a world-class trauma center, and more outpatient clinics to meet the underserved medical needs of the people of Newark."

"In 1968, the state and federal governments negotiated a detailed pact with the people of Newark to create a top-notch medical facility with community involvement and oversight in perpetuity. On the 50th anniversary of the Newark Agreement, it's time to keep the promise."

[A previous ProMED-mail post concerned a report in October 2018 of an _Acinetobacter baumanii_ outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Newark (NJ) University Hospital. This outbreak involved 4 patients and, at the time, resulted in the death of one of these premature babies (ProMED-mail post Acinetobacter, adenovirus - USA: (NJ) fatal, ped. short/long-term care facility 20181031.6122389). Now an additional 2 of the original 4 patients have died, but there have been no new cases in the NICU since October 2018. Because of co-existing medical conditions, the exact cause of the 3 deaths is still under investigation. No source for the outbreak has been revealed as yet. However, unspecified "major" infection control deficiencies were reported to have been found during an inspection in October 2018.

_Acinetobacter_ are aerobic Gram-negative coccobacilli commonly found in soil and water and readily survive in a hospital environment. During nosocomial outbreaks, _Acinetobacter_ have been recovered from various sites in the patients' environment, including bed curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment. Of the many _Acinetobacter_ species, _A. baumannii_ accounts for about 80 percent of reported infections.

Outbreaks of _Acinetobacter_ infections usually occur in healthcare settings, especially in critically ill patients in intensive care units. These organisms may colonize patients or cause a variety of infections, such as pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, burn wounds, traumatic and surgical wound infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and infective endocarditis. _Acinetobacter_ have been reported to spread most commonly on the hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from other patients who are either infected or colonized with these organisms.

Resistance of _Acinetobacter_ to multiple commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, monobactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, severely restricts treatment options for infections caused by these organisms. Some _Acinetobacter_ isolates are susceptible only to the polymyxins such as colistin and sulbactam (Go ES, Urban C, et al: Clinical and molecular epidemiology of _Acinetobacter_ infections sensitive only to polymyxin B and sulbactam. Lancet North Am Ed. 1994; 344(8933): 1329-32; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7968028), although resistance to these antibiotics has also been reported. Sulbactam is a beta-lactam that is most commonly used in combination with ampicillin to inhibit certain bacterial beta-lactamases that would otherwise break down ampicillin. Against _Acinetobacter_, however, sulbactam itself exhibits antibacterial activity.

University Hospital is a 519-bed academic medical center, with a Level I Trauma Center that is one of only 3 in New Jersey; it is a principal teaching hospital for Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences and is the largest provider of uncompensated care in New Jersey (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Hospital_(Newark,_New_Jersey)).
