[Since 10 Oct 2016 there have been a total of 9 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia. Of these 9 cases, 4 were reported by Ash Sharqiyah province -- 3 of these 4 were in Hufoof, and the 4th is in Urayarah, a town located approximately 75 miles [about 120 km] to the northwest of Hufoof, an approximate 1 hour 20 minute drive. In addition, 2 of these 4 newly confirmed cases are in healthcare workers, although one of these 2 cases was reported to be asymptomatic at the time of MERS-CoV infection confirmation. Of the other 2 cases reported in Hufoof, one was classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a patient and the remaining case was the 1st case reported and was classified as a primary case with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. As best as I can identify, there are several hospitals in Hufoof, and there were nosocomial outbreaks in Hufoof in the past -- one in 2013, another in 2015. Hopefully this current nosocomial cluster will remain small and transmission will be interrupted soon.

The remaining 5 cases reported in October 2016 were classified as primary cases -- one from each from Hail, Riyadh, Buraidah, Abha, and Najran.
