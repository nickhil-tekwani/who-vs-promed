Malaysia closes 500 [kindergarten] schools to stop disease
----------------------------------------------------------
The Malaysian Health Ministry ordered the immediate closure of 488
kindergartens in the Borneo state of Sarawak for 2 weeks, after
rising cases of hand, foot and mouth disease among children, a news
report said yesterday [3 Mar 2006].
"This action is taken to stem the transmission of the disease, which
has increased rapidly in Sarawak," Health Minister Chua Soi Lek was
quoted as saying by Bernama, the national news agency.
The 2-week kindergarten closure follows 3 deaths this year [2006] in
the state from the viral disease, which produces symptoms that
include fever, a rash in the mouth and sores with blisters on the
palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The latest death occurred
on Wednesday [1 Mar 2006]. Chua said 942 cases had been reported from
1 Jan to 18 Feb 2006, compared with 270 in the same period last year
[2005].
Tests on one of victims revealed the presence of enterovirus 71, the
virus that caused deaths during a 1997 hand, foot and mouth disease
outbreak, he said. The disease is spread through the saliva and feces
from those infected, and Chua advised parents to promote cleanliness
among their children and said those with symptoms of the disease
should seek treatment immediately. The disease normally takes 3-5
days to manifest, and death is caused by complications such as
inflammation of the heart and sometimes meningitis, he added.
