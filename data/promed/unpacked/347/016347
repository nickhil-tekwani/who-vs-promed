The Health Department confirmed on Thursday [21 May 2015] the 2nd fatal case of yellow fever in Brasilia this year [2015]. The victim was admitted to a private hospital in the South Wing and died on Tuesday [19 May 2015]. According to the record, the man did not contract the disease in the capital.

Photos posted by the victim in a social network indicate that he spent the 1 May [2015] holiday fishing in the Araguaia River. His family campaigned on the web asking for blood donations after he was admitted to the ICU. The G1 tried to contact the family, but received no reply until the publication of this report.

The 1st case of the disease in Brasilia occurred in early February [2015], when a 22 year old was transferred to the DF [Federal District] after showing symptoms of the disease in Alto Paraiso, Chapada dos Veadeiros, in Goias. [This is the same area where multiple cases of YF were contracted over the millennium New Year; see ProMED archive 20000122.0107. - Mod.JW]

The Health Department of the Federal District (SES-DF) confirmed on Thursday [21 May 2015] the 2nd case of death from yellow fever in the capital. [This individual] died on Tuesday [19 May 2015], after a brief hospitalization at the Hospital Santa Luzia.

His relatives campaigned recently on social networks to encourage blood donation. The same means were used to spread the news about his death. He had visited the city of Luis Alves, Goias, along the Araguaia River. The location is 569 km away from the Federal District and the Brasilian would have gone there to fish.

According to SES, the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) investigated the case as soon as the patient was admitted to the hospital, coming to the conclusion that he did not contract the disease in Brasilia. The reporter contacted the victim's family, but got no answer until the closing of this report. The Hospital Santa Luzia confirmed that the patient was hospitalized on site but did not elaborate.

[The infection, it is understood, occurred in a forest environment around 1 May 2015; death occurred on 19 May 2015. There is no information about the date of onset of symptoms. The importance? Where was the patient during the period of viremia (starting usually 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms and extending 3-5 days after)? What were the blocking [preventive] actions taken, or not, in the Federal District or possibly in other potentially _Aedes_-infested localities where the patient was during the viremic period? - Mod.RNA]

[Yellow fever (YF) virus is endemic in forested areas in many parts of Brazil. There are 2 cycles of yellow fever virus transmission: urban and sylvan (forest). The concern is that a person infected in the forest (sylvan cycle), such as the patient above, could come to a locality where _Aedes aegypti_ vectors are abundant enough to feed on the viremic individual and initiate ongoing urban transmission. This is a real concern, and explains why Mod.RNA asks whether an epidemiological barrier was set up in the Federal District or whether the patient's route of travel had been identified from where the patient had been fishing until he became ill in the Federal District.

This mosquito vector is abundant enough across Brazil to transmit dengue and chikungunya viruses, and potentially YF virus, to many people annually. Fortunately, a large proportion of the population in Brazil is vaccinated against YF. However, no mention is made of the YF vaccination status of the population in areas where that patient had been until he died. - Mod.TY
