Usutu virus strikes again: alarming blackbird mortality in Austria
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Usutu virus, a member of the mosquito-borne cluster within the
flavivirus genus, has been responsible for a blackbird die-off in
Vienna and neighboring districts of Lower Austria last year:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol8no7/02-0094.htm>
This year, first sightings of dead blackbirds were made as early as
15 Jul 2002. Within the following weeks, numerous dead blackbirds
have been reported and some were submitted for necropsy to the
University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna. So far we have received 11
blackbirds from the 6th, 10th, 11th, 14th, 15th, and 22nd district of
Vienna and 15 blackbirds from the Lower Austrian districts Modling,
Baden, Korneuburg, and Tulln, located south and northwest of Vienna.
All but 2 tested positive for Usutu virus by PCR,
immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. Out of 21
submissions of other wild birds and exotic birds from the Vienna zoo
a single house sparrow from the Lower Austrian district Korneuburg
was positive.
Sequence comparisons of this years' isolates with sequences from last
year revealed the identity of the viral genomes. These findings
suggest that Usutu virus managed to overwinter in Austria, most
probably in infected mosquitoes, and slowly spreads into new areas.
There are no reports on associated diseases in humans and domestic
animals so far.
We have to realize, however, that the virus has found a new habitat
in Central Europe and that blackbird mortality will remain a
considerable issue in the forthcoming years.
