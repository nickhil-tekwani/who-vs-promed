The police report into the death of 3 infants after they were
infected with Legionnaires' disease at a private Nicosia hospital at
the end of last year [2009] allegedly recommends criminal and
disciplinary action against 3 people.

Nicosia CID investigators are thought to have concluded their report
on Friday [13 Mar 2009]. The police file will be handed over to the
Attorney-general tomorrow. It will be up to Petros Clerides whether
or not criminal or disciplinary action will be taken against those
implicated in the report.

According to Phileleftheros [the largest newspaper in Cyprus], the
criminal aspect of the investigation was very difficult because it
dealt with very delicate medical issues, compared to disciplinary
offenses which are easier to prove. Letters and warnings sent to the
hospital regarding inspections are also likely to be taken into
account regarding the disciplinary aspect of the case.

Eleven infants born at the Hippocration hospital between [17 and 27
Dec 2008] developed Legionnaires' disease. The newborns had all been
discharged healthy but developed symptoms a few days later and were
rushed to Makarios Hospital for treatment. Three of the children died
while 8 others completed their treatment and were released.

Within days of the outbreak the private hospital closed down its
inpatient wards, including its maternity and neonatal unit, and only
continued to operate on an outpatient basis. A few weeks later it was
given the green light to reopen its inpatient wards after samples
taken from the hospital received the all clear for legionella from
the state laboratory.

[This outbreak of neonatal legionellosis was previously posted by
ProMED-mail (see ProMED-mail Legionellosis, neonatal, nosocomial,
fatal - Cyprus: susp. 20090102.0011). The current news report
increases the number of deaths by 2 and the total number of cases by
one. However, we are not informed about the source or mode of
transmission for this outbreak.

Legionellosis in children is unusual. Most reported cases have
involved neonates and children who are immunocompromised by, for
example, malignancies, severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic
granulomatous disease, organ transplantation, and prolonged treatment
with corticosteroids, or who have preexisting respiratory disease
(<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/965492-overview> and
Greenberg D, Chiou CC, Famigilleti R, Lee TC, Yu VL. Problem
pathogens: paediatric legionellosis--implications for improved
diagnosis. Lancet Infect Dis. 2006; 6:529-35).

Neonates with legionellosis may develop necrotizing pneumonia with
signs of sepsis and multisystemic involvement that may progress
rapidly to respiratory failure and death (Holmberg RE Jr, Pavia AT,
Montgomery D, et al. Nosocomial Legionella pneumonia in the neonate.
Pediatrics. 1993; 92:450-3). For further discussion of Legionellosis
