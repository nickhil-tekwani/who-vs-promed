A rotavirus surveillance study was led between October 1996 and October
1998 in Argentina. It was designed to study the burden of rotavirus
diarrhea in the main cities by age, and to determine the serotype of the
different strains collected from each place. Only hospitalized diarrhea
patients under 3 years of age were studied. Positive samples
(diagnosed using a commercial EIA kit) were typed with either
monoclonal antibodies or by RT-nested-PCR using specific typing primers.
We noticed that during late 1998, G9P6 samples that were not reported
during previous years studied, began to appear. Given that rotavirus
epidemiology changes from year to year we decided to type more samples
corresponding to 1999. From 50 samples studied between September 1998
and February 1999, 8 samples (16%) were typed as G9P6. These cases
belonged to the following Argentine cities: Mendoza, La Plata, Cordoba
and Ushuaia. Five of them were under 7 months of age, and La Plata
reported that their G9P6 cases had been severe diarrhea cases.
Also, we were able to obtain VP7 sequences from five G9P6 samples that need
further analysis to determine their relationship with other G9P6 strains
distributed worldwide.
