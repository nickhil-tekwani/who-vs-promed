Detection of 3 new human infections with the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in a week has set alarm bells ringing as scientists have found evidence of the virus in the live-bird market in crowded Dhaka.

The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) confirmed a human case on 26 Feb 2012 when a worker at a live-bird market in the southern part of the capital tested H5N1 positive at the IEDCR's surveillance site. Its director, Professor Mahmudur Rahman, told BDnews24.com that they had informed the government's Department of Livestock right away and suggested "immediate" steps to disinfect wet markets.

BDnews24.com saw no cleaning drive but learned the livestock department had arranged a technical committee meeting for Wednesday [7 Mar 2012] instead of beginning to disinfect the market. In the meantime, the IEDCR that oversees human infections of bird flu disclosed on Monday [5 Mar 2012] that another 2 cases were confirmed on Sunday [4 Mar 2012] night in their lab. "They are also live-bird market workers," Prof Rahman told BDnews24.com and added that they expected the livestock department to move quickly for the sake of public health safety. "The virus's presence in the live-bird market means it is now even closer to people," he added. A scientist with the IEDCR told BDnews24.com that they had run into evidence suggesting presence of the H5N1 virus in the live-bird market's garbage, as well.

The virus has the potential to cause severe illness in humans with a high fatality rate. "We are lucky, as the strain (clade 2.2) of H5N1 that circulates in Bangladesh is less virulent, but it can change into another class (2.1), which is highly infectious to humans," the IEDCR director said. According to the World Health Organisation, across the globe, H5N1 killed 349 out of its 592 victims, except the latest 2 detected in Bangladesh [in fact all the 4 previous cases recorded in Banglades recovered]. Chief veterinary officer Mosaddek Hossain, who oversees poultry infections of bird flu, declined to comment when BDnews24.com approached him at around 6.30 pm. Professor Nitish C Debnath, FAO expert on avian influenza, told BDnews24.com that the government should launch a "wet market cleaning drive" at this moment. "All should be vigilant to prevent sick poultry from entering the market," he warned.

With 4 strains of flu virus -- H5N1, H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2 -- circulating in Bangladesh, the Food and Agriculture Organisation [FAO] in August last year [2011] warned of a possible major resurgence of bird flu. It said a mutant strain of the H5N1 virus is spreading in Asia, including Bangladesh.

The government has confirmed the 1st case of human infection with H5N1 in 2008, and 2 cases were reported in 2011. IEDCR advises people to wash egg shells and suggests consuming well-cooked poultry products. It also urged people not to throw out giblets and dead birds just anywhere and to maintain personal hygiene, coughing into the crook of the elbow and washing hands with soap often.

The 1st human infection with H5N1 was detected in 1997 in Hong Kong.

[The 1st case described above is the case of avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection previously reported in ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza, human (26): Bangladesh (Dhaka) 20120301.1057954, with subsequent WHO confirmation (Avian influenza, human (28): Bangladesh (Dhaka) WHO 20120303.1059658. This case is only the 4th Bangladeshi case, and this case and the preceding 3 cases reported from Bangladesh all recovered after relatively mild illnesses.

Now another 2 live-poultry market workers in Dhaka have been diagnosed with avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection, bringing the total of human cases in Bangladesh to 6. Information on the medical condition of these 2 new cases is awaited.
