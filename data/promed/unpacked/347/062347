LYME DISEASE - USA: (MAINE) INCREASED INCIDENCE

Dr. Dora Anne Mills of the Maine Center of Disease Control says 50
cases of Lyme disease were reported in the state in January and
February 2010. That's up from a 5-year average of 15 for those 2 months.

Officials told the Portland Press Herald that the warm temperatures
in recent months are likely to blame, setting the stage for a
possible increase in ticks for the coming summer.

Maine Medical Center biologist Chuck Lubelczyk said ticks normally
come out in the middle of April, when the snow is gone and the ground
thaws. But with the warm winter, ticks have been active most of the
past several months.

[_Borrelia burgdorferi_, the spirochete that causes Lyme Disease, is
transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick (_Ixodes
scapularis_ in Maine), which begins to feed on a blood meal in
spring, soon after the thaw. The thaw in Maine has apparently
occurred earlier than usual this year. A graph of selected reportable
diseases in Maine that displays preliminary Year-To-Date (through
February 2010) totals with median Year-To-Date totals for the
previous 5-year period (available at
<http://www.maine.gov/dhhs/boh/ddc/epi/publications/reportable-diseases-0210.pdf>)
shows higher reported number of cases of Lyme disease through
February than the 5-year median.

The following has been extracted from a prior ProMED post (Lyme
disease - USA: (ME) increased incidence 20090715.2523):

Lyme disease is distributed focally within the United States: it is
considered endemic in 8 northeastern (Connecticut, Delaware,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and
Rhode Island) and 2 upper Midwestern (Wisconsin and Minnesota)
states, where 93 percent of cases were reported during 2003-2005
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm>).

Lyme disease surveillance in Maine began in 1989 and the number of
Lyme disease cases has increased steadily since 2000. Over the same
period, incidence rates for the USA population were relatively stable
while rates for the entire New England region fluctuated but still
remained higher than those for Maine; case rates were highest for 3
southeastern, coastal counties (York, Lincoln, and Knox), with 71.2
cases per 100 000, 56.5 per 100 000, and 42.9 per 100 000, respectively
(<http://lymebook.com/blog/geographic-incidence/lyme-disease-in-maine-statistics-cases/>).

Some inland areas, including Kennebec County, have also experienced
an upsurge in reported cases, a phenomenon that is consistent with
ecological studies tracking changes in deer tick (_Ixodes
scapularis_) populations
(<http://lymebook.com/blog/geographic-incidence/lyme-disease-in-maine-statistics-cases/>).

_Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the cause of Lyme disease), _Anaplasma
phagocytophilum_ (the cause of human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and
_Babesia microti_ (the cause of babesiosis) share a common vector,
the deer tick
(<http://entnem.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/medical/deer_tick.htm>),
which along with the white-footed mouse
(<http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Peromyscus_leucopus.html>),
maintain the organisms in nature, and as a result, the diseases they
produce have a common geographic distribution in the northeastern and
upper Midwest USA, where this tick is commonly found. Patients with
any one of the diseases transmitted by _Ixodes scapularis_ may also
be concurrently infected with the other diseases transmitted by this vector.

It should be noted that cases are reported by county of residence,
which is assumed to be the county of exposure. But people are often
exposed to infected ticks outside their county of residence.
