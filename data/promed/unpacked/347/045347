---------------------------------------------------------------------
Greenhouse tomatoes from Lower Saxony showed symptoms consisting of mottling, yellowing, and/or chlorotic spots. 8 samples were analysed by high throughput sequencing, 2 samples were pooled. STV sequences were detected in 2 of the pools, and no other virus sequences were detected. The full genomes were assembled by mapping to STV reference (Genbank). The sequences had 99.9% nt identity to each other and to [an] STV isolate from Switzerland [see link below].

To confirm the findings in the original samples, for the 4 samples in the positive pools RT-PCR was performed. STV infection was confirmed in 3 samples. The sequences had 100% identity to the sequences [obtained earlier]. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of STV infecting tomato in Germany.

[_Southern tomato virus_ (STV) is a member of the new genus _Amalgavirus_ and was first reported in the Americas. The genus _Amalgavirus_ (family Amalgaviridae) has been designated as part of the plant cryptoviruses and is phylogenetically related to virus families containing nematode, protozoan and fungal pathogens.

STV has been detected in many different commercial and local tomato varieties, but so far it is not known if it also has any other hosts. A high rate of seed transmission in tomato of up to 90% has been reported. Specific insect vectors or horizontal transmission, such as by mechanical means or grafting, have not been reported for STV. A role of potential weedy reservoir species is being investigated.

Symptomatology of STV is still being debated. STV has frequently been detected in mixed infections with other tomato viruses in association with leaf yellowing, stunting, and fruit malformation; there are also reports of detections from asymptomatic plants (ProMED-mail post 20190616.6522021). However, in the detection in Germany in symptomatic plants above, no other viruses are reported.

Further research is needed to determine the pathogenic role of STV in these various scenarios and its epidemiology, as well as a potential quarantine risk, since tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to be able to spread pathogens internationally (such as, ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560).
