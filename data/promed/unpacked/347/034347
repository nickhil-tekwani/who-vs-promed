Rice farmers in Taraba State have raised alarm over an unidentified fungal disease. The Rice Farmers Association said [that] farmers have sprayed their rice with all known pesticides without results as the destruction of the crops persisted. The association has reported the outbreak to the Ministry of Agriculture. They said that many farms have been destroyed by the strange disease.

[It is unclear why a 'fungus' is considered to be the cause of the problems above. While an outbreak of rice blast (caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_) was reported from the neighbouring state of Bauchi in 2019 (ProMED-mail post 20190704.6551673), a range of pathogens including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes have been reported to affect rice crops in the region. Reliable diagnosis of the cause(s) and/or pathogen(s), as well as identification of any potential external factors associated with the problem, are essential before any management strategies can be designed.
