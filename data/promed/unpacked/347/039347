Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Qatar [10 Mar 2016]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [21 Feb 2016], the National IHR Focal Point of Qatar notified WHO of 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case
A 66-year-old, male, Qatari national developed symptoms on [18 Feb 2016] while in Saudi Arabia, where he had stayed for approximately 2 months. On [19 Feb 2016], the patient sought health care in a hospital in El-Hassa Region, Saudi Arabia, where he was treated symptomatically and discharged. The patient developed additional symptoms on [20 Feb 2016]. On the same day, as his condition deteriorated, the patient was transferred by ambulance to a hospital in Doha, Qatar. The patient, who was a heavy smoker and had comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [21 Feb 2016]. He passed away on [7 Mar 2016].

The patient owned a camel barn in Saudi Arabia and frequently visited it. He had a history of frequent contact with the camels and of consumption of their raw milk. He had no history of contact with the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

The Ministry of Public Health of Qatar carried out case investigation and contact tracing. Respiratory swabs were collected from the patient's household and healthcare contacts in Qatar resulted negative for MERS-CoV. Household contacts were monitored until the end of the 14-day exposure period to the case.

Health education messages about appropriate preventive measures were shared with all contacts, who were advised to comply with the recommended MERS-CoV preventive measures and to report the development of any respiratory symptoms to the health authorities. Infection prevention and control measures in all health facilities have been reinforced by the Ministry of Public Health.

The National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia was informed and investigation of contacts as well as the camels that the patient owned in Saudi Arabia is ongoing. None of the household contacts identified in Saudi Arabia developed symptoms. Following notification of the event, the Ministry of Agriculture in Saudi Arabia investigated the concerned camels. Swabs were collected from the camels; however, laboratory results are pending.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1652 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 591 related deaths.

[What is not mentioned in the above report is whether this patient was tested for MERS-CoV while hospitalized in El-Hassa (also known as Al Ahsa, El Hasa, Hadjar, or Al-Ahasa). Hufoof -- which is located in the Al Ahsa governorate -- was the location of earlier nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV in 2013 and 2015. The report above mentioned the patient was treated "symptomatically". Checking the listing of previously reported cases there have been no reports of MERS-CoV infected individuals in the Al Ahsa governorate since a case reported from Hufoof on 29 Oct 2015. Hence, one suspects that there has been undetected transmission in the Al Ahsa governorate.

A map showing the Al-Ahsa governorate can be found at http://tinyurl.com/zqfemzs. Note that it borders with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as well as extends close to Alkarj and Riyadh to the west. - Mod.MPP
