It is official now, the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) that has killed 233 children in Bihar since May [2012] is not Japanese encephalitis, announced Thursday [28 Jun 2012] the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV).

"In fact the disease remains a mysterious one," Additional Secretary (Health) RP Ojha said. "NIV has told the Bihar government that no one had a positive strain [test?] for Japanese encephalitis," he said.

According to him, the NIV collected cerebral spinal fluid and blood samples of 73 patients from Muzaffarpur district.

Earlier this month [June 2012], Health Minister Ashwani Kumar Choubey announced that the mysterious disease was AES.

Ojha said of the 599 children with AES symptoms admitted to hospitals in Muzaffarpur, Patna, and Gaya, 233 have died.

[The encephalitis situation in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states remains unclear. Although reports from this year (2012) and previous years implicates Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections in at least some of the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases, the report above rules out JEV infections in the current Bihar cases. The question now is -- if not JEV infections, then what is the etiological agent involved? A recent publication attributed AES cases to heat stroke, rather than to an infectious disease (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120613.1166861). No mention is made of that possible etiology in the report above.
