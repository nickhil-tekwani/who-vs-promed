Canada's ongoing outbreak of mumps has hit the country's biggest
city. And Toronto's public health officials expect the current case
count of 3 infections to climb before the outbreak subsides. "I think
we may see more cases," Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Director of communicable
disease control for Toronto Public Health, said in an interview
Tuesday 15 May 2007. That's because one of the infected young adults
spent a number of hours last Thursday night [10 May 2007] at a
crowded nightspot in the city's Kensington Market neighbourhood,
known as the Supermarket Restaurant and Bar. "We know it's a very
popular place. There were probably around 300 people there, so they
may have been exposed to mumps," said Yaffe.
Toronto Public Health called a news conference to [alert] both to
young people who were at the bar and city doctors who may soon be
diagnosing a disease many would not have seen in a very long time, if
ever. "So we're saying to those people: If they develop the signs or
symptoms, swelling and pain in the salivary glands around the sides
of their cheeks, fever, headache, muscle pains, aches, fatigue, or
loss of appetite, they should [consult their doctor]," Yaffe said.
She urged people who believe they may have mumps not to go to their
doctor without calling first, so that arrangements can be made to
ensure other people aren't exposed to a potential case.
"We're also telling people in general, and particularly in that age
group -- the university age group -- to try and modify their
behaviour; to do less sharing of saliva. You know, don't share
drinks. Don't share water bottles. Because that is a great way of
spreading infections, including mumps."
As of May 11 2007 -- the most recent date for which national numbers
are available -- the Public Health Agency of Canada was reporting 271
cases. But those numbers are already out of date. A spokesperson for
the Ontario Ministry of Health said on Tuesday [11 May 2007], that
the province now has 9 confirmed cases, up from the 8 in the public
health agency's report.
There are other discrepancies. British Columbia has stated it had a
case, in a student who has recovered and returned to Nova Scotia. But
the public health agency doesn't include that case in its tally
because it doesn't meet the national definition. According to the
agency's criteria, confirmation requires a positive lab test or a
known link between the suspected case and someone who tested positive
for mumps.
The public health agency reports cases in 4 provinces: Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Ontario. The vast majority
of the infections -- 222 as of last Friday [11 May 2007] -- have
occurred in Nova Scotia, where cases first started cropping up in
Halifax in mid-to-late February [2007]. The city, which boasts a
vibrant bar scene ideal for the spread of a disease like mumps, has
been the epicentre of this outbreak.
Yaffe said 2 of the 3 Toronto cases are students who attend
university in Halifax who came home at the end of the school year.
The 3rd was a person exposed to one of the 2 cases.
University aged young adults make up the majority of the cases. They
appear to be at greatest risk because they would have only received
one dose of measles, mumps, and vaccine rubella (MMRV) in childhood.
While one dose protected a great number of people, in some people it
wasn't sufficient to prevent infection; since the mid-1990s, 2 doses
have been given. But even 2 doses don't always prevent infection.
Yaffe said one of Toronto's cases had 2 shots of MMR vaccine in childhood.
Symptoms of mumps include aches, pains, fever, loss of appetite and,
in about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva glands that
give mumps its characteristic chipmunk-cheek look. In males past
puberty the virus can also infect one or both testicles, leading to a
painful condition known as orchitis. Mumps in both testicles can
result in sterility. Other potential, if rare, side effects include
meningitis and encephalitis. and women who become infected during the
1st trimester of pregnancy are at increased risk of miscarrying.
"It's generally a benign childhood disease -- that's what we think
of," said Yaffe. "But again, with all these benign childhood diseases
there is some complication rate."
