Many children in Jumla district have taken ill due to an outbreak of [a] viral fever. Health officials at Karnali Academy of Health Sciences and Teaching Hospital attributed the outbreak to abrupt change in climate. On Wednesday [20 Mar 2013] alone, several children were admitted to the hospital after contracting viral fever, said Bikalpa Pokharel, a doctor at the teaching hospital. He said it is likely that more children would contract the fever in the days to come. Abrupt rise in body temperature is one of the symptoms of viral fever. "The illness may be life threatening if not cured on time. As the medicines for the illness are not readily available, it makes treatment all the more difficult," said Pokharel.

Meanwhile, the hospital said it has recorded a rise in elderly asthma patients visiting the hospital lately. The hospital said more than 15 elderly patients visit the hospital for asthma treatment every day.

Although the teaching hospital has aimed to establish a 50-bed facility, there are only 35 beds available currently.

[The nature of the illness described in this report cannot be interpreted in the absence of any precise clinical information other than that several children have been admitted to a hospital in Karnali with febrile symptoms. The children's condition has been attributed to a viral infection. None of the familiar childhood illnesses (measles, mumps, chickenpox, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, etc.) can be excluded, nor is it certain that their condition is the result of virus infection. It is likely that the increase in admission of elderly asthmatic patients is coincidental, although there could be infection with a respiratory virus in both populations.

In November 2012, children in a different part of Nepal were admitted to hospital with suspected pneumonia, but no further information was reported subsequently.

Jumla is the capital of the Jumla District in the Karnali Zone of Nepal. The town is located at an altitude of 2514 metres on the banks of the Tila River and is one of the highest rice growing areas in the world. The Tila Valley as well as the Sinja Khola Valley are covered with paddy fields growing the Kala Marci rice variety, a unique red rice that is sought after for its special taste. Jumla is a zonal headquarters of the Karnali zone. It is served by an airstrip and by a road from Surkhet.
