Denmark finds 1st suspected human bird flu case
-------
Denmark found its first suspected case of human bird flu, according
to reports reaching here Saturday from Danish capital of Copenhagen.
The Danish news agency Ritzau reported on Saturday a 25-year-old man
who tested positive for bird flu had been transferred from the
hospital in Nykoebing on the island of Falster to the Royal Hospital
in Copenhagen.
But no official confirmation so far for the report.

across the world according to figures from the World Health
Organization.

[The absence of apparent avian influenza in Danish poultry would make
this human case appear unlikely, although H5N1 has been seen in wild
birds in this country. The nature of the testing is not stated and
we await the results of official word and confirmatory tests. -
