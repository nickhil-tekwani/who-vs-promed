In the area of Pakoan, Gulaibancah, Kenagarian Gadut, Tilatang Kamang
subdistrict, Agam regency, a disease attacked the area. It is the
[virus that] causes chikungunya where the sufferer is almost
paralyzed. As of the date of this news release [11 Nov 2011], there
are 2 people who suffer from this disease in the area immediately
adjacent to the City of Bukittinggi. "But thanks to the infected
individuals having been rapidly brought to Achmad Mochtar Hospital
(RSAM) Bukittinggi, the threat of paralysis had been anticipated.
Reportedly the victim is recovering," said Pakoan Youth Chairman, Jon
Sutan Longhouse, to Padang Express, yesterday (10 Nov 2011). He said
the Agam District Health Office went to the field to conduct spraying
fogging last Tuesday (8 Nov 2011).

[There was an apparent (but later not confirmed), significant focal
outbreak of chikungunya virus infection in Central Java province. Not
surprisingly, no fatalities are reported in that outbreak or in the
one above, as is the case in nearly all chikungunya outbreaks.
Morbidity may be significant, and incapacitating arthralgia may
persist for weeks or months in convalescent individuals. Reports of
chikungunya infections often indicate that the patient is paralyzed.
In reality, rather than paralysis, the patient may have arthralgia so
severe that they are reluctant to move because of this joint pain. The
original report above indicated that this area is having a mixed
outbreak involving both dengue and chikungunya viruses.

Agam is a regency of West Sumatra, Indonesia. It has an area of
2232.30 sq km (862 sq mi) and a population of approximately 419 800
people. Tilatang Kamang is one of 15 subdistricts in this regency. A
