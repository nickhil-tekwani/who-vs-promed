The number of yellow fever cases in Brazil advances. From July 2017 to 14 January [2018] there were 35 confirmed cases of the disease, with 20 deaths. Most of these occurrences are concentrated in Sao Paulo. The state registers 20 confirmed infections with 11 deaths. The registered [cases] are significantly higher in those presenting in the last week of December [2017]. The country registered 4 confirmed infections with one death during this period.

The data were presented on this [Tue 16 Jan 2018] by the Ministry of Health, hours after the World Health Organization (WHO) changed their recommendation for vaccination in the country. This organization now recommends that international travelers with Sao Paulo as their destination get vaccinated against the disease.

According to the Ministry, the change established by the WHO does not change the defined strategy for vaccination in Sao Paulo. The state [Sao Paulo], alongside Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, will strengthen vaccination and offer partial doses of the vaccine in areas considered strategic.

The yellow fever vaccination campaign in Sao Paulo will be expected to start in a week. In Sao Paulo, the campaign will be expanded and anticipated. Instead of being initiated on [Sat 3 Feb 2018], as had been planned, the campaign will begin on [Mon 29 Jan 2018]. The goal is to vaccinate 8.3 million people in the state. There will be 2 "D Days", days in which health posts will be open on Saturdays, [Sat 3 and Sat 17 Feb 2018].

"The recommended areas for vaccination remain the same," stated the acting Minister of Health, Antonio Nardi.

[With the occurrence of recent cases, the vaccination campaign is urgent. Application of fractionated (reduced volume) doses of the vaccine (1/4 the normal, full dose) is being applied to conserve vaccine to have enough to cover the population in this and the other states. The campaign is urgent because of the continuation of cases and evidence of circulation of the virus in the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission. The strategy is to have a sufficient level of herd immunity via vaccination to prevent spill-over of the virus from the sylvan cycle into an urban, person-person transmission via _Aedes aegypti_ urban cycle, which has not occurred in Brazil since 1942.

"This January (2018) the states and municipalities involved in the campaign will train health professionals and work out the logistics to provide and apply the fractionated doses" (in Portuguese).
