In March 2006, 2 vans of police inspectors, undercover in jeans and
sneakers, pulled up at a storefront near the Piazza Morselli on a
sensitive raid, a matter of national well-being and security. Their
target was not terrorists, weapons or drugs. It was smuggled Asian
poultry -- a product at risk for carrying bird flu.
While sorting through a refrigerator at the back of the Chinese
grocery store, the inspectors found their quarry: bags of unlabeled
refrigerated duck feet that General Emilio Borghini, head of the
Military Police Health Service, deemed "suspicious." A similar raid
at a warehouse here a few months ago yielded 3 million packages of
chicken meat smuggled from China in unmarked packages, even though
such imports have been banned in the European Union since 2002. "In
spite of the EU ban we are still seizing Chinese poultry products,"
Borghini said.
There is increasing evidence, experts say, that a thriving
international trade in smuggled poultry products -- including birds,
chicks, eggs, meat, feathers and other products -- is making a
substantial contribution to the spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus.
Poultry smuggling turned out to be a huge and previously largely
overlooked business, perhaps second only to narcotics in
international contraband, experts and government officials believe.
H5N1 is a robust virus that survives not just in live birds but in
frozen meat, feathers, bones and on used cages -- although it dies
with cooking.
"No one knows the real numbers, but they are large; behind illegal
drug traffic, illegal animals are No. 2," said Timothy Moore, an
official at the University of Nebraska, who has advised the U.S.
government on agricultural disaster planning. "And there is no doubt
in my mind that this will play a prominent role in the spread of this
disease. It looks to be the main way it is spreading in some parts of
the world."
Illegal trade seriously undermines the bans on poultry products from
bird flu-infected countries that many governments have enacted in the
hopes of stemming spread of the disease. Many experts are convinced
that the illegal import of infected chicks introduced the virus into
Nigeria, setting off Africa's 1st and largest epidemic, which is
limited to poultry farms and has not affected wild birds.
This week, Vietnamese health officials said chickens smuggled over
the border from China had reintroduced bird flu into their nation,
which had reported no cases for 4 months.
No one has any precise sense of the extent of the trade -- or the
importance of its role in spreading bird flu -- because until
recently, poultry smuggling was regarded mostly as an economic
nuisance. The police and experts say the trade is hard to control
because such massive amounts cross borders in trucks, carts, planes
and boats each day. Smuggled meat from Asia is often loaded in
containers with a mish-mash of other goods -- from clothes and toys
to furniture. Labels indicating the port of origin are easily
falsified.
"We're aware that the risk to public health can be hidden in these
containers, but thousands of containers pass through Italian ports
and it is impossible to inspect them all," said Mario Pantano,
director of the Police Health Service in southern Italy, who said his
staff had found hidden poultry products stuffed into shoes.
Late in 2005, his team discovered a shipment of 260 tons of meat
scattered among several containers transiting at a port in Calabria
in southern Italy, destined for the tiny East European country of
Moldova. Because of improper paperwork, the inspectors started asking
questions and determined that the shipment had come from China.
Although many countries attribute the spread of H5N1 to migratory
fowl, many ornithologists say the evidence often points to smuggling.
"We believe it is spread by both bird migration and trade, but that
trade -- particularly illegal trade -- is more important," said Wade
Hagemeijer, a bird flu expert at the Netherlands-based Wetlands
International, which has been studying the role of migrating birds.
"Unfortunately it's very difficult to get good information about
smuggling, and it's convenient to blame wild birds, since then no one
has to admit that their borders are out of control." The effect of
smuggling can sometimes be direct, when sick birds are smuggled onto
farms. The H5N1 virus strain found on the farms involved in Nigeria's
1st outbreak, in northern Kano state, closely matched those found on
Chinese farms, Hagemeijer said.
Although bird flu has now been detected on many farms in several
African nations, there have been only a handful of reports in wild
birds on the continent, supporting the notion that trade is most
important there. "We're been looking for it in wild birds for the
last 2 months and it is surprising that we've come up with zero,"
Juan Lubroth (FAO) said, noting that scattered outbreaks in the wild
might be particularly hard to detect in Africa.
Producers in Egypt and Nigeria frequently import day-old chicks for
about 20 cents a bird, because it was easier to buy them than to
master the delicate technology of hatching. In Nigeria, 100 percent
were smuggled and therefore not inspected, because all imports were
banned by the Nigerian government to protect its young domestic
industry. The main concern is China, a country with a serious avian
influenza problem and also formerly a major exporter of chicken and
poultry products. There is extensive illegal trade between China and
Africa, experts say.
"The government policies created the illegal trade," said an official
at the U.S. Embassy in Lagos who spoke on condition of anonymity,
adding that some products certainly came from Asia. "The industry was
growing at 8 percent annually and it needed imports, from parent
stock to hatching eggs. Everything comes in illegally."
Since H5N1 lives through most slaughtering and shipping, smuggled
poultry products of many types can bring the virus into a country:
infected chicken parts in feed or fertilizer, second-hand cages used
to house infected birds, or cheap meat that ends up being used on a
farm or in a home where other birds are kept.
In the developing world, the illegal trade often has economic roots,
as businesspeople try to avoid duties. But there is a strong cultural
element as well. For example, Asian immigrants seek out poultry
products, like feet, that may not be available in the West. The
illegal meat that has been seized in Italy has been at Chinese stores
or warehouses servicing Chinese restaurants.
Several months ago, Milan's health inspectors noticed that all of the
Chinese restaurants in Milan bought their poultry from a single
distributor. When they conducted a surprise raid at the warehouse of
Euro Food International in Milan, they discovered 3 million packages
of meat from China.
