Asian soybean rust - national map commentary
--------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust (ASR) has now been reported on soybeans in the
following locations: Baldwin County in Alabama, Marion County in
Florida (6/29) and Seminole County in Georgia. The Alabama and
Florida finds were in sentinel sites, while the Georgia find was on
volunteer soybeans which have since been destroyed. 7 counties in
Florida have now reported ASR on kudzu, the latest find was in
Gadsden county on 5 Jul 2005, which is adjacent to Leon County in
Northern Florida. Intensive scouting is continuing throughout eastern
North America from the Gulf coast to southern Ontario wherever
soybean is grown with no new finds. As new tropical storms, such as
Dennis, push through northward, there are more possibilities of spore
dispersal from known infected sites in Florida and Alabama to the
north. Additional moisture from the tropical storms will provide
conditions conducive for soybean rust development.

[The gist of this report is that ASR may spread further following
recent tropical storms. New reports of ASR are likely over the next 2
weeks. At present, no soybean rust pathologists are calling for applications of
chemical fungicides to combat ASR. - Mod.DH]
