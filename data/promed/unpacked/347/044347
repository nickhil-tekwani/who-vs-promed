Dengue in Cuba: Request for Information
----------------------------------------
The Cuban independent press have repeatedly reported the existence of
dengue in the suburbs of the city of Havana during this week. There are
also reports of at least one death probably two which would indicate the
presence of hemorrhagic dengue (DHF). (I have e-mailed Professor Kouri at
the Institute Pedro Kouri asking for his confirmation or denial of these
reports, but I have not gotten a reply so far).
The actual reports of dengue can be found at the following two sites:

A total of 666 cases of dengue have been confirmed so far, compared with
468 in 2000. Cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) have almost doubled to
81, with 2 deaths aged 5 and 29 years, compared with 42 during the same

14 years, of whom 2 or 3 cases are being hospitalized daily.
