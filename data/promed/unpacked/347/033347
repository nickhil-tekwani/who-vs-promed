A total of 10 people who were hired by the Sarawak Forest Corporation
(SFC) to "save" animals from being drowned, following the impoundment
of the Bakun Dam, are now dead. The dam was impounded in October last
year [2010]. The 10 dead were allegedly killed by a mysterious
disease. Bakun Community Safety Committee chairman Dr Ellie Luhat said
today [1 Aug 2010] that the latest such death was a 28-year-old SFC
worker who worked on the project. His father told FMT that his son
fell gravely sick after returning from Bakun Dam. "We sent him to the
hospital, but the hospital did not know what caused his sickness. We
sent him to a private clinic. Again, we were told that the doctor
could not determine what made him sick. 2 days later he passed away,"
said [the father]. Angry and dissatisfied, he asked for a post-mortem
to be conducted on his son. According to him, the doctors again could
not determine the cause of his death.

The death came to light after Luhat called for an investigation into
the death of the 10 SFC workers. He believes they could have been
exposed to infectious and deadly diseases such as melioidosis and
leptospirosis (known locally as "penyakit kencing tikus"). "So far 10
persons have died from the mysterious disease and a number of others
have been infected," said Luhat.

Also in critical condition is the village penghulu (chief) who is in
Bintulu Hospital. The penghulu was transported to the Bintulu Hospital
when he collapsed during the recent visit of deputy chief minister
Alfred Jabu Anak Numpang to the dam.

"They (the 10 workers) were involved in moving large animals from the
Bakun Dam water catchment area to higher ground and fell sick upon
completion of the work. There have also been several mysterious deaths
over the years in that area including a cousin of mine. Because of
this, we want the government to confirm and identify the diseases, so
that immediate and remedial actions can be taken. This may include
vaccination," Luhat said.

Melioidosis is caused by a bacterium (_Burkholderia pseudomallei_)
found in soil, rice fields, and stagnant waters. Victims acquire the
disease when the contaminated soil comes in contact with an abraded
area of the skin. Leptospirosis is caused by a bacterium called a
spirochete [_Leptospira interrogans_] and is transmitted through
contact with contaminated soil or water.

Luhat, who is a retired Sarawak Timber Development Corporation (STIDC)
officer, has been actively involved in the dam. He believes that the
change of biodiversity could have resulted in the spread of the
diseases. Local people believed that the "spirits" of the jungles are
angry over the construction of the dam and the destruction of the
surroundings. They believed their dead ancestors are also angry that
their graves (pendam) have been submerged by the dam water.

Luhat said that he is sending letters to the relevant authorities to
alert them of the mysterious deaths. "These diseases can affect the
tourism industry apart from the lives of the workers and the local
people. The diseases can also affect the government's plan to
introduce aquaculture of 'empurau', which is Sarawak's most famous and
expensive fish," he said, adding that the death of several tonnes of
fish early this year [2011] could have been due to these diseases.

[Very little information is given in this news release as to the
clinical manifestations, epidemiology, or laboratory findings to make
a differential diagnosis, other than a fatal illness following
exposure to soil and water in construction of a dam in a tropical
region of the world and diagnoses of melioidosis and leptospirosis
were being considered, in which case, the illness was presumably
febrile. There were non-fatal cases, but their number is not given.
Many etiologic agents could be responsible for an undifferentiated
febrile illness.

The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments on the
possible etiologies of an acute non-specific febrile illness in
ProMED-mail post Undiagnosed illness - Mexico: (SL) RFI 20110720.2190:

"Acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses, that is, occurring in the
absence of an obvious focus of infection, have several possible
etiologies that vary with the geographic region in which they occur
(1-3). Some are rodent-associated, such as, leptospirosis,
_Hantavirus_ infection, _Bartonella_ infection, tularemia, and murine
typhus. …. Other possible etiologies include scrub typhus, dengue,
chikungunya, malaria, brucellosis, enteric fever, and melioidosis.

The clinical manifestations and the epidemiological features of
_Hantavirus_ infection and leptospirosis can be strikingly similar
(4). Tularemia and leptospirosis can be acquired from contact with
water contaminated by the urine of infected reservoir host animals;
melioidosis is also acquired by contact with contaminated water.
However, melioidosis is usually endemic in parts of Southeast Asia and
northern Australia ….

"Scrub typhus is restricted to a region that extends from northern
Japan and far-eastern Russia in the north, to northern Australia in
the south, and to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the west."

Specifically for Malaysia, _Bartonella_ have been detected in animal
ectoparasites in Malaysia
(http://www.msptm.org/conference/program/47-Student-Oral.pdf).

Large numbers of patients with potentially fatal _Plasmodium knowlesi_
infection (simian malarial species) have been reported in Sarawak
(Cox-Singh J, et al: _Plasmodium knowlesi_ malaria in humans is widely
distributed and potentially life threatening. Clin Infect Dis. 2008;
46(2): 165-71;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2533694/); and tick
typhus has been reported to be the most common rickettsial infection
in rural Sarawak
(http://www.thaiscience.info/journals/Article/Research%20note-%20rickettsial%20infection%20in%20five%20remote%20orang%20ulu%20villages%20in%20upper%20rejang%20river,%20sarawak,%20malaysia.pdf).
A more detailed description of the clinical manifestations,
epidemiology, and laboratory data in the outbreak at the Bakun Dam is
clearly needed.

The controversial (see http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/130982)
hydroelectric Bakun Dam, the 2nd tallest concrete-faced rock-fill dam
in the world, is under construction on the Balui River in Sarawak,
Malaysia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakun_Dam). The Bakun dam
flooding began on 13 Oct 2010.

Sarawak can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
http://healthmap.org/r/15-V - Mod.ML]

[The crew of 10 that died was hired to "save" animals from drowning
following the closure of the Bakum dam. The denominator is not given,
but as you don't need many people to move cattle it was probably near
100% mortality, and they were working in a flooded environment.
Considering the frequency of leptospirosis in adventure racers in
backcountry areas it could have been leptospirosis, though the reports
list no animal deaths or illness. But we have both wild and domestic
animal shedders and in the right conditions the organism can persist &
multiply in shallow water. But such high mortality rates are unusual
with this disease, and it would be relatively straightforward to
diagnose.

On the other hand Nipah virus was recorded in pigs, dogs and cats in
Kuching, Serian and Sibu districts of Sarawak, which were consequently
declared Nipah virus-infected areas in 1999. And this infection
carries a high mortality risk. The absence of Nipah reports in Sarawak
during the past 10 years can be interpreted in many ways, but one
might be clinical unawareness. See 19990606.0957, and also 20000722.1214, 20000710.1148, 20000707.1127.
