The stem rot disease has affected the pointed gourd cultivation in some areas of Naogaon district [Rajshahi Division]. Agriculture officers said the disease is caused by a fungus infection in the stem. It infects the plants that are in their vegetative or flowering stages.

[A farmer] of the area said most of the green pointed gourd plants on his land have turned yellow as a result of stem rot disease. "I cannot recoup the production cost from the cultivation", he added. "We could not protect the plants using any of the pesticides available in the market", [other farmers] said.

[A local] agriculture officer said excessive rain during [the] cultivation period is the main reason behind the disease.

[The name gourd is used for a range of species in the family of Cucurbitaceae which also includes melons, cucumber, squash, and pumpkins. Young fruit are a popular vegetable in many Asian countries, mature fruit may be dried and used for various purposes ('bottle gourds').

A number of soil borne cucurbit root and stem rots caused by fungal pathogens, as well as fungus-like _Phytophthora_ species, are known. High humidity, as described above, is conducive to the development of many of these pathogens. Reliable diagnosis is needed for successful disease management.

In Bangladesh, gummy stem blight caused by the fungus _Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum_ was reported recently from gourd crops in the neighbouring Khulna division (ProMED-mail post 20191208.6829808), but it is not clear whether the problem reported above is thought to be due to the same pathogen.
