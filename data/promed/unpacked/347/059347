International humanitarian organizations have hinted on being alert together with the Malawi government amidst the cholera scare in Malawi's borders. This comes amidst incessant scares of the outbreak in Malawi's borders. UNICEF states on its website that it is on high alert following a cholera outbreak in the southern border areas, where highly populated camps for people displaced by the floods are located.

"Over a period of 2 weeks, the Ministry of Health has confirmed 39 cases of cholera, including 2 deaths. New concerns are that a rapid spread of infection could lead to a larger outbreak that already over-burdened health services may not be able to contain. There are also new alarming reports in neighboring Mozambique (which shares a border with Malawi), which has recorded more than 3400 cholera cases and 37 deaths since 25 Dec 2014, many of them children."

"As humanitarian actors in Malawi, we need to move quickly to stop any further spread of this disease," said UNICEF's representative in Malawi, Mahimbo Mdoe. "These displaced populations are extremely vulnerable, particularly those with low immunity, such as malnourished children. UNICEF is working to support the government with mobile health services, as well as safe water, sanitation and hygiene services, which are critical factors in preventing the spread of cholera."

Cholera poses a serious public health problem to populations in crowded environments, with inadequate water and sanitation resources. While cholera is endemic in Malawi, no cases have been reported in the last 3 years. The last time the country experienced a large-scale outbreak was in 2009, when well over 1000 people were infected.

UNICEF's chief of health in Malawi, Kyaw Aung, says so far UNICEF has begun measures to stop the outbreak from spreading further. "UNICEF has dispatched protective equipment, 30 cholera beds, 15 isolation tents, medicines, IV fluids and 1450 bottles of chlorine in health facilities," said Mr Aung.

The cholera outbreak is [most strongly] feared in Nsanje, which borders Mozambique and was also affected by floods that hit the nation in February 2015.

Cholera has spread to the central Mozambican province of Zambezia, the provincial governor, Abdul Razak Noormahomed, told a press conference in the provincial capital, Quelimane, on Tue, 24 Feb 2015. Razak said that 2 cases of cholera were diagnosed on Mon 23 Feb 2015, and a further 6 on Tuesday morning, 24 Feb 2015. All 8 cases were in Quelimane. None of them have died of the disease. Razak said there had been 23 cases of serious diarrhea (16 children and 7 adults), and 8 of these had been diagnosed as cholera.

Cited on the independent television channel STV, Razak said that all mechanisms have been activated to ensure that the disease does not spread to other parts of the province. The government, he added, will do all in its power to ensure that no one dies of cholera in Zambezia. Zambezia is the 4th province to suffer a cholera outbreak this rainy season. The others are Tete, Nampula and Niassa.

According to the health authorities, the total number of known cases of cholera in the 4 provinces is 3468, and so far 37 of these have died. This is a lethality rate of 1.1 per cent.

Achi said government health officials had been mobilized to the affected communities and some of the victims in critical condition had been stabilized.
