A differential diagnosis list generated by Gideon [Global Infectious Disease & Epidemiology Network] http://www.GideonOnline.com, includes 2 lesser-known pathogens which have been associated with single small clusters of hemorrhagic fever in Africa: Bas-Congo virus (rhabdovirus) and Lujo virus (arenavirus). In 2008, 4 of 5 patients died of Lujo virus infection in a South African hospital, following transfer of an index patient from Zambia. The following year, 2 of 3 villagers in DR Congo died in an outbreak of Bas Congo virus infection. If tests for other pathogens continue to be negative, these 2 agents might be considered.

[ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this information. If samples remain from the cases in South Sudan, it would be of interest to test for Lujo and Bas-Congo viruses.
