Another 3 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been confirmed in UK
residents who have visited Corfu, bringing the total number of cases
to 12, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has said. The HPA said 3
other possible cases in people who travelled to the Greek island in
the past 3 months are still under investigation.

As a precautionary measure, the HPA is looking into the possibility of
a UK source, but a spokeswoman said preliminary investigations have so
far not found a common link between the patients -- whose ages range
from 39 to 79 -- other than they all visited Corfu, albeit different
parts of the island. Greek health authorities have sent 2 teams to
Corfu and over the past week water samples have been taken from hotels
and other venues.

Professor Nick Phin, head of the HPA's Legionnaires' department, said
Legionnaires' was uncommon and cannot be spread from person to person
but warned residents to be aware of the risks. "As we are still seeing
cases of Legionnaires' in UK residents returning from Corfu, we want
them to be aware of this potential risk, but we are not suggesting
that people change their holiday plans," Mr Phin said. He said it was
difficult to pinpoint the cause behind the Legionnaires' cluster.
"Sometimes a source for the infection is never found, because the
bacteria can live in a very wide variety of types of water supply," he
said.

The HPA is working with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control, UK colleagues, and the Greek Public Health authorities to
identify the source of the Legionnaires' cluster. People going on
holiday to Corfu are being told to be aware of the signs and symptoms
of Legionnaires' disease, which is a form of pneumonia which is spread
through water droplets. Symptoms may start between 2 and 14 days after
exposure to the bacterium, often with an initial flu-like illness
leading on to pneumonia.

[HealthMap Alerts submitted a similar news release. These news
releases add 3 more cases to the 9 cases previously reported as having
developed Legionnaires' disease among British tourists following a
stay on the Greek island of Corfu. (See Legionellosis - UK ex Greece,
travelers, alert 20111008.3021). It would be useful for the HPA to say
if there are any towns, hotels, or other tourist destinations on Corfu
that were found to be in common among these 12 British tourists, or,
if nothing is in common on the island of Corfu itself, if there are
any common means by which these 12 British tourists traveled to
Corfu.

Corfu, a popular tourist destination, is a Greek island northwest of
mainland Greece off the coast of Albania in the Ionian Sea
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfu). For a map of Corfu see
