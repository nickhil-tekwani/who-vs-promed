Pseudorabies has been detected in Germany again. The deadly virus mainly affects pigs, but is also dangerous for dogs. So far cases have been reported in Rhineland-Palatinate, Thuringia, and Bavaria, as the disease is notifiable. In Thuringia, a hunting dog had to be euthanized as he had bitten an infected wild boar. The Landesjagdverband NRW (hunters organisation of North Rhine-Westphalia) has issued a warning, as dogs being walked in forests can become infected with the pathogen.

The disease caused by this virus is also called Aujeszky's disease. It is a herpesvirus which can cause infection to many mammals. For humans there is no danger. The incubation period is 2 to 9 days. Symptoms include itching and problems swallowing, eventually leading to paralysis during the course of the disease. There is no cure for pseudorabies, vets can only treat the symptoms. In most cases the infection is fatal.

There is no vaccination against this virus. Dog owners should monitor their dogs closely, especially in the forest, in order to avoid contact with infected animals. Also, no fresh meat of wild boar should be fed to them.

[Although most mammals are susceptible to infections with pseudorabies virus (PRV), swine seem to represent the main host reservoir.

PRV-infected feral swine represent a potential source of infection for domestic pigs in North America. By contrast, reports on PRV-infections of wild boar in Europe are scarce. Evidence exists for sporadic PRV-infection of wild boar in Germany (serosurveys), and seroprevalences might reach high levels in East Germany. Based on official hunting statistics, Germany and France are believed to have among the highest population densities of wild boar in Europe. - Mod.PMB
