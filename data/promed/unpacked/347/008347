The UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) has reported that a main United Nations logistics hub managed by the World Food Programme (WFP) in Guinea is fully operational despite the fire that swept through the facility last week threatening medicines and laboratory materials used in the fight against Ebola. The facility is located in the main humanitarian logistics base of the airport and of the city of Conakry, the capital of Guinea. UNMEER stated "The cold chain capacity has already been re-established via the setup of donated refrigerated 40 foot containers."...

According to the latest update released today [24 Dec 2014] by WHO, 19 497 people have now been affected by Ebola, with 7588 reported deaths, including 666 health care workers who are known to have been infected up to the end of 21 Dec [2014], 366 of whom have died [but see updated figures in [1] above. - Mod.JW]

[3] Liberia: Christmas celebration
Date: 24 Dec 2014

Christmas is celebrated in Liberia by painting houses decoratively and carols playing on the radio. It is a festive time of year. Commentator Siatta Scott Johnson says there's a government order to paint all office buildings, shops and private houses by mid-December 2014, otherwise you face a fine. She says Ebola has not changed that practice. The past couple of months have seen the number of new cases declining and stabilizing in Liberia.

Ebola specialists warn that creeping complacency is the new enemy and that Liberians must remain vigilant. A presidential order is in force, banning large gatherings in the capital city Monrovia to keep people from crowding together and possibly spreading the virus, including on beaches. (And neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone have banned public celebrations altogether during the festive season because of Ebola.)...

Sierra Leone has declared a lockdown of at least 3 days in the north of the country to try to contain the Ebola epidemic. Shops, markets and non-Ebola related travel services will be shut down, officials said. Sierra Leone has already banned many public Christmas celebrations. Alie Kamara, resident minister for the Northern Region, told the AFP news agency that most public gatherings would be cancelled.

More than 7500 people have died from the outbreak in West Africa so far, says WHO, with Sierra Leone the worst hit. Sierra Leone has the highest number of Ebola cases in West Africa, with more than 9000 cases and more than 2400 deaths since the start of the outbreak. Sierra Leone has been in a state of emergency since July [2014].

A hazard payment delay has led to nurses striking work in Sierra Leone. Nurses at a public hospital in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone went on strike on Thu [25 Dec 2014], claiming that hazard pay for the month of November [2014] had not been paid by the government. Around 30 nurses at the Mabenteh Hospital stayed off work...

[7] Region: UN teams to study lines of transmission
Date: Wed 24 Dec 2014

Medical detective work will be the next big phase in the fight against Ebola when the United Nations deploys hundreds of health workers to identify chains of infection as the virus passes from person to person, top UN health workers said. The health teams will travel to each district and region of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the 3 countries at the center of the epidemic, to trace who each infected person has potentially contacted. The effort will run in parallel with measures to minimize the spread of infection, such as treating all Ebola patients in specialized centers and burying all victims safely. The plan is to contain the virus by understanding its lines of transmission, said WHO director-general Margaret Chan.

"You don't have control of Ebola until you know where all your transmission chains are and until your cases are coming from known contact lists," said Bruce Aylward, WHO's head of Ebola response. Illustrating the scale of the challenge, 25 per cent of new cases in Liberia are coming from new sources, Aylward said. By contrast, officials in Guinea said in November [2014] that all the cases in the capital stemmed from just 4 chains.

The UN health agency will mobilize 900 epidemiologists, triple the number currently available, he said. Around half will be foreigners. The aim is to get teams in place by the end of January [2015], following a separate plan to get all patients treated and all victims safely buried by the end of this month [December 2014]...

The Chinese military has developed and will test an Ebola vaccine on humans in December 2014, a defense ministry spokesman said Thu 24 Dec 2014. Spokesman Yang Yujun said at a regular press briefing that the vaccine has been developed by a research team at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. "The vaccine has recently passed appraisal by state and military authorities," Xinhua quoted Yang as saying.

Yang said the China-developed Ebola vaccine was the 3rd one to have been put into clinical tests in the world. It is also the 1st 1st genetic mutation Ebola vaccine in the world.

[9] Cote d'Ivoire girds its loins
Date: 24 Dec 2014
From: Dr Adjogoua, Edgard Valery <edgardadjogoua@pasteur.ci> [edited]


Cote d'Ivoire shares on all its western part, a common border with Guinea and Liberia, major epidemic Cote d'Ivoire countries of the Ebola virus disease. The north western part of Cote d'Ivoire is bordered by Mali, a new infected country. This reality makes it the country most at risk in West Africa, but so far, no cases have been reported and confirmed.

The country is preparing to face a possible epidemic. In order to face this situation, a national committee to fight against Ebola virus has been introduced. The National Institute of Public Hygiene coordinates and monitors the activities in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur of Cote d'Ivoire (IPCI), which is responsible for the laboratory diagnosis of any suspected cases. These 2 Institutes ensure, firstly, the training of health workers about precautions to take to protect themselves from infection with Ebola virus, and secondly, awareness. In response to this epidemic risk, what has been done at the laboratory level?

A situation analysis was used to verify the diagnostic capabilities of the Institute, the capacity and level of containment and biosafety, human resources and infrastructure. Indeed, IPCI has a security level 3 laboratory obtained as part of a US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) TB project and a biological resource bank for the secure storage of samples.

The presence of an experienced team enabled biosafety risk assessment and the provision of quality procedures and biosafety. This team has enabled the provision of more appropriate personal protective equipment. A needs assessment of consumables and small equipment was made.

One of the major strengths has been the availability of human resources. The Pasteur team is composed of virologists, epidemiologists, veterinarians, pharmacists, engineers, technicians, inventory manager, logistics etc. At the infrastructure level, an inventory of the different laboratories was done. The Department of Epidemic Virus and platform for molecular biology of the IPCI have the equipment to perform diagnostic tests in real-time and conventional PCR.

As technical staff was insufficiently prepared for this epidemic risk, training was organized and upgrading sessions at national and international level. A biologist from the IPCI was trained by WHO in the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) on molecular diagnosis of filoviruses [The UVRI has experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) among its staff. - Mod.JW]. A sample management system from the peripheral level (health center) to the laboratory at the IPCI has been defined. Each district of the western border of the country was given a triple packaging container approved for the transport of highly pathogenic microorganisms.

The primers, probes and positive controls were provided initially by the regional laboratory for arboviruses and hemorrhagic viral fevers in Dakar [Senegal] and then by WHO. In the field, 6 regional laboratories developed through collaboration with CDC were trained for Ebola activities. The IPCI set up in each laboratory involved in the response a team responsible for the collection and the transport of samples to Abidjan [the capital]; to provide a list of equipment and training necessary for biosafety; provide technical procedures for the collection, storage and transport of samples; and supervise the activities of regional labs. IPCI also makes the diagnosis of suspected samples and maintains a comprehensive database of the samples received and finally ensures and coordinates the proper disposal of laboratory waste as part of the response to the epidemic. 63 samples of suspected Ebola cases were collected from March to December 2014 in Cote d'Ivoire. Only 9 samples were taken from people who had stayed in the epidemic area. All these 63 samples tested by real-time PCR with Altona Kit (Realstar filovirus screen RT-PCR kit 1.0) after extraction with mini-Qiagen kit were negative for Ebola and Marburg viruses. Among these samples, 2 were positive for the yellow fever serology (IgM).

[10] Guinea-Bissau: no news good news?
Date: 14 Dec 2014 [no update since then]
Source: Crofsblogs [edited]
http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2014/12/waiting-for-ebola-news-from-guinea-bissau.html


Sundays are slow news days at best, but the absence of reports from Guinea-Bissau is slightly maddening. I know it's a small country, a former Portuguese colony, but surely someone in Bissau or a neighbouring country must know what's happening with the suspected Ebola case who crossed the border from Guinea-Conakry.

Aggravating the problem is that Guinea-Bissau seems to have just a couple of online news sources, one of which is weeks out of date. Neither has a word about Ebola; the original report on the suspected case came from a francophone source, which hasn't updated the story since Fri [12 Dec 2014]. And the government has no health ministry that I can find.
