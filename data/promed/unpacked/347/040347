Update number 358 (based on data up to 22 Dec 2019)
---------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns

Summary
-------------
In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity continued to increase in most countries.

In North America, influenza activity further increased, and although all seasonal influenza subtypes were co-circulating, there was a high proportion of influenza B viruses.

- In Europe, influenza activity continued to increase across the region and was reported at moderate levels in some countries of Northern Europe.
- In Central Asia, influenza activity increased with influenza A and B viruses co-circulating.
- In Northern Africa, influenza activity was low overall.
- In Western Asia, influenza activity remained elevated overall and continued to increase in Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Turkey and Yemen.
- In East Asia, ILI and influenza activity continued to increase overall.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, influenza activity was low overall, except for Cuba where increased detections of influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses were reported. In tropical South American countries, increased influenza activity was reported from Ecuador and Colombia in recent weeks.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity was elevated in some countries of Eastern and Middle Africa.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity was low in most reporting countries, but remained elevated in the Islamic Republic of Iran, though decreased.
- In South East Asia, influenza activity was reported in the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Malaysia.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
Worldwide, seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 110 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 9-22 Dec 2019 (data as of 3 Jan 2020 08:00:07 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 96 024 specimens during that period. A total of 20 706 specimens were positive for influenza viruses, of which 14 225 (68.7 percent) were typed as influenza A and 6481 (31.3 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 3210 (28.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 7890 (71.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 45 (1.5 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 2962 (98.5 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[2] Japan - Influenza 2018/19 season
Date: 9 Jan 2020
Source: National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan [edited]
https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-vol40-e/865-iasr/9288-477te.html


The 2018/19 influenza season (from week 36 in September 2018 to week 35 in August 2019) was characterized by the predominance of the influenza A/H1pdm09 subtype in the beginning, followed by the AH3 subtype and B/Victoria lineage from week 10 in 2019.

Epidemiology of the 2018/19 influenza season: Under the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID) system, approximately 5000 influenza sentinel sites (approximately 3000 pediatric and 2000 internal medicine facilities) report patients diagnosed as influenza on a weekly basis. The number of patients reported per sentinel exceeded 1.0 (the usual indicator of the nationwide start of influenza season) in week 49 of 2018 (Fig. 1 & https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/10/2096-weeklygraph/2572-trend-week-e.html) and exceeded 10.0 (indicator for the alert level used at the public health center level) in all 47 prefectures by week 2 of 2019. The peak was in week 4 of 2019 with 57.09 patients/sentinel, which was the highest since April 1999 when the Infectious Diseases Control Law was implemented.

Based on the reported sentinel surveillance data, the estimated number of influenza patients who visited medical facilities between week 36 of 2018 and week 17 of 2019 was approximately 12 000 000. From the 2018/19 season, the method of estimation has been improved and is expected to be approximately 0.66-times the previous estimate. According to hospitalized influenza patient surveillance (data from approximately 500 designated sentinel hospitals with 300 or more beds), the number of hospitalized influenza patients (between week 36 of 2018 and week 17 of 2019) was 20 389. Among patients diagnosed as "acute encephalitis (including encephalopathy)" (a category V notifiable infectious disease), the causative pathogen was reported to be influenza virus in 223 (between week 36 of 2018 and week 17 of 2019). Approximately 3400 excess deaths were observed nationwide in the 2018/19 season, which was estimated to be similar to the average year (see p. 192 of this issue).

Isolation/detection of influenza virus in the 2018/19 season: Prefectural and municipal public health institutes (PHIs) reported the isolation/detection of 8382 influenza viruses (6105 isolates and 2277 detections without isolation) (Table. 1). Among them, 7704 were reported from the influenza sentinel sites and 678 from non-sentinel sites (Table 2). Influenza type A/H3 comprised 56 National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-vol40-e/865-iasr/9288-477te.html, A/H1pdm09 comprised 36 percent, and B comprised 8 percent https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-vol40-e/865-iasr/9288-477te.html (Yamagata lineage 7 percent, Victoria lineage 91 percent, and unknown lineage 2 percent https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-vol40-e/865-iasr/9288-477te.html) (Table 2). Although isolations of A/H1pdm09 began increasing from week 48 of 2018, it was surpassed by that of A/H3 from week 2 of 2019. Isolation of influenza type B began increasing from week 10 of 2019 and surpassed that of type A from week 17 of 2019 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). In the early summer of 2019, more A/H1pdm09 and A/H3 were found in Okinawa than in previous years (Fig. 2 and see p. 186 of this issue). Overseas, there were epidemics mainly of type A, whereas type B epidemics were less frequent.

Genetic and antigenic characteristics of 2018/19 isolates: The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) conducts genetic and antigenic analyses of isolates from Japan and other Asian countries. For antigenic analysis, post-infection ferret antisera were used (see p. 180 of this issue). The hemagglutinin (HA) genes of all A/H1pdm09 isolates analyzed belonged to genetic clade 6B.1A, and the majority of viruses possessed a 183P substitution in HA. Antigenicity analysis demonstrated a lower reactivity of the viruses with vaccinated human serum. Although A/H3 is broadly divided into 2 groups, 3C.2a and 3C.3a, in the HA gene tree, all analyzed strains in the 2018/19 season belonged to 3C.2a. More than 90% of viruses tested reacted well with ferret antiserum against cell culture-propagated A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 virus (the vaccine strain for the 2018/19 season), but hardly with the ferret antiserum against the egg-propagated virus, which had undergone antigenic mutation due to egg adaptation. The HA genes of all B/Yamagata lineage isolates tested belonged to genetic clade 3, and more than 90% of isolates tested were antigenically similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013 virus (the vaccine strain for the 2018/19 season). The HA genes of all B/Victoria lineage strains tested belonged to genetic clade 1A, and 74% of isolates possessed 3 amino acid deletions in HA. Approximately 70% of viruses tested reacted well with ferret antiserum against B/Colorado/06/2017 virus (WHO recommended vaccine strain for the 2018/19 season), which has 2 amino acid deletions in HA.

Resistance to antivirals among 2018/19 isolates: Among the 2163 domestic isolates of A/H1pdm09, 21 (1.0%) isolates were found to be resistant to oseltamivir/peramivir. Four of the strains were isolated from patients who had not been treated using the drug. Of the 331 A/H1pdm09 isolates from Japan, 6 (1.8%) baloxavir-resistant mutants were detected from patients treated using the drug. With the exception of one B isolate that was resistant to peramivir, the 331 A/H3 and 161 B domestic isolates analyzed were susceptible to oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir. Regarding baloxavir, among 356 A/H3 isolates from Japan, 34 (9.6%) were resistant to baloxavir. Of these, 5 came from patients who had not been treated using baloxavir. Baloxavir-resistant variants of type B were not detected (see p. 185 of this issue).

Seroprevalence among the Japanese population prior to the 2018/19 season: Based on seroprevalence surveys conducted under the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases program, the seroprevalence levels were measured from 6569 serum samples collected between July and September 2018 (see p. 188 of this issue). The age groups with the highest seroprevalence (measured as HI antibody-positive, titer 1:40 or higher) were 10-24 year olds (68-71%) for A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 [A(H1N1)pdm09], 5-19 year olds (71-82%) for A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016[A(H3N2)], and 20-34 year olds (66-70%) for B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage). The sero-positivity for B/Maryland/15/2016 (B/Victoria lineage) was less than 40% for all age groups, except for 35-54 year olds (41-57%).

Influenza vaccine: The tetravalent vaccine for the 2018/19 season contained antigens of 2 type A and 2 type B strains. Approximately 27 170 000 vial-equivalent doses (estimated on the assumption that 1 vial contained 1 mL) were produced in the 2018/19 season, of which an estimated 26 300 000 vials were used.

For the 2019/20 season, A/Brisbane/02/2018(IVR-190) and A/Kansas/14/2017(X-327) were newly selected as the A/H1 strain and A/H3 strain, respectively. Both the B/Yamagata strain and B/Victoria strain selected were B/Phuket/3073/2013 and B/Maryland/15/ 2016(NYMC BX-69A), respectively, as in the 2018/19 season (see p. 196 of this issue).

A multicenter case-control study was performed on the effectiveness of 2 doses of the influenza vaccine in children under 6 years of age, and significant disease prevention effects were observed in the 5 seasons from 2013/14 to 2017/18 (see p. 194 of this issue). Continued active vaccination is recommended.

Human infection with avian and swine influenza virus (see p. 190 of this issue): Since 2003, 861 confirmed human cases (455 fatal cases) of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection have been reported from 17 countries, including the 1st case in Nepal in March 2019. There have been 24 reports of A (H5N6) virus from China since 2014, including one human infection case in both March and August 2019 (as of 27 Sep 2019). On the other hand, since 2013, China has reported a total of 1568 human cases (616 fatal cases) of low pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection (as of 27 Sep 2019). During the 5th epidemic (from October 2016 to September 2017), A(H7N9) viruses mutated to be highly pathogenic to poultry, and human infection cases were also reported. However, only 3 cases of human infection due to highly pathogenic viruses have been reported since October 2017, and no cases have been reported after April 2019. Human cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) virus infection have been sporadically reported from China, Egypt, Bangladesh, and Oman.

Regarding swine influenza viruses, human cases of A(H3N2) variant (v), A(H1N1)v, and A(H1N2)v virus infections, associated with exposure at agricultural fairs in the United States, have been reported.

Conclusion: The response to influenza will continue to require sustained, comprehensive monitoring. Important activities include monitoring of trends in the occurrence of influenza patients, isolation of influenza viruses, analysis of the antigenic and genetic properties of circulating strains, vigilance against the emergence of drug-resistant strains, and monitoring of seroprevalence levels.

Note: For IASR reporting, influenza nomenclature is based on the virus information available. Influenza viruses are classified by type, subtype, and strain based on hemagglutination (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and other information:

- When both HA and NA typing have been performed, names are listed fully [e.g., A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), A(H5N1)].

- When NA typing has not been performed, only HA information is listed (e.g., A/H1pdm09, A/H3).

- The strain name is represented by the location of isolation; in the case of isolation in Japan, the location is written in Japanese kanji, and in the case of isolation in foreign countries, in English.

- To distinguish swine influenza viruses recovered from humans from seasonal influenza viruses, the term "variant virus" is used with a letter "v" added after the subtype name [e.g., A(H3N2)v].

[3] Hong Kong: Arrival of the 2019/20 Winter Influenza Season
Date: 9 Jan 2020
Source: Centre for Health Protection [edited]
https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/letters_to_doctors_20200109.pdf


We would like to alert you that the local seasonal influenza activity has continued to increase in the past week and exceeded the baseline thresholds, indicating that Hong Kong has entered the 2019/20 winter influenza season. We anticipate that the influenza activity will continue to rise in the coming weeks and remain at an elevated level for some time.

Among the respiratory specimens received by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP), the percentage tested positive for influenza A and B viruses has increased steadily since mid-December last year [2019] and rose to 10.09% last week, which was higher than the baseline threshold of 9.21%. The circulating influenza viruses in the past 2 weeks were predominately influenza A(H1) (66.3%) and A(H3) (30.4%), with very few influenza B positive detections. The overall admission rate with principal diagnosis of influenza in public hospitals has been increasing to 0.40 per 10 000 population last week, which was above the baseline threshold of 0.25.

Globally, influenza activities continued to increase in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. The winter influenza season has already started in the United States (US), Canada, Europe, the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, Mainland China, Macau and Taiwan. Different subtypes of viruses circulate with varying proportions in different regions. Influenza A(H3) virus was predominating in Europe, the UK and Mainland China (both southern and northern provinces), while influenza A(H1) virus was predominating in places such as the US, Japan and Taiwan. In the US and southern provinces in Mainland China, influenza B virus was also one of the predominant circulating viruses.

For the surveillance of influenza-associated admissions to intensive care unit (ICU) and deaths among patients aged 18 years or older, private doctors are reminded to continue to report cases fulfilling the following criteria to the CHP through the infection control officer or designated responsible officer of the respective private hospital: adult patients (aged 18 years or older) who (i) required ICU admission or died; AND (ii) had any positive laboratory result of influenza infection. For patients admitted to public hospitals, the CHP has collaborated with the Hospital Authority (HA) to retrieve the relevant data electronically. In addition, all doctors in both public and private sectors are reminded to continue to report any paediatric patients who fulfill the reporting criteria for severe paediatric influenza-associated complication/death to the CHP.

Please advise your patients who are aged 6 months or above, especially the priority groups, to receive the 2019/20 influenza vaccine as soon as possible for personal protection. Moreover, you may consider empirical treatment with neuraminidase inhibitor (e.g. oseltamivir) for your patients suspected to have influenza infection early based on clinical assessment, especially patients at higher risk of complications, such as young children, elders, people with chronic diseases, pregnant women, etc.

It is still too soon to know how severe this season [2020] will be, but swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] claimed its 1st victim in the city [Pune, Maharashtra] and the state on [10 Jan 2020].

The 40-year-old man from the rural parts of Satara [district, Maharashtra] died after he tested positive for the contagion at KEM Hospital in Rasta Peth [Pune].

Currently, a 64-year-old woman in Pune is critical and undergoing treatment at the intensive care unit of Sahyadri Hospital in the city.

As many as 6 patients from Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, and Pune have tested positive for the virus in Maharashtra between [1 and 13 Jan 2020].

Symptoms of swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] are similar to a common cold, and people often take it lightly in the initial stages till it turns critical.

In 2019, as many as 2287 people in the state were diagnosed with the H1N1 infection. Of them, 246 people succumbed to the contagion, accounting for a significant mortality rate of 10 percent, calling for vigilance and also initiation of early treatment for influenza-like illness, say experts.

"Scientists at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) confirmed the presence of H1N1 virus in the man's throat swab on [2 Jan 2020]. He succumbed to [influenza A/H1N1]-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with septicemia around 5:50 am on [10 Jan 2020]. He was diabetic," a doctor from the KEM Hospital said.

The deceased man was from Nirgudi village in Phaltan taluka of Satara district. He had developed influenza-like illness from [24 Dec 2019]. "Initially, he had fever and cough. Later, he developed high grade fever with breathlessness. He was admitted to KEM hospital in Rasta Peth on [28 Dec 2019]. Despite medication, the man's condition kept worsening. He was also kept on ventilator support during the course of treatment," the doctor said.

Experts say that since the symptoms of [influenza A/H1N1] are quite similar to those of a common cold, people often don't take it seriously in the initial stages until it becomes critical.

"An [influenza A/H1N1] flu patient usually suffers from a burning sore throat, abdominal pain, and cough and the additional symptom of shortness of breath. These symptoms should not be dismissed and need to be treated under the supervision of a medical expert," infectious diseases expert Mahesh Lakhe of Columbia Asia Hospital in Kharadi [Pune] said.

He recommended a [quadrivalent] flu vaccine shot before the flu season peaks, especially for those suffering from underlying medical conditions.

[Introduction of vaccination to protect the high-risk groups is a priority intervention to reduce the burden of influenza. In individuals belonging to the high-risk groups, it is important to initiate treatment early in order to prevent influenza-associated complications and help reduce mortality. To prevent further transmission of the disease in the community, it is necessary to maintain respiratory and hand hygiene and stay at home during the illness. - Mod.UBA]

https://www.dawn.com/news/1527724/five-h1n1-flu-cases-reported-in-karachi


Sources told Dawn on [Sat 11 Jan 2020], that 5 patients, who had reported at a private hospital in Clifton [Karachi] over the past few weeks, were tested positive for [influenza A/H1N1].

One of these patients, identified as a 35-year-old man admitted to the same hospital on [27 Dec 2019] last year and was treated in its infectious diseases' ward, died on [5 Jan 2020].

The sources said that 2 patients infected with the H1N1 strain were currently under treatment at the hospital, while 2 others had been examined in its outpatient department.

No health department official was available for confirmation, while the private hospital hadn't specified the H1N1 flu as the cause of his death, as the patient had some other health complications also.

Sources said 4 to 5 cases of H1N1 flu had been reported in Islamabad as well.

The H1N1 influenza -- according to the WHO -- is similar to seasonal influenza but has been characterised by higher activity during the northern summer season, higher fatality rates among healthy young adults, and higher incidence of viral pneumonia.

Precautions
-----------
Sharing his concern over flu cases, senior ENT [ear, nose, throat] specialist Dr Qaiser Sajjad of the Pakistan Medical Association said people must not get scared of H1N1 flu as it was like any other influenza strain.

"What is, however, important for the public is to know is that influenza is a highly contagious viral infection and that increasing the body's immunity through preventive steps is the key to avoiding complications," he said.

These measures included vaccination against influenza that should be done every year, intake of a healthy balanced diet, 7 to 8 hours per night of sleep, and drinking plenty of water.

In case of infection, patients should have complete bed rest and avoid hugging, shaking hands, and sharing personal paraphernalia such as glasses, cups, towels, mobile phones, pens, etc.

"Do not indulge in self-medication. Antibiotic drugs are not used in any viral disease, and people should get treatment only from qualified doctors," he explained.

The government should start a mass public awareness campaign, and influenza patients should be kept in isolation wards. Provide clean and safe potable water to the patients and their attendants, he said.

"The PMA [Pakistan Medical Association] again demands the establishment of virology laboratories at all provincial capitals so that viral diseases such as H1N1 flu, dengue, and other viruses could be diagnosed promptly," he said.

[6] Yemen

https://www.scidev.net/global/health/news/hundreds-dead-as-yemen-flu-outbreak-spreads.html


The World Health Organization (WHO) sought to allay fears about the presence of swine flu in Yemen after the war-torn country's health authorities said a growing outbreak had claimed more than 270 lives in 3 months.

The Houthi-affiliated health ministry is introducing measures to combat the spread of the H1N1 flu strain across several governorates only months after declaring an emergency state over outbreaks of dengue and malaria.

According to a report released by the ministry and seen by SciDev.Net, the virus has killed 271 people out of 6945 suspected of contracting the infection since October 2019. "We need an appropriate assessment and comprehensive management to avert the crisis, especially as we have received several complaints that hospitals cannot accommodate more cases," said Yemeni director of epidemiological surveillance Khaled al-Mo'ayad, WHO's representative in Sanaa. Altaf Musani confirmed that the number of cases had reached an all-time high since last October [2019]. He tried to allay fears of a swine flu outbreak, however, saying it was no more than a "seasonal flu" pattern that will continue until the spring.

The report, entitled "The pandemic status of acute respiratory inflammations," states that the virus has reached 17 governorates, representing 3/4th of the country, with Sanaa, Thamar, and Saada the worst affected.

Yemen's director of epidemiological surveillance Khaled al-Mo'ayad, said: "We have recorded 90 deaths in Sanaa alone." He told SciDev.Net that the health ministry had announced some containment measures, adding: "We have instructed public and private hospitals to allocate certain departments and beds in intensive care units that are equipped with fluids and Tamiflu medication for free. We have also established full laboratories and entities for surveillance."

Taha al-Motawakkel, a health minister in the Houthi-affiliated administration, has ordered a high committee to be established, involving representatives of several ministries, as well as a 24/7 operation room, in collaboration with international partners, to tackle the virus.

WHO officials reject the use of the term "swine flu" in reference to the outbreak. Musani uses the term "seasonal flu" that is further categorised into 4 types, A-D. "The spread pattern of this flu differs from one country to another, as well as death rates, according to the conditions there," he said.

Islam Hussein, senior researcher in Microbiotix, Inc, a company which specialises in developing antimicrobials, told SciDev.Net: "The term swine flu was not correct in the 1st place, as the flu does not directly spread from pigs (swine), but the strain passed through several genetic mixing stages before getting to the final form that attacked humans. This virus is now categorised under viruses causing seasonal flu, and it is one component of seasonal vaccination."

Whatever term is used, it is not the 1st time the virus has hit Yemen, however, with records of infections and deaths throughout the past 3 years. In 2009 and 2010, Yemeni health authorities recorded around 650 swine flu infections and around 40 related deaths.

Ahmed Hassan El-Qa'eesh, head of epidemiological surveillance in Muhweet governorate, said: "The ministry didn't take it seriously though, and there haven't been official records, as most hospitals reject infected personnel while dealing with most of them indifferently."

He said that Sanaa had been the focus for the spread of the virus, adding that most cases have been diagnosed as chest inflammation, with patients dying without discovering that they were infected with the virus.

Meanwhile the country is still battling with an outbreak of dengue fever, with more than 65 000 suspected cases and 245 deaths in 2019, according to official figures.

Musani ruled out that the flu outbreak in Yemen could be an indication of a global pandemic, such as the one in 2009-2010, saying that the current situation points to a normal increase in cases in the Middle East and North Africa region.

But Al-Mo'ayad warned that the health and economic status of the country is critical, creating a suitable environment for the virus to thrive. "We need an appropriate assessment and comprehensive management to avert the crisis, especially as we have received several complaints that hospitals cannot accommodate more cases."

Al-Qa'eesh also believes that the situation is "very risky," as the virus is capable of "totally destroying the lung in 3 days if patients couldn't find timely medical care." He says official statements ignore the reality on the ground, adding: "Medical capacities are very weak and insufficient."

There have been suspected and confirmed category A flu cases in several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Oman and Jordan, but "no abnormal cases," according to a WHO statement on 18 Dec 2019. Categories A and B are the ones which cause seasonal epidemics.

Virus H1N1, category A, spreads easily among humans through coughing, sneezing, hand contact, or touching surfaces infested with the virus. To prevent infection, WHO advises patients to cover their mouths and noses, stay at home when feeling sick, wash their hands regularly, and keep a distance from healthy individuals.

Dire conditions in Yemen throughout the war have led to the deaths of many infected people in their homes, "due to poverty and incapability to access medical care," said health ministry spokesman Youssef al-Hadry, adding: "What makes things worse is the similarity between symptoms of different categories of the flu, which leads to ignoring infected people and not taking appropriate measures at the right time."

He believes the outbreak "shouldn't cause any worries as it can be contained through vaccination," but admits that, in a country reeling from the effects of war, accessing vaccination could be hard, and warns that this could only worsen the country's health crisis.

Unlike most years, the 2019-20 flu season is hitting younger Americans especially hard, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received reports of 7 additional child deaths this week, bringing the total to 39, more than double the number at this time last year [2019].

Approximately 44 percent of reported flu cases this season are affecting children age 17 and under. The increase is due to a shift in the predominant strain, health officials say. While the predominant strain is usually influenza A, this year [2020], it's influenza B, which tends to affect children more. The strain also is known to cause severe complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, sinusitis and ear infections.

According to the state Department of Health, 36 people have died in Washington during the 2019-2020 flu season so far, including 3 children. King County recorded its 1st pediatric flu death in a decade in December 2019, and Pierce County continues to have the highest number of deaths associated with the flu in the state.

King County Public Health said Friday [17 Jan 2020] it appears influenza B activity had peaked within the county for the season, but flu activity is still expected to continue for several weeks.

"It's good news that we may be over the hump of the flu B outbreak, but the risk for influenza persists," said Dr. Jeff Duchin, Health Officer for King County Public Health. "If you haven't been vaccinated yet, it's still a good idea, there is plenty of flu to come."

According to Public Health, it is too soon to predict whether there could be a 2nd outbreak of influenza A.

Nationally, according to the CDC's influenza report for the week ending 11 Jan 2020, the percentage of virus specimens testing positive for influenza fell from 23.3 percent for the week ending 4 Jan 2020 to 22.9 percent this week. However, flu activity remains high, officials said, and the number of flu-related hospitalizations and deaths indicates we haven't yet reached the national peak of this year's [2020] flu season.

The CDC estimates that there have been at least 13 million illnesses, 120 000 hospitalizations, and 6600 deaths from the flu this season.

For comparison, the CDC reported a total of 9.7 million illnesses, 87 000 hospitalizations and 4800 deaths in its weekly report ending 4 Jan 2020.

The latest data from the agency show that the virus has been widespread in nearly all states, including Washington. Only 2 states, Oregon and Hawaii, in addition to the District of Columbia, are reporting regional or local activity.

The CDC's surveillance of influenza-like illness measures the level of flu activity within a state. According to the latest data, flu activity remains high in Washington, New York City, Puerto Rico, and 32 other states.

The groups most at risk of the flu are older adults, very young children, pregnant women, and those with certain chronic medical conditions, according to the CDC.

Influenza-related deaths in the region rose to 11 last week, and more than 1600 flu cases were reported, the county Health and Human Services Agency announced on 8 Jan 2020.

The latest flu fatality is a 51-year-old woman from North County who died from influenza A on 31 Dec 2019. She had underlying medical conditions.

To date, 11 influenza deaths have been reported locally, the same number as this time last year [2019].

The number of lab-confirmed flu cases jumped again last week, when 1623 cases were reported, 260 more than the previous week when 1363 flu cases were recorded.

"Given the high number of cases, influenza activity in the region continues to be widespread, just like it is in other parts of the nation," Dr. Wilma Wooten, county public health officer, said. "The best protection against the flu is getting vaccinated."
