antibodies in French horses, Galabru et al. [edited

The authors report a seroprevalence of 8.9% (14/158) on the basis of
Western immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence tests run on 158
equine sera collected during 1998 & 1999. These sera had been submitted for
routine examination and therefore the results are only broadly indicative
of a possible true seroprevalence of infection. The selective bias in the
sample is clear from the high number from more expensive horses and breeds
-- 115 sera were from French trotters and thoroughbreds. However, as a
first estimate of a near 10 percent, it is not a matter for complacency
even if most infections are subclinical.
