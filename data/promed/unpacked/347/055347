Rift Valley fever outbreak spreads in Sudan - WHO
-----------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Sudan has spread, killing 84
people out of 228 known cases, the World Health Organisation (WHO)
said on Thursday [8 Nov 2007]. The toll was up from 60 deaths among
125 people a week ago, according to the United Nations agency which
has been working with Sudan's health ministry since it sought help in
October [2007].

A total of 15 sites in White Nile, Sennar and Jazeera provinces in
central and eastern Sudan are now affected by the disease, which is
transmitted by contact with the blood or organs of infected animals,
the WHO said in a statement. The Rift Valley fever virus can also be
carried by mosquitos. Herders, farmers, veterinarians and
slaughterhouse workers are deemed at higher risk of infection from
the disease, which can devastate livestock.

There is no specific treatment or effective human vaccine, so it is
important to raise awareness of risk factors and ensure people take
protective measures to prevent exposure, the WHO said. Gloves and
other protective clothing should be worn when handling sick animals
or their tissues or when slaughtering.

Animal products including blood, meat and milk should be thoroughly
cooked before eating, it said. Humans should also sleep under
mosquito nets and wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers to protect
against bites. While most human cases are relatively mild, a small
percentage of patients develop a much more severe haemorrhagic form
which can cause them to vomit blood or pass it in their faeces.
Bleeding from the nose or gums can also occur. [Ocular disease has
also been a risk factor in some outbreaks of Rift Valley fever. - Mod.CP]

[The death toll in the Rift Valley fever outbreak along the Nile
valley in central Sudan is now 84, having increased by 24 since the
previous WHO report. The case number has risen more dramatically from
125 to 228, possibly indicated enhanced surveillance. There is still
no indication of the extent of animal disease associated with this
outbreak. Information from an informed source would be welcomed.
