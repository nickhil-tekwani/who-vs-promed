A virus believed responsible for cancerous tumors in Atlantic salmon has
been identified by a team of federal and university researchers. The virus,
salmon swimbladder sarcoma, is not believed to be a human health hazard but
could be devastating for Atlantic salmon populations, according to
researchers at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.
The virus is believed responsible for tumors that killed breeding-stock
Atlantic salmon in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hatchery in North
Attleboro, Mass. In the past the disease was found in commercial
aquaculture where salmon were grown in off-shore pens.
A cancer with similar symptoms was reported in some farm-raised Atlantic
salmon in Scotland in 1978, before modern genetic testing methods were
available. At the time, Scottish scientists reported seeing "virus-like
particles" during microscopic examination of the salmon tumors. To date
this disease has not been seen in any commercially raised Atlantic salmon
in the United States.
"We don't yet know how this virus is actually transmitted from one fish to
another," said James W. Casey, a Cornell professor of veterinary
microbiology and immunology. "Our concern is that the virus is in the
environment, and the levels of infection need to be determined."
The virus causes a slow-growing cancer that can take two years to produce a
noticeable tumor on swim-bladders. By the time the swimbladder tumor is
detectable, from a bulging in the side of the fish, the salmon are near
death. An earlier sign of swimbladder sarcoma might be blood hemorrhaging
from the fins. Although tumors are fatal, it appears that viral infection
alone reduces the salmons' vitality and reproductive success.
Salmon swimbladder sarcoma is classified as a retrovirus, Casey says,
because it contains hallmark sequence similarities to other members of this
group. There are many well-studied retroviruses that cause cancers in
chickens, mice, cats and humans, but salmon swimbladder sarcoma is the
first retrovirus of salmon that has been identified.
