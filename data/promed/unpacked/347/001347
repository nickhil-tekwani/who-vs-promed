Banana disease attacks Rumphi
-------------------------
An outbreak of banana bunchy top has been reported in Rumphi. Crop Protection Officer George Gopani called for an urgent intervention to eradicate the disease before it spreads to other areas.

"No banana variety in Malawi is resistant to the disease, so it is very important to eliminate it before it spreads to other areas. There are many banana orchards and we are afraid farmers would lose their income if the disease spreads," Gopani said. He said the deadly banana disease reduces yield to nothing.

District Commissioner Rodrick Mateauma said his office would ensure the disease did not spread to the district's major banana growing areas. "We are mobilising resources to start removing and destroying the infected crops. We are appealing to all to assist in the provision of alternative crops for the victims," he said.

According to Gopani, the banana bunchy top disease was 1st discovered in Malawi in 1994 in Nkhotakota [district].

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the only member of the genus _Babuvirus_ and only affects _Musa_ species. It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting and death of the host plant. The virus is spreading in Africa, Australasia and the Pacific Islands. BBTV is transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a persistent manner. Infectious insects may be spread on plant material. The virus is also spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools).

Disease management is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of
inoculum, use of clean planting material and frequent scouting for new outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV from a planting is usually impossible. Tolerant varieties can be used to enable some crop production in infected areas, but these cultivars may still support virus replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs. The report above does not clarify whether any tolerant varieties suitable to the affected area in Malawi are available.
