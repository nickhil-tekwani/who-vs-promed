The director of a prison in the Colombian city of Villavicencio (about 100 km [62 mi] southeast of Bogota) says overcrowding is to blame for one of the country's worst coronavirus outbreaks.

More than 850 inmates and members of staff have been infected. "How can I ensure there is isolation if there are people sleeping under the beds and in the bathrooms?" asked prison director Miguel Angel Rodriguez.

He said that when the outbreak started, there were 1835 inmates at the jail, more than double its capacity.

Mr. Rodriguez was answering questions about the outbreak at Villavicencio prison during a virtual session of the regional assembly in Meta province.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 13 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO has published an annex to the guidance on considerations on adjusting public health and social measures (PHSM) (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/considerations-in-adjusting-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-context-of-covid-19-interim-guidance). The new annex provides a pragmatic decision process to help countries through adapting PHSM based on epidemiological and public health criteria (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/public-health-criteria-to-adjust-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-context-of-covid-19).

- According to the 2020 World Health Statistics published by WHO today [13 May 2020; https://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2020/en/], the COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant loss of life, disrupting livelihoods, and threatening the recent advances in health and progress towards global sustainable development goals (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/13-05-2020-people-living-longer-and-healthier-lives-but-covid-19-threatens-to-throw-progress-off-track).

- WHO has joined forces with the UK to run an awareness campaign named "Stop The Spread" about the risks of inaccurate and false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic (https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/countering-misinformation-about-covid-19).

- The Regional Director for the WHO Regional Office for the Americas, Dr. Carissa F. Etienne called on countries to "support their economies while building strong social protection networks and embracing evidence-based public health measures that are essential to saving lives."

- In the "Subject in Focus" below, we discuss newly released WHO guidelines for school-related public health measures.

Subject in Focus: Considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Across the globe, countries have implemented a number of control measures to respond to COVID-19, with the objective of slowing down transmission and reducing mortality. Based on local epidemiology, some countries are in the process of scaling up public health and social measures, while others are considering or currently scaling down these interventions.

Based on local risk assessments, countries have implemented several public health and social measures, such as local movement restrictions, adapting schools to distance-learning and businesses to teleworking, and international travel measures. WHO has issued considerations for school-related public health measures to guide decision-makers and educators on how or when to reopen or close schools in the context of COVID-19. These decisions have important implications for children, parents or caregivers, teachers and other staff, communities, and society at large.

WHO school-related considerations to decide to close, partially close or reopen schools is guided by a risk-based approach to maximize the educational and health benefit for students, teachers, staff, and the wider community, and to help prevent a new outbreak of COVID-19 in the community. A series of factors should be considered when deciding on whether to open or to close schools, such as the epidemiology of COVID-19 nationally and in the local area, health system and public health capacity to respond to outbreaks as well as the school settings and ability to maintain COVID-19 prevention and control measures that protect children.

Thus, additional important factors to include in the assessment are risk of non-return to school, risk of widening disparity in educational attainment, access to meals for children who need them, the possibility of domestic violence aggravated by economic uncertainties, and the need to maintain schools at least partially open for children whose caregivers are "key workers" for the country.

These school-related considerations also provide recommended measures on hygiene, daily practices, physical distancing and tele-schooling to guide school reopening. These recommendations are provided through questions and answers and can be used as a checklist under topics such as school resources and infrastructure, policy for educators and school staff, safety and security of the children, hygiene and practices at schools, and communication with parents and students.

Finally, it is crucial to monitor the protective measures implemented to ensure their effectiveness and impact not only on educational objectives but also on health and well-being of the children, parents, family and school staff.

This risk-based approach needs to be implemented through inclusive and early collaboration between the school and the community. During this unique and challenging period, it is important for decision-makers, educational institutions and caregivers to maintain flexibility and modify approaches to ensure learning and sharing of good practices in order to do what is best for the children, students, school staff, and community.

The WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) co-hosted a webinar with UNICEF on public health and social measures in schools on 13 May [2020], with more than 890 registrants. Key questions such as managing physical distancing, physical activities and wearing of masks still remain as countries implement measures over the coming weeks and months. The comments provided by the participants were very positive, and there were requests for a follow-up seminar on examples from countries.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 37 847 new cases (46.4% of the global newly reported cases), and 1955 deaths (46.0%) were recorded for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 62.7% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil 14.8%, Chile 4.4% and Peru 4.0%. Recognizing that USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, if newly confirmed cases from the USA are excluded, then Brazil reported 40.0% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Chile 11.7%, Peru 10.7%, Canada 8.4% and Ecuador 6.5%.

The European region reported 24 527 new cases (30.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 1918 deaths (45.2%). Russia reported 40.1% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 13.8%, Turkey 6.9%, Italy 5.7%, Germany 3.3%, and France 2.7%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 10 243 new cases (12.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 121 deaths (2.8%). Pakistan reported 21.2% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 18.6%, Qatar 14.8%, Iran 14.4%, and Kuwait 9.6%.

The African region reported 2600 new cases (3.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 51 deaths (1.2%). South Africa reported 26.8% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 16.4%, Algeria 6.7%, Guinea-Bissau 5.8%, Nigeria 5.6%, and Cote d'Ivoire 4.8%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1329 new cases (1.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 51 deaths (1.2%). Singapore reported 63.8% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 19.8% and Japan 11.2%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 55%, Japan 31.3%, South Korea 5.4% and Malaysia and Australia 3.3% each.

The South East Asia region reported 5031 new cases (6.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 149 deaths (3.5%). India reported 70.1% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 19.2% and Indonesia 9.6%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 64.3% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 32.1%, Nepal 1.7%, and Sri Lanka 1.3%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 13 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South East Asia.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.UBA]
