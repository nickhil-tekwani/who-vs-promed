In a follow-up on the tularemia, or harpest situation in Sweden, a little over 120 people have become ill with tularemia over the past week, bringing the total to around 690 in 2019.

Compared to the previous weeks, there is a slight slowdown in the number of new cases, while compared to previous years there are still an unusually high number of people who fall sick with the bacterial infection, according to Folkhalsomyndigheten.

Most new cases of illness are reported from the Dalarna and Gavleborg region, which together now have over 400 cases, while the number of new cases from Orebro counties has decreased.

According to the CDC, tularemia is a disease that can infect animals and people. Rabbits, hares, and rodents are especially susceptible and often die in large numbers during outbreaks. People can become infected in several ways, including: tick and deer fly bites, skin contact with infected animals, drinking contaminated water and inhaling contaminated aerosols or agricultural and landscaping dust.

Symptoms vary depending how the person was infected. Tularemia can be life-threatening, but most infections can be treated successfully with antimicrobials.

[The number of cases of tularemia in Sweden continues to grow. Past reports have suggested that the outbreak is mosquito-borne but none of the reports have included clinical details of the cases. If an insect bite was responsible, one would see glandular or ulceroglandular disease, but if the outbreak was waterborne, then oropharyngeal infection with draining lymphadenopathy might be seen. ProMED would appreciate clinical information about the cases. - Mod.LL
