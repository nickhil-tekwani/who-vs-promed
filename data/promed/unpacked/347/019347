[In February 2017 Belgium reported HPAI H5N8. This serotype has been reported only in ornamental captive birds and single wild birds. Until now, it had not been detected in poultry farms. See further details of this February 2017 event at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22703. This event was reported as resolved on March 2017.

Based on information published by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) found at http://www.afsca.be/animalhealth/avianinfluenza/:

"Since avian influenza is not present on poultry farms, Belgium is still considered as « free » of this disease pursuant to the definitions contained in the OIE terrestrial code (chapter 10.4)".

Indeed:
- Belgium makes permanent measures mandatory in the higher risk areas (resting places and/or areas with a high density of migratory birds), so as to avoid any contact between domestic poultry and wild birds.

- Following the multiple outbreaks of Avian influenza in Europe, Belgium has been taking additional preventive measures since [10 November 2016]. Among these measures was the obligation for professionals to confine poultry in order to prevent any contact with wild birds.

- With these measures and the high professionalism of our poultry farmers, the introduction of the disease among poultry intended for trade and human consumption could be prevented in Belgium until now.

- The affected holding kept "ornamental/captive birds" for non-commercial purposes. Furthermore, the epidemiological investigation highlighted that these birds had multiple contacts with wild birds.

- Due to the outbreak [on 3 Feb 2017], the mandatory measures have been reinforced: the obligation of confinement has been extended to amateur poultry and ornamental/captive birds holdings (all poultry and captive birds present on the Belgian territory must now be confined) and all gatherings of poultry and captive/ornamental birds are prohibited (market, shows).
