Syracuse University health officials have said the campus mumps outbreak, at present, is not spreading as fast as it was earlier this semester.

Syracuse University, which has had 45 confirmed and 81 probable cases of the mumps since the end of August [2017], is not the only college that [has] grappled with an outbreak of the disease in recent years.

A mumps outbreak at the University of Missouri infected nearly 400 students in a 10-month span after the university confirmed a student contracted the disease in August 2016.

By the time a mumps outbreak at the University of Illinois ended in June 2016, 317 students had been infected.

And 301 students caught the mumps during an outbreak at the University of Iowa between July 2015 and May 2016.

SU health services officials say the disease is not spreading on campus as quickly as before. But, as the number of mumps infections spike nationwide, SU is one of the latest in a growing number of universities forced to handle the highly contagious disease on campus.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4980 people contracted the mumps nationwide between [Sun 1 Jan and Sat 4 Nov 2017]. In 2016, more than 6000 cases of the disease were reported, up from about 1500 cases in 2015. There were less than 500 cases of mumps nationwide in 2012.

Mumps cases reported to the CDC in 2016 and 2017 have primarily been "associated with college settings," according to the agency.

Brittany Kmush, an assistant professor in the David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics who studies infectious diseases, said mumps can spread quickly on a college campus because students are interacting in close quarters, such as living together in dorms and coming in contact with each other in classrooms.

But scientists are not sure why the disease has been contracted in such high numbers in recent years.

"Our evidence is limited to fully explain what has happened in the last couple of years," said Kelly Moore, director of the Tennessee Immunization Program at the Tennessee Department of Health. "If the answer were easy, we would have it by now."

Moore said researchers believe the mumps vaccine's effectiveness may wane as people get older. That may be one of the reasons why the disease has made a comeback in recent years, she added.

To attend college in New York state, students are required to receive 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Most are vaccinated when they are children.

Since the end of October [2017], SU has hosted 7 clinics so students could receive a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine. Every SU student who has contracted the mumps has been properly vaccinated, though, according to the health services website.

Although a CDC advisory board in October [2017] unanimously recommended that people exposed to a mumps outbreak should receive a 3rd vaccine, federal officials also said there was limited scientific evidence showing whether the 3rd dose protected individuals against mumps-related complications, The Washington Post reported.

But is a 3rd vaccine effective? "The simple answer is yes," said Patricia Quinlisk, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health. But, she added, "It's obviously more complex than that." Quinlisk said the effectiveness of the 3rd MMR vaccine depends on the timing of mumps cases, who the cases are occurring in and whether cases are linked. A 3rd vaccine is effective, Quinlisk said, if there are multiple mumps cases in a single dorm during a short period of time. If there are isolated cases over a longer period of time, a 3rd vaccine isn't necessary, she added.

The Onondaga County Health Department only recommended a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine after it was determined that:

There was high vaccination coverage at SU. Exposure settings, such as schools, colleges and dorms, were likely to cause easy transmission of the disease. There was a high attack rate and transmission of the mumps for at least 2 weeks.

Brad Hutton, deputy commissioner of public health at the New York State Department of Health, said at a press conference in October [2017] that the 3rd vaccine will not stop the mumps from infecting those who have already been exposed to the disease.

Still, roughly 30 percent of SU students received a 3rd MMR vaccine through the university's clinics, said Karen Nardella, medical director of Health Services.

SU's response to the mumps outbreak
Ben Domingo, director of SU Health Services, said the university has handled the mumps before. "We actually had a few close calls," Domingo said. "Last fall we had a case, and then we had a few cases in January [2017]."

None of the previous cases were considered an outbreak, he said. But, he added, those cases helped the university plan how it would confront a larger mumps outbreak.

Nardella said SU officials also looked at how the State University of New York New Paltz and University of Missouri handled mumps outbreaks.

SU's response to the outbreak has included isolating students with confirmed or probable mumps cases from the rest of the campus community for up to 5 days.

"The minute we were getting cases we were already familiar with the fact that, this fall, isolation was necessary," Domingo said.

Students have been housed in South Campus apartments and the Sheraton Syracuse University Hotel and Conference Center. If a potentially infected student lives in university housing with their own bedroom and bathroom, such as on South Campus, they can spend their isolation there, Nardella said. But because some may have roommates, they are asked to wear a mask in the rooms' common areas. ...-more

The Onondaga County Health Department in late September [2017] ordered SU to "exclude" students from campus who had not submitted vaccination records. Currently, 4 students remain excluded from campus, Nardella said.

Students can waive New York state's MMR vaccination requirement for medical or religious reasons.

If a person has a suppressed immune system or is taking certain medications, that could qualify as a medical exemption, Nardella said.

The 4 students excluded from campus will not be allowed to return to SU until at least [Thu 14 Dec 2017]. According to Health Services, they must remain off campus for a minimum of 26 days after the most recent confirmed mumps case. If a new mumps case is confirmed, the 26-day exclusion period starts over. ... - more

Nardella said the spread of mumps at SU began to slow in mid-November [2017], which she attributes to the vaccine clinics and communications from the university about how to prevent the transmission of the disease.

In mid-November, only 2 students were in isolation, she said.

[Cases rose to 51 as of [Wed 6 Dec 2017] and the number of probable cases increased to 81. The 51 confirmed cases represent the number of students diagnosed with mumps since August 2017. Some of those students have fully recovered. Probable cases are students with symptoms who require further testing. The outbreak began primarily among athletes and spread to other students.

To contain the outbreak, SU began offering students a 3rd dose of the mumps vaccine at the end of October 2017. SU has said all infected students had received the 2 required mumps vaccinations.

A mumps outbreak has continued to spread throughout Anchorage with 71 confirmed cases and 15 probable cases reported since May [2017]. The state recommends people be especially vigilant identifying and treating the infection during the holidays.

As of [Fri 1 Dec 2017], the mumps outbreak has not spread beyond the Municipality of Anchorage.

Dr. Amanda Tiffany, an epidemiologist with the Department of Health and Social Services, says the Alaskan mumps outbreak mirrors a trend seen nationally. She says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports over 4900 cases of mumps this year. Up to 47 states and the District of Colombia have all reported cases of mumps, according to Dr. Tiffany.

To put the outbreak in perspective, the DHSS says it saw less than 5 confirmed cases of mumps between 2012 and 2017. And all of those were travel related, meaning the infection was contracted outside Alaska and then brought into the state.

The DHSS can't be sure where this latest mumps outbreak started but nearby states have also reported significant mumps cases this year [2017]. Hawaii has reported more than 500 cases and Washington State has reported over 300 cases.

The current recommendation from the Department of Health and Social Services is to stay up-to-date with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination (MMR). "For Anchorage residents who self-identify as native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, we recommend a 2nd dose of MMR," Dr. Tiffany said. She says a 3rd dose is recommended for people who have had a 2nd dose within the past 5 years.
Dr. Tiffany explains the vast majority of reported cases have been seen in the Pacific Islander and native Hawaiian communities because the infection is spread through close contact.

The DHHS has some recommendations if a person suspects they may be infected with mumps:

- Go to a healthcare provider. Dr. Tiffany says due to the similarity of its symptoms, mumps can often appear as other illnesses .

- The MMR vaccine should be covered by health insurance or Medicaid.

- If you experience facial swelling or a cough, tell family and friends because mumps has a long incubation period.

- It's especially hard during the holidays but the state says it's essential to self-isolate for 5 days after symptoms start.

[See Mumps update (34): Canada, USA (AK,TX) 20171125.5464364 for discussion of why Pacific Islander and native Hawaiian communities are at greater risk.

Children should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine: 1st dose: 12-15 months of age; 2nd dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 28 days after the 1st dose)

Some infants younger than 12 months should get a dose of MMR if they are traveling out of the country. (This dose will not count toward their routine series.)

Some adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have either been vaccinated or had all 3 diseases.

MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.

Children between one and 12 years of age can get a "combination" vaccine called MMRV, which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines. (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmr.html)

Mumps infections have risen by over 6000 percent in Hawaii, the Department of Health said.

Statewide, Hawaii had a total of 636 cases as of [Thu 30 Nov 2017]. Previously, the state saw 10 or fewer cases per year.

Experts are having trouble explaining exactly what has caused the outbreak.

State epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park said some people were never vaccinated for mumps and other residents' immunity shots could be waning. The state has suggested that anyone born in 1957 or later receive another mumps shot to be safe.

Park said it could also be that people are getting sick, but not sick enough to stay home and recover. Park said it's a common practice that she sees every flu season.
"And we're seeing that with mumps," Park said. "And I think that above all is what's contributing."

Hawaii county had just 2 confirmed cases from 2007--16, but is up to 72 this year [2017]. Six were diagnosed in the past week [week of Sun 26 Nov 2017], according to the Department of Health.

A total of 2 Big Island schools -- West Hawaii Explorations Academy and Keonepoko Elementary School in Pahoa -- alerted families that their communities were affected, but neither said whether the sick person is a student or staff member, West Hawaii Today reported .

There are hopes that a mumps outbreak in Cumbria could be over, with only one new case in the last week [week of Sun 26 Nov 2017].

Throughout November [2017] there have been 8 cases across the county, leaving doctors on high alert.

Mumps has previously been recorded in Carlisle, South Lakeland and Allerdale, with other cases unconfirmed.

But latest figures show there was just one new confirmed case in the last week [week of Sun 26 Nov 2017]. This was in Allerdale.

It has prompted hopes that the outbreak may be over, though parents are still warned to remain on high alert.

Public health experts have urged them to ensure children are vaccinated to help prevent serious illness.

Mumps is a contagious virus resulting in painful swollen glands and a distinctive "hamster face" appearance.

It was common in children before the MMR vaccine was introduced but is now fairly rare.

Although mumps has been spreading across the North West, there were no cases in Cumbria until this month [December 2017].

But since [Wed 1 Nov 2017], they have been confirmed in north, south and west Cumbria by Public Health England.

Initially 3 cases of mumps were recorded - in Carlisle, South Lakes and Allerdale. A further 3 - 2 in Carlisle and one in Allerdale - were confirmed the following week.

Last week [week of Sun 26 Nov 2017].another 2 were confirmed in Carlisle and South Lakeland, with just one more in Allerdale in the last 7 days.

Northland DHB are appealing to Northland parents to ensure their family is up to date with Immunisations after confirmed cases of Mumps and Pertussis (Whooping Cough) in the region.

Northland DHB have been notified of 8 confirmed cases of mumps in school aged children from the Dargaville community. These confirmed now bring the number of notifications for the Northland Region to 24 this year [2017] - compared with 6 in 2016 and 3 in 2015.

With the school holiday period approaching and the current Mumps outbreak in Auckland, it is especially important for people under the age of 35, and for parents to check your family's vaccination status.

Mumps has recently gained attention internationally with members of the All Black squad contracting mumps, Medical Officer of Health Dr Virginia McLaughlin says this also highlights the importance of ensuring vaccines are up to date for young adults (up to 29 years of age).

"Vaccination is the best protection against mumps. If you or your children have not had the recommended 2 MMR (Measles Mumps and Rubella) vaccinations, it is strongly recommended that you get these up to date.

Contact your doctor or practice nurse if you are unsure whether you or your family has been vaccinated, and book in vaccination if they haven't."

Mumps can cause swelling in the glands around the face and can lead to meningitis in about one in 10 people. Mumps is spread through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva (ie kissing, sharing food and drink).

"If you think you have mumps, please exclude from school or work and phone ahead to your GP, so that you are not sitting in the waiting room.

Wash your hands and cover your mouth when you cough.

Dr McLaughlin also confirmed an increase in notified cases of pertussis in Northland, with 48 notifications this year [2017] compared to 9 in 2016 and 36 in 2015.

Whooping cough can be a very serious illness for babies and children, especially under one year of age.

'There have been 25 notified cases of pertussis in Ngunguru, with others throughout the region. A baby was admitted to hospital for treatment and has made a good recovery.

This gives us an opportunity to check immunisation status for both pertussis and mumps. By doing this as individuals we can protect those most at risk in our community. Don't delay; check your immunisation status today!

[Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It is caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_. Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. After cough fits, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breaths, which result in a "whooping" sound. Pertussis can affect people of all ages, but can be very serious, even deadly, for babies less than a year old.

The best way to prevent pertussis (whooping cough) is to get the vaccine. There are vaccines for babies, children, preteens, teens, and adults. DTaP is the childhood vaccine, and Tdap is the pertussis booster vaccine for preteens, teens, and adults.

A mumps outbreak in Tonga could have started in Auckland and the Government should take responsibility, 2 Opposition MPs say.

Shane Reti and Alfred Ngaro believe Tongan and other Pacific Island rugby league players at the recent World Cup could have been exposed to mumps while they were in Auckland.

They're upset because when Health Minister David Clark was asked about it, he said individual countries were responsible for their own immunisation regimes.

"There are currently 1600 recorded cases in Tonga," Mr Reti and Mr Ngaro said in a joint statement.

"Is the minister saying that the complications of this disease such as deafness, sterility and meningitis don't matter in Pacific Island people?"

The MPs thinks the Government should offer advice to Tonga and help with its vaccination programme.

"The minister is displaying an appalling lack of responsibility," they said.

Dr Clark told Newshub mumps outbreaks in the Pacific are not uncommon.

"The latest outbreak in Tonga began in March and peaked in June [2017] - before the Rugby League World Cup. The suggestion from the 2 National MPs that Tongan Rugby league players that contracted mumps in New Zealand have somehow caused the outbreak in Tonga does not make sense and is irresponsible at best."

He said the Ministry of Health isn't aware of any requests for assistance from Tonga, which would actually come through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

"Anyone who needs treatment while in New Zealand will receive it, but individual countries are responsible for their own vaccination programmes."

[Before sports teams travel to countries where mumps outbreaks are occurring, MMR vaccination status of each player should be checked. The coaches should advise unvaccinated players to immediately go to clinics that conduct immunizatons. Because measles and mumps are highly infectious, sports teams should take extra precautions to protect their players from disease even in country. They can become infected at home and when traveling, and can spread infection to other non-immunized individuals.
