French tourists die from Legionnaire's disease:
Two French tourists died and another is in critical condition with
Legionnaire's disease contracted during a visit to Turkey, the [French]
Health Ministry said on Sunday. A ministry spokesman said the tourists had
returned home from Istanbul earlier this month. Legionnaire's disease is a
form of pneumonia first identified in 1947 but named after a 1976 outbreak
of the disease that caused the death of about 29 American Legion members
attending a convention in Philadelphia.
CDPC Note: If this report is accurate, and there is no reason to doubt it,
there should be follow-up information that should be reported in
Eurosurveillance Weekly shortly.
