MSF responds to serious kala azar outbreak in southern Sudan
------------------------------------------------------------
"We suspect that the number of kala azar patients reaching clinics in some
areas is just the tip of the iceberg," said Dr David Kidinda, MSF medical
coordinator in southern Sudan. "With all the barriers facing people here --
the severe lack of infrastructure, few proper roads, crippling absence of
health care staff and structures and the current increase in violence and
insecurity in the region -- survival becomes a cruel obstacle course for
those in need of life-saving treatment."

Following a serious outbreak of severe parasitic disease, kala azar, in
southern Sudan, medical humanitarian aid agency, Medecins Sans Frontieres
(MSF; aka Doctors withour Borders), is responding to the emergency in
several locations across both Jonglei and Upper Nile States. MSF is
treating patients in its clinics in Pibor and Lankien and using mobile
teams in Rom to actively trace patients.

"Without treatment, those infected with kala azar become skeletal and can
die within weeks if their immune system is already weakened," said Dr
Kidinda. "Yet, in Southern Sudan, where almost 3 quarters of the population
have no access to even the most basic health care, it's a race against time
to reach patients."

Kala azar, or visceral leishmaniasis, is a neglected tropical disease,
endemic in some parts of southern Sudan, and which spreads quickly and
easily during an outbreak. The disease thrives in poor, remote, and
unstable areas, where there is extremely limited access to health care.

It is contracted by the bite of a sandfly carrying the kala azar
[leishmania] parasite, which multiplies inside the body, attacking the
immune system. Symptoms include an enlarged spleen, fever, weakness and
wasting. It demands quick diagnosis and treatment and if left untreated is
fatal in almost 100 per cent of cases within one to 4 months. However, if
patients access treatment on time there is a success rate of up to 95 per cent.

Jonglei State is the most affected area, with reports of 275 kala azar
patients in the Old Fangak clinic in the northwest being treated by a local
non-governmental organisation. In its remote health centre in Pibor, MSF
has admitted 24 kala azar patients, 2 of whom died having accessed health
care too late. MSF has also admitted an additional 46 kala azar patients to
its clinic in Lankien. Further north, in neighbouring Upper Nile State,
following reports that 66 kala azar patients were undergoing treatment in
Malakal hospital, MSF deployed an outbreak response team to screen people
across Rom, where 37 patients are now undergoing treatment.

The patients in Pibor clinic were infected in the cattle camps in the north
of Jonglei State, before moving back to their villages around Lekwongole,
in the north west of Pibor County. Patients make their way to MSF's
outreach health post in Lekwongole, as MSF teams are currently unable to
access these villages due to insecurity and road inaccessibility. MSF then
transports the patients to Pibor by boat, as roads have become rivers.

MSF is not only providing direct treatment for the disease, which involves
one injection per day for 30 days, but is also giving supportive treatment
for dehydration, anaemia, and other diseases affecting some kala azar
patients, such as malaria. In addition, MSF is providing food to patients
and distributing mosquito nets and soap, and is starting health promotion
activities in Jonglei State to raise awareness of the disease and encourage
more people to seek treatment.

[Southern Sudan is endemic for both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis as
well as HIV and Leishmaniasis co-infection
(<http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/leishmaniasis_maps/en/index1.html>). WHO
estimates that about 2 per cent of the adult population is infected with
HIV in Sudan
<http://apps.who.int/globalatlas/predefinedReports/EFS2008/short/EFSCountryProfiles2008_SD.pdf>).
The report of the 5th consultation meeting on HIV and Leishmania, Addis
Ababa, March 2007, can be found here:
<http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/Leishmaniasis_hiv_coinfection5.pdf>.
WHO background information on leishmaniasis is available at
<http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/en/>.

The last major outbreak of leishmaniasis in the Sudan was from 1984 to
1994, when WHO estimated that 100 000 people died out of a population of
300 000 in the Western Upper Nile State
<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/surveillance/en/Leishmaniasis.pdf>.
The present outbreak is most probably due to famine combined with an
unstable security situation, where poor infrastructure further makes
control measures difficult.
