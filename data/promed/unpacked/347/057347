Regarding information that has been flowing through this
media on a "supposed" outbreack of meningococcal disease in
the Dominican Republic, I would like to share with you a
translation (brief version) of the public international
report that Pan American Health Organization/World Health
Organization (PAHO/WHO) office in Dominican Republic (DR)
has delivered on May 7, 1997:
1.- There is not an outbreak of meningococcal disease in
any part of DR. The surveillance system for bacterial
meningitis and for meningococcal disease is outstanding since
1995. The number of probable cases in 1995 was 118
countrywide, and 101 in 1996 (1.8/100,000 pop.). In 1997,
until epidemiological week #18 (April 3) 37 probable cases
have been identified. A total of 43 and 32 probable cases
were identified in the same periods in 1995 and 1996. These
figures include both clinical forms (meningitis and
meningococcemia). All of these have been "isolated cases",
with no relationship among them. All cases have been
investigated, as usual, and every intimate contact has
received chemoprophylaxis (Rifampin) less than 48 hours
after notification. The predominant serogroup has been C,
with some cases of B and A.
2.- There have been and there are no reasons for any
interruption in schools, labor or tourist activities. Any
other additional preventive measure (than active surveillance
and chemoprophylaxis of intimate contacts) is absolutely
unjustified and has not been adopted or recommended.
3.- National surveillance system relies on passive notification
of suspected cases from more than 600 health services
countrywide (public and private) on a weekly basis. It
is a routine procedure to declare an alert when they want
to switch from passive to active surveillance in any
place or period. On April 29 national surveillance system
emitted an alert for health services because some cases were
reported from some areas which did not report any in two
previous years. So, they considered it very important to assure
that surveillance, chemoprophylaxis of intimate contacts,
medical care and lab. support are ready to give an adequate
response.
Another reason for the epidemiological alert was an unexpected
proportion of cases over 10 years old and an unexpected
fatality rate (50%). Usually more than 60% of cases were
under 10 years old and pediatricians have been more trained in
dealing with them. Usually the fatality rate countrywide has been
around 20%, and 10 - 15 % in specialized services. The alert
has made it possible to improve the care of suspected cases
in other services than pediatrics.
4.- Although the expected number of probable cases for the
whole year 1997 is around 100 to 120 countrywide, more than
70 more in the next months, the last reported case was on
May 1 countrywide, and April 27 in areas where the alert was
established.

From: Joe Shea (by way of Jack Woodall
)
I found this new information on a Caribbean-related health site,
apparently posted Wednesday [7 May 1997]:
Following recent statements in the press which reported an
outbreak of meningococcal meningitis in 3 cities near Santo
Domingo, CDC investigations have concluded that there has not
been an increase in the number of cases recorded. CDC is not
recommending that travel to the Dominican Republic be avoided,
nor that meningococcal vaccination be administered to travelers
to the country.
