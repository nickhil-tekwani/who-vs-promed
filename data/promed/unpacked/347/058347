Outbreaks of animal rabies extend over Ukraine
----------------------------------------------
Veterinarians say that an alarming situation is developing with
regard to outbreaks of rabies among animals in the Crimea and in the
Ukraine in general. The situation is particularly bad in the Feodosia
Region because many settlements are located on the edge of tracts of woodland.

Veterinarians still do not know how best to cope with stray animals.
Albina Levchenko, the acting head of veterinary services of Feodosia,
reported during the meeting of the regional government that outbreaks
of animal rabies are not limited to the Crimea and occur throughout
the Ukraine. She stated that rabies cases are common in dogs, cats
and other domestic animals, which are an enhanced risk for humans.
The fact that many settlements are on the edge of forests increases
the risk of domestic animals contracting rabies from wild animals
which are the natural reservoirs of this infection.

A total of 96 people have experienced animal bites and 3 dead cats
had been delivered to the Crimean Regional Veterinary Laboratory for
testing this year. 618 dogs and 208 cats had been immunized and 3
observation cells have been allocated for housing suspected rabid
animals that had bitten humans. Local hunters' and fishers'
organizations shot 83 dogs, 6 cats, 26 foxes and 5 raccoon dogs found
outside residential areas. The deputy mayor of Feodosia sought the
advice of the veterinarians regarding how other cities and states
dealt with the problem of stray animals, since local residents were
complaining vociferously about this issue. The veterinarians answered
that if there was an animal shelter the veterinarians could then
immunize, sterilize and treat stray animals, but this does not seem
to be a feasible option at the present time.
