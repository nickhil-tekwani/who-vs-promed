Through an abundance of caution, Rose Acre Farms of Seymour, Indiana is voluntarily recalling 206 749 248 eggs because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.

Healthy individuals infected with Salmonella Braenderup can experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella Braenderup can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.

The eggs were distributed from the farm in Hyde County, North Carolina and reached consumers in the following states: Colorado, Florida, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia through retail stores and restaurants via direct delivery.

22 illnesses have been reported to date.

The affected eggs, from plant number P-1065 with the Julian date range of 011 through date of 102 printed on either the side portion or the principal side of the carton or package, are as follows: [see URL for table of affected eggs. - CopyEd.MSP].

The voluntary recall was a result of some illnesses reported on the USA East Coast, which led to extensive interviews and eventually a thorough FDA inspection of the Hyde County farm, which produces 2.3 million eggs a day. The facility includes 3 million laying hens with a USDA inspector on-site daily.

Consumers who have purchased shell eggs are urged to immediately discontinue use of the recalled eggs and to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.

[_Salmonella enterica_, especially serotype Enteritidis, has the unique ability to contaminate eggs without causing discernible illness in the birds infected. The infection route to humans involves colonization, survival, and multiplication of the pathogen in the hen house environment, the bird, and, finally, the egg. The review cited below highlights the stages of transmission and discusses evidence that altered bacterial growth patterns and specific cell surface characteristics contribute to the adaptation of _S._ enteritidis to these diverse environments.
