Latest on Israeli and Oman isolates
-----------------------------------
Information on VP-2 sequencing of the BTV-8 strain recently identified in
Israel and the BTV-8 and BTV-1 strains recently identified in Oman:

The Israeli strain of BTV-8 showed a 99.7 per cent similarity in its VP-2
sequence with the strain of BTV-8 isolated from the Netherlands in 2006. It
is therefore likely that the Israeli BTV-8 strain is derived from the
recent European outbreak of BTV-8. Another possibility (but less likely)
[see comment] is that the Israeli BTV-8 could be the source of the BTV-8
outbreak in Europe.

The Oman BTV-8 strain showed a 95.2 per cent similarity in its VP-2
sequence to the strain of BTV-8 isolated from the Netherlands in 2006
indicating that it is a western strain from a similar lineage to the
European BTV-8, but it is not derived from the European BTV-8 strain.

The Oman BTV-1 strain is distinct from all other BTV-1 strains in the
reference collection at IAH, Pirbright and, although it is a western
strain, it is not derived from the BTV-1 strain that is currently
circulating in Europe.

Therefore the Oman introductions of BTV-1 and 8 are likely to be from
Africa (not Europe), to which Oman is geographically close. Israel could
either be a source of the BTV-8 in Europe (perhaps unlikely) or more likely
have a BTV-8 infection derived from Europe (probably due to the movement of
BTV-8 infected animals into the region) [see comment].

[ProMED-mail recently indicated (see 20090620.2268) that genotyping of the
BTV-8 (Israel and Oman) and BTV-1 (Oman) isolates may allow tracing back
their respective origins. We are therefore most grateful for the current
eye-opening information from the OIE reference laboratory at Pirbright.

As indicated by Dr Oura, Oman's introductions of BTV-1 and BTV-8 viruses
are likely to be from Africa (not Europe). This is also in line with the
following data, pertaining to the quantities of live ruminants imported to
Oman, as well as to their respective origins. According to FAO
international trade statistics (FAOSTAT), Oman imports annually between
350-500 000 live sheep and almost twice as many live goats. Cattle imports
are rather negligible. The main countries of origin for sheep (most recent
available data are from 2004-5) were Australia and Somalia, and for goats
Somalia and Iran. There is also rather minor import from Djibouti and
United Arab Emirates (the latter might be on transit from a 3rd party).
Clearly, no animals from Europe seem to be imported to Oman.

As for Israel, the picture is strikingly different. During 2007 (the last
year of available information), about 58 000 cattle were imported, of which
about 23 500 were from Australia, 21 500 from Lithuania, and 13 000 from
Hungary. In addition, 10 000 sheep were imported, all from (Western)
Australia. The same 3 countries were also the exporters of cattle to Israel
during the previous 4 years. Since BTV-8 is definitely new in Israel (see
further), and in view of its similarity to the north European strain,
clearly the most likely route of introduction is through the massive
imports of live cattle from Europe to the region.

In fact, Lebanon has become Europe's main external customer. The total
annual quantities of live cattle imported into Lebanon, mainly for
slaughter, are between 200 and 250 000, and of live sheep slightly higher.
According to the latest FAOSTAT detailed data available from Lebanon
(2004), out of the total of 239 191 head imported during 2004 from 20
countries, 3 EU countries, namely Germany, France and Spain combined,
supplied 172 658 head (72 per cent) of the Lebanese demand. FAOSTAT
information on the total Lebanese cattle imports for the years 2005 and
2006 were 248 291 and 206 744 head respectively, but no data on their
countries of origin were given. Later detailed information on the countries
from which Lebanon imports cattle are not available and will be welcomed
from informed sources.

According to FAOSTAT, the countries from which cattle were imported during
2004, and their respective numbers, were: Belgium (549), Brazil (12 033),
Bulgaria (21), Cyprus (2490), Czech republic (1195), France (36 871),
Germany (120 217), Hungary (4748), Ireland (8229), Italy (31), Luxembourg
(400), Netherlands (701), Poland (313), Moldova (1303), Romania (1242),
Russia (504), Slovakia (49), Spain (15 580), Sudan (521) and Ukraine (1225).

According to information from unofficial sources, such as a 2005 report for
the animal welfare association Compassion in World Farming, "the EU exports
around 250 000 live cattle to 3rd countries each year. Over 80 per cent of
these are slaughtered shortly after reaching their destination. The
majority of live cattle exported from the EU for slaughter go to Lebanon"
(see at
<http://www.ciwf.org.uk/resources/publications/live_transport_live_export/default.aspx>).
From a reliable source, we noted that "it is known that approximately 20
per cent of these cattle are not slaughtered directly." We also noted that
in-calf cows are not excluded from such consignments (2009 data). It will
be interesting to note which measures are required and subsequently applied
in Europe to preclude the inclusion of potentially BTV-infected animals in
exports to other parts of the world.

Israel has been maintaining an intensive bluetongue monitoring system for
decades. The disease was initially declared as officially notifiable by the
British Mandate government for Palestine in 1945, 3 years before the
establishment of the State of Israel. This status was maintained and
continued since, with BT diagnosis and research consistently performed by
the Kimron Veterinary Institute (where, in 1968, the BTV isolation
technique by inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs was developed by Leah
Goldsmit and Erga Barzilai, becoming the most practical virus isolation
method to the present day).

Bluetongue is regarded endemic in Israel since its initial
laboratory-confirmed identification in 1951, with clinical disease seen
almost every year. It is strictly seasonal and affects almost exclusively
sheep (of susceptible breeds). All clinically suspected cases are
obligatorily laboratory-confirmed. Seven serotypes have been identified in
Israel throughout the years, namely BTV-4 (1951), BTV-16 (1968), BTV-6
(1972), BTV-2 (1973), BTV-10 (1973), BTV-15 (2006) and BTV-24 (2008). BTV-4
has been, throughout the years, the most prevalent serotype.

BTV-8 has become now Israel's 8th BTV serotype. The virus was initially
isolated from the spleen of a 3-year-old dairy cow, euthanized in extremis
in Rosh Haniqra's dairy operation on the Lebanese border. The serotyping
was eventually carried out at Pirbright. The outbreak started on 19 Nov
2008 and was terminated on 12 Dec 2008; out of 250 cattle, 80 clinical
cases were seen, of which 12 died (case fatality rate of 15 per cent).
There is no doubt about the novelty of BTV-8 to the country. Previously,
such symptoms in cattle were caused only by EHD virus, seen for the 1st
(and, so far, only) time in Israel during the late summer and fall months
of 2006. The 2009 BTV season is about to commence, and it will be important
to note whether BTV-8 has overwintered.

While the source of the European BTV-8 epizootic, which started in July
2006 (or earlier?!), is still enigmatic, the hypothesis that it has been
introduced into Israel by live, unvaccinated cattle exported to Lebanon
from infected European countries, has now been supported by the isolate's
genotyping. - Mod.AS]
