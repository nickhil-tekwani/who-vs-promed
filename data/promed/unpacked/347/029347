San Antonio veterinary hospital, kennel battle canine influenza
outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
"This just spread like wildfire," says veterinarian Michele Wright of
Huebner Oaks Veterinary Hospital.

In fact, Wright was referring to a recent outbreak of canine
influenza, a highly contagious respiratory disease of dogs that swept
through a local clinic and ultimately spread to a large dog kennel.

In total, Wright tells DVM Newsmagazine that they confirmed about 30
cases of H3N8 canine influenza and 60 others were suspected.

"This is the 1st time we have ever seen it," Wright says. "We check a
lot, since it became a disease in the United States. We constantly
take PCR samples (at this kennel facility). And we get a lot of dogs
in from various places -- overseas and United States. If they come in
and are coughing, a PCR is performed, and they are put in isolation.
It just happens that with this kind of flu, they are shedding it
before showing symptoms, and that is what got us in a bind," she
explains.

Canine influenza has been around for 40 years, but in 2004, a
scientific investigation confirmed a mysterious respiratory illness
affecting Greyhounds was actually caused by equine influenza A H3N8.
The virus has since been recognized as a new "dog-specific lineage of
H3N8," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since its introduction into the canine population in 2004, the H3N8
virus has since been identified in 38 states, including Texas.

"I think the important thing is that when it gets in your facility, it
is so contagious you have to practically shut down to clean so that
you don't infect other dogs," Wright explains.

Out of all the cases of known and suspected canine influenza from this
outbreak, only 3 of the dogs became very ill. One of sickest dogs was
a clinic dog that had recently undergone a blood transfusion and
therefore more susceptible to disease. All of the animals recovered,
Wright says.

In this case, she says, the hospital was not aggressive in vaccinating
against the influenza strain, simply because they had not documented
any cases prior to this outbreak.

Prevention was far easier than the cure, Wright adds.

While veterinarians successfully treated animals infected with the
virus, it was an enormous undertaking of time and manpower to
disinfect every corner of the hospital and kennel, Wright says.

"You want to make your staff hate you? Let me tell you, we had to suit
up in plastic gear, and it was 106 [deg F/41 deg C] outside. We had to
wear disposable gowns, gloves, hairnets, and booties, and they were
not happy. I got some pretty nasty looks, but that is okay, I gowned
up too. We sweated together," she says.

So, what's her message to other veterinarians? "When it takes your
clinic down, it becomes a big deal. When you have to call owners of
dogs that just came in for an ear flush because it was aerosolized or
was on your clothes. It's a big deal," Wright says.

[If canine influenza was around for 40 years, then a retrospective
study of canine diseases should pick up a common thread of clinical
signs in dogs. I have not seen such a report, nor am I aware of one.
Granted, technology may have made it possible to narrow down a cause
to a syndrome that had been previously seen.

On the other hand, we know that equine influenza has been around for
decades. But adapted to canines for 40 years? I am skeptical of this.
However, it is here now, and we must be prepared to deal with it.
