The Hungarian food safety authority NÉBIH warned yesterday [Tue 25 Jul 2017] of an occurrence of African Swine Fever (ASF), a disease with a near 100 percent fatality rate in pigs, just 20 km [approx. 12.4 mi] from the border.

The outbreak was registered in Berehuifalu, Ukraine, NÉBIH said. A number of cases of ASF have also been registered in Poland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania in recent months, the authority added, although no cases have been discovered in Hungary, thus far.

NÉBIH urged compliance with all rules and advice on preventing the spread of the virus. Lists of prevention measures can be found on the authority website.
