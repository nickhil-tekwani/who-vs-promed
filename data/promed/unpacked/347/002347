Public Health Wales and Public Health England have confirmed they are monitoring 3 cases of imported monkeypox identified in North Wales.

The 1st case was acquired overseas, and all 3 cases are members of the same household. All cases were admitted to a hospital in England, where 2 currently remain. The index case has made a full recovery, does not present an infection risk, and has been discharged, it is confirmed.

Monitoring and follow-up of the cases and their close contacts was undertaken as part of normal practice, and the risk to the general public is very low.

Richard Firth, Consultant in Health Protection at Public Health Wales, said: "Confirmed cases of monkeypox are a rare event in the UK, and the risk to the general public is very low.

"We have worked with multi-agency colleagues, following tried and tested protocols and procedures, and identified all close contacts. Actions have been put in place to minimise the likelihood of further infection.

"Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by the monkeypox virus and has been reported mainly in central and West African countries.

"Monkeypox, in most cases, is a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person's health. Most people recover within a few weeks."

[All 3 cases have occurred within a single family, indicating that close physical contact facilitated transmission. The previous report indicated that the index case had been in Delta state, Nigeria, prior to his return to Wales, UK. Monkeypox (MPX) cases have been reported in Nigeria since 2017, and transmission of the virus continues there. The above case presumably acquired the monkeypox virus infection in that country.

As noted in the previous ProMED-mail post (cited below), an 11 Jun 2021 report of monkeypox cases in Nigeria provides more detail, stating, "Since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report sporadic cases of monkeypox. From September 2017 to May 2021, a total of 446 suspected monkeypox cases have been reported from 30 states. Of the reported cases, 199 (44.6%) have been confirmed in 18 states: Abia (3), Akwa Ibom (7), Anambra (2), Bayelsa (39), Benue (2), Cross River (13), Delta (22), Ebonyi (1), Edo (7), Ekiti (2), Enugu (4), FCT (5), Imo (8), Lagos (25), Nasarawa (2), Oyo (6), Plateau (3) and Rivers (48). A total of 8 deaths have also been recorded (CFR= 4.02%) in 6 states: Cross River (1), Edo (2), FCT (1), Imo (1), Lagos (2) and Rivers (1). In 2021, a total of 32 suspected cases have been reported from January and May. Of the suspected cases, 7 were confirmed from 5 states Delta (2), Bayelsa (2), Lagos (1), Edo (1), Rivers (1), and no deaths were recorded (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/monkeypox-in-nigeria-and-drc-updates-84788/).

Interestingly, there have been 2 previously imported monkeypox case from Nigeria. In December 2019, a patient believed to have contracted the infection while visiting Nigeria was staying in southwest England prior to transfer to the specialist high-consequence infectious disease centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, where treatment was given (see Monkeypox - UK: ex Nigeria 20191206.6827532). On 17 Sep 2018, there were 2 people who contracted the disease in Nigeria before traveling to England. One was a Nigerian resident in Cornwall, followed by the case at the Blackpool Victoria hospital. A healthcare worker who cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made contracted the infection (see Monkeypox - UK (04): ex Nigeria, more details 20180926.60539892019).

The question remains about the source of these recent infections and the index case above. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. Even if a vaccine was available for use in Africa, deciding where to mount a campaign in this broad geographic area where the virus occurs would be a challenge. - Mod.TY
