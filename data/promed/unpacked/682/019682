The current outbreak of equine flu remains an ongoing concern with 5 new cases having been confirmed by the Animal Health Trust (AHT) during the first 7 days of March [2019]. The AHT has reported confirmed cases of the virus in Suffolk, Staffordshire and 3 cases at separate premises in Sussex, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated horses.

Yesterday [7 Mar 2019] a case was confirmed in Sussex in an unvaccinated non-thoroughbred that had been imported from Ireland. An AHT spokesperson said approximately 30 other vaccinated horses are on the premises, but have "not shown any clinical signs" at this stage.

On 5 Mar [2019], 2 cases at separate 2 premises in Sussex were confirmed. The 1st case is in a vaccinated non-thoroughbred who presented with nasal discharge. "There are 18 other horses that are vaccinated at the premises but have not shown any clinical signs at this stage," said the AHT spokesperson.

In the 2nd case, a positive diagnosis was made on an unvaccinated non-thoroughbred that had contact with another horse reported to have been recently imported from Ireland. "The case presented with harsh dry coughing, nasal discharge, pyrexia and in-appetence and there is one directly in-contact animal, which had recently been imported showing signs of a nasal discharge. There are 18 other horses that are vaccinated but which are not showing clinical signs at this stage," said the spokesperson.

On 4 Mar [2019] cases were confirmed in Suffolk and Staffordshire. The positive diagnosis in Suffolk was confirmed in an unvaccinated non-thoroughbred, recently imported from Ireland. "There are 14 in-contacts with varying vaccination status and 4 of these have had mild signs of coughing," said the spokesperson.

In Staffordshire a positive diagnosis was confirmed in an unvaccinated non-thoroughbred. The AHT spokesperson said no further cases had been reported at the Staffordshire premises of 5 horses, 3 of which are "fully and recently" vaccinated.

This brings the total number of cases reported to the AHT during 2019 to 45.

Meanwhile, officials at Malvern's popular Three Counties showground have said equines must be vaccinated against flu within the past 6 months plus 21 days, but not within 7 days before attending the showground. Equines who have received only the primary course of vaccinations can attend, as long as they have had the first 2 injections that make up the primary course, the 2nd of which must have been given 6 months plus 21 days but not within 7 days before the show.

This means equines attending the CountryTastic show on 18 Apr 2019 must have received their last vaccination between 28 Sep 2018 and 11 Apr 2019 inclusive, and equines attending the Royal Three Counties Show on 14-16 Jun 2019 must have received their last vaccination between 24 Nov 2018 and 7 Jun 2019 inclusive.

Head of shows, Diana Walton, said: "Equine flu is a serious concern to anyone involved in the industry and, as a responsible organisation, we have to play our part.

"After taking guidance from our team of highly experienced equine experts we have decided that we have no alternative options but to enforce the FEI guidelines. This means that any horse, pony, donkey or mule attending an event at the showground must have been vaccinated as per the FEI requirements."

All horses arriving at affiliated events from 1 Mar 2019 must have had a flu booster vaccination within 6 months. Equines that have not been vaccinated correctly will not be allowed to attend the showground.

"Equine entries will have their passports checked and any animals found not to be complying with the FEI vaccination rules will not be allowed to enter the showground," said Diana. "We know how passionate the equine community is about the welfare of its animals and we're counting on people's support on this matter."

[Equine influenza (EI), an OIE-listed disease, is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi2) of influenza A virus within the genus _Influenza virus_ A of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s.

Although EI has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus.

The virus behind the UK event has been identified as the virulent EI virus strain H3N8 Florida clade 1, a strain apparently new to the UK. This strain had reportedly shut down racing in Australia for 3 months in 2007, affecting more than 10 000 horses. It is a strain endemic to North and South America. This virus has recently been identified in clinical cases in France as well. - Mod.AS
