For the 1st time since 1974, a reported case of bovine tuberculosis
has been found in Colorado. Inspectors say a bull was sold from a
Colorado owner in Douglas County to a meat packing facility in San
Angelo, Texas.
Colorado's assistant state veterinarian, Keith Roehr, says evidence
of the disease was discovered in the bull's lungs during routine
inspection of the carcass. Roehr says the bull's meat was never moved
beyond the facility.
"The food supply is safe, the regular measures we have in place for
meat inspection prevent any meat coming into the food chain that's
infected," said Roehr.
The state has quarantined approximately 660 cattle from what Roehr
calls "the herd of origin." Roehr says any cow that had prolonged
exposure to the bull, nose to nose specifically, may be infected.
"The rest of the herd will be individually tested, if there were any
animals that were found to be positive, they would be eliminated too
and we would do further testing of that herd," Roehr said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, bovine tuberculosis can
be passed on through the air and can attack any part of the body. The
lungs are the usual targets.
If untreated, the disease can be deadly.
Testing of the cattle in Douglas County is underway. The state will
not release the location of the ranch. Some of the 1st test results
are expected to be in by Thursday [8 Feb 2007].

[Any time a meat inspector sees something suspicious the carcass is
usually condemned. A condemned carcass cannot enter the food chain.
If the herd of origin is already quarantined, then testing has proven
this to be tuberculosis (_Mycobacterium bovis_). Tuberculosis can
spread between cattle in close contact. Certainly, in Colorado at
this time of the year, when hay is being fed because of cold
temperatures, cattle are more likely to have close contact. However,
tuberculosis is a slowly growing disease, may not manifest itself
with clinical signs for some time. Consequently the disease is found
at slaughter, or through testing.
Since the herd is quarantined, the officials will start to trace
animals that have moved into the herd (trace-ins) and animals that
have moved out of the herd (trace-outs). This could mean that other
herds will be quarantined and tested. It could also mean that if more
herds are found, Colorado could lose its free state status.
TB can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals. No
other TB organism has as great a host range as bovine TB, which can
infect all warm-blooded vertebrates. The causative agent of TB in
animals is _Mycobacterium bovis_. It can be transmitted by close
contact such as nose-to-nose contact or through nasal/oral
secretions. - Mod.TG]
