Re: Dr. Sauri's comments in the ProMED posting of 22 Jun 2002 [see
ref. below].
In the hope of identifying areas of clear agreement and highlighting
important areas of disagreement where new policy may be necessary:
First, and most important, I stated many times at the NAS presentation
that the numbers in the Aralsk outbreak were small, and that even
though they are statistically worrisome for unusual behavior of the
virus, they account for only a small percentage of the variance we see
in Aralsk versus any of the other smallpox outbreaks as regards the
incidence of hemorrhagic disease or the ease of spread within
households.
What IS significant about the Aralsk outbreak is that this is the first
demonstration of aerosol dissemination of smallpox over distances
greater than tens of meters. Indeed, the apparent "travel distance" of
smallpox exceeded by 3 orders of magnitude or more any other
documented airborne propagation of the virus.
Second, the clinical studies of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s (let alone those
of hundreds of years ago) are devoid of any inferential statistical
analysis (Fenner's book, for example, has not a single "p" value that I
can find, and ditto for the work of Rao and many other orthopox
researchers), and as noted by several of the speakers at the NAS
meeting, the old data is often difficult to subject to such analysis due to
problems with stratification (which is to say, mixing of disparate data
from multiple locations). This is precisely why I focused on Rao's
work (it is as homogenous a dataset as we have), and therein lies the
basis of my statistical calculations. Weak as they are, they are the best
we have, and suggest -- but certain do not prove -- that something was
odd about the virus in Aralsk.
In addition, given the commentary of Pyotr Burgasov about a "special
strain" being tested on Vozrozhdeniye Island (Dr. Henderson tells me
he is a generally credible person despite his [statements] about the
Sverdlovsk anthrax accident), I believe it is legitimate to at least ask
the question: are we dealing with something different than the strains
that caused the documented outbreaks around the world? The stakes,
after all, are very high.
Third, it is quite incorrect to state that the Aralsk data does not change
the thinking on strategies for countering a terrorist attack utilizing
aerosolized smallpox. As every modeler noted at the NAS meeting,
assumptions about the number of index cases dramatically affect the
appropriate strategy -- especially if a better vaccine becomes available.
Even if the virus is merely garden variety, the consequences of an
aerosol release infecting thousands, and perhaps more, changes
everything.
Fourth, and most important, in no way did I recommend that current
policy for acquisition of the 300 million doses of NYBH vaccine be
changed. Further, after the ACIP announced its recommendation, I
supported it fully on NPR's "Science Friday" program. It is the best
hedge we have at the moment; which is another way of saying the
vaccine is highly problematic and is best kept out of circulation in our
[immunologically] heterogeneous population.
Fifth, regarding the infants in Aralsk who acquired hemorrhagic
disease. In other outbreaks, this is decidedly rare (about 0.03 percent);
if we really believe that host factors are more-or-less solely responsible
for the clinical outcome of smallpox, should not infants have a high
prevalence of hemorrhagic disease? I don't know the way out of this
conundrum, but I believe that it is reasonable to conclude that variola
biology and pathogenesis are much more complicated than our current
state of knowledge suggests.
In the end, here is where we disagree: on the one hand, [a position
that] is comfortable trusting 200-year-old vaccine technology that has
limited effectiveness (measured in years, at best), results in side effects
in a substantial portion of the population, requires immobilization of
large segments of society in the event of an outbreak with all of the
attendant economic consequences, and which may or may not work if
individuals inhale (literally) large numbers of virions. I believe, on the
other hand, that we can and ought to do better.
Jahrling, Huggins and Daemon have identified several candidate anti-
viral drugs and a promising animal model is being refined. There is
every reason to proceed with this pioneering work. And, since
vaccinology has only recently emerged as a science from the mysticism
that characterized it until only a decade or so ago, I am confident we
can design (and test) a vaccine that is far less reactogenic, much longer
lasting, and perhaps even protective after large-scale mucosal exposure.
I am grateful to ProMED-mail for providing a forum to debate the
difficult questions surrounding smallpox. This open discussion should
have begun a long time ago.

[I think the 2 sides of the argument have been fairly stated in this and
previous posts. Policy decisions turn on whether we believe that the
putative index case of the Aralsk outbreak really did become infected
while on a boat several kilometers from land. There was an outbreak in
Afghanistan that by October 1970 had spread to Mashad, in Iran, close
to the (then) USSR border -- see Fig.23.5 on p.1089 in Fenner et al.
1988, Smallpox and its Eradication, now online on the WHO website
<http://www.who.int/emc/diseases/smallpox/Smallpoxeradication.html>
. That epidemic spread west all the way to Yugoslavia, so why not
north also? Mashad has a direct road link to Aralsk. The USSR, having
declared eradication in 1936, was unlikely to have publicly
acknowledged any spread to its territory (it did not notify this outbreak
to WHO). The statistics of neither the Aralsk outbreak nor Rao's series
appear to hold up, leaving the question of the virulence of the Aralsk
strain in doubt. And while I am sure that science is capable of
developing smallpox-specific antivirals and a better vaccine, logic
suggests that bioterrorists are not going to wait around for that to
happen -- or even for countries (Canada & the UK besides USA, at last
count) to make up their minds when and whom to immunize with the
existing vaccine.
