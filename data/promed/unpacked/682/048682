A number of cases of _E. coli_ O157 in Orkney are being investigated by health experts. 2 cases are being treated in hospital, with another 3 under investigation. The cases have occurred in 2 areas and NHS Orkney yesterday, 20 Aug 2012, said there was no indication that there was a link between them.

The director of public health, Dr Louise Wilson, said: "The cases have occurred in 2 different areas of Orkney and there is no current indication that there is a link between the cases in these 2 areas. When we start an investigation it is not uncommon to find other people with symptoms or who are positive on testing.

"We are working closely with the environmental health team from Orkney Islands Council to try and identify a source for the infections and the investigation is ongoing. _E. coli_ O157 infections are often associated with environmental exposure, but can also be food-related.

"One of the simplest things that can be done to prevent infection with _E. coli_ O157 is to wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet or changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food. It is also important to wash your hands after contact with animals or their environment."

A statement from the board added: "NHS Orkney and Orkney Islands Council are currently investigating a small cluster of apparently unlinked cases of _E. coli_ O157 infection.

"Currently there are 5 cases being investigated, of which there are 2 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ O157 -- these 2 cases are receiving treatment in hospital."

ProMED awaits additional information regarding the cases and whether DNA analysis shows if the cases are related or not. - Mod.LL
