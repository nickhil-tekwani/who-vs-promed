The following was added into the article: [This is actually a vectorborne disease, as it is transmitted from fleas not from the animal itself. The fleas may get off the animal onto another animal or a human being. But the affected animals do not transmit the disease. The infected animal is only the vehicle for the fleas. - Mod.TG]

It should be noted that cats (feline in general) can transmit the bacterium via the respiratory route, rather effectively. Several cases have been described of primary pneumonic plague in humans after exposure to a _Y.pestis_ infected cat (see references below).

Someone else might be able to quantify the transmission efficiency, but it is important to note that plague infected cats are a risk factor for human exposure even without fleas present.

To clarify moderator TG's comments that a cat infected with plague cannot infect another animal or person may not always be true. If the cat is shedding plague via a draining abscess or has the pneumonic form, then the cat itself becomes the vector, and quite capable of transmitting the bacterium without a flea intermediary. Thanks for your postings!

[Dear Readers,
Years ago when I started with ProMED-mail, a dear friend said be ready on some occasions to eat some 'crow', the only question was did I prefer it baked or fried. To which I said, please pass the catsup.

Well, it seems I need to ask to you, to please pass the catsup. These kind of readers have served me with both baked and fried versions of my momentary lapse. Both of these readers, as well as numerous others that wrote me privately are quite correct. My humble apologies to you all.

My comment was meant to only refer to the fleas themselves. Perhaps I should have said: The fleas may get off the animal onto another animal or a human being. Thus the affected animal may transport the fleas to other hosts. - Mod.TG
