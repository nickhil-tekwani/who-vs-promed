Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) has been identified in Wisconsin. The virus is especially fatal to young pigs, with a death rate of nearly 100 percent.

According to the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV), samples from Wisconsin were submitted and tested positive for PEDv earlier this month [August 2013]. Testing data from the National Animal Health Laboratory Network says that as of 4 Aug 2013, PEDv has been confirmed on 461 farms in 17 states. PEDv is characterized by severe diarrhea and vomiting, with high morbidity, often 100 percent, and variable mortality, up to 100 percent among young pigs.

"This is a very serious disease," says Warren Wilson, technical service veterinarian for Merck Animal Health, and member of the American Association of Swine Veterinarians. "If you are raising sows [and] get this disease, you will lose up to 100 percent of your baby pigs for 4 to 6 weeks."

PEDv poses both a major threat and challenge to the hog industry. According to Wilson, there is no vaccine for this disease, as it had never been recorded previously in the US. A similar strain, however, was found in China in 2012, but there is no proof that this is the origin of this strain.

Easily transmissible, PEDv can spread quickly from one farm to the next through trucks that transport pigs. As stated by the Wisconsin Pork Association, incidences of the virus appeared in multiple, widely distributed sow herds within days, implying a common point-source origin used with some frequency across the industry.

Complicating matters further, PEDv is not considered a reportable disease, which means that producers are not legally obligated to contact state or federal officials with positive test results; however, Wilson emphasizes that reporting the highly contagious virus is the right thing to do.

"We want to do everything we can to keep it out of Wisconsin," he says. "If someone has the disease on their farm, they need to be working extremely closely with their veterinarian. We want to do everything we can to make sure Wisconsin stays free from the disease."

Bump up biosecurity
-------------------
Hog producers and swine exhibitors are encouraged to do their part to step up biosecurity measures in effort to prevent PEDv. The AASV offers the following recommendations.

First and foremost, review and tighten their biosecurity protocols. Pay particular attention to anything or anyone sourced internationally. Be especially diligent about personnel and visitors but also consider supplies, feed ingredients, food items, etc., that might be of international origin. If you are unsure about the origin of a particular product, or the components of a product, contact the supplier and request information on the origin of their ingredients or components.

Additional biosecurity recommendations should include: limiting traffic, people, and equipment onto the farm; thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting anything coming onto the farm; enforcing downtime requirements and maintaining a log of visitors; taking care when disposing of dead stock particularly if using a communal disposal method; isolating newly arriving animals and continuing vet to vet discussions about animal health at the herd of origin; and showering into the facility where practical and changing into clean boots and coveralls.

If you suspect PEDv, please contact your local veterinarian. More information can be found at http://www.aasv.org.

Industry groups take action
---------------------------
With USD 800 000 committed to research, education, and coordination of efforts for the control and elimination of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus from the US, the National Pork Board, American Association of Swine Veterinarians, and National Pork Producers Council have formed the following groups to address activities associated with the industry response to PED
virus.

A PEDv Strategic Task Force is charged with helping to review and direct the overall effort. This task force is comprised of representatives of the 3 groups in addition to numerous members and advisors with particular expertise or involvement with the disease.

PEDv working groups, under the direction of Hans Rotto, DVM, Iowa swine veterinary consultant, were formed to concentrate efforts on 3 key areas: packing plant biosecurity, on-farm biosecurity including transport biosecurity, and on-farm biocontainment.

AASV, in collaboration with Pork Board, NPPC [National Pork Producers Council], and USDA, also has developed a survey to determine the origin of the disease.

The US Department of Agriculture has confirmed that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been identified in the United States for the 1st time through testing at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory.

Since PEDV is widespread in many countries, it is not a trade-restricting disease, but rather a production-related disease. PEDV may appear clinically to be the same as transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus with acute diarrhea. Producers will need to work with their herd veterinarian with if any TGE-like symptoms appear and as always, maintain strict bio security protocols.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a virus similar to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), another disease only affecting pigs. It is not zoonotic, so therefore it poses no risk to other animals or humans. Also, it poses no risk to food safety.

PEDV has been identified in the United States in a small number of herds. The virus is not a new virus as it was first recognized in England in 1971. Since then, the disease has been identified in a number of European countries and Canada, and more recently in China, Korea and Japan.

USDA, State Animal Health Officials, the American Association of Swine Veterinarians, and veterinarians at the National Pork Board are actively monitoring this disease and will make recommendations to producers as necessary.

PEDV is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and may appear to be the same as transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus with acute diarrhea within 12 to 36 hours of onset. Herd veterinarians remain well versed in managing TGE-like diseases.

Laboratory testing is the only way to diagnose PEDV.

As always, producers who see any signs of illness in their pigs should notify their herd veterinarian immediately to address the issue.

PEDV does not affect pork safety. Pork remains completely safe to eat.

[The 2nd article is a little odd. The National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) has been diagnosing this disease for some time. The Wisconsin case described above is not the 1st report of the disease in the US. The disease has likely been simmering in the USA for some time, and has only recently had a name applied to it and a test capable of making the detection. I would be very much surprised after the number of reported cases that this particular case in Wisconsin is the 1st one the NVSL has diagnosed.

This coronaviral diarrhea affects pigs of all ages and clinically resembles transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE).

The porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus is not related to any other member of the _Coronaviridae_. Pigs are the only known host. Antibodies to the virus have not been found in wild pigs or in other animal species. Infections have been seen in most European countries and in China. Large epidemics occurred in Europe in 1969; no antibodies have been found in sera collected before 1969. Since then, the virus has become widespread and endemic in several European countries, and acute outbreaks have become rare. On large breeding farms, the virus persists in consecutive litters of pigs after weaning and after they lose their immunity from antibody in the milk. On these farms, the virus may be associated with weaning diarrhea. In Belgium, the virus is most frequently associated with diarrhea in feeder pigs, which develops shortly after they are gathered from different breeding farms and assembled in large fattening units. The virus was demonstrated in fecal material in 80 percent of these groups. Epidemiologic data from other countries are scarce. Spread of the virus mainly occurs directly through infected pigs and indirectly through virus-contaminated fomites and via transport trucks.

The pathogenesis and immune mechanisms are similar to those reported for TGE. Oral infection results in viral replication in the epithelial cells of the small intestinal villi. Cells on colonic villi also become infected. No other tissue tropisms have been shown. Virus is excreted in the feces.

Diarrhea is the only direct virus-induced clinical sign observed. An acute outbreak on a susceptible breeding farm resembles a TGE outbreak and is characterized by watery diarrhea in pigs of all ages. However, as compared with TGE, the incubation period is longer (3-4 days), not all the litters of suckling pigs may become sick, and mortality in neonatal pigs is lower (average 50 percent). Also, the disease within the farm spreads more slowly. In all outbreaks, signs are most consistently seen in feeders, finishers, and adults, which appear to be most susceptible because outbreaks often start in these age groups. Older pigs are more lethargic and depressed with PED than with TGE. Sick pigs appear to have colic.

Acute outbreaks in susceptible finishing pigs are characterized by watery diarrhea, but a markedly increased number of acute deaths may be seen, particularly in pigs infected toward the end of the finishing period and in stress-sensitive breeds. Death may even occur during the incubation period.

Clinical differentiation from TGE is difficult. TGE in its typical epidemic form causes a rapidly spreading diarrhea in animals of all ages with high mortality in neonates. With PED, the diarrhea spreads at a slower rate, and although diarrhea is seen in most of the litters, some litters may remain healthy even in the absence of immunity. Morbidity is 100 percent in older pigs, and they are severely sick. Acute deaths in adults and finishing pigs due to muscle necrosis and occurring during an outbreak of diarrhea are typical of PED and are not seen with any other infectious diarrhea.

Laboratory diagnosis in neonates is made by direct immunofluorescence on cryostat sections of small intestine or colon. ELISA to detect viral antigens in feces or intestinal contents is more useful for older pigs. Antibodies can be detected in paired serum samples through ELISA-blocking.

No specific treatment is available. Measures taken during an outbreak are of a general nature. Pigs with diarrhea should have free access to water, and finishing pigs should have feed withheld for 1-2 days.

On breeding farms, in the face of an outbreak, spread of virus to the farrowing house can be prevented temporarily by sanitary measures and, if performed together with a deliberate infection of pregnant sows, losses in neonates may be lowered. No vaccine is available.

Until recently this disease was not present in the Western Hemisphere.
