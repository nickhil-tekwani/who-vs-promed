Swiss authorities are set to widen the net for vaccinations against tick-borne encephalitis after a record year for infections.

A total of 334 have been affected by the dangerous early summer meningo-encephalitis (ESME) virus this year [2018], a new record and 30 percent more than all of 2017.

While only a small number of ticks carry the virus (also known as tick-borne encephalitis), a bite from one of the insects can have serious consequences for your health.

The initial stage of the disease, which comes around 1-2 weeks after the bite, includes flu-like symptoms such as headaches, fever, tiredness and aching muscles.

In 5-15 percent of cases, however, a 2nd stage of the disease includes meningitis symptoms that can last for months.

Overall, some 80 percent of people infected require hospitalization, while around one percent of cases are fatal.

The risk of being bitten by a tick carrying ESME varies depending on what part of Switzerland you are in.

Now, Swiss health authorities want to widen the net on vaccinations to prevent 2019 being another record year for viral infections from ticks, according to national weekly NZZ am Sonntag.

Currently, vaccination, which is highly effective and available to adults and to children from the age of 6 up, is recommended only in localised areas where risk of infection is high. The process requires 3 injections with a booster shot after 10 years. The cost is covered by health insurers.

But federal and cantonal authorities, as well as the national vaccination commission, are now looking at possibly recommending vaccinations for entire cantons or even for the whole country, NZZ am Sonntag reported.

The vaccination rate is too low, a health ministry spokesperson told the paper.

Full details of the new proposals are set to appear in winter.

Swiss health authorities say you can help protect yourself against ticks by wearing tightly woven clothes and avoiding brush and low-lying vegetation.

You should also use repellent for skin and insecticide for clothing and check your body and clothing for ticks after spending time outdoors.

[The number of tick-borne encephalitis cases continues to climb in Switzerland, from 230 on 24 Jul 2018 to 272 on 13 Aug 2018, to 325 one month later, and now to 334 as listed above. As noted earlier, the virus is endemic (and expanding) in certain areas of the country, as well as in some areas of Germany and Austria.

In a previous comment last year (2017) concerning TBE in Switzerland, Dr Ivo M Foppa indicated that the incidence of TBE in Switzerland has increased distinctly since 2000, roughly about 50 percent. The reason for the increase of TBE incidence in Central/Western/Northern Europe is unknown, as Dr Foppa notes above. He is thanked for his comments.

The WHO has stated: "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/).

TBE is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
