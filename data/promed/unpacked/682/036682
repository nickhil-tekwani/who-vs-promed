Rabies claims 216 in East Nusa Tenggara
---------------------------------------
Rabies has killed 216 people in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) since 1997,
according to the local administration. NTT Health Agency chief Samuel
Rebo said there were also 4526 reported cases of dog bites in the same
period.

In 2010, 28 people reportedly died from rabies infections in the
province, whereas only one person has died of rabies in 2011 to date,
Samuel said. The victim, a resident of Flores [East Nusa Tenggara],
died from rabies after he had been bitten by his own dog in March this
year [and presumably did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis. -
Mod.CP]. The 31-year-old was a resident of Uneng city in Maumere in
Sikka regency and died at nearby Saint Gabriel Hospital.

[Rabies remains a problem on the island of Flores despite some
progress in reducing the extent of human exposure. The fact that the
most recent case was a resident bitten by his own (presumably
unvaccinated) dog reveals that the dog vaccination programme is far
from achieving eradication of canine rabies. Travelers in the region
should be aware of the continuing risk of exposure to rabies virus
infection by contact with domestic and feral dogs in this Indonesian
island.

Sikka is a regency within East Nusa Tenggara province, Indonesia, on
the island of Flores. It covers an area of 1731.9 sq km (669 sq mi)
and has a population of 278 628 (2008 estimate). The capital is
Maumere. The location of Sikka regency within East Nusa Tenggara is
shown in the map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikka_Regency. The
