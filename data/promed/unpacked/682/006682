Hepatitis in children - could it be aflatoxins?
---------------------------------------
Timeline
--------
On 5 Apr 2022, WHO was notified of 10 cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children under the age of 10 years, across central Scotland [1]. By 8 Apr 2022, 74 cases had been identified in the UK. As of 21 Apr 2022, at least 169 cases have been reported from 11 countries in the WHO European Region and 1 country in the WHO Region of the Americas: UK (114), Spain (13), Israel (12), the USA (9), Denmark (6), Ireland (<5), The Netherlands (4), Italy (4), Norway (2), France (2), Romania (1), and Belgium (1) [1].

CDC is currently working with the Alabama Department of Public Health to investigate the cluster of 9 cases [2]. The first American cases were identified in October 2021 at a children's hospital in Alabama that admitted 5 children with significant liver injury (including some with acute liver failure) without known cause, who also tested positive for adenovirus [2].

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics
--------------------------------------
Cases are aged 1 month to 16 years old. Seventeen children (approximately 10%) have required liver transplantation; at least 1 death has been reported [1]. Identified cases present with markedly elevated liver enzymes; many cases reported gastrointestinal symptoms (including abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting) preceding presentation with severe acute hepatitis, and increased levels of liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) greater the 500 IU/L) and jaundice. Most cases did not have a fever [1].

Etiology
---------
Initial hypotheses by the incident team in the UK around the etiological origin of the cases centred around an infectious agent or a possible toxic exposure [3].

Hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, E, and D where applicable) have been excluded [1]. Adenovirus has been detected in at least 74 cases, and of the number of cases with information on molecular testing, 18 have been identified as F type 41 [1]. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 20 cases of those that were tested [1]. Furthermore, 19 were detected with a SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus co-infection [1]. The United Kingdom, where the majority of cases have been reported to date, has recently observed a significant increase in adenovirus infections in the community (particularly detected in faecal samples in children) following low levels of circulation earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. The Netherlands also reported concurrent increasing community adenovirus circulation [1].

International travel or links to other countries based on the currently available information have not been identified as factors [1]. No link to the COVID-19 vaccine was identified and detailed information collected through a questionnaire to cases about food, drink and personal habits failed to identify any common exposure [3].

EITaF comment
-------------
The presenting symptoms are liver failure of different degrees and common hepatitis virus include hepatitis A, B, C and E have not been found.
The finding of adenovirus in some of the children may just be a coincidence, resulting from enhanced laboratory testing, as this is a common respiratory virus in children. Also, adenovirus does not fully explain the severity of the clinical picture, as adenovirus usually cause self-limited infections and have not previously been linked to such a clinical presentation. Adenovirus type 41, the implicated adenovirus type, typically presents as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, often accompanied by respiratory symptoms. While there have been case reports of hepatitis in immunocompromised children with adenovirus infection, adenovirus type 41 is not known to be a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children [1]. The potential emergence of a novel adenovirus and factors such as increased susceptibility amongst young children following a lower level of circulation of adenovirus during the COVID-19 pandemic need to be further investigated.

In the presence of an outbreak in several countries, a food-borne cause has to be considered. Food production is highly centralized and often distributed from one manufacturer to many outlets in several countries. A recent example is the outbreak of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome in several European countries due to _E. coli_ contaminated sprouts in 2011-12 [4] [or other foods 5,6 - Mod. LL]

Could the present outbreak of liver failure in children be caused by food contaminated with aflatoxins? Aflatoxins are various poisonous carcinogens and mutagens that are produced by certain molds, particularly _Aspergillus_ species. The fungi grow in soil, decaying vegetation and various staple foodstuffs and commodities such as hay, sweetcorn, wheat, millet, sorghum, cassava, rice, chili peppers, cottonseed, peanuts, tree nuts, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and various spices). Aflatoxins cause liver damage that may be acute and chronic [7]. High-level aflatoxin exposure produces an acute hepatic necrosis and children are particularly affected by aflatoxin exposure [8,9].

[The UKHSA publication (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1071116/acute-hepatitis-technical-briefing-1_3_.pdf) has mentioned that aflatoxin is to be tested for. Aflatoxin can clearly cause both acute and chronic effects on the liver including liver cancer. The following is the editorial note from a report in MMWR from Kenya. One of the factors distinguishing this current outbreak is no clustering of cases in the same household as well as the lack so far of a common food vehicle. ProMED awaits further virological data (especially information regarding whether the adenovirus serotype 41 was actually found in the liver) and toxicological (aflatoxin and others) data.

Nyikal J, A Misore A, Nzioka C, et al: Outbreak of Aflatoxin Poisoning --- Eastern and Central Provinces, Kenya, January--July 2004. MMWR 2004 / 53(34);790-793

Editorial Note:

Evidence that this outbreak resulted from aflatoxin poisoning included 1) high levels of aflatoxin (up to 8,000 ppb) in maize samples collected from patient households, 2) a clinical illness consistent with acute aflatoxin poisoning, 3) clustering of cases among residents of the same household, and 4) reports of deaths among animals known to have eaten the same maize as the patients during the same period. Serum specimens from a convenience sample of 7 patients were tested for differential viral etiologies. All seven patients had negative serologic tests for yellow fever, dengue, West Nile virus, Rift Valley fever, Chikungunya and Bunyamwera viruses, acute hepatitis A, acute hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.

Aflatoxins are a group of metabolic products formed by 2 species of fungus, _Aspergillus flavus_ and _A. parasiticus_, in several agricultural commodities, including corn or maize. 2 structural types of aflatoxins are known (B and G types), of which aflatoxin B1 is considered the most toxic and was the type most commonly found in Kenya during this outbreak. Exposure to aflatoxins occurs primarily through ingestion of contaminated foods (2) and can cause hepatic and gastrointestinal injury and have immunosuppressive, teratogenic, and oncogenic effects. Chronic low-level aflatoxin exposure can increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (3). Severe, acute liver injury with high morbidity and mortality has been associated with high-dose exposures to aflatoxins (4). Ingestion of 2--6 mg/day of aflatoxin for a month can cause acute hepatitis and death (5,6).

The largest reported outbreak of aflatoxicosis to date occurred in western India in 1974, resulting in 397 recognized cases and 106 deaths (6). The ongoing epidemic in Kenya already has resulted in 125 recognized deaths. Because of the remoteness of villages in the affected districts in Kenya and the large geographic area involved, case finding has been limited to medical facilities. In addition, because some persons might not have been able to reach health-care facilities for diagnosis and treatment, the true magnitude of this outbreak is likely to be considerably greater than reported.

An outbreak of acute aflatoxicosis (20 cases; CFR = 60%) was reported previously in Makueni district, Eastern Province, Kenya, in 1981 (1). Patients were clustered in family groups that shared meals consisting of aflatoxin-contaminated maize (1,600--12,000 ppb). Acute hepatitis associated with consumption of moldy grains also has been reported in other areas in Africa, Western India, and Malaysia (6--8), where affected persons came from areas prone to drought and malnutrition and unseasonable rains forced the harvest of grains before adequate drying had occurred. Typically, increased reports of jaundice and hepatitis followed within weeks of such harvests (6--8). Locally produced maize associated with this outbreak was harvested in February during peak rains, and the first illnesses were reported in Makueni district in late March and early April.

For every symptomatic case of aflatoxicosis identified, several other persons likely were exposed to unsafe levels of aflatoxin and might face future adverse health consequences. In addition, individual cases or clusters of aflatoxin poisoning likely occur regularly but are not recognized. Efforts should focus on the prevention of aflatoxin exposure by implementing extensive food replacement, without which, the epidemic can be expected to continue. Longer-term requirements include strengthened surveillance; increased food inspections to ensure food safety; and local education and assistance to ensure that maize is harvested correctly, dried completely, and stored properly.

This report describes the first investigation by the Kenya FELTP, a partnership of CDC, KMOH, and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology intended to build public health, epidemiologic, and laboratory capacity in Kenya. This investigation provided field experience to these Kenyan public health workers in training and exemplified collaboration between different national and international agencies and among various sectors and disciplines, including health, agriculture, food safety, nutrition, and humanitarian relief. Increased collaboration between the health sector and others involved in food security and safety could enable early warning of high levels of aflatoxins.

As a result of widespread drought, Kenya faces an acute food shortage, with nearly 1.8 million persons in 26 districts vulnerable to food insecurity (9), including persons in the area most heavily affected by the aflatoxicosis outbreak. Because an estimated 166,000 metric tons of food will be required to meet the requirements of emergency and school feeding programs during August 2004--January 2005, public health officials should be vigilant to a possible wider aflatoxicosis outbreak resulting from the large-scale storage and distribution of certain emergency food supplies.
