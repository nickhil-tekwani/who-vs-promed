With reference to the discussion on tick feeding habits and forest
temperatures, we have three comments to make:
1. In our experience (in English woods/forests) tick feeding activity is
optimal at about 20C and decreases significantly when the ambient
temperature rises above about 22C to 23C.
2. Ticks do not climb trees. If a tick inadvertantly landed on a tree when
it dropped off a bird, it would almost certainly be engorged (otherwise it
would not normally drop off the animal) and therefore be unlikely to feed
again immediately. Interrrupted feeding is very rare with ticks and is
likely to lead to damage to the tick, thus impairing its
feeding capacity.
3. In our experience (remember this is England and may be different from
other countries), the habitat determines which instar will feed on humans.
When conditions are optimal, ie high humidity and 20deg.C and under the
shade of the trees, nymphs or larvae would be the most common predators on
humans. Adult ticks attach to humans more rarely when [the latter are
collecting ticks in the forests using blanket-dragging techniques,

Following your ProMED-mail message on the TBE [tick-borne encephalitis
cases, I would like to give you some information, although not resolving
the problem on vaccines or behavioural campaign. You can find some
information on the TBE and the climate relationship in a recent document we
developed which can be download from our website on: <http://www.who.it>
or from the site of the London Conference, <http://www.who.dk>
In addition:
Tick-borne diseases: Ticks transmit several bacterial, rickettsial and viral
pathogens to humans. Ticks are ectoparasites and their geographical
distribution depends upon the availability of suitable habitat vegetation
and host species, usually rodents, large mammals, such as deer. The
distribution and population density of ticks is also limited by climatic
factors. Tick vectors are long-lived and are active in the
spring-summer-early-autumn months.
Temperature must be sufficiently high for completion of the tick's life
cycle during the warmer part of the year (i.e. above 5-8 deg.C), and low
enough in winter to suspend the life cycle. Humidity must be sufficient to
prevent both eggs and ticks from drying out. Higher temperatures enhance
proliferation of the infectious agent within the ticks, although
temperatures above the optimum range reduce the survival rate of both ticks
and parasites.
The northern limit of the distribution of ticks in Sweden has changed
between 1980 and 1994 (TÃ¤lleklint and Jaenson, 1998). In regions where ticks
were prevalent in 1980s, population density has increased between the early
1980s and mid 1990s. Unpublished data show that changes in distribution and
density over time are correlated with changes in seasonal daily minimum
temperatures (Lindgren et al., 1999).
Ixodid ticks such as _Ixodes ricinus_ and _I. persulcatus_, which are widely
distributed in temperate regions, transmit tick-borne diseases in Europe.
People most at risk of infection are those who spend time in the countryside
or come into contact with the ticks in vegetation in periurban areas. People
have also been infected in city parks. Tick populations are difficult to
control directly using pesticides. It is also difficult to
control the host animal populations due to the diversity of species that can
provide ticks with a blood meal. Tick populations may be controlled
indirectly by modifying the local vegetation type but this can only be done
on a small scale.
Currently, the most effective public health measure is to raise public
awareness about tick-borne diseases and how to avoid infection. A vaccine
for TBE is available and persons at high risk of infection (e.g., those who
live or work in endemic areas) are vaccinated in Sweden and other countries.
TBE is present in southern Scandinavia, central and Eastern Europe. There
are at least two distinct types: the central European form of tick-borne
encephalitis which was first identified in the 1930s; and the Russian
spring-summer encephalitis subtype which encompasses several diseases
world-wide, including Omsk haemorrhagic fever in Siberia.
***[This is not correct. See my comments below. - Mod CHC***
The risk of contracting the disease from a single tick bite is 1 in 600 in
endemic regions (Gustafson, 1994). The mortality rate for TBE is 1% and 10%
of cases lead to permanent paralysis. Mortality rates are higher for the
Russian spring-summer
encephalitis subtype.
TBE virus is transferred mainly from small rodents to humans by ticks. The
virus has been shown to infect humans via unpasteurised goat milk as well,
which has led to some rare localised outbreaks in Eastern Europe. A study of
TBE during nearly 4 decades in a highly-endemic region in Sweden found that
TBE incidence increased after milder winters (i.e., fewer days with
temperatures below -7 deg.C) in combination with extended spring and autumn
seasons during two successive years (Lindgren, 1998). It is therefore likely
that climate change could extend the length of the transmission season for
tick-borne diseases in central, eastern and northern Europe and facilitate
the spread of the disease to higher latitudes and altitudes.

[Most of this information is correct but Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHF) is not
a subtype of Russian Spring-Summer encephalitis (RSSE).
Let's start at the beginning: First, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the
name for a
clinical diagnosis. When one considers that the bacterium _Borrelia
burgdorferi_, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease can cause encephalitis,
and therefore "tick-borne encephalitis", it becomes apparent that it is best
to speak of the specific etiologic agent causing an illness.
When speaking of TBE, either the term "TBE virus" should not be used or the
names for various agents that cause than syndrome should be dropped; one or
the other. The problem is that some people use both, as it suits them or
out of ignorance.
Among the family Flaviviridae, genus _Flavivirus_, are a number of
tick-borne viruses that can cause human illness. Without going into awful
detail, let me say only that there are not huge differences between Central
European encephalitis (CEE) virus and RSSE virus but there are some
differences. Franz Heinz and his associates in Vienna have done elegant
work on the molecular characteristics of many of these viruses, as have
Ernie Gould (writer of Part [1 above) and his associates. Numerous
publications have appeared in the literature and they are recommended to
those who want to know more.
However, as always, shoddy classification leads to poor communication. Omsk
hemorrhagic fever, the disease, is caused by OHF virus, related to but quite
distinct from RSSE virus. Moreover, OHF and RSSE (the diseases) are not at
all similar to each other, except that they are caused by related viruses.
Differences in antigenic, molecular, and ecological characteristics of these
two viruses are clear-cut.
Bottom lines:
CEEV causes TBE
RSSEV causes TBE
CEEV and RSSEV are very closely related to each other
TBE is a euphemism for any of a number of diseases but usually is meant to
indicate infection with CEEV
OHFV is something else, but not altogether something else
The etiology of "TBE" in Moscow likely is CEEV; the etiology of "TBE" in
Vladivostok likely is RSSEV.
The Austrian "TBE vaccine" is prepared with the Neudorfl strain of CEEV.
It is a good vaccine for at-risk humans and protects mice against RSSEV
infection as well as against CEEV.
Let's move on. String cut, unless we receive additional information on
Russian cases of TBE. - Mod.CHC
