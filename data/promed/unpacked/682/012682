The New Mexico Department of Health's (NMDOH) Scientific Laboratory Division has confirmed a case of plague in a 72-year-old man from Torrance County, the 1st human case of plague in New Mexico this year [2019].

Plague is a disease caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is generally transmitted to humans from the bites of infected fleas that live among rodents and rabbits. Plague can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals. Pet dogs and cats can become infected with plague when they eat an infected rodent or when they are bitten by an infected flea.

NMDOH staff have gone door-to-door in the affected area to inform neighbors about plague and provided them with education to reduce their risks.

"No matter where you call home in New Mexico, you can reduce the risk of plague by avoiding contact with rodents or their fleas, or outdoor pets by providing appropriate flea prevention for pets year-round," said Secretary of Health Kathy Kunkel.

Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of a fever, chills, headache, and weakness usually within one to 7 days of becoming infected. There may be a painful swelling of the lymph node in the neck, armpit or groin areas, referred to as bubonic plague. The infection can also spread to the blood, causing septicemic plague, or to the lungs, causing pneumonic plague.

With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report all cases to the New Mexico Department of Health.

To prevent plague, the Department of Health recommends that residents:

- Avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and burrows.
- Clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned or un-used vehicles.
- See a healthcare provider about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever. Inform your healthcare provider about any flea bites, contact with rodents, or burrows during the previous couple of weeks.
- Wear protective clothing to prevent flea bites while working outside.
- Provide safe and effective flea control for pets as recommended by a veterinarian.
- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian.

This is the 1st human plague case in New Mexico since 2017, a year where there was a total of 4 human cases. There has been one animal plague case in a dog in Quay County in 2019 (see Department of Health Reports Plague Case in Quay County). There were 3 cases of animal plague in dogs in 2018, and 28 animal plague cases in 2017 in New Mexico.

[Earlier comment from Mod.LL (archive number 20180614.5856107):
"The manifestations of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in this case are not stated in the report but it is likely to have been bubonic plague. Of late, 2015 was a "banner year" for _Y. pestis_ infections in the USA with 15 cases and 4 deaths. In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year (range: 1-17 cases per year) with 0-2 deaths.

The following was extracted from: Prentice MB, Rahalison L. Plague. Lancet. 2007; 369(9568): 1196-207, with the citations removed:

"Some plague cases (10-25 per cent) present with primary septicemia (hypotension, shock) without lymph nodes being obviously affected and these patients have higher mortality than those with bubonic plague. The term septicemic plague can be confusing, since most patients with buboes have detectable bacteremia at some stage and can also have high-density bacteremia with systemic signs of sepsis. Debate about whether septicemic plague is always secondary to frank or subclinical bubonic or pneumonic disease continues, but work in mice lends support to the existence of a syndrome of septicemic disease without histological changes in lymph nodes in a few animals infected by flea bites."

Earlier comment of Mod.TG (archive number 20190413.6421127):

"Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection.

Plague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever (or chills). These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat-fight abscess.

If your pets are not on flea prevention, please ask your veterinarian about the best flea prevention. Bathing your pet in dishwashing soap is not sufficient to help your pet avoid diseases carried by fleas. Some of the over the counter flea preventions may be harmful to your pet, so please check with your veterinarian. It is also a good time to make sure your pet is current on a rabies shot.

Keeping your pets inside is best, and being inside a yard will help diminish the ability to consume a dead animal and further reduce the risk of plague to your animal and to yourself." - Mod.LM
