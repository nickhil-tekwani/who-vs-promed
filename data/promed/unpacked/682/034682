This is in reference to the Kenyan government ban on the use of the
anti-malaria drug chloroquine in western Kenya.
Unfortunately this is going to be easier said than done. Chloroquine has
been so misused as a drug that it is hardly surprising that it is now
proving to be ineffective in the treatment of malaria. The word 'malaria' is
synonymous with any fever in Kenya,
especially in Western Kenya, and is therefore used as an antipyretic. Its
easy
availability at all the road side kiosks (small wooden stalls selling
everything from bread, milk, salt to chloroquine) to bus stations has meant
that anybody and everybody has access to the drug.
Invariably we would see patients who had taken different dosage regimes from
one tablet 3 to 4 times a day to 4 tablets as a stat dose before they
presented to us. So, I find that the ban is only going to result in the
product now being illegally sold at a premium. Unless one can change the
entire thinking of the common man to this problem, no amount of ban will
[prevent its continuous misuse.
I would also like to know if anybody has data on the neuropsychiatric
reactions of Mefloquin when take as a chemoprophylactic drug. Somehow I saw
a lot more than the expected 'rare' reaction, resulting in patients having
to stop the drug altogether. If we are to totally rely on Mefloquin, it
won't be long before we see the number of adverse reactions increasing.

Ban on malaria drug angers medics
--------------------------------------
The Mt Kenya branch of the Pharmaceutical Society of Kenya yesterday opposed
a move by the Ministry of Health to reject the use of chloroquine for
treating malaria.
The branch chairman, Dr Muchiri Gaku, and treasurer, Dr Edward Kamamia, said
chloroquine was still an effective anti-malarial drug. Addressing a press
conference in Embu Town, the medics said the move was unprocedural.
The ministry last week recommended quinine instead of chloroquine.
Chloroquine
is used to treat 60 per cent of malaria cases in the country. A deadly
malaria outbreak has hit Kisii and parts of Nandi and Trans Nzoia districts,
claiming many lives.
During his tour of malaria-hit Uasin Gishu District, Health Assistant
Minister Basil Criticos said in Eldoret that government hospitals would be
instructed not to use chloroquine because it had proved ineffective in
treating malaria.
The PSK officials said it was unfortunate for the government to ban the drug
when
malaria continued to claim lives. They argued that chloroquine was more
effective than quinine, and demanded that the chloroquine in medical stores
be analysed to establish whether it was still effective.

analysed. You´d think they´d be capable of doing that themselves - Mod.JW
