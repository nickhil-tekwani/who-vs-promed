Indonesian woman dies of suspected bird flu
-------------------------------------------
A 21-year-old Indonesian woman has died of suspected bird flu, a
doctor said on Wednesday [28 Jan 2009]. The woman died on Saturday
[24 Jan 2009] in Doctor Soetomo Hospital in Surabaya, East Java,
after showing bird flu symptoms, said Palilingan, a doctor in the
hospital's avian flu team who, like many Indonesians, goes by only
one name.

"She had breathing difficulties, high fever and lost consciousness,"
Palilingan told AFP. He said the presence of the deadly H5N1 strain
of the virus would have to be confirmed after testing of tissue
samples. Two positive results are needed before Indonesian
authorities confirm a human bird flu infection.

A health ministry spokeswoman said the ministry had sent experts to
check on the condition of poultry in the woman's village in
Tulungagung district, East Java. Indonesia is the country worst hit
by avian influenza with 115 deaths officially recorded since 2003.
Experts fear the virus, which is usually spread directly from birds
to humans, could mutate into a form easily transmissible between
people, sparking a global pandemic.

[These reports have certain similarities (such as, time and place of
death of the patient) and further information is awaited to provide
clarification.

As of Tue 27 Jan 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has
confirmed 141 human cases of avian A/H5N1 influenza virus infection
in Indonesia and 115 fatalities.

So far there has been no official confirmation (from WHO or the
Indonesian Health Ministry) of the suspected case in Kuningan, West
Java (see ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (16): Indonesia, susp
20090123.0297).
