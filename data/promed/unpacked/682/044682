After staging a comeback in the country this winter, deadly Nipah virus has so far claimed the lives of 10 people, including 2 in the capital, out of 12 infected as of 3 Feb [2013], reports UNB (United News of Bangladesh). Among the casualties, there have been 2 from each of Dhaka, Pabna, and Natore and one from each of Rajbari, Jhenaidah, Naogaon, and Rajshahi, according to Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology Diseases Control and Research (IEDCR). It says 2 of the victims of Dhaka consumed raw date palm juice from Bhaluka, Mymensingh.

Dr Mushtuq Hossain, the principal scientific officer (medical sociology) of IEDCR, told UNB on Monday [4 Feb 2013] that those died and who have been affected by the deadly Nipah virus consumed raw date palm juice. Mushtuq cautioned that no one should drink raw date palm juice and fruits that were partly eaten by animals earlier. "One should drink date juice after its proper boiling and eat raw fruit after washing it properly."

Asked about the symptoms of the disease, Mushtuq said high fever, senseless talking, acute chest pain, respiratory problems, and severe headache are the symptoms of the disease. "If any patient has those symptoms he or she should be admitted to nearby hospital for treatment." Mushtuq added that the attendants of the Nipah virus affected patients should take precautionary steps while taking care of the patients as the virus is contagious.

Human Nipah virus (NiV) infection, an emerging zoonotic disease, was 1st recognised in a large outbreak of 276 reported cases in Malaysia and Singapore from September 1998 through May 1999.

NiV is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus belonging to genus Henipavirus. It is an enveloped RNA virus.

But now, according to Mushtuq, the disease is only found in Bangladesh. Some 139 patients out of 180 infected people so far died in the outbreak of the disease in Bangladesh.

[The number of Nipah virus infections and deaths continues to slowly rise so far this year (2013). Curiously, the above report makes no mention of the source of palm sap or fruit contamination. The reservoir hosts of Nipah virus are giant fruit bats (_Pteropus_ species). They shed virus, particularly during the breeding season when pregnant or lactating. Because these sporadic cases occur in geographically scattered areas, increasing the degree of public awareness, and need for either boiling the sap or preventing access to sap collection vessels by the bats by placing barriers around the jars, is a major public health education challenge. - Mod.TY
