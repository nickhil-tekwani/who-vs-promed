The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority [WRHA] is sounding the alarm on sexually transmitted infections in the city, warning that cases of syphilis are on the rise.

In 2018, the rate of syphilis in Winnipeg was 4 times higher than it was in 2017, according to the WRHA. Dr Pierre Plourde, medical officer of health with the WRHA, said these rates are the highest he's seen in 20 years. "We knew syphilis was on the increase, but this is unheard of," said Plourde.

The WRHA is still trying to figure out what is causing the uptick in syphilis cases, but health officials have analyzed data to better understand who is experiencing these infections.

According to the WRHA, almost 2/3 of those affected live in the downtown and Point Douglas areas of the city, and almost half reported using drugs, mainly methamphetamine. "It looks like people who are injecting meth are much more likely to get contaminated with syphilis," said Plourde.

The WRHA is also concerned about a potential rise in HIV cases in Winnipeg.

The city has already seen increases in hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and according to Plourde, an increase in HIV often follows those diseases.

[The United States has experienced a rising incidence of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis since 2000 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/sam/2017syphilis.htm), after syphilis reached historic lows with less than 6000 reported cases and an incidence of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people in 2000. Syphilis rates have increased in every region of the US, in a majority of age groups, and across almost every race/ethnicity. During 2000-2015, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the US was primarily attributable to increased cases among men, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). More recently, syphilis also increased among women. For example, during 2014-2015, the rate increased 18.1 percent among men, but increased 27.3 percent among women (http://www.loopcayman.com/content/syphilis-cases-increase-1). The increasing incidence in women has been associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis. Similar trends have been seen in Canada (see ProMED-mail posts Gonococcal dis. chlamydia, syphilis - Canada (02): increased cases, background 20171031.5416876 and Gonococcal dis, chlamydia, syphilis - Canada: (ON) increase, MSM, RFI 20171031.5414788).

However, we are not told in the news report above what segments of the population are involved in the increased incidence of syphilis in the city of Winnipeg, although almost two thirds of those affected are said in the news report to live in the downtown and Point Douglas areas of the city and almost half reported using drugs, mainly methamphetamine. The Point Douglas area has been reported to have the lowest average family income of any electoral division in the province and about one third of families are single-parent households (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Douglas).

Winnipeg, with a population of over 700 000 residents in 2016, is the capital and largest city in the Canadian province of Manitoba (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg), approximately 110 km (70 mi) north of the Canada-United States border.
