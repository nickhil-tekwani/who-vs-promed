A disease-inducing fungus in amphibians worldwide could become deadlier as different genetic variations emerge, according to research led by the University of Alabama (UA).

Biologists tested the harmfulness of a Brazilian hybrid form of _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_, known simply as Bd or the amphibian chytrid fungus, as well as both parent forms, on species of frogs from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. They found infections and strength of the illness increased with the hybrid form.

Published today [Tue 26 Jun 2018] in Scientific Reports, the research is the 1st to demonstrate hybrids of the fungus can be deadlier than more common and widespread fungal genotypes.

"With globalization facilitating pathogen spread across continents, hybridization of chytrids might lead to new epidemic waves reducing amphibian biodiversity in both tropical and temperate regions," said Dr. Gui Becker, UA assistant professor of biological sciences. Becker was a co-author on the paper, "Hybrids of amphibian chytrid show high virulence in native hosts," which was led by Dr. Sasha Greenspan, a UA post-doctoral researcher.

When the paper was written a few months ago, the Brazilian hybrid of the fungus was the only one documented, but new evidence shows another hybrid of the fungus emerged in South Africa, Greenspan said.

"The genetics of this fungus are changing, and with these changes may come new risks for frog populations," she said.

Infectious outbreaks of the disease caused by the fungus, chytridiomycosis, have afflicted amphibians for at least 40 years on every continent except Antarctica, sometimes killing massive numbers of animals and, occasionally, extinguishing some species.

The fungus' complex genetic history is not completely understood, but a relatively new version, on an evolutionary timescale, is known as the global pandemic lineage, or Bd-GPL. What led to its emergence is unknown, but it is particularly deadly.

In Brazil, Bd-GPL reproduced with another lineage, a process known as hybridization, and the UA-led research shows the hybrid fungus can be even more deadly than Bd-GPL in native frogs, Greenspan said."This is significant because it shows that hybrids of this fungus can increase disease risk," she said.

The team conducted the research at the University of Campinas in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and included a diverse array of frogs native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, including _Brachycephalus ephippium_, called a pumpkin toadlet among other names; _Ischnocnema parva_; and _Dendropsophus minutus_, a lesser tree frog.

"Since it is well-established that Bd has a dynamic genome and is now nearly globally distributed, this finding highlights the importance of global surveillance to detect future genomic shifts in this disease system that could lead to new outbreaks of chytridiomycosis," Greenspan writes in the paper.

_B. dendrobatidis_ (Bd, chytrid fungus) is a singular fungal pathogen. It has a swimming zoospore as the infectious stage. It colonizes skin cells of adult amphibians and the mouthparts of tadpoles. Infection occurs when zoospores land on the skin or the mouthparts and encyst. Through mechanisms that are not fully understood, the pathogen moves from the surface of the skin to the stratum granulosum of the epidermis and matures in the stratum corneum. There, it enters healthy cells, grows in size, and develops into an urn-shaped zoosporangium in which the zoospores develop. As infected skin cells move toward the surface, the zoosporangium matures, the discharge papilla opens, and mature zoospores swim out. The mechanism by which this pathogen causes disease seems to be by interference with the ion transport functions of the skin, leading eventually to cardiac failure.

Genetic studies revealed that there are several lineages of Bd. Some have been present for a long time in a region, causing little impact on local frog species. One lineage, however, has spread across several continents and has been linked to many amphibian population declines. This global pandemic lineage became hybridized with local lineages in South Africa and Brazil, producing a novel strain, which in this case proved to be more pathogenic in one native species. The authors tested the hybrid in 3 species, finding different results in each case.

To interpret these results, and the phenomenon as a whole, it is important to analyze what virulence is. Virulence is one of the consequences of the host-pathogen(/parasite) interaction and is the cost paid by the host as a result of an infection. Virulence is not simply an attribute of the pathogen, but an outcome of this interaction determined by the interplay between infection and host defenses, as it depends on the detrimental effect per parasite (not only dependent on the pathogen, as it is also reflected by host tolerance) and by the intensity of parasitism (affected by host resistance, and dependent on parasite exposure). Thus, virulence may vary across a group of hosts, mainly due to variability in defense competences.

Taking the above into account, it is expected that hosts of a given region have evolved defense strategies (tolerance and resistance) to maximize their fitness in when infected with local pathogens. When new lineages or hybrids appear, the defenses to these new pathogens may not be optimal, provided there is no co-evolutionary history that allowed adjusting an appropriate response. This holds for other host-parasite systems. Introduction of foreign pathogens in areas where there are susceptible hosts with naive immune systems may cause disastrous results. - Mod.PMB
