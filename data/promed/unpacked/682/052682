3d case of illness reported
---------------------------
The rare bacterial disease called tularemia has not loosened its grip on
Martha's Vineyard, where this week a third case was confirmed by public
health officials for this season.
An outbreak of the disease last year struck 15 people on the island, one of
them fatally. Most of the victims have been landscapers.
Public health officials have stressed that generally people who come to the
Vineyard are not at high risk for getting tularemia. Most of those who have
fallen ill have worked outdoors. Of this year's 3 cases, one was a farmer,
and another a landscaper. The other was a child.
But the persistence of the disease makes it a medical mystery for the
record books, especially since most of the cases are the pneumonic form,
probably caused by people breathing in airborne particles contaminated by
the bacteria.
No other place in the country has ever experienced an outbreak of pneumonic
tularemia. Last summer marked the Vineyard's second outbreak, the first one
taking place back in 1978, when 15 people were stricken.
"What we're seeing is a continuing transmission of the bacteria at levels
that are exposing people to the pneumonic form [of tularemia," said Dr.
David Dennis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose
researchers left the island this week.
For the CDC, it was the third trip in less than a year. They were joined by
a Harvard School of Public Health team, and together, they cast a wide net
in the search for clues to why a disease that usually infects only one or 2
people a year has a foothold here.
They drew blood samples from more than 100 landscapers, captured several
hundred dog ticks and trapped about 50 rodents, common carriers of the
disease.
Already, one rabbit has tested positive for tularemia.

[The details of this third case are not presented well, but I presume it
was another case of pneumonic tularemia. I also presume this patient to be
a landscaper, since the previously reported cases were a child and a
chicken farmer. - Mod.ES
