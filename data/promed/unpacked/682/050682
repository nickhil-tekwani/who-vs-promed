As of 18 Jul 2007 at 11 AM ET, 65 persons infected with _Salmonella
enterica_ serotype] Wandsworth have been reported to CDC from 20
states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont,
Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. Among the patients for whom
clinical information is available, all had diarrhea, 76 percent had
bloody stools, and 6 patients were hospitalized. No deaths have been
attributed to these infections.
Onset dates, which are known for 64 patients, ranged from 26 Feb to
27 Jun 2007. Most (91 percent) cases have occurred in children aged
10 months to 3 years. During the initial phase of the outbreak, the
number of cases gradually increased, with only 8 cases reported to
PulseNet (the nationwide network of public health laboratories that
sub-type bacteria) from 6 states before 1 May 2007. Health
department and CDC investigators worked for weeks conducting
interviews with parents of ill children to develop theories about
possible sources of infection.
A multi-state case-control study demonstrated a strong association
between illness and consumption of Veggie Booty, a snack of puffed
rice and corn with a vegetable coating. CDC OutbreakNet staff shared
this information with colleagues at the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) on 27 Jun 2007. After being informed about the outbreak by FDA,
the company that manufactures the product issued a voluntary recall
on 28 Jun 2007. None of the 65 known illnesses from _S._ Wandsworth
began after the product was recalled. Persons are advised to discard
any product in their possession.
OutbreakNet officials at CDC and in state and local health
departments, FDA, and the marketing and manufacturing companies are
working collaboratively to learn more about production of Veggie
Booty to determine how it may have become contaminated. The Minnesota
Department of Agriculture Laboratory (MDAL) has isolated the outbreak
strain of _S._ Wandsworth from sealed bags of Veggie Booty obtained
from retail stores. The outbreak strain has also been isolated from
sealed bags of Veggie Booty by the FDA laboratory and the New York
State Department of Health Wadsworth Center Laboratory. Preliminary
testing suggests that the seasoning mix used in Veggie Booty may be
the source of the contamination.
MDAL also isolated _S._ Typhimurium, a different strain of
Salmonella, from a sealed bag of Veggie Booty collected at the same
time as the bags positive for serotype Wandsworth. PulseNet
identified 10 persons who had illness caused by this strain of _S._
Typhimurium between 1 Jun and 27 Jun 2007. OutbreakNet officials
have interviewed 8 of the 10 ill persons with this strain of _S._
Typhimurium and determined that all 8 consumed Veggie Booty during
the week before their illnesses began.
On 2 Jul 2007, the company expanded the recall to include Super
Veggie Tings Crunchy Corn Sticks. This was done due to the company's
concern that Veggie Booty and Super Veggie Tings share ingredients
that could be contaminated. Persons should discard any Super Veggie
Tings in their possession. CDC is not aware of any human illnesses
associated with the consumption of Super Veggie Tings.

[The number of cases related to serotype Wandsworth and the number of
states affected have increased only slightly since the last posting.
It had already been known that _S._ Typhimurium had been found in the
product but this posting reveals that human cases of this serotype
were also linked to the product. - Mod.LL]
