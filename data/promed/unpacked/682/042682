In a follow up to a story earlier this month [August 2013], the cryptosporidium outbreak in Iowa continues to climb, with 528 probable and confirmed cases reported since 1 Jun 2013. This is up from the last update on 14 Aug 2013, which revealed 399 probable and confirmed cases since June 2013.

Polk County tops the 59 counties reporting cases of the parasitical disease, with 216 cases. The Iowa Department of Public Health is reporting that, year-to-date in 2013, 615 cases (confirmed and probable) of cryptosporidiosis have been reported in Iowa.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that cryptosporidium is a microscopic parasite that causes the diarrheal disease cryptosporidiosis. Both the parasite and the disease are commonly known as "crypto." There are many species of cryptosporidium that infect humans and animals.

The parasite is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods of time and makes it very resistant to chlorine disinfection.

While this parasite can be spread in several different ways, water (drinking water and recreational water) is the most common method of transmission. Cryptosporidium is one of the most frequent causes of waterborne disease among humans in the United States.

[Larger outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis are usually due to contaminated drinking water. The current newswire above contains no information on the investigation carried out by the health authorities or whether mapping of the cases suggest a common water reservoir as the source. However, crytosporidia may also be food borne, and several food borne outbreaks have been reported, for instance from the United Kingdom (Cryptosporidiosis - UK: food borne 20130324.1600837). - Mod.EP
