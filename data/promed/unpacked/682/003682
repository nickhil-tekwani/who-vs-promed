Link between vCJD and beef consumption is still circumstantial
-------------------------------------------------------------
A study of the case histories of 51 sufferers of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (vCJD) has failed to produce a positive link with eating beef. The
report from the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh also found
little evidence to support theories that medical treatments or victims'
occupations could be a factor in developing the disease. "We have found no
evidence of any dietary, iatrogenic or occupational risk for vCJD," said
the report, quoted in the Daily Telegraph. The report's findings go against
the grain of the general scientific consensus that the most likely means of
vCJD transmission is through eating infected beef. The number of confirmed
deaths from vCJD - the human form of mad cow disease - has been rising
steadily since it was first identified in the mid 1990s. So far this year,
there have been 18 confirmed deaths, with another 4 deaths probably due to
vCJD but not confirmed by post-mortem examinations.
For the latest study, the UK Government CJD Surveillance Unit compared the
dietary and medical histories of 51 known victims, with 27 patients who
were not suffering from the disease. Only one of the 51 victims was not a
beef eater, and 88% of the sample group had eaten burgers - statistics
which appear to match with the population as a whole. Of the vCJD victims,
54% were found to eat beef more than once a week, compared to 37% of the
non-sufferers. [At this sample size, the difference is not statistically
significant. - Mod.CP The report also found no direct association between
the amount of beef eaten and the incidence of the disease, but said it
could not exclude the possibility of a link.
On Fri 3 Nov 2000, the Department of Health admitted the evidence that
eating beef was to blame for vCJD was "circumstantial". The Meat and
Livestock Commission, which was slammed by the recent BSE inquiry report
for overplaying the safety of beef, said the latest report made
"interesting reading".
