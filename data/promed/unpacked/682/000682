Six people in Norway have fallen ill in recent months with the source of infection thought to be contaminated raw milk cheese from France. The foodborne outbreak was suspected to be caused by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Dublin in chilled cheese made with unpasteurized milk.

The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet) investigated the outbreak with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet) and Norwegian Veterinary Institute.

Early in 2021, Norwegian officials detected a cluster of 6 patients with _Salmonella_ Dublin infections. _Salmonella_ Dublin is rare in the country with typically no more than 5 infections reported annually, according to health officials.

Patients lived in 4 different counties. Their median age was 70 and a half years old with a range from 40 to 85, and half were female. Symptom onset ranged from the end of December 2020 to beginning of March 2021.

In interviews, 5 of 6 people said they may have eaten raw milk cheese from France. No microbiological analysis of cheese could be performed because there was no stock left, and the product is believed to no longer be on the market. All 6 patients were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire for _Salmonella_ to get food consumption history one week before symptom onset. There was also a more targeted questionnaire with pictures of different cheeses. People were also asked where they bought the different products.

Based on results of patient interviews and traceback information, raw milk cheese from France may be the source of the outbreak, but given the small number of confirmed cases and limited information, officials were unable to determine the link conclusively.

Meanwhile, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority has published findings of a survey on dried products in the domestic market that were analyzed for _Salmonella_. The surveillance program in 2020 was done to assess the sector following a _Salmonella_ outbreak in 2019 where 58 people became ill after eating a mixture of exotic dried fruit. Some products were ready to eat food that are often consumed without heat treatment.

_Salmonella_ survives for a long time in dry foods and can be unevenly distributed in them. In total, 543 samples of spices, dried berries, fruit and nut mixtures, and milk powder and dried infant formula were collected, and more than 1000 analyses were done, but no _Salmonella_ was detected. Samples were taken randomly from across the country and at all stages of the supply chain from importers and manufacturers to retailers. Products originated from many countries, including the United States, China, India, Thailand, Viet Nam, Denmark, Sweden, and Turkey.

[_Salmonella_ Dublin as a cause of salmonellosis associated with unpasteurized milk products brings back memories of my Infectious Diseases fellowship at Stanford in California related to the Alta Dena dairy. The following is part of an article published in 1997 by William Jarvis entitled "Raw milk can be deadly" (https://www.ncahf.org/articles/o-r/rawmilk.html), which described the episode (the references can be seen at the original URL):

"For many years, the state's [California] largest dairy (approximately USD 100 million per year), Alta Dena Dairy, aggressively promoted Certified Raw Milk (CRM) as a health food. The owner, Harold Stueve, was apparently a vitalist (one who believed that unprocessed foods possessed a mystical "life force"). A Los Angeles Times report revealed his ideology:

"Stueve ... was feeding milk samples to 2 young pumpkin plants. One plant was being fed raw milk, the other pasteurized. Stueve was convinced that the experiment would show that the raw milk would produce bigger, fatter pumpkins. "The Lord gives us everything in its wholeness, and that's the way He meant us to keep it," he said [3].

"The term 'certified' raw milk has no public health significance; it is a marketing term owned by the American Associations of Medical Milk Commissions (AAMMC). AAMMC was organized in 1907 to develop uniform standards for the production of 'certified raw milk.' One feature at the time was the elimination of bovine tuberculosis from cow herds. However, by 1941, all the disease had been eliminated from all US herds. Hygienic standards are similar in all modern dairy operations. Unfortunately, cleanliness does not protect consumers from every disease that may be transmitted via unpasteurized milk, and animal testing cannot prevent dangerous _Salmonella_ Dublin from contaminating milk. During the 1980s, Alta Dena was the lone member of the AAMMC, meaning that it 'regulated' itself. The raw milk production facilities were sold by the Stueve family in the late 1980s, so that all milk sold under the Alta Dena label is pasteurized, but the dairy continued to distribute CRM under the name Stueve's Natural Raw Certified Milk (produced by Stueve Brothers Farms at Chino).

"Between April 1971 and March 1974, _S._ Dublin was isolated from 79 persons in California, 37 of whom had medical conditions. Their ages ranged from 1 month to 88 years; 59 were hospitalized, 16 died, and 32 infections were traced to Alta Dena CRM. Herd tests found that cattle can have localized infections that will not show up in fecal surveys [4]. _Salmonella_ organisms have been recovered 45 times since 1977 from California produced raw milk, all from Alta Dena's CRM [5]. In 1981, 46 cases of _S._ Dublin were reported in California; in 1982, 70 cases were reported; 24% of patients reported using CRM. In 1983, 123 cases were identified, 44% reported using CRM; at least 24 of the 1983 patients had cancer. As many as 80% of patients were hospitalized, and 26% died [6]. Alta Dena CRM was also implicated in the Jalisco cheese tragedy that killed 89 people [7]. Stueve refused to believe the data and claimed they were part of a conspiracy against CRM. The facts suggest that just the opposite was true. Alta Dena had strong political support. Governor Jerry Brown was a CRM user. State Senator William Campbell sponsored several bills exempting Alta Dena from control by the state; 2 such bills passed the legislature but were vetoed by Governor George Deukmejian. Alta Dena also intimidated its critics. It launched a USD 110 million personal lawsuit against the physician who testified on behalf of children for the American Academy of Pediatrics [8].

"Alta Dena's advertising claimed that CRM was the 'safest, purest, most wholesome milk you can buy' and distributed 'educational' materials claiming that pasteurization markedly reduced the nutritional value of milk. Alta Dena refused to put warning labels on CRM. The Berkeley Co-op reported that the warning signs it voluntarily posted were repeatedly torn down by CRM buyers. The AIDS problem in San Francisco eventually caused its city council to require such a label. Political intervention in Sacramento continued to prevent the Department of Health Services from ordering Alta Dena to pasteurize. A public interest lawsuit brought by Consumer's Union, the American Public Health Association, and the California Grey Panthers (a senior citizen consumer group) resulted in a 1985 court order requiring a warning label on CRM. Stueve continued to deny that CRM was responsible for health problems. Alta Dena financed an independent study by the UCLA School of Public Health to determine whether CRM was actually a problem. Epidemiologists at UCLA estimated that more than 1/3rd of reported _S._ Dublin infections in California from 1980-83 were attributable to raw milk consumption. It appeared that the incidence of infection was 8 to 35 per 100 000 [9]. It was determined that the relative risk of illness from _S._ Dublin for CRM users in 1983 was 158.0 based upon an estimated one pint/day/user consuming some of the 12 000 gallons produced daily [10]." - Mod.LL
