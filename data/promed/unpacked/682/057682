Health Ministry epidemiologists are investigating the apparent foodborne illness in nearly 4 dozen guests at 2 hotels in Tiberias over Rosh Hashana [the Jewish New Year - Mod.LL]. They were hospitalized in Poriya Medical Center just outside the city after complaining of diarrhea, vomiting and dizziness.

The victims ranged in age from a baby to an octogenarian. The epidemiologists were sent by the district health office to the Bali Hotel and the Leonardo Club Hotel in Tiberias to take samples of the food and conduct other tests.

[With guests from 2 hotels affected, if this is indeed foodborne, there must be a common source of the food vehicle. Comparing the food history of those affected and controls can help to epidemiologically link a food source.

Tiberias (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberias) is a city on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee (also called the Kinneret), Lower Galilee, Israel. Established in 20 CE, it was named in honor of the emperor Tiberius.

A map of Israel showing the location of Tiberias can be found at http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberias#/image/File:Israel_location_map_with_stripes.svg. - Mod.LL
