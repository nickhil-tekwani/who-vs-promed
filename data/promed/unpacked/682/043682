Canada (West): correction
-------------------------
[Dr Ellam has sent the following amendment to the moderator's comment in
the preceding post].
Although correctly noting that influenza activity has commenced earlier
than usual in Western Canada the moderator's comment also states that the
A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) strain is present, as it is in the UK and parts of
Europe. This is not correct, as the presence of Fujian strains has not been
reported from Western Canada. The latest report (week 44) available states:
"The National Microbiology Laboratory has antigenically characterized 14
influenza viruses to date; all were found to be A/Panama/2007/99-like,
which is included in the 2003-04 vaccine"; (that is, not the Fujian
strain). I think this is important as readers may erroneously think that
the evolution of influenza activity in western Canada may have specific
relevance to the United Kingdom, when this is less likely to be true, given
that the main circulating virus is different.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Ellam for pointing out this error. Indeed the
identification of the Canadian isolates as A/Panama/2007/99-like was stated
correctly in the earlier ProMED-mail post: "Influenza - Canada (West) (02)
20031030.2699". The moderator's comment that the strains were
A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2)-like was extrapolated incorrectly from a general
statement in a recent WHO WER report that: "The majority of influenza
A(H1N1) and B viruses isolated during the [previous] season were closely
related to the vaccine strains, whereas the majority of influenza A(H3N2)
viruses recently isolated were closely related to A/Fujian/411/2002. - Mod.CP]
