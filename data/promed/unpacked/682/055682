In the northern Shaviyani atoll [in the Maldive Islands], 5 cases of
dengue fever have been confirmed among residents of Foakaidhoo
Island. Hundreds more islanders have contracted a mystery viral
fever, and more than 5 new infections are being reported daily.
But the Shaviyani atoll hospital manager Hassan Ismail has denied
reports 600 people have been infected, and dismissed concerns
chikungunya could be present on the island too. He said a handful of
islanders are being tested for dengue, but the vast majority of
patients are suffering from a less serious virus.
Outbreaks of the mystery virus have been reported in Shaviyani atoll
since June [2007]. Hassan Ismail says up to 300 people were infected
on the capital island, Fonadhoo, last month [June 2007]. No dengue
and chikungunya cases were reported, but the Department of Health
Services dispatched 2 doctors to Shaviyani to encourage islanders to
take precaution against mosquitoes, and prevent infections spreading.
The 1st viral case on Foakaidhoo was reported on 4 Jun [2007]. Since
then 4 or 5 cases have been reported daily, and up to 10 a day since
Thursday [12 Jul 2007]. According to Hassan Ismail, a female
Foakaidhoo islander suffering with the virus died in the Indira
Gandhi Memorial Hospital in early June [2007], after being taken from
the island to Male for treatment.
Since then a doctor, 2 nurses and a community health worker have been
based in the Foakaidhoo island hospital, and the island has been
sprayed regularly to eradicate mosquitoes.
But concern has grown in the last week [week of 1 Jul 2007] after 5
patients transferred from Foakaidhoo to the Kulhuduffushi hospital in
neighbouring Haa Dall atoll, tested positive for dengue. And since
then rumours of a dengue and chikungunya epidemic on Foakaidhoo have spread.
The Island Chief Mohamed Rasheed says 80 percent of the 1000
islanders have been infected in the last month [June 2007], and
Aishath Waheeda, who works in the island health centre, says she has
seen several suspected chikungunya cases.
Reacting to reports in Aafathis that 600 of the 1000 islanders on
Foakaidhoo are in "a serious condition," Ismail said, "I have heard
this, but it is really wrong." According to Ismail, "no one is in a
serious condition," and there are less than 300 hundred people recorded ill.
Ismail says a handful of islanders are being tested for dengue, but
the vast majority of the patients are suffering from a minor virus,
and "and can be treated at home." He said the Foakaidhoo Island
centre "has the capacity" to deal with the outbreak and said the 3
beds in the centre are being used to provide IV drips to patients who
need them.
But Foakaidhoo islanders are more concerned about the outbreak.
According to one resident, Ahmed Hameed, nearly every islander has
contracted the virus in the past month, and half of the islanders
remain ill. Even the 2 doctors dispatched to Shaviyani from Male
contracted the illness and had to leave Foakaidhoo.
Ismail Hassan said daily reports being sent to the Department of
Public Health will show infection rates are lower than reports
suggest. The Health Ministry was closed for the weekend [14-15 Jul
2007] and unavailable for comment.

[ProMED requests further information about this outbreak of febrile
disease, and the basis on which chikungunya virus infection was ruled
out. There was a chikungunya outbreak in the Maldives in 2006, as
well as a dengue outbreak during that same year.
