Regarding ProMED-mail post "Usutu virus - Europe," I would like to draw your attention to the paper: "Usutu virus, Italy, 1996. Emerg Infect Dis. 2013 Feb;19(2):274-7. doi: 10.3201/eid1902.121191. by Weissenböck H1, Bakonyi T, Rossi G, Mani P, Nowotny N.," in which the authors show by analysis of archive samples that Usutu virus had been causing blackbird mortality in Italy as early as 1996.

The abstract states: "Retrospective analysis of archived tissue samples from bird deaths in the Tuscany region of Italy in 1996 identified Usutu virus. Partial sequencing confirmed identity with the 2001 Vienna strain and provided evidence for a much earlier introduction of this virus into Europe than previously assumed."

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Höfle-Hansen for sending in this information and the reference from which it came.

Evidence of Usutu virus infections in humans and wild birds has been emerging in various countries in Europe over the past several years. The article that Dr. Höfle-Hansen cites establishes Usutu virus-caused mortality in blackbirds in Italy as early as 1996, information that ProMED-mail has not posted previously. - Mod.TY
