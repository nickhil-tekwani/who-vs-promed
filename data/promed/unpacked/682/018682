The CDC (US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) said Wed 26 Sep
2007 that 21 people in 8 states may have fallen ill after eating
hamburgers possibly contaminated with _E. coli_ [O157] bacteria. CDC
spokeswoman Lola Russell said 3 cases, 2 in New York and one in
Florida, are confirmed as being linked to the ground beef, with the
other 18 cases possibly linked and under investigation. No one has
died, but Russell said she had no additional information on the cases.
Elizabeth, NJ-based Topps Meat Company announced a recall Tue 25 Sep
2007, for boxes of frozen hamburgers it distributed. The recall
affects 331 582 pounds of frozen beef patties and 21 products that
were distributed nationwide, the USDA (US Department of Agriculture)
and Topps said.
Russell and USDA spokeswoman Amanda Eamich said the illnesses were
reported in Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Maine, New Jersey, New
York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In Florida, the parents of a
15-year-old Fort Lauderdale girl alleges she suffered kidney failure
in August 2007 after eating a Topps hamburger patty tainted with _E.
coli_ that her mother bought at Wal-Mart.
Topps spokeswoman Cortney McMahon said officials continue working to
find the cause of the contamination. "That investigation is still
ongoing," McMahon said. "Topps is going to fully cooperate with the USDA."
Health officials found contaminated burgers in one New York victim's
home freezer. The boxes recalled carry the number "Est. 9748" inside
the USDA mark of inspection. The company, the leading American
manufacturer of frozen hamburgers, said this was its 1st recall in
its 65-year history.
New Jersey Health Department spokesman Tom Slater said the state has
4 suspected cases. Slater urged consumers to return the product to
the store and immediately call their doctor if they ate the
hamburgers and feel symptoms similar to stomach flu.

[Not surprisingly, the number of cases of _E. coli_ O157 disease is
increasing in number and location. Essentially all of these were
preventable, independent of the contamination, by appropriate kitchen
hygiene and cooking techniques. - Mod.LL]
