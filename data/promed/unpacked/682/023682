Foot-and-mouth near Khabarovsk spreads
-----------------------------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has been registered in 2 districts of the
Khabarovsk Territory, the Emergency Situations Ministry press-service has
told Itar-Tass.
According to the source, 105 head of cattle have been affected in the
Dobrolyubovo village, Bikin district, and another 17 in the village of
Vidnoye. In both cases, the Asia-1 strain is to blame.
"A special group of the Emergency Situations Ministry department for the
Khabarovsk Territory and specialists from the national animal protection
center are dealing with the situation in the crisis area," the
press-service said.
3 disinfection cordons and extra traffic police posts have been placed on
nearby roads to keep strangers away from the contaminated areas.
The authorities of the Khabarovsk Territory have held an emergency
conference to discuss the situation.

[2 FMD serotypes are, reportedly, evolving now in eastern Asia/the far
east: type Asia 1 in Russia's Amur region (Khabarovsk province); type A in
eastern Mongolia's Dornod province. They are more than 1000 miles apart;
both share borders with the People's Republic of China. - Mod.AS]
