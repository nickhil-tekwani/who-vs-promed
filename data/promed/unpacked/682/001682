OESTERSUND, Sweden: European Union agriculture ministers said they would
not drop their defenses against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), despite
tentative optimism the epidemic may be defeated outside Britain and the
Netherlands. "We have to stay very alert," said Belgium's minister, Jaak
Gabriels. "It's still spreading everyday in Britain so it's not the moment
to relax."
The EU's top public health official told the ministers he was hopeful the
FMD outbreak would not spread beyond the 4 EU countries so far infected,
and 2 of those -- France and Ireland -- appeared to have the disease under
control.
"In all other member states, there are grounds to consider they have
succeeded in avoiding any outbreak," EU Health Commissioner David Byrne
told ministers on the final session of a 3-day meeting in northern Sweden.
With no new cases in France or Ireland for almost 3 weeks, Byrne said the
EU was preparing to lift restrictions Thursday on French exports of
livestock, meat, and dairy goods, and those on Ireland on 19 Apr. "We
cannot rule out the risk completely; there are almost 1200 cases just
across the Channel in Britain," said French Agriculture Minister Jean
Glavany. But after just 2 cases in France, he added, "We think the outbreak
is under control."
There was even a glimmer of hope for Britain. In a message to the ministers
published in Sweden's Dagens Nyheter newspaper, Prime Minister Tony Blair
said his government's policy of slaughtering animals to isolate the virus
was beginning to pay off. "There are signs that these efforts, however
painful, have contributed to slowing down the spread of the disease," Blair
wrote. "But it is too early to say with some confidence that the worst is
over."
Ministers in Sweden were split over whether to reverse the EU's decade-old
ban on FMD vaccinations to prevent future outbreaks. Germany and the
Netherlands argued for reconsidering the ban, while Ireland, Spain, and
Nordic nations say it should stay. Vaccination would damage trade. Many
nations ban imports from countries that vaccinate because inoculated
animals are almost impossible to tell apart from livestock infected with
the virus. Byrne said the potential costs of the disease were rising. He
calculated compensation payments to farmers and other costs could wipe $224
million off the EU's budget, up from last week's estimate of $152 million.
