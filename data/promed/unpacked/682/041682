[Both WPV1 and cVDPV2 cases continue to occur; 2019 has not been a good year for the eradication effort. To highlight again what has been transpiring, the global total of WPV1-associated paralytic disease with dates of onset during 2019 to date is now at 107, compared with 27 for the same time period in 2018, and the global total of cVDPV-associated paralytic disease with dates of onset during 2019 is now at 157 compared with 104 for the same time period in 2018.

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 23 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

The Philippines reported on Wednesday [20 Nov 2019] 3 more confirmed polio cases in the southern Philippines, bringing the total cases to 7 since the outbreak in September [2019].

Health undersecretary Rolando Enrique Domingo said the new cases include a 2-year-old girl from Maguindanao province, a one-year-old boy from Cotabato City, and a 4-year-old girl from Cotabato province.

Domingo said they are looking at the water supply as the possible source of infection, as polio virus is spread through the oral-fecal [fecal-oral - Mod.MPP] route.

"It is unacceptable that more children are falling victim to this vaccine-preventable disease," health secretary Francisco Duque said, adding that the Department of Health is "more determined than ever" to make sure that no child shall be missed during the next round of polio vaccination in Metro Manila and Mindanao.

On [25 Nov 2019], the government will start another round of door-to-door vaccination activity in Metro Manila and the entire Mindanao in the southern Philippines. This will be expanded to the rest of the country next year [2020].

"We are reiterating to all parents and caregivers to have their 0-59-month-old children immunized with the polio vaccine from [25 Nov 2019] to [7 Dec 2019]," Duque added.

Duque said polio is best prevented through vaccination. Proper hygiene like hand washing will also help in the prevention, he added.

On [19 Sep 2019], the Philippines declared a polio outbreak after the infectious disease reappeared 19 years after the country was declared polio-free by the World Health Organization in 2000.

Four polio cases have been reported previously: a 3-year-old girl from Lanao del Sur province, a 4-year-old girl from Maguindanao province, and a 3-year-old girl from Sultan Kudarat province, all in southern Philippines, and a 5-year-old boy from Laguna province. [One of these 4 cases was classified as an iVDPV -- immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived poliovirus and not due to a cVDPV -- hence the apparent discrepancy in numbers. - Mod.MPP]

Polio is an infectious disease that spreads rapidly. It can cause paralysis and, on rare occasions, can be fatal. There is no cure for polio. However, it can only be prevented with multiple doses of polio vaccine, which have long been proven safe and effective.

Polio is spread when the stool of an infected person is introduced into the mouth of another person through contaminated water or food.

["Routine immunization (RI) is the sustainable, reliable and timely interaction between the vaccine, those who deliver it, and those who receive it to ensure every person is fully immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases.

Strengthening routine immunization is one of the pillars of the polio eradication strategy. In polio-endemic countries, the virus persists in marginalised populations and where health and immunization services are largely non-existent and oversight and management are weak.

However, the poliovirus cannot survive for long periods outside of the human body. Without an unvaccinated person to infect, the polio virus will die out. Strong routine immunization helps to facilitate the interruption of all poliovirus transmission and protect populations from a re-infection.

Strengthening routine immunization involves:
- Maximising the reach of quality vaccines through a well-functioning supply and cold chain system, improving equity, detecting unreached groups, efficient service delivery, and the capacity building of vaccinators and supervisors;
- Managing programmes with strong political and management support, effective planning, as well as policy and strategy development;
- Mobilising people to generate demand through community and caretaker engagement; and
- Monitoring programme performance with rigorous disease surveillance, data analysis, and evaluation."

These 3 additional cases are all from the southern provinces. In another media report there is mention of an additional 1-2 suspected cases currently under investigation (see https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/11/22/1970907/more-possible-polio-cases-being-monitored).
