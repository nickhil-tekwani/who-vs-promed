NSW pigs catch swine flu
------------------------
Tests have confirmed that swine flu has broken out at a piggery in
the central west of New South Wales (NSW). It is the 1st case of the
virus among pigs in Australia and the State Government believes the
animals probably caught the disease from workers at the piggery.

A total of 280 pigs have been placed in quarantine and strict
biosecurity measures are in place to try to contain the spread of the virus.

NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald says the piggery's
owner and staff have previously suffered flu-like symptoms and are
being tested for swine flu by the health department. Mr Macdonald
says the outbreak poses no threat to humans.

Australia reports its 1st H1N1 case on pig farm 31 Jul 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------
The novel influenza A virus (H1N1) has been found in a pig herd in
New South Wales, Australia, as a result of human-to-pig transmission.

In a press release, Australian Pork Limited (APL) CEO Andrew Spencer
said, "This isolated incident is now being handled in accordance with
exotic disease response procedures under the supervision of New South
Wales Department of Primary Industries, with the health and well
being of the animals of paramount concern. We expect the animals
affected to fully recover."

As to the spread of the disease, Spencer said, "The influenza A/H1N1
(2009) virus has spread rapidly across Australia through
person-to-person transmission and is affecting thousands of people."

"Though it is unfortunate that the virus has been detected in some
pigs on just one farm, consumers have absolutely nothing to be
concerned about," he said, quoting e.g. statements by the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

After reported cases in Alberta and Quebec provinces (Canada) and
Buenos Aires province (Argentina), this is the 4th occasion the
disease is reported in pigs -- the 1st time outside of the Americas.

Spencer emphasized that Australia is a world leader in on-farm
biosecurity and said producers were expected to maintain their normal
strict biosecurity measures and monitor their animals and staff, and
that eradication of the disease at the single affected farm was now
the objective.

[These 2 articles are completely different. In the 1st article: "Mr
Macdonald says the outbreak poses no threat to humans" is not clear.
Does he mean the virus as an overall, because it certainly has
affected humans. Is he referring to only this incident on one
premises? Or is he referring to the virus is not a threat when the
pigs are consumed? This statement is not clear.

The 1st article also indicates the workers at the facility were ill,
thus providing a source of the virus. The 2nd article does not
include this information. However this article appears to offer some
information in that consumers (presumably those ingesting swine
products) have nothing to worry about. - Mod.TG]
