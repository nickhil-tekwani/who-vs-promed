Multiple cases of influenza B have been reported in middle school-aged children [10-14-year-olds] in the greater Annapolis [Maryland] area. It is unknown if any of the cases are co-infected with RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] which is also circulating widely in the area.

[After being declared nearly extinct during peak COVID-19 due to mask wearing and stay-at-home orders, influenza B is making a comeback. This is in conjunction with large regional increases in reports of influenza-like illness and/or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in the Virginia/Maryland area. It will be interesting to see whether this year's (2022) flu vaccine provides any protection against influenza B illness in particular. - Mod.JH

A Virginia high school will remain open even as hundreds of students continue to stay home because of flu-like illnesses.

Stafford High School, located in Fredericksburg, Virginia, had a "high number of student and staff illnesses" reported last week [week of 17 Oct 2022], prompting the school to shut down all activities and athletics scheduled from Friday through Sunday, the school said. The school, which has roughly 2100 students, saw 1000 student absences on Friday [21 Oct 2022]. On Monday, 670 students were absent, and on Tuesday, 526 students -- about a quarter of the student population -- continued to miss school, the district's chief communications officer Sandra Osborn told CBS News.

"All other schools remain within normal absence rates for this time of year," Osborn said. "We will continue monitoring the illnesses with the Rappahannock Area Health Department."

On Monday [24 Oct 2022], the school said the Virginia Department of Health recommended that the district's schools remain open and that mitigation measures continue.

"After consulting with our health department, all activities taking place among Stafford High School students may resume Tuesday," the school wrote on Facebook. "This includes activities such as after school homework or test makeup, clubs, and practices. Athletic practices among Stafford High School students may also resume Tuesday."

Athletic matches between schools, however, are still canceled on Tuesday to "minimize exposure to other schools."

The rampant illness has left some afraid to return to school.

"My daughter is one of the sick ones," one parent commented on the high school's Facebook page. "Honestly, she is scared to return."

The Rappahannock Area Health District said Monday that it's working with the school district to "investigate a potential disease outbreak" at the high school "after a large number of students called in sick and reported similar symptoms" on Thursday and Friday.

"Since that time, the school has reported that a number of students have tested positive for influenza A, and more are showing respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with the flu," the health district said.

The announcement came the same day that the state's Department of Health said this year's [2022] flu season is "showing concerning, early signs that it may be worse than in recent years."

"More people are seeking care in hospitals and urgent care centers for influenza-like illness than at this point in previous years, particularly young children aged 0-4 years," the department said. "Virginia health officials encourage everyone aged 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine this fall, with rare exception."

Outbreaks have been sweeping through schools in other parts of the country as well, with half the students out sick at a San Diego school earlier this month [October 2022].

Virginia State Health Commissioner Dr Colin M Greene urged people get vaccinated against the flu and to take preventative measures, including staying home when sick, using the elbow to cover the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and frequently washing hands.

The department also warned that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is also circulating throughout the state. RSV is common in children and cases typically surge from December to February, but this year [2022] hospitals in dozens of states are seeing a dramatic uptick.

"Emergency department and urgent care visits with diagnosed RSV have quadrupled and have been rapidly increasing in Virginia's syndromic surveillance system since early September," the department said. "RSV is common and usually causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people but can be very dangerous for young infants or those who are immunocompromised."

As per the influenza and respiratory pathogens report from the Centers for Disease Control (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm), with over 4.4% positive for influenza this week, and 8.8% of deaths attributable to influenza, pneumonia, and COVID-19 which is above the threshold levels.

"Influenza activity is increasing in most of the country. Regions 4 (southeast) and 6 (south-central) are reporting the highest levels of flu activity." As also highlighted in the report above, children including school-age children are being affected in large numbers. An annual flu vaccine is the best way to protect against the flu. Vaccination helps prevent infection and can also prevent serious outcomes in people who get vaccinated but may still get sick with the flu. The CDC recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October every year.

Similarly, the detection rates for the respiratory syncytial virus are also on the increase. Prior to 2020, seasonal patterns for RSV in the United States were very consistent. However, the patterns of circulation for RSV and other common respiratory viruses have been disrupted since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (see Respiratory syncytial virus - USA (03): seasonal infection patterns disrupted 20221027.8706398).

The situation calls for continuous surveillance and monitoring of trends of respiratory pathogens in the background of a protracted pandemic situation that is in its 3rd year now. - Mod.UBA]

Enterprise students are learning from home Tuesday and Wednesday [25-26 Oct 2022] due to a virus outbreak.

The district released a notice saying, "due to an outbreak of the flu virus that has greatly impacted our students (nearly 30%) and teachers, the Enterprise School District will conduct virtual learning."

"We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this may cause but want to be proactive in preventing an even larger outbreak within our district. We ask that you please wash and sanitize all classroom materials, including book bags, lunch boxes, etc."

Students will return to in-person learning Thursday [27 Oct 2022].

The district said the custodial staff is sanitizing all classrooms while the schools are closed.
