The NSW [New South Wales] Department of Primary Industries (DPI) has today [23 Dec 2016] quarantined a property near Casino following the death of 1 horse from Hendra virus.

DPI Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Christine Middlemiss said the property had been placed in quarantine by the Local Land Services district veterinarian and the dead horse was being buried.

"The 22-year-old horse died recently following a period of illness and receiving treatment from a private veterinarian," Dr Middlemiss said.

Samples from the horse were sent for laboratory analysis which confirmed the presence of Hendra virus.

Dr Middlemiss said staff from Local Land Services and NSW Health have been working with people who have handled the horse, including the property owners and the veterinarian.

The horse had been in a paddock in an area which has regular flying fox activity.

The case is the 1st Hendra case in NSW in 2016.

In a statement the NSW DPI said it encouraged horse owners to discuss a Hendra virus vaccination strategy with their veterinarian.

"Vaccination remains the most effective way of reducing the risk of Hendra virus infection in horses, but good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures should always be practiced in conjunction with it," Dr Middlemiss said.

"Horses should also be kept away from flowering and fruiting trees that are attractive to bats.

"Do not place feed and water under trees and cover feed and water containers with a shelter so they cannot be contaminated from above.

"If a horse becomes sick, owners should contact their veterinarian immediately. People in contact with horses need to practice good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures even if a horse is vaccinated against Hendra virus."

Horse owners and vets are encouraged to download the latest information on Hendra virus from <www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/animals-and-livestock/horses/health-and-disease/hendra-virus>.

[Hendra virus is a virus carried by flying foxes that inhabit Australia, Papua New Guinea, and surrounding islands. So far, clinical disease due to Hendra virus infection has only been recognised in Australia. Flying foxes appear to be unaffected by the virus.

Rarely, Hendra virus spreads from flying foxes to horses, (spillover events) causing severe disease, and may then spread to people or animals in close contact with infected horses.

Hendra virus can cause a range of symptoms in horses. Usually there is a sudden fever and either respiratory or neurological illness and rapid death. In some cases the onset of illness is gradual. But often the decline of the animal is rapid.

Other signs can include:
- laboured breathing
- frothy and/or blood stained nasal discharge
- a temperature (usually but not always higher than 40 degrees C)
- neurological changes, including tilting of the head, loss of vision, abnormal muscle twitching, weakness and loss of balance
- colic like discomfort.

Most cases in horses are fatal but occasionally a horse will survive the infection. The reported mortality rate in infected horses is greater than 70 percent.

If you have been in contact with an infected horse please seek medical attention immediately.

Symptoms typically develop between 5 and 21 days after contact with an infectious horse.

Fever, cough, sore throat, headache and tiredness are common initial symptoms. Meningitis or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) can then develop, causing headache, high fever, and drowsiness, convulsions and coma.

Hendra virus infection can be fatal.

There is no evidence of bat-to-human, human-to-human or human-to-horse spread of Hendra virus.

Horses can shed Hendra virus before they show any sign of illness. All horse handlers should protect themselves by routinely using good hygiene practices whenever handling horses.

Always cover any cuts or abrasions on exposed skin before handling your horse. Always wash your hands with soap and water, particularly after handling your horse's mouth or nose. Do not smoke, eat or touch your eyes, nose or mouth until you have washed your hands.

Remember that every time you put a bridle on or take it off you are likely to contact the horse's saliva.

Take care with hygiene and personal protection when handling sick horses. In particular, avoid contact with blood, other body fluids (especially respiratory and nasal secretions, saliva and urine) and tissues.

Ideally you should avoid all contact with suspect horses until a veterinarian has investigated and provided advice on the safe handling of affected horses.

Everyone handling or investigating a suspect case of Hendra virus should wear full protective clothing. The minimum standard is overalls, boots, gloves, respirator mask and eye protection. Follow the procedures outlined in the 'For Veterinarians' section of the Queensland DPI website.

Flying foxes are attracted to a wide range of flowering and fruiting trees and vegetation as a food source. Some examples of the trees and vegetation on NSW properties where Hendra virus in horses has occurred include:
- a range of fig trees (including the Moreton Bay fig tree)
- melaleucas (including paperbarks)
- eucalypts
- palms (including date palms)
- mulberries
- guava
- citrus trees.

Other trees that may attract flying foxes include flowering or soft fruiting trees, e.g. mangoes, pawpaws, cherries, bananas, apricots, peaches, palms, lilly-pillies and grevilleas.

Please note this is not an exhaustive list of trees that are attractive to flying foxes. This will vary with the geographical area and the season. Check your property (including the boundary fence) regularly to identify what trees are about to fruit or flower and make sure your horse is not accessing the area under these trees.

Signs that flying foxes are feeding include:
- tooth marks on fruit on or under the tree
- large compressed pieces of fruit skin and flesh on the ground under the tree (spats)
- broken twigs or shoots
- debris under the tree including: leaves, broken branches and partly eaten fruit or flowers
- fruit distributed up to 100 metres [about 330 feet] from the tree.

You can reduce the risk by taking care with both the type of trees you plant and how you set the trees out.

Trees that are safer include:
- Casuarinas (she oaks)
- conifer or cypress
- Brachychitons, e.g. flame trees, bottle trees and Kurrajongs
- bamboo
- Bougainvilleas
- jacarandas, olives, fiddlewoods, Tipuanas, and
- other deciduous or evergreen trees that don't flower or produce soft fruits.

Horses should not be placed in paddocks with dense tree planting that may attract roosting bats. Safer plantings for horse paddocks are single line plantings or shade trees spaced at least 50 metres [about 165 feet] apart.

It is not practicable to kill flying foxes because of the risk of Hendra virus infection to horses. Increasing stress levels in flying foxes by attempting to scare them off or eradicate them may increase shedding of the virus.

Flying foxes are protected native fauna in NSW. To enable better management of the risk of infection, research is underway to understand how the infection is maintained in flying fox populations and what factors are associated with the spread of the virus to horses.

It appears that the number of cases of Hendra virus is increasing.

The reason for this is not entirely clear, but it is possible that the destruction of bat habitat and food sources by cyclone Yasi and the widespread flooding in northern Queensland has driven northern bats south. These hungry bats may have been carrying Hendra virus, and stressed animals tend to shed more virus.

The northern bats have exposed bats further south to the virus that have not been previously exposed, and animals usually shed higher levels of virus when they are 1st infected.

If this theory is accurate, then as the newly exposed bats become immune, the level of viral shedding is likely to decrease.

Hendra virus is a very fragile virus. It may survive in the environment for several hours up to a couple of days outside of the animal host.

There is a proven vaccine and it should be used.

Hendra Virus Vaccine
--------------------
A Hendra virus vaccine for horses produced by a commercial manufacturer was released on 1 Nov 2012. Vaccination is the single most effective way of reducing the risk of Hendra virus infection in horses. Human infection and death have occurred following high-level exposure to body fluids from an infected horse. Vaccinating horses is an important measure to prevent this occurring and provides a public health and workplace health and safety benefit.

The vaccine has been released under special conditions and only veterinarians who have completed an online training module managed by the manufacturer will be accredited to order and administer the vaccine.
