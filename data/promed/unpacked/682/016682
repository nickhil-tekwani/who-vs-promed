[The following comments, pertaining to the issues indicated by
asterisk in the above 'OIE immediate notification', will be followed
by some remarks concerning BTV-8 in the Near East.

*1. The time gap between the start of the disease (21 Feb 2009) and
its laboratory confirmation (15 and 29 May 2009) is in need of
clarification. According to the data of the OIE Ref lab for
bluetongue at Pirbright, one "ovine" and one "sheep" blood samples,
collected respectively on 13 and 28 Apr 2009 in Sohar, Batnah coast
in the Arabian Gulf, Sultanate of Oman, were sent to Pirbright where
the virus was initially isolated in KC cells. See at
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins//ReoID/btv-8.htm#OMN2009/04_>.

*2. the time gap between the 1st confirmation of the event (15 May
2009) and the immediate notification date (16 Jun 2009) requires
clarification.

*3. Several BTV serotypes have been identified in the region,
including BTV-4 and 16. In 1991, BTV-3, 4 and 22 were reported from
Oman (see AL BUSAIDI (SM) & MELLOR (PS). Epidemiology of bluetongue
and related orbiviruses in the Sultanate of Oman. Epidemiol. Infect.
1991, 106: pp. 167-178. We wonder if BTV-1 and/or BTV-8 are indeed
"recurring" or rather new in Oman. In case the latter is correct, the
reason for this notification should have been "New strain of a listed
disease", similarly to all immediate notifications on the 1st cases
of BTV-8 in north and west Europe, including the most recent ones in
Greece and Israel.

*4. The following additional information is derived from the page
'Isolates of Bluetongue virus type 8 (BTV-8) in the dsRNA virus
collection at IAH Pirbright' on Pirbright's website: "Not all +ve
animals showed clinical signs of disease. Only Wiltshire sheep,
Arabian gazelles, fallow deer and blackbucks were affected. Only one
multi-horn sheep died, showing similar signs and post mortem changes,
but all of the other live animals sampled were -ve. The +ve Cattle,
buffalo, goats and reem gazelles showed no signs of disease. Strains
of BTV-1, BTV-4 and BTV-16 were also isolated in early 2009." From
the said data it appears that the affected population included
various exotic ruminant species ('reem gazelle' is _Gazella
subgutturosa marica_; picture at
<http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Images/Gazella_subgutturosa/G_subgutturosa2.jpg>).
More information on the holding (wildlife park? zoo? private animal
collection? otherwise?), the origin of the animals and their exact
species data will be much appreciated.

*5. Where from? More specific information will help. Genotyping of
the BTV-8 (and probably also BTV-1) isolates may allow tracing back
the origin of these introductions. It is worthwhile mentioning that
large numbers of live European cattle for slaughter are imported
annually to the Middle East -- primarily to Lebanon, which has become
Europe's main external customer. According to the latest FAOSTAT
detailed data available from Lebanon (2004), out of the total of 239
191 heads, imported during 2004 from 20 countries, 3 EU countries,
namely Germany, France and Spain combined, supplied 172 658 heads (72
percent) of the Lebanese demand. FAOSTAT information on the Lebanese
imports for the years 2005 and 2006 were 248 291 and 206 744 head,
respectively, but no data on their countries of origin were given.
According to information from unofficial sources, such as a 2005
report for the animal welfare association 'Compassion in World
Farming,' "the EU exports around 250 000 live cattle to 3rd countries
each year. Over 80 percent of these are slaughtered shortly after
reaching their destination. The majority of live cattle exported from
the EU for slaughter go to Lebanon." (see at
<http://www.ciwf.org.uk/resources/publications/live_transport_live_export/default.aspx>).
From a reliable source we noted that "it is known that approximately
20 percent of these cattle are not slaughtered directly," and that
"Some of them find their way to other regional countries; it is not a
flood but a steady trickle now." We also noted that in-calf cows are
not excluded from such consignments (2009 data). A recent (1st
quarter of 2009) report mentioned Lebanon and Algeria as destinations
for French bovine males for slaughter. It will be interesting to note
which measures are required, and subsequently applied, to preclude
the inclusion of potentially BTV-infected animals in such
consignments.

*6. It is not clear which animals are to be vaccinated, which
serotypes are to be included, and whether live-attenuated or
inactivated vaccines are to be applied. Inactivated vaccines are
commercially available only against a limited selection of serotypes.

Finally, it will be interesting to note if suspected introductions of
BTV-8 (and BTV-1?) may have been observed in other countries within
the Eastern Mediterranean basin and the Near East. It will surprise
if Greece (Lesvos, off the Turkish mainland), Israel (Rosh Haniqra,
on the Lebanese border) and Oman are factually solitarily infected. -
