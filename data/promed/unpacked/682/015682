Chinese officials report a human H9N2 avian influenza case in a 4-year-old girl from Guangdong province. The child was hospitalized in August 2020 with mild symptoms and has fully recovered.

The investigation into the case shows the girl had contact with domestic poultry. No further cases were confirmed among the contacts of this case.

The last case of H9N2 avian influenza was reported in May 2020. In 2020, 6 cases have been reported, all from China.

Since 1998, 67 total cases have been reported from 7 countries. In most human cases of H9N2 avian flu, the associated disease symptoms have been mild, and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.

[H9N2 viruses are avian influenza viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAIV, "low pathogenic avian influenza virus"), a subtype found worldwide in wild birds while becoming endemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa.

Human H9N2 infections are generally mild, and there has only been a single reported death due to the virus (a 57-year-old woman with underlying conditions, Sichuan, China, 2016; https://tinyurl.com/wj3cmqc). Human H9N2 cases are more often isolated during periods when other HPAI viruses are being surveyed for, such as H7N9 in China and H5N1 in Egypt and Bangladesh. As of June 2019, there have been a total of 59 laboratory confirmed human H9N2 infections with over half of those being recorded since 2015. The majority of those with confirmed infections were young children, and the median age of infection was 4 years (https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/7/620/htm).

Recent evidence suggests LPAI H9N2 could potentially have a role in the emergence of the next influenza pandemic, either directly as an H9N2 subtype virus, or through the donation of internal genes to a pandemic virus [Peacock, T., James, J., Sealy, J. E. and Iqbal, M. (2019). A Global Perspective on H9N2 Avian Influenza Virus. Viruses, 11(7), 620. https://doi.org/10.3390/v11070620].

WHO guidelines, entitled "Protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases," are available at https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/275657/WHO-WHE-IHM-GIP-2018.2-eng.pdf.

It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people be fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories. - Mod.UBA
