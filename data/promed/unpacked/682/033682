[1] Lancet paper confirms poultry as source of H7N9

H7N9 bird flu: Lancet blames poultry
------------------------------------
Chinese researchers have reportedly confirmed poultry as a source of H7N9 flu among humans but say they found no evidence of person-to-person transmission.

A probe into 4 cases of human H7N9 influenza in eastern Zhejiang province has determined all the patients were exposed to poultry, either through their occupation or visiting so-called wet poultry markets.

The World Health Organization had previously said poultry were the likely source of the virus, which has been linked to at least 22 deaths out of 108 identified cases since February [2013].

A team led by Lanjuan Li of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou and Kwok-Yung Yuen of the University of Hong Kong took rectal swaps from 20 chickens, 4 quails, 5 pigeons, and 57 ducks all from 6 live poultry markets likely to have been visited by the patients. Their findings have been reported in the general medical journal, The Lancet. Two of the pigeons and 4 of the chickens tested positive for H7N9 but the virus was not found in any of the ducks or quails.

The researchers analysed the genetic makeup of H7N9 found in one of the patients and compared it to a sample found in one of the infected chickens. The similarities "suggest that it is being transmitted sporadically from poultry to humans," The Lancet said. "This is the 1st time that definite bird-to-human transmission has been shown for the H7N9 virus."

Doctors also monitored 303 other people who were relatives or co-workers of the patients, as well as 82 health care workers. "Nobody else who came into contact with the H7N9-infected patients began to show any symptoms within 14 days from the beginning of surveillance, suggesting that the virus is not currently able to transmit between human beings," the journal said.

However, further adaptation of the virus could lead to infections with less severe symptoms and "more efficient person-to-person transmission," the researchers cautioned.

[2] Impact on tourism

The arrival of the H7N9 bird flu has affected China's tourism industry, with tourists shunning wetlands and farms while restaurants eliminate chicken and duck from their menus.

More than 120 human H7N9 infections, including 23 fatal cases, have been reported in China thus far, raising concerns about a possible lull in domestic tourism that occurred during the SARS epidemic a decade ago.

The 3-day May Day holiday begins on 29 Apr 2013, with many urban Chinese travelling around the country for short trips.

Tour agencies in Shanghai said local "agritainment" farms have been hiding their fowl in order to quell concerns about the virus. H7N9 cases have been reported in the eastern city, as well as nearby provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui that are favored by holiday makers in Shanghai.

"All free-ranging fowl have been penned," said Chen Zhennian, manager of a Shanghai-based tour agency. Tourists used to enjoy the sight of roaming birds in farm-style hotels but now fear their presence, he said.

Other farms have canceled activities that could expose tourists to live poultry, while rural restaurants have eliminated chicken and duck dishes, according to Chen.

H7N9 cannot be acquired by eating chicken or duck, as the virus is killed by high temperatures when the meat is cooked thoroughly.

According to a nationwide survey of tourist agencies conducted by Hongyuan Securities, group tour packages in east China that were hit hardest by the bird flu have not seen a drop in price, although wetland visits have been removed from the agencies' recommendation lists.

In Shanghai, where more than 30 H7N9 cases have been confirmed, train stations are gearing up for an influx of tourists and shopping malls have put up discount flyers to attract non-local shoppers.

A Shanghai resident said the bird flu did not affect her family's plans to travel to south China's Hainan Province, a popular vacation destination. "The only difference is that we will not eat the famous Hainan chicken rice this time," she said.

Business observers said that although the virus may deal a blow to agritainment farms and wetlands, its impact on general tourism will be limited.

Chen Yiting, a tour guide from the city of Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu Province, said tourists have spurned the city's famous salted duck.

"Their reaction is understandable and has not caused trouble for our business," Chen said. "This is very different from the SARS panic in 2003, when I guided almost no tourists for half a year."

------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Dozens of human cases infected with H7N9 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) have been confirmed in China since March 2013. Distribution data of sexes, ages, professions and regions of the cases were analyzed in this report. The results showed that the elderly cases, especially the male elderly, were significantly more than expected, which is different from human cases of H5N1 avian influenza and human cases of the pandemic H1N1 influenza. The outbreak was rated as a Grade III (severe) outbreak, and it would evolve into a Grade IV (very severe) outbreak soon, using a method reported previously. The H7N9 AIV will probably circulate in humans, birds and pigs for years. Moreover, with the driving force of natural selection, the virus will probably evolve into highly pathogenic AIV in birds, and into a deadly pandemic influenza virus in humans. Therefore, the H7N9 outbreak has been assumed severe, and it is likely to become very or extremely severe in the future, highlighting the emergent need of forceful scientific measures to eliminate any infected animal flocks. We also described 2 possible mild scenarios of the future evolution of the outbreak.

[The Chinese Science Bulletin is co-sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. "Its primary mission is to encourage communication of novel and significant research results across the fields that comprise the natural sciences. The journal offers readable articles that have immediate and far-reaching implications to a broader audience. Sections include articles; news & views; progress; reviews; frontiers; brief communications; forum; correspondence; trends and book reviews."

The paper above was received by the bulletin on 11 Apr 2013 and accepted on 23 Apr 2013, published under "Progress" (virology). 10 of its 11 authors are workers of the China National Avian Influenza Professional Laboratory, China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, Qingdao.

The following animal-health related statements are included in the paper:

1. The confirmed human cases and the confirmed bird infections were likely only a small portion of the reality, according to the iceberg phenomenon principle in epidemiology.

2. Beyond that the virus can infect humans and birds, we think that the virus can also infect pigs, which support circulation of both AIVs and human influenza viruses. In addition, it cannot exclude that the virus will not circulate in horse flocks after it has accumulated some mutations if it will circulate widely in the nature, as H7 subtype influenza virus had widely circulated in horses in the world for decades of the last century.

3. It is difficult to identify the humans, birds, or pigs infected with the H7N9 virus from clinical signs, and it is extremely tough to conduct large-scale detection or surveillance to identify the virus infections in humans, birds, or pigs for a long period.

4. Since the virus has spread widely, and it can infect humans, birds, and pigs, and it is difficult to identify infected humans, birds, and pigs, we think it is extremely difficult to eliminate the virus in China, and infections with the virus in humans, birds, and pigs will continue for a long period, possibly for more than 10 years.

5. Due to the great populations of birds and pigs raised in China, low-level biosecurity of many live bird markets, low-level biosecurity of many small-scale poultry and swine farms in China, the frequent transportation of live birds and live pigs, and rapid transmission of the virus in the hosts it has adapted to, the virus will likely spread rapidly to other regions. It may be possible for the virus to spread to other countries via wild bird migration, and at least one wild bird infected with the virus has been found in Jiangsu province.

6. Considering the previous circulation history of H7 subtype in some countries, the novel H7N9 virus may mutate into highly pathogenic AIV during its future probable long circulation in birds, which will be as disastrous as H5N1 highly pathogenic AIV having been circulating in many countries for years.

One of the authors' main concluding remarks is:
"Forceful scientific measures, such as massive replacement of traditional live bird markets with modern low-cost sanitary electronic live bird markets far away from residential areas, will be useful not only in the control of the H7N9 outbreak, but also in the control of many other infectious diseases".
