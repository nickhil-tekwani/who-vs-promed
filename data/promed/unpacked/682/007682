Of the 3 cases of hemorrhagic fever deaths in Divinópolis which were tested, 2 were confirmed [for which disease?]. The information was issued by the Secretary of Health, Amarildo de Sousa, this [Wed 8 Aug 2018].

The Health Secretariat (SEMUSA) announced in a collective interview, that entry into the Parque da ilha, in the Niterói neighborhood is restricted for an undetermined period of time. This measure was taken after confirmation of the deaths of 2 people who frequented this locality days before they presented with symptoms of the disease. The death of a 3rd person under the same circumstances is still under investigation. [What disease? What signs? - Mod.RNA]

The Secretary stated that the municipality took a series of measures to deal with the disease, such as cleanup of the Parque da ilha and other areas considered at risk, and informative campaigns about the situation.

"Even with the restriction of some areas considered to be at risk, such as trails in the middle of a forest, people were circulating through these sites and even ripping off the signs placed in those spaces. So we had to restrict access to the park," added Sousa. From this [Wed 8 Aug 2018] the gates of the park will be locked. According to SEMUSA, only the entrance of employees to the place will be permitted.

"Despite reports that the victims have been to the park, people should be aware in other parts of the city. All people who frequent sites, around the Itapecerica River, should remain alert and attentive to the precautions. Always check the body after the walks," [for what? - Mod.TY] said the secretary.

School
------
The Divinópolis Secretary of Education, Vera Prado, said to the MGTV team that the students of the Carcy Ribero Municipal School, which is near the park, do not go to the park and that the playground at the school was closed as a precaution.

According to the secretary, the school underwent last week an internal insecticide treatment and an external one is scheduled for next [Sat 11 Aug 2018]. Asked about a possible cancellation of classes or about transferring students to another school, the City Hall stated that it will keep classes per normal and that the tick can be found anywhere. They added that he time is of caution not to create panic or trigger excessive actions.

Task force
----------
In the face of the situation, the prefecture appointed a task force to deal with the matter. The group is made up of representatives from several secretariats that visit homes and schools, especially at points considered to be at risk, to alert the population.

Understanding the case
----------------------
The 1st confirmed case of the disease was a 24-year-old young woman. She died on [30 Jun 2018] after admission to the São João Hospital with body pain and high fever.

The 2nd case is an 81-year-old person who died on [23 Jun 2018]. He was hospitalized in the Santa Mônica Hospital with high fever and body pain. He was later taken to the intensive care unit but died.

The 3rd case, still under investigation, is a 63-year-old person who died on [6 Aug 2018] after presenting with all the symptoms of the disease. The victim was sent to the hospital, but underwent a rapid deterioration of the clinical picture [what was the presented clinical picture? - Mod.RNA]. Blood samples of the victim are being tested at the Ezequiel Dias Foundation in Belo Horizonte.

[As always, information about person-time-place is scarce.

Hemorrhagic fever is not a disease; it is a clinical syndrome initially designed to include viral haemorrhagic fevers by flaviviruses, filoviruses, arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses. With the widening of the syndromic approach with surveillance for acute hemorrhagic (ictero) syndromes, the use of the term, with the inclusion of rickettsial diseases, severe malaria, sepsis (such as meningococcemia), etc., as differential diagnoses of hemorrhagic fevers has frequently become a concern.

About the cases above, additional information would be welcome. Are there any links between cases? Was there exposure to vectors (including ticks) or environments with presence of vertebrate hosts (rodents in general, horses)? Have there been trips to areas with forest, pasture, water collections? Were they vaccinated against yellow fever? Were there jaundice, renal insufficiency, respiratory manifestations, hemodynamic changes, and/or shock?

Other possible agents include spotted fever, yellow fever, leptospirosis, severe dengue fever, hantavirosis; the list can be long. Clinical, epidemiological and laboratory information are essential to consider more or less probable hypotheses.

Additional information is necessary and would be welcome. - Mod.RNA]

[The implication in the report above is that arthropods are transmitting the pathogen involved in these cases, but no information is provided to substantiate that, as Mod.RNA mentioned. Sabiá virus, the etiological agent of Brazilian hemorrhagic fever, could be added to the list of potential pathogens. However, no mention is made of rodents that are the suspected hosts of the virus. Sabiá virus (Brazilian hemorrhagic fever) was first reported in São Paulo in 1990.
