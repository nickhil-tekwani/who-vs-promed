Viet Nam: Tough Measures Intensified against Avian Influenza Epidemic
--------------------------------------------------
The National Steering Board for Avian influenza Prevention and Control on
Thursday sent an urgent telegram to Provincial People's Committees and
relevant ministries and agencies regarding [control] measures against the
avian influenza epidemic. The telegram said that it is essential to promote
dissemination [of information] work to raise basic knowledge and public
awareness of the dangers of the fatal disease. During the past months,
thanks to effective measures and joint efforts by local authorities and
relevant ministries and agencies, the epidemic has been partly kept under
control. However, avian influenza outbreaks have still been reported in
some localities, and the number of H5N1 avian influenza patients remains high.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has warned that risks from H5N1 avian
influenza remain high. From 1 to 30 Apr 2005, the ministry [is launching] a
hygiene campaign nationwide to stamp out the avian influenza epidemic.
Doctor Trinh Quan Huan, head of the Ministry of Health's Department for
Preventative Medicine and HIV/AIDS Control, said that there are as many as
33 cases that have tested positive for the H5N1 virus in 16 cities and
provinces across the country so far in 2005, including 15 deaths. During
the past 2 weeks, an additional eight people were reported to be infected
with H5N1 virus, including 5 cases in Hai Phong, Doctor Huan noted.

Bush Authorizes Use of Quarantine Powers in Cases of Bird Flu
-------------------------------
President Bush signed an executive order on Friday authorizing the
government to impose a quarantine to deal with any outbreak of a
particularly lethal variation of influenza now found in Southeast Asia.
The order is intended to deal with a type of influenza commonly referred to
as bird flu. Since January 2004, an estimated 69 people, primarily in
Vietnam, have contracted the disease. But Dr. Keiji Fukuda, a flu expert at
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, has said
he suspects there are more cases.
The fatality rate among those reported to have contracted the disease is
about 70 percent.
Health officials around the world are trying to monitor the virus because
some flu pandemics are thought to have begun with birds.
Mr. Bush's order added pandemic influenza to the government's list of
communicable diseases for which a quarantine is authorized. It gives the
government authority to detain or isolate a passenger arriving in the
United States to prevent an infection from spreading.
The authority would be used only if the passenger posed a threat to public
health and refused to cooperate with a voluntary request, the Department of
Health and Human Services said.
The quarantine list was amended in 2003 to include SARS, or severe acute
respiratory syndrome, which killed nearly 800 people in 2003. Other
diseases on the list are cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis,
plague, smallpox, yellow fever and viral hemorrhagic fevers.
Quarantine and isolation were last used during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
The last large-scale quarantine was during the Spanish flu pandemic of
1918-19, though there have been lesser quarantines -- for instance,
travelers coming off airliners or cruise ships who have been exposed to
curable diseases.
Jennifer Morcone, a spokeswoman for the health centers, said Mr. Bush's
executive order was intended to prepare for all options. The Public Health
Service, Ms. Morcone said, would typically recommend voluntary home
quarantine when possible. In general, the government defers to state and
local authorities in their use of quarantine powers and would work with
them in case of an outbreak, she said.
