YELLOW MOTTLE, RICE - UGANDA: UPDATE

Since its start in 2004, the Upland Rice (Nerica) Project has
increased rice farming in Uganda from 4000 farmers to more than 35
000 in 2007. However, rice yields have been affected by the
[increasing spread of] rice [yellow] mottle virus, causing panic to
farmers and agricultural researchers. After discovering that wild
rice that naturally grows in lakes and rivers has resistance to the
virus, researchers are working on transferring the genes of wild rice
to locally produced rice [varieties] to improve production.

According to Fred Mukisa, Minister for Fisheries, they have gathered
different wild rice lines from various locations for conservation in
research gardens because they are facing extinction. John Wasswa
Mulumba, National Generic Centre, said the major reasons for the near
extinction are "overgrazing, cultivation and construction." They are
also collecting breeds [of cultivated rice] from various locations
for conservation, documentation, and utilization towards crop improvement.

[Yellow mottle disease of rice is caused by _Rice yellow mottle
virus_ (RYMV; genus _Sobemovirus_, not yet assigned to family or
order) and was originally confined to one district of Kenya. However,
large-scale rice irrigation projects lead to build up and wide
dissemination of the virus and its vectors in sub-Saharan Africa.
Yield losses of up to 100 percent have been reported. In Uganda, the
virus was 1st confirmed in 2006.

Besides rice, RYMV also affects a number of other grass species.
Symptoms include stunting, reduced tillering, mottling and yellowish
streaking of the leaves, delayed flowering or incomplete emergence of
the panicles and, in extreme cases, death of plants. RYMV is spread
by a number of insect vectors, mainly by several leaf beetle species
(_Chrysomelidae_; for example _Chaetocnema pulla_). It does not
appear to be seed transmitted in rice, but it can be spread by
mechanical means, which is thought to account for much of its spread
in the field (RYMV often increases after switch of cultivation
methods from direct seeding to transplanting of seedlings). The virus
survives in crop residues, and volunteer rice and grassy weeds serve
as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes cultural
practices as well as control of vectors and reservoir hosts.

RYMV is highly variable, and different strains may have different
levels of virulence. Consequently, specific resistance breeding
programmes for local virus strains and local rice varieties are
needed. While highly competitive annual and perennial wild rice
species are considered an important constraint to rice production in
the region, their elimination would result in serious loss of rice
genetic diversity including potential sources of genetic resistance
to RYMV and other pathogens. The preservation of wild relatives of
rice for research purposes, as reported above, is an important
prerequisite for the success of future breeding programmes.
