A mysterious disease has killed 50 head of cattle in the past week,
spreading panic among farmers in the agrarian belts of Kendrapara
district.
According to reports reaching here today, more than 500 cattle,
including 150 calves, across the district, are afflicted by the
disease.
The animals' throats are swollen and the affected cattle have become
immobile. More than 50 cattle have so far died due to the disease,
mainly in Mahakalpada, Derabish, Rajkanika and the Aul blocks. The
worst-hit pocket, which alone accounted for 13 deaths, was Balipala
village in Mahakalpada.
Farmers rued that not a single veterinary surgeon had visited the
affected sites so far and they are worried that the disease would
assume the proportion of an epidemic.
District animal husbandry department officials were not available for
comment. Farmers fear that it might be the deadly foot and mouth
disease.
