A 58 year old man in New Mexico was recently treated for bubonic
plague, the 1st case of the disease to surface in 2011.

Health officials in Santa Fe said the unidentified man spent a week
in the hospital after suffering high fever, intense pain in his
stomach and groin, and swollen lymph nodes. He was treated and
released, but officials would not say when. The results of blood tests
released Thu 5 May 2011, confirmed the man had bubonic plague,
officials said.

Doctors said the man was most likely bitten by a flea carrying the
plague bacteria, the most common method of transmission to humans.
Ratborne fleas can carry the bacterium, and humans can also catch the
disease from contact with infected rodents or animals.

"He was probably bitten by a flea somewhere on his left leg,"
Department of Health veterinarian Paul Ettestad told the Santa Fe New
Mexican. Officials wouldn't say where the man lived, but said they
would check his home for rats and rodent burrows and alert his
neighbors, the paper said.

Only about 10 to 15 people in the USA catch the illness each year,
typically in western states. It is particularly prevalent in New
Mexico because the state has a high population of both rodents and
fleas.

It can be treated with antibiotics, but 1 in 7 cases is fatal. The
last reported outbreaks of plague in New Mexico were in 2009, when 3
people, including an 8 year old in Santa Fe, died.

[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in the USA occur in the
"Four Corners" states of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah and
no cases have ever been acquired along the east coast of the country.

In New Mexico, 262 cases have been reported from 1949 to 2010
(http://www.health.state.nm.us/erd/HealthData/documents/HumanPlagueinNMbyCounty1949-2010.pdf),
the cases are concentrated in the counties in the north western part
of the state as can be seen in the URL above. Santa Fe county, where
this case arose, reported the most cases, which may in part be related
to a higher population. - Mod.LL

The Four Corners region of the US (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and
Utah) can be seen on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
