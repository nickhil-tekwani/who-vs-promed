Czech Republic: Tick-borne encephalitis incidence rising steeply
-----------------------------------------------
The number of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases has increased by 70
percent in the Czech Republic this year [2006], compared to 2005, according
to data from the State Health Institute (SZU) released to CTK [Czech News
Agency]. Since the beginning of 2008 [2006?], 890 people have become
infected with TBE, which is the highest TBE incidence in the past 10 years.
Last year [2005], 538 cases were reported during the 1st 44 weeks.
According to the National Reference Laboratory, the steep rise in TBE was
partially caused by the extremely hot summer, with a number of tropic
[tropical?] days and consequently a high number of infected ticks.
Moreover, only 10 percent of inhabitants of the 10-million Czech Republic
have been vaccinated against TBE.
The highest TBE incidence in the country is in South Bohemia, where 155
cases have been reported this year [2006], in Vysocina (106 cases),
situated in south Bohemia and Moravia, and in central Bohemia (105 cases).
Compared to the previous years, the lowest number of TBE cases -- 303 --
was reported in 1998, while the highest incidence of 566 cases was in 2000.
The highest [proportion] of TBE-infected people this year [2006] are aged
55 to 64 (186 cases) followed by those aged 45-54 (162 cases). The lowest
incidence is among children under 4 years (10 cases). The steepest rise in
the TBE incidence was monitored among children aged 5 to 9 years and people
over 75.
According to experts, a broadly applied vaccination [program] could
considerably lower the TBE [incidence] in the Czech Republic. Citizens in
neighboring Austria were vaccinated against TBE free of charge, and, since
then, the incidence of this serious disease afflicting the neural system
has dropped by 80 percent. Czech health insurers cover only part of the
vaccination costs in the case of children and juveniles under 19 years.

[The following comment has been extracted from notes contributed by Martin
Haditsch MD, PhD, <martin.haditsch@travel-clinic.at> to an earlier report
in ProMED-mail concerning the incidence of TBE in the Czech Republic (see
below). "One very important reason for the increase of tick-borne
encephalitis (TBE) infections is the change of leisure time activities:
ticks are attracted by butter acid, for example, in human sweat. Ticks are
not limited to woodland areas; lying on the ground, going through high
grass, even sitting in the garden or in parks in endemic areas may be a
substantial risk. The manifestation rate of clinical disease will not
exceed 1:100, the severity of TBE (as in some other diseases) is
age-dependent, and the presentation, especially in children, may not be as
the classical "meningo-encephalitis." We must, therefore, consider
underreporting and erroneous estimations of transmission rates [as relevant
factors]."
The weather during 2006 has been exceptionally benign across northern
Europe and central Asia, and an increased incidence of TBE and tick
infestations have been reported across the northern hemisphere in countries
where vaccination is not deployed comprehensively.
