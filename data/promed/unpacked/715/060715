A 2nd cat in Oregon has died after becoming infected with the H1N1
pandemic flu virus. The cat's owner presented the 8 year-old spayed
female to an emergency veterinary clinic on 24 Nov 2009, complaining
that the cat was suffering from severe weakness and pain. The cat was
described as "hypothermic and dehydrated", and had excessive nasal
discharge. Further investigation showed that the cat had developed
pneumonia. A nasal discharge sample was collected and tested positive
for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus by the Oregon State University
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Despite supportive care and
treatment with anti-viral drugs, the cat died on the same evening.

Further investigation by the Oregon state public health veterinarian
confirmed that the owner had been suffering from H1N1 influenza
virus, meaning that both cats who have died from this influenza virus
contracted the virus from their owners. The news follows an
announcement by France's Director General of Health that a cat in
France has tested positive after catching the virus from one of 2
infected children in the same household. In this case the cat
recovered after approximately a week. In other developments, 2 cats
from different households in Colorado have been confirmed as testing
positive for H1N1 influenza. These cats are 10 and 11 years old, and
the Colorado State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory
confirmed that the cats have fully recovered.

"Because this strain of H1N1 is new, information about how it impacts
animals is limited. It is possible that any animal may be susceptible
to H1N1, but no other cases have been documented in companion
animals. To date, there are no reported cases of H1N1 in dogs in the
United States. Pet birds have been susceptible to other strains of
the flu, but no cases of H1N1 in these animals have been reported,"
said Kristy Pabilonia, a veterinarian and expert on H1N1 testing in
animals at Colorado State University.

An 8-year-old cheetah that loves to play soccer with its trainers at
Safari West preserve near Santa Rosa [California], is the 1st known
exotic animal in the US to have contracted swine flu [influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection].

The graceful female, named Gijima, tested positive last month
[November 2009] to the H1N1 virus after staff members observed her on
15 Nov 2009 coughing, acting lethargic, and showing no interest in food.

The staff tested Gijima because Safari West director Nancy Lang
recently had read of a family house cat with similar signs that was
confirmed to have contracted swine flu. Lang, who with her husband
Peter owns the 400-acre [162 ha] wildlife preserve, said she
nonetheless was "absolutely stunned" when the cheetah tested positive.

Gijima, whose name means "fast," has fully recovered, and on
Wednesday [9 Dec 2009] appeared briefly in the crisp morning air
within its large outdoor enclosure. She is one of 4 cheetahs among
the preserve's 700 animals, including giraffes, addax antelopes, and
Grant's gazelles.

While the staff can't be certain, they suspect Gijima became infected
from a human, Lang said. They have ruled out the general public
because of barriers that keep guests back about 3 feet [1 m] from the
cheetah enclosure.

A spokesman for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in Silver
Springs, Maryland, confirmed that the cheetah is the 1st case of
swine flu in an exotic animal to come to the group's attention.

Spokesman Steve Feldman praised Safari West for quick action and for
helping alert other zoos and wildlife preserves to the news. He also
emphasized that the animals in zoological institutions don't present
a risk of infecting people.

"This is not a public health issue as much as an animal health
issue," Feldman said.

A small number of pets have contracted the H1N1 virus from humans. On
Tuesday [8 Dec 2009] the American Veterinary Medical Association
listed cases in Iowa, Utah, Oregon, and Colorado, but not California.
There is no evidence that humans have become infected by their pets.

What remains key for animal handlers is to employ the same safety
procedures as when around humans, only "in the zoological
environment," Feldman said. Among those procedures: "Stay home when
you're sick, and especially for our employees who come in close
proximity with animals, to limit their contact with animals if
they're not feeling well."

At Safari West, located off Porter Creek Road in the hills above
Larkfield, Lang said the staff regularly sterilizes tools and food
bowls, sterilizes shoes in foot baths before entering enclosures and
uses separate gloves for each animal's food bowl.

Gijima already was receiving antibiotics before the test results came
back confirming the H1N1 virus. Marie Martinez, who oversees the
cheetahs, said the cheetah's care was "kind of like for your kids"
who are sick. Staff provided the animal a warm bed, adequate food,
water, and rest.

Lang expressed relief at Gijima's recovery. "We feel extremely
fortunate to have the cat in great health," she said.

[Clearly our domestic pets are sensitive to the virus in the
household environment. There is much to learn about this virus in our pets.

We are glad to hear that Gijima has recovered. However, one wonders
if 3 feet between people and zoo animals is enough for an airborne
virus? - Mod.TG]

[As a non-veterinarian, this moderator is struck by the recent
increase in reports of pandemic influenza (H1N1)v infection in
felines (see prior ProMED-mail reports below, and see
<http://vetmedicine.about.com/b/2009/12/08/h1n1-cat.htm> for a report
of a feline case in France. One suspects that there may be
significant under-reporting, as routine testing of felines for viral
agents associated with respiratory illnesses is not often done (the
most common viral etiologies for feline respiratory infections are
feline herpesvirus (FHV1) and feline calcivirus (FCV)). It is
curious (to this moderator) that this current H1N1 influenza virus
seems to be capable of infecting multiple species... One can't help
but wonder if perhaps academic veterinarian institutions are more
sensitive to testing given the heightened awareness vis a vis a new
pandemic strain ("seek and ye shall find") or is there something new
going on? - Mod.MPP]
