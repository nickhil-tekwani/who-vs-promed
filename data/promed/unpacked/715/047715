Human cases have been reported from:
State / Neuroinvasion* / *West Nile* fever** / Other, Unspecified***
/ Total **** / Fatalities
Iowa / 0 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Mississippi / 3 / 1 / 0 / 4 / 1
South Dakota / 0 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
TOTALS / 3 / 3 / 0 / 6 / 1
* cases with neurological manifestations (such as WN encephalitis,
meningitis*, and myelitis)
** cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
'Neuroinvasive disease' refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
'West Nile fever' refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional
whether or not state health departments report these cases to CDC.
[Further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and
West Nile fever can be found in the CDC website at the URL provided
above].
'Other' includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid
paralysis. 'Unspecified' cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
'Total human cases reported to CDC': These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments.
ArboNET is the national, electronic surveillance system established
by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other
mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2007 virus/disease
activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

(WNV) infections have been reported to CDC ArboNET from the following
states: California, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Mississippi, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.
WNV antibody-positive sentinel animals (birds and/or horses) have
been found in California, and Florida. [Note: not all states have WNV
sentinel programs. - Mods.JW/TY]
WNV equine infections have been reported from California, Tennessee, and Texas.
WNV has been detected in dead wild birds in California and Mississippi.
