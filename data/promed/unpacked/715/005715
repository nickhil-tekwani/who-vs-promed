Review Committee Report: Inadvertent shipment of live _Bacillus anthracis_ spores by DOD
--------
Executive Summary:

On 29 May 2015, due to the inadvertent shipment of live anthrax from a Department of Defense (DoD) laboratory, the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DSD) directed the Under Secretary of Defense (USD) for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics (AT&L) to conduct a 30-day review of the Department's safety practices for generating and handling inactivated _Bacillus anthracis_ (BA). This independent review was in addition to the concurrent investigation initiated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For more than a decade, DoD and CDC have been working closely on optimal oversight of and compliance with the select agent regulations. These regulations impact all U.S. laboratories that work with biological select agents including those supported by the DoD's Critical Reagents Program (CRP), which primarily serves the interagency and the biodefense research community.

USD (AT&L) established a review committee to conduct the comprehensive review mandated by DSD. This document is the Review Committee's report; membership of the committee is provided in Appendix C. The committee was asked to address the following critical areas:
- The root cause for the incomplete inactivation of BA samples at DoD laboratories;
- Why post inactivation viability testing did not detect the presence of live BA;
- Existing DoD laboratory biohazard safety protocols and procedures;
- DoD laboratory adherence to established procedures and protocols; and
- Identification of systemic problems and what steps should be taken to fix those problems.

The United States Department of Defense Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) develops medical and physical countermeasures to protect the warfighter from chemical and biological threats. BA is an exceptionally resilient organism. This resilience combined with its infectious nature makes BA ideally suited for potential adversaries' biological weapons programs. Therefore it is critical for the Department to have a strong countermeasures program to protect our warfighters against this dangerous organism.

As part of the above process, the DoD routinely inactivates many select agents such as _Bacillus anthracis_ (the causative agent of anthrax), _Francisella tularensis_ (the causative agent of tularemia), and _Burkholderia mallei_ (the causative agent of Glanders disease in horses) through a number of chemical, thermal, or radiation procedures. There are many federal partners and private sector laboratories outside the DoD that depend on DoD's ability to provide them with inactivated pathogens for national security and public safety missions. The 4 DoD laboratories whose mission involves inactivation of BA are: Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) in Maryland, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Maryland, the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) in Maryland, and Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) in Utah.

What Happened?
-------
The DoD regularly ships inactivated biological materials for research, development, testing, and evaluation to industry, academia, and other Federal laboratories. On 22 May 2015, a private company notified the CDC that inactivated BA spores in its possession were live. Live BA has the potential to pose a threat to human health and it is only distributed to facilities regulated by the Federal Select Agent Program.

The CDC began an investigation and determined that a BA sample originating from DPG on 20 Apr 2015, was not fully inactivated and contained viable BA spores. We now know that, over the course of the last decade, 86 facilities in the United States and 7 other countries have received low concentrations of live BA spore samples from DPG thought to be completely inactivated. The low numbers of live spores found in inactivated DoD samples did not pose a risk to the general public. Nonetheless, the shipment of live BA samples outside of the select agent program restrictions (at any concentration) is a serious breach of regulations.

What Has DoD Done Since The Incident?
-------------
The DoD issued a moratorium on the shipping of inactivated BA from DPG, ECBC, and USAMRIID. NMRC does not currently inactivate or ship BA.

DSD advised any laboratories that may have received inactivated BA from the DoD that they should stop working with it until further instructions are received from DoD and CDC. The CDC promulgated disposition instructions for laboratories who received samples of inactivated BA spore preparations from DPG. The office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological programs subsequently issued a directive to all DoD laboratories with inactivated BA spores to immediately determine if any inactivated material at their laboratory contained live BA.

The DoD created a website that summarizes current information pertaining to the BA situation at http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2015/0615_lab-stats/.

The DoD opened a hotline that is available for telephone calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and posted the hotline number to the website as a resource for any questions that laboratories or the public may have regarding this incident.

On 1 Jun 2015, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs established a Task Force to coordinate the DoD response.

On 5 Jun 2015, the CDC issued updated guidance for testing inactivated BA spores for growth. All DoD laboratories that began testing using in-house protocols restarted testing in conformance with the updated CDC protocol to verify that inactivated samples contain no live BA spores.

The DoD has validated that there are no additional irradiated BA samples of concern that are demonstrating growth using currently available DoD and CDC viability testing protocols.

Root Cause
-----
To perform root cause analysis, the committee visited all 4 DoD laboratories with capabilities for BA irradiation to interview members of the scientific staff and management. The observations and recommendations in this report apply to all 4 DoD laboratories conducting this work. The committee also focused on the question of why materials originating from the Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) exclusively exhibited live BA spores in irradiated samples.

For this report, the committee reviewed existing procedures and protocols from all 4 DoD laboratories that produce and work with gamma-irradiated BA spores and the scientific literature pertaining to bacterial spore inactivation.

A key finding by the committee is that there is insufficient technical information in the broader scientific community to guide the development of thoroughly effective protocols for inactivation of spores and viability testing of BA. This has contributed to the creation of protocols that do not completely or permanently sterilize BA with gamma irradiation. The absence of this critical information is a scientific community-wide problem and needs to be addressed with irradiation standards and viability testing procedures. Pending the publication of standards, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has agreed to initiate a review of the Federal Select Agent Program Authorities to oversee inactivation procedures and consider rule making or other actions to expand the requirements for assurance of adequate inactivation.

The DPG is a production facility and its output of inactivated BA materials far exceeds other DoD laboratories that inactivate BA. Several potential causes requiring additional scientific research are suggested. 2 additional factors specific to DPG, which may have contributed to the presence of live BA in inactivated samples, include low sampling volume for viability testing and a very short time period between the completed irradiation cycle and start of the viability testing. It is clear that BA spores are particularly difficult to kill and live spores injured by irradiation may be able to repair their injuries over time.

Findings
------
The root cause for the incomplete inactivation of BA samples at DoD laboratories:
A single root cause for shipping viable BA samples could not be identified. DoD personnel appear to have followed their own protocols correctly. However, the committee found inherent deficiencies in protocols for 3 phases in the production of inactive spores that could lead to non-sterile products: 1) radiation dosing, 2) viability testing, and 3) aseptic operations (contamination prevention). These deficiencies and other factors contributed to the establishment of protocols that do not completely or permanently sterilize these samples.

Why post-inactivation viability testing did not detect the presence of live BA:
There is no single root cause to explain why the BA samples were incompletely inactivated, or why viability testing did not detect live BA spores. Contributing factors that may have resulted in undetected live BA spores during viability testing in DPG's samples include deficiencies in sample sizes and inadequate incubation periods after irradiation.

Existing DoD laboratory biological safety protocols and procedures:
The committee identified existing DoD laboratory safety protocols and procedures in each location. However, these procedures are not standardized amongst the laboratories.

DoD laboratory adherence to established procedures and protocols:
In most cases, the committee observed that DoD laboratories followed their own established procedures and protocols.

Identification of systemic problems and what steps should be taken to fix those problems:
The primary systemic issue responsible for failures in the preparation of inactivated BA spores is the lack of specific validated standards to guide the development of protocols, processes, and quality assurance measures.

Abridged Recommendations
--------------------
Quality Assurance: Enhance quality control programs at DoD laboratories working with hazardous select agents and other pathogens.

Standardize BA Inactivation Protocols Across Laboratories: All DoD laboratories should follow a common Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for such practices as irradiation and viability testing.

Institute More Rigorous Quality Procedures: Establish quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) procedures for inactivation and viability testing of BA spores.

Clarify The Conditions Of The Material Transfer Agreement (MTA): Material transfer agreements enable DoD laboratories to communicate potential hazards to the customers and maintain a positive inventory tracking for potential recalls on all select agent inactivated materials.

Perform Preventive Maintenance: All reusable mechanical equipment employed throughout the process should be routinely maintained and calibrated, from mechanical pipettes to the irradiator.

Establish And Manage An Environmental Surface Sampling Program: Some laboratories lack written procedures to document, investigate, and report contamination found outside primary containment areas during environmental persistent agent sampling.

Establish Validated Dose Curves: Radiation dose curves should be generated for each BA strain used for production, at the same concentrations used in production and performed on the same irradiator as used for inactivation of spore preparations.

Understand The End Users' Needs: The Chief Science Officer of the lab, Army or Command, should work with individual customers to understand sample requirements and determine the appropriate strains and material needed to support the objectives.

Quantitate Spores Before Irradiation: Spore preparations intended for irradiation should be quantified as precisely as possible to maximize the likelihood of achieving the inactivation levels predicted by kill curves produced with the same strain in the same irradiator.

Peer Review: Establish BA spore inactivation and viability testing protocols that are based on relevant scientific data, standards, and studies conducted to fill knowledge gaps. All protocols and subsequent protocol modifications should be subject to a peer review process, validated and implemented uniformly across similar operations.

Program Management: Program managers should provide adequate laboratory space, equipment and time to conduct relevant safety and surety [the state of being sure or certain of something] research for select agents and other pathogens. Program managers should develop a plan to track and document the implementation and long-term sustainability of the recommended corrective actions identified through this review panel as well as all internal and external audits.
