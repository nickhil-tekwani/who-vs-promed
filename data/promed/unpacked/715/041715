Romania may have its 1st human case of avian influenza. A Turkish
citizen was admitted to a hospital in Bucharest on Wednesday night
with bird flu-like symptoms. Romania has been on alert as the virus
spreads westwards across neighbouring Turkey, where 2 people are
known to have died of the disease and many more are thought to have
been infected.
Countries to the east of Turkey have also taken action. Georgia has
tightened controls on goods crossing the border and Iran has decided
to cull poultry within 15 kilometres of the Turkish frontier. The
European Union has banned imports of live birds and risky poultry
products such as fresh meat and untreated feathers from affected
areas. In Turkey and neighbouring countries, authorities have tried
to increase awareness of the importance of hygiene when handling birds.
So far there is no evidence that the potentially lethal H5N1 strain
of the virus can jump from one human to another, but the World Health
Organisation says that threat is growing. At a conference in Tokyo,
organised by the WHO, experts have been discussing the risks of a
global pandemic that could kill millions. They say governments should
intensify preventive measures.

influenza in Turkey before arriving in Bucharest. Further information
is awaited. - Mod.CP]
