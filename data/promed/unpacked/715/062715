The Asian tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_], which was found in Limassol last month [October 2022, see Invasive mosquito - Cyprus (02) 20221024.8706340] has also been detected in the north, the Turkish Cypriot association of biologists announced on Monday [21 Nov 2022].

The association identified the specific mosquito species following complaints by residents and called on relevant departments to take measures. "In addition to the biological control programme, control strategies specific to invasive mosquitoes should be implemented," the association said and noted the competent authorities should be notified as to where these mosquitoes have been found.

_Aedes albopictus_, native to South East Asia, was also found in the Ayios Ioannis and Apostolos Andreas area of Mesa Geitonia in Limassol. The city's mayor Nicos Nicolaides said measures will be taken but reassured that these types of mosquitoes are not concerning, as the diseases they carry do not appear in Cyprus.

According to the University of California Riverside's department of entomology, this mosquito is an aggressive biter that feeds primarily during the day and has a broad host range including humans, domestic and wild animals, and birds. It is a potential vector of encephalitis, dengue (all 4 serotypes), yellow fever, and dog heartworm.

[Finding _Aedes albopictus _ in the northern, Turkish, area of Cyprus is not surprising, given that this mosquito was detected in the southern, Greek, area of Cyprus last month (October 2022). There is no indication in the previous report or the one above about how _Aedes albopictus_ may have been introduced into Cyprus. However, it is present in several nearby countries. Because there are abundant potential breeding sites on the island with no ecological barriers present, further spread of this mosquito to various localities in Cyprus is likely.

As the report above notes, _Ae. albopictus_ feeds on a wide range of hosts, many of which are not susceptible to dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses although humans are. _Ae. Aegypti_ is the main vector of these viruses and feeds almost exclusively on humans but _Ae. albopictus_ has been the vector in some outbreaks. Eliminating these mosquitoes from the island may be difficult now that it has been detected in both the southern and northern areas of the island.

A map showing the distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ in Europe as of March 2022 can be seen at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-albopictus-current-known-distribution-march-2022. A series of maps showing the distribution of other invasive _Aedes_ mosquitoes in the Mediterranean basin is available at this same URL. The map shows that _Ae albopictus_ is widely distributed around southern and south western Europe. - Mod.TY
