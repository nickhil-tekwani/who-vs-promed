Russian medical services reported several outbreaks of infection in
February in which 134 people were affected.
A dysentery outbreak sickened 27 people at a mental hospital in the Pskov
region. Of those, six are in serious condition. The disease was caused by
the gross violation of sanitary and hygiene rules, officials at Russia's
Sanitary and Epidemiological Service told Itar-Tass on Thursday.
In the Dergachev district, Saratov region, 46 people came down with
salmonellosis, including 34 children after eating infected barbecued meat.
In Siberia's town of Kemerovo, an intestinal infection affected 61 people,
including 52 children, who had eaten vegetables contaminated by infected
rodents.
