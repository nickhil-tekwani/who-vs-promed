[These came in response to our posting the above Request For Information.
Obviously, we are not receiving official information about this epidemic,
else we would have posted it. We have heard the epidemic is quite a large
one; 4-5 times the number of cases usually seen at this time of year and
2-3 times the 1994-1995 epidemic (at this part of the epidemic curve). In
February we posted the following message (Dengue-3 - Puerto Rico
980211072625), in part: "According to the Puerto Rico Secretary of Health,
an elderly San Juan man has been diagnosed with dengue 3 virus infection, a
virus not detected in Puerto Rico since the 1970s. Dengue 3 virus had been
absent from the Americas from 1977 until 1994, when it reappeared in
Nicaragua and Panama. If the current epidemic is due to dengue 3 virus,
this virus has been smoldering for six months. - Mod.CHC

Several weeks ago some family members traveled to Puerto Rico. During that
visit my great aunt, who went on the trip, became seriously ill. She
required hospitalization and was in critical condition. We were told she
would have hemorrhaged to death had she waited much longer. The doctor said
she had been [fed upon by a mosquito carrying a virus which affected her
platelet levels and she could not leave Puerto Rico until her condition
stabilized. She is currently hospitalized in New York [diagnosis = dengue.
In addition, my great uncle's daughter (early 50's) last week became
hospitalized in NY for the same condition [I assume this second patient
also went to Puerto Rico with the family, else there is dengue virus
transmission in New York City, which isn't likely. - Mod.CHC.

[If Dra. Carmen Deseda, Puerto Rico's State Epidemiologist, is monitoring
ProMED-mail and would care to comment we would appreciate it. If anyone
can provide her e-mail address, please send it to me.
Sort of hard to comment on rumors, newspaper reports, and messages from
relatives of travelers (to whom, nonetheless, we are most grateful), but at
least no one has been jailed for having told the truth. - Mod.CHC
