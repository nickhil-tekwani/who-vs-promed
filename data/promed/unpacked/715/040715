One child has died and another is in hospital following an outbreak of _E.
coli_ food poisoning at a holiday resort. Four other children have been
affected by the outbreak in Dawlish Warren, south Devon, over the past
three weeks.
Dr Jim O'Brien, director of public health at South and West Devon Health
Authority, said: "I would like to reassure local residents and
holidaymakers that extensive investigations have been undertaken and all
necessary precautions are in place. "Although the source of the infection
has not been identified, there have been no further confirmed cases and it
is extremely unlikely there is any increased risk to the public."
Three of the children were on holiday, while the other three lived locally
and were visiting holidaymakers. The children were infected with _E. coli_
O157, which causes persistent diarrhoea, violent sickness and other
symptoms in humans.
Many other types of _E. coli_ are harmless to humans. However, in some
cases infection with O157 [strain can lead to kidney failure and prove
fatal. This was the case with the child who died in Devon.
The health authority has taken samples from local food outlets as a
precaution but they have proved negative. Water supplies have also been
tested, but the authority still cannot pin down the source of the infection.
