Yellow fever threat: How vigilant are our gatekeepers?
------------------------------------------------------
I recently travelled with a group to Brazil to watch the World Cup. Before the journey, we were advised to get vaccinated against yellow fever 10 days prior to departure. This is a mandatory requirement in Singapore for such travel. The reason is that yellow fever, which is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, is endemic in Brazil and parts of South America.

I studied the measures put in place to ensure compliance, to assess any shortcomings that may inadvertently allow the yellow fever virus to slip into Singapore. In the group, I found a fellow traveller who had his vaccination a mere 24 hours before travel. To me, this was self-defeating as it takes 10 days after the jab for the immunity to kick in. Consequently, he had no protection during the time he was in Brazil. If he had been bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus, he would have been infected.

Owing to the incubation period, an infected person may be asymptomatic when he returns to Singapore. Thus, the virus could be introduced to the island in this manner. A returning Singaporean or permanent resident can also opt to use the lane reserved for the Immigration Automated Clearance System to pass through the Changi Airport checkpoint. Officers are not being deployed to ascertain where the person is flying in from, which means any infected person can walk right through.

On my return, I met someone who was planning to travel to Brazil for the World Cup matches. He did not know he had to have a yellow fever vaccination certificate. He was surprised when I brought this to his attention; this illustrates the lack of public awareness. With Brazil hosting the World Cup, we could see a large number of football fans heading there. Are the current measures effective enough to ensure that the yellow fever virus does not take root in Singapore?

[The fan travelling to Brazil for the 3rd place and final matches was not at risk, because those are held in Brasilia and Rio, which are not in the yellow fever (YF) zone. But those who travelled to Manaus earlier to see the England vs Italy match on 14 Jun 2014 were at risk if they travelled outside the city. And there is even a small risk in cities outside the YF zone, such as when infected Brazilians returning from Millennium celebrations in the YF zone of Brazil's interior fell ill on return to Rio de Janeiro and cities in Sao Paulo state (see ProMED 2000 refs. below). - Mod.JW]

[Although events like the FIFA World Cup attract thousands of people from all over the world, one must not forget that there are smaller, but still significant numbers of individuals who travel between localities where yellow fever virus (YFV) is endemic (Africa and South America) and areas where YFV is not present -- but competent mosquito vectors are abundant and transmitting dengue virus currently. This argues for good public health education for travelers and for constant surveillance to promptly detect yellow fever cases whenever and wherever they occur. Just because YFV has not appeared in areas thus far free of the virus is no guarantee that they will remain free. - Mod.TY
