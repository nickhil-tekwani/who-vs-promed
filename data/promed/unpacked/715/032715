2001/053 High Plains disease found in Washington State (US)
------------------------------------------------------
In 1998, samples of sweet maize (_Zea mays_) showing symptoms of mosaic,
yellow streaking and severe stunting were observed in 3 eastern counties of
Washington State, USA. Older leaves showed extensive tip burn and severe
scorch. Microscopic observation revealed the presence of eriophyid mites
within leaf whorls. ELISA tests confirmed the presence of wheat High Plains
disease (EPPO Alert List) in sweet maize (_Z. mays_ cvs Golden Jubilee,
Peaches Cream, Lyric). The disease was also found on a fourth location on
maize. This is the first report of High Plains disease in Washington State.

[High Plains disease was detected in susceptible winter wheat and maize in
several High Plains states (Texas, Kansas, Colorado, Idaho Nebraska and
Utah) in the western and central USA during 1993-94. It has also been
reported in winter sweet maize production fields in southern Florida, and
there are confirmed reports of its presence on maize in Chile and Brazil.
Infected, but not healthy, wheat and maize plants contain ovoid, double
membrane-bound, virus-like particles (DMP) of 150-180 nm in diameter and a
32 kDa protein is associated with several dsRNAs. The pathogen is
transmitted by the wheat curl mite (_Aceria tosichella_). High Plains
disease belongs to a new group of eriophyid mite-transmitted viruses that
cause wheat spot mosaic, fig mosaic, thistle mosaic, rose rosette and
redbud yellow ringspot. - Mod.DH
