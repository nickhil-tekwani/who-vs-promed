WHO: H5N1 cases in Turkey targeted children, youth
-----------------------------------------------
A recent World Health Organization (WHO) report on 10 of the 12
confirmed H5N1 avian influenza cases that occurred in Turkey last
winter adds to evidence that children and youth may be particularly
susceptible to the infection. The disease struck only children
younger than 16, even though their parents had probably been exposed
to the same probable source of infection, infected poultry, according
to the 27 Oct 2006 issue of WHO's Weekly Epidemiological Record [see:
WHO bulletin with report on H5N1 cases in Turkey
<http://www.who.int/wer/2006/wer8143.pdf> and ProMED-mail post: Avian
influenza, human (161): age-related severity 20061008.2888].
"To some extent, this reflects the same age distribution observed
globally, where 50.5 percent of cases occurred among people aged <20
years, and it suggests that age-related factors may influence
susceptibility to the disease," the report states. Of the 4
case-patients described in the report who died, all were teenagers,
while all the survivors were younger children, aged 3 to 9 years.
"This reflects closely the global situation where the highest
case-fatality rate (73 percent) has been observed in the 10-19-year
age group," the article says.
Turkey was the 1st country outside Southeast Asia to have human
cases. The WHO report discusses 10 cases that occurred in the eastern
provinces of Van and Agri in late December 2005 and January 2006 and
were investigated by WHO epidemiologists. The 2 other confirmed cases
in Turkey were in other provinces, according to Mary K. Kindhauser, a
WHO spokeswoman in Geneva. A total of 21 human H5N1 cases had been
reported in January 2006 on the basis of tests in a Turkish
laboratory. But the WHO recognized only 12 cases that were confirmed
by a reference laboratory in the United Kingdom.
At the time of the outbreak, a WHO official reported that 2 Turkish
boys had asymptomatic H5N1 infections. But those 2 cases were among
the 9 that were never confirmed by the UK lab, Kindhauser told CIDRAP
News by e-mail today [31 Oct 2006]. The 10 cases covered in the
report included 3 family clusters, one involving 3 cases and 2
involving 2 each. But investigators concluded that person-to-person
transmission in the families was unlikely, because in each family,
the members fell ill within about a 2-day period, indicating they all
contracted the virus from a common environmental source.
Although all 3 family clusters occurred near one another and within a
2-week period, "field investigations provided no evidence of
human-to-human transmission between households," the report says. The
families had had no interactions, and the children attended different
schools. Investigation indicated that close exposure to infected
poultry was the primary risk factor for infection, the WHO says. All
the patients had been exposed to backyard poultry, and at least 5
were known to have had contact with sick or dead poultry. The 3
families that had multiple cases had been sheltering their poultry
indoors in late December 2005 because of severe cold. Two patients
had pet pigeons, but the birds' possible role could not be assessed
because no samples were collected from pigeons in the area, the report says.
The article notes that 135 people in the 2 provinces had suspected
cases of H5N1 and were hospitalized and treated with oseltamivir at
the time, but testing ruled out all the cases.
