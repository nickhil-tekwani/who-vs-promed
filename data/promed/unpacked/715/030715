- 7 Jun 2018. Congo reports 1st confirmed Ebola case in over a week
[Daily Mail, edited]
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-5818755/Congo-reports-confirmed-Ebola-case-week.html [reporting: Fiston Mahamba; writing: Aaron Ross; editing: William Maclean]

The Democratic Republic of Congo has recorded its 1st confirmed case of Ebola in over a week, the health ministry said on [Thu 7 Jun 2018], although medics say they have made significant progress in their efforts to contain the disease. The patient, a known contact of someone who is believed to have died from Ebola on [20 May 2018], was confirmed positive on [Wed 6 Jun 2018] for the hemorrhagic fever in the rural community of Iboko, the ministry said in a daily report.

Health officials have moved aggressively to contain the epidemic in a bid to head off a repeat of the 2013-16 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11 300 people. Over 1800 health workers and other people who could have been exposed to the virus have received an experimental vaccine first tested in the waning days of the West Africa epidemic. Those efforts and the slowing pace of new cases have led health officials to express cautious optimism about containing the outbreak, although its location directly upstream the Congo River of the capital Kinshasa remains a concern.

The last confirmed case before Wednesday's [6 Jun 2018] was on 30 May 2018, in Iboko. The ministry also reported 5 new suspected cases on [Thu 7 Jun 2018], including 2 in Mbandaka, a city of some 1.5 million people. In all, the ministry has recorded 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 10 suspected cases, including 27 deaths.

The World Health Organization said on [Thu 7 Jun 2018] that it was committing USD 15.6 million over the next 9 months to helping the 9 countries that border Congo to scale up their emergency response capabilities. Earlier this week [week of 7 Jun 2018], the government of the northern Angolan province Malanje closed its river border with Congo in response to the outbreak.

[WHO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, edited]
http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272785/SITREP_EVD_DRC_20180608-eng.pdf

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains active. On 6 Jun 2018, 1 new confirmed EVD case was reported in Iboko Health Zone. The case-patient, a known contact of a probable case who died on 20 May 2018, developed illness on 2 Jun 2018. In addition, 5 new suspected EVD cases have been reported in Wangata (3) and Bikoro (2) health zones. 4 laboratory specimens (from suspected cases reported previously) tested negative. No new deaths have occurred on the reporting date.

Since the beginning of the outbreak (on 4 Apr 2018), a total of 62 EVD cases and 27 deaths (case fatality rate 43.6 per cent) have been reported, as of 6 Jun 2018. Of the 62 cases, 38 have been laboratory confirmed, 14 are probable (deaths for which it was not possible to collect laboratory specimens for testing), and 10 are suspected. Of the confirmed and probable cases, 27 (5 per cent are from Iboko, followed by 21 (4 per cent from Bikoro, and 4 ( per cent from Wangata health zones. A total of 5 healthcare workers have been affected, with 4 confirmed cases and 2 deaths.

The outbreak has remained localised to the 3 health zones initially affected: Iboko (24 confirmed cases, 3 probable, 5 suspected, 6 deaths), Bikoro (10 confirmed cases, 11 probable, 2 suspected, 18 deaths) and Wangata (4 confirmed cases, 3 suspected, 3 deaths).

The number of contacts requiring follow-up is progressively decreasing with many completing the required follow-up period. As of 6 Jun 2018, a total of 619 contacts were under follow up, of which 91 per cent were reached on the reporting date.

[2] Future outlook
- 8 Jun 2018. WHO says Ebola situation in DRC shows promise
[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/06/who-says-ebola-situation-drc-shows-promise
[byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Today [8 Jun 2018] Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO said he was cautiously optimistic that the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is stabilizing, while another top WHO official said response efforts are having an impact. Tedros, who goes by his 1st name, told Reuters he would be traveling to DRC on [Sun 10 Jun 2018] to check on progress one month after the outbreak began in the rural Bikoro health zone, which would mark his 2nd visit to the outbreak region. His optimism was echoed by Peter Salama, the WHO's deputy director-general of emergency response. Salama gave a press briefing over the WHO's Twitter account earlier today [8 Jun 2018].

The outbreak stands at 62 cases, including 27 deaths, with the most recent confirmed case identified on [2 Jun 2018] in a known contact from Iboko health zone. Iboko, the most rural of the outbreak sites, was the focus of Salama's briefing. Bikoro health zone and Wangata health zone both reported their last confirmed case in mid-May [2018].

"This tells us the response is having an impact in those 2 locations," said Salama, referring to the robust ring vaccination campaign launched 2 weeks ago with Merck's VSV-EBOV. More than 98 per cent of known contacts have been vaccinated, Salama said. "But we know to never underestimate Ebola." Salama said vaccinating contacts in a big city (Mbandaka, in Wangata health zone and home to more than 1 million people) and a smaller rural town (Bikoro) was the 1st phase of the outbreak response. Phase 2 will focus on Iboko.

"Contact tracing has been a huge challenge in this hard-to-reach area," Salama said, describing Iboko as a remote community in a heavily forested part of the DRC. The village has no electricity, and WHO workers travel by motorcycles because 4-wheeled vehicles have a hard time navigating area roads. "It takes an enormous logistical challenge to reach suspected cases and contacts," Salama said. He also said many cases in the area are connected to a super-spreader, a female nurse who treated people both formally and informally.

Community engagement and education will be emphasized in the coming weeks, as 50 per cent of Iboko's population is indigenous. According to a story from AllAfrica, community engagement in rural communities means educating schoolchildren on hygiene and dispelling rumors that Ebola is fake or a curse, among other steps.

Chinese vaccine team and rapid tests
------------------------------------
Yesterday [7 Jun 2018], the DRC's Ministry of Health said a team of Chinese experts was arriving today in Kinshasa to assist the Congolese health authorities and reportedly bringing an experimental Chinese Ebola vaccine to health authorities, according to STAT today [see items [3] and [4] below]. To date, DRC has approved only the use of Merck's vaccine.

Finally, yesterday The Lancet published a letter by US experts who suggested that, although costly, using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) during the outbreak would be beneficial to identify all transmission chains of Ebola present in the DRC. Failing to do so in West Africa during the 2014-2016 outbreak allowed the disease to spread, the authors said [see report on the Lancet publication below on deploying RDTs. - Mod.LK]

"Deploying RDTs in this manner might seem costly and operationally burdensome, but, as learned from the West African epidemic, finding all chains of transmission cannot be left to chance and the ultimate cost of missing them can become far greater," the authors write.

- 8 Jun 2018. An encouraging prediction about the Ebola outbreak
[NPR, edited]
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/06/08/618012443/an-encouraging-prediction-about-the-ebola-outbreak
[byline: Nadia Whitehead]

When an Ebola outbreak was declared in the Democratic Republic of Congo this spring [2018], there were all kinds of predictions about how the epidemic would play out. At first the outbreak was confined to a remote rural area, so the hope was it could be easily contained. There simply weren't a lot of people who could have come in contact with the infected individuals.

Then a case was identified in Mbandaka, a city of more than 1 million, raising concerns that this outbreak could echo the 2014 outbreak, where a single case in Guinea, a country in West Africa, triggered an epidemic in which more than 28 500 people were infected with the virus and 11 325 died. But now it looks as if the outbreak is slowing down. And one mathematical epidemiologist is predicting it'll all be over soon.

Christian Althaus, head of the Immuno-Epidemiology Research Group at the University of Bern, predicts that the number of Ebola cases will level off by the end of June [2018] -- resulting in no more than 67 infections. As of 6 Jun 2018, there have been a reported 58 cases -- including 27 deaths -- in the outbreak in DRC, which started in early April [2018]. To make this prediction, Althaus created a mathematical model for how easily Ebola was spreading in Congo. Models are a common tool epidemiologists use to get a rough idea of how epidemics will develop.

Specifically, he used case numbers shared by WHO in twice-a-week updates to calculate the average number of people infected by 1 person carrying Ebola. At the start of the Congolese outbreak, Althaus calculated that the transmission or "reproduction number" was 3.2 -- meaning, on average, an infected individual spread the virus to 3 others. That explains the graph's rapid incline. But weeks later, that reproduction number has fallen well below 1, creating the graph's sudden plateau. When the reproduction number drops below 1, an outbreak starts to slow down because some infected people don't spread the virus to anyone else.

[3] Response
- 8 Jun 2018. Ebola response: "MONUSCO [Mission de l'Organisation des Nations unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo; UN Stabilization Mission in the Congo DR] has strengthened the airlift established by WFP [World Food Program]"

https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/06/08/actualite/sante/lutte-contre-ebola-la-monusco-renforce-le-pont-aerien-etabli-par-le-pam

MONUSCO has followed and reinforced the WFP airlift by adding another passenger plane between Kinshasa and Mbandaka to facilitate the movement of Ministry of Health staff and our partners in the UN family, as well as facilitate the deployment of doctors between Mbandaka and the 1st affected areas," said Safia Boly, MONUSCO director of administration support. Invited by Radio Okapi on [Fri 8 Jun 2018], she reported on the logistical support of the UN mission in the DRC in the fight against the Ebola virus epidemic in the Equateur province.

MONUSCO's support was also to establish 2 camps in Iboko and Itipo that allow doctors to work to sensitize staff, but also to care for the affected people and provide them with the necessary care and support.

"We also support these health workers in terms of food, electricity, and drinking water so that our partners can fulfill their roles," said Safia Boly. She pointed out that the UN mission in the DRC is also setting up camps to improve the working conditions of those tasked with fighting Ebola. "We are transporting materials from the WHO and the Ministry of Health. We are talking about the medical equipment, the protection, the equipment we need to set up camps and allow them to do their job. In the space of a month, the equivalent of more than 162 tons of cargo was transported. And in terms of passengers, we had more than 300 passengers on our various flights," said MONUSCO's director of administration support.

- 8 Jun 2018. Chinese sent to help fight Congo Ebola
[China Daily, edited]

A team of Chinese health experts will depart for the Democratic Republic of Congo this week [week of 8 Jun 2018] to help fight an Ebola outbreak in the west central African nation. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the experts will attempt to use a vaccine developed by China to help combat the disease. The team, comprising 4 public health experts from the Chinese CDC and 7 from other institutes, will evaluate the situation on the ground and provide support to counterparts in Congo, including virus testing, he said.

"They will stay in Congo for a month according to the initial plan," Gao said. "The places where outbreaks occurred are far away from the capital, and transport is inconvenient. We are still discussing the details of our work there. "So in the initial period of the stay the team members will try to get familiar with the situation," he said. "We will seek to use the Chinese developed vaccine there to help with control and prevention of the disease, but for the present the vaccines will likely only cover Chinese living in Congo." It's also a pre-emptive intervention for China, as infectious diseases know no national borders, he said.

The vaccine, jointly developed by the Academy of Military Medical Sciences and CanSinoBio, a Chinese company involved in human vaccine development and production, was approved by China's top drug regulator in October [2017]. This made China the 3rd country, after the United States and Russia, with a vaccine available to combat Ebola, according to the State Drug Administration. The vaccine-recombinant Ebola virus disease vaccine (adenovirus type 5 vector) is available in powder and, compared with liquid vaccines in the other 2 countries, is more stable, which is an advantage in transportation and use in tropical areas such as Africa, the administration said.

Gao, from the Chinese CDC, said China will intensify cooperation with African nations to help them better cope with infectious disease prevention and control. "We will fulfil our pledge to support the building of a center for disease control and prevention in Africa, including training experts in Africa," he said. "We will help build a center on prevention, control and research of tropical diseases in Sierra Leone, and continue the monitoring of emerging pathogens such as Ebola in West Africa."

[4] Diagnostics and vaccines
- 8 Jun 2018. Deploying RDTs [rapid diagnostic tests] in the DRC Ebola outbreak
[The Lancet journal, edited]
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31315-1/fulltext

ref: Dhillon RS, Srikrishna D, Kelly JD. Deploying RDTs in the DRC Ebola outbreak. Lancet 2018. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31315-1
------------------------------------------------------------------
Uncovering unknown transmission chains in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is an emergent priority. During the early stages of the 2013-16 West African Ebola epidemic, we thought we had a grip on transmission only to discover that unknown transmission chains were spreading unchecked, ultimately enabling the epidemic to spiral out of control.

The initial assessment of the DRC outbreak, its remote location, and the strong immediate response suggest that considerable unknown transmission is unlikely. However, several findings portend that undetected transmission chains could easily take root. Patients with haemorrhagic symptoms were noted months before the outbreak was recognised and initial cases were found in three distinct locations separated by over 60 km [37 mi]. Confirmed transmission in Mbandaka -- a provincial capital of over 1 million people situated on the Congo River, which is a major transit route linking several large cities -- raises the potential for spread within the city as well as seeding of other places in the region.

How can we make sure all newly arising transmission chains and hotspots are promptly identified? Point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are currently being used to screen patients flagged through contact tracing and case definition. If deployed more widely, RDTs could help uncover unknown transmission chains and hotspots. By facilitating early detection and isolation, RDTs could also minimise the number of people exposed and enable early rehydration, which is key for improving survival.

Ebola infection presents with non-specific symptoms that mirror common illnesses like malaria and cannot be differentiated clinically. PCR, the standard for diagnosis, requires specialised personnel and equipment that has been established in two outbreak sites, but cannot be decentralised or scaled for detecting cases more widely, such as in neighbourhoods of Kinshasa, DRC's capital, that could be seeded from the initial outbreak. In the West African epidemic, patients were screened using case definition which was only 68.9 per cent sensitive and 49.6 per cent specific. As a result, many Ebola-infected individuals were missed and only tested after days of exposing others. At the same time, up to 40 per cent of patients isolated based on case definition turned out not to have Ebola, yet were hospitalised alongside others who did.

RDTs for Ebola were not available then, but can mitigate this challenge in the current outbreak. RDT use could be expanded to include screening of all deaths and patients with non-specific symptoms in areas of known transmission as well as sites where there is concern transmission could have been seeded or is occurring undetected. In places without transmission and surveillance points, such as airports, RDTs could be used to screen patients with non-specific symptoms who have recently been in active zones. In communities with known cases, such as affected neighbourhoods of Mbandaka, identifying everyone who might have been exposed can be difficult and RDTs could be used for comprehensive door-to-door screening when necessary.

Each of the 3 Ebola RDTs developed and authorised during the West African epidemic has unique performance and usability characteristics with different advantages and potential use cases. The GeneXpert, an automated PCR device with more than 99 per cent sensitivity and more than 95 per cent specificity, can be carried in a backpack and run off battery for several hours, but requires trained technicians and recurrent inputs that limit its use in the field. The other 2 RDTs -- the ReEBOV and OraQuick -- are dipstick immunoassays that, like widely used malaria and HIV RDTs, require pinprick blood samples and can be used by field workers with only training in biosafety. In a field study during the West African epidemic, the ReEBOV demonstrated 100 per cent sensitivity and 92 per cent specificity. The OraQuick achieved 84 per cent sensitivity and 98 per cent specificity and was used safely and effectively by community and primary health workers on over 2500 patients in a field pilot at the end of the epidemic.

The exact strategy or combinations used should ultimately be determined by teams on the ground who have granular understanding of the communities and settings involved. Deploying RDTs in this manner might seem costly and operationally burdensome, but, as learned from the West African epidemic, finding all chains of transmission cannot be left to chance and the ultimate cost of missing them can become far greater. Staying on top of all transmission chains and understanding exactly where this outbreak is spreading is critical for ensuring the response under way remains adequately tuned to contain it and bring it to an end.

- 8 Jun 2018. China may compete with the West for limited opportunities to test Ebola vaccine
[STAT News, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/06/08/china-may-compete-with-west-to-test-ebola-vaccine/
[byline: Helen Branswell]

China is making a bid to use its Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It's a move that could further complicate efforts to test a crowded field of vaccines and therapies in the context of a waning outbreak. The head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Gao Fu, is reported to have said that a team of experts will travel to the DRC on [Fri 8 Jun 2018], bringing with them an unspecified number of doses of vaccine. "We will seek to use the Chinese developed vaccine there to help with control and prevention of the disease, but for the present the vaccines will likely only cover Chinese living in Congo," Gao is reported as saying in China Daily [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201806/06/WS5b171af6a31001b82571e597.html; see report in item [3] above].

The DRC health ministry's daily Ebola update on [Thu 7 Jun 2018] noted that only one Ebola vaccine has been approved for use in the country at this time, and that is the vaccine being developed by Merck.

Jessica Ilunga, a spokesperson for health minister Dr Oly Ilunga, said there has not been an official request by the Chinese to use the vaccine. Any decisions on approving additional vaccines would have to be made by 2 government advisory committees, she said. One committee studies the science behind the products while the other looks at the ethics of using them.

Given the progress being made in containing the outbreak, it doesn't appear that there is a need to introduce a 2nd vaccine in DRC at this time, Dr Peter Salama, the WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said [Fri 8 Jun 2018]. "The way the current epidemiology stands for this outbreak, I would say not," Salama told STAT. "But if anything changes in this outbreak and certainly for the future we would definitely want to encourage more than one vaccine to be available."

WHO's vaccines advisory committee has recommended that, until there is a fully licensed Ebola vaccine, Merck's experimental vaccine should be used in outbreaks. That vaccine is given in one dose and it triggers a rapid immune response -- characteristics that are needed against such a deadly disease.

So far 2064 people in DRC have received the Merck vaccine in a ring vaccination approach, where contacts of cases, and contacts of the contacts, are offered vaccination in an effort to protect all those who may have been exposed. Healthcare workers, too, have been vaccinated.

At the end of the day, though, on the issue of which vaccines to use the WHO only advises. It is up to individual countries whether they want to follow its recommendations. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said the move by the Chinese is "a harbinger of things to come." Osterholm said that global health aid and assistance is a form of diplomacy. If the current US administration is looking to cut back on what it spends to help developing countries with their health problems, it should expect to see China step in to gain more influence.

"This is the beginning of what I think is a very consequential change in international public health response, with impact on overall global health security," Osterholm said. "By beginning to turn our back on global health security ... we have not understood that those that provide the emergency response and those that provide the vaccines and those that provide the care and treatment are often those who also have access at the table of the highest levels of government for every other thing, including trade, resources and all aspects of regional security."

The news may also cause concern among American and European companies that have long been working on Ebola vaccines and drugs and have struggled to find opportunities to test them during sporadic outbreaks. Janssen, the vaccines division of Johnson & Johnson, has been developing an Ebola vaccine for years and has also been interested in trying to test the product in this outbreak.

Little is known about the Chinese vaccine, which was licensed without a phase 3 trial -- meaning there is no human efficacy data to prove that it is protective. Its approval was based on animal studies and small trials that showed it was safe and induced antibody production in healthy people who received it.

The Merck vaccine was shown to be effective during the West African outbreak, but has still not made its way through the licensure process. "What makes it difficult is that if the Chinese license a product and bring it to a low- or middle-income country ... and we're still trying to evaluate those vaccines and drugs that we believe are important, it may actually create a real challenge," Osterholm said. "The country may well be motivated to use the licensed [Chinese] product, even without potentially the same rigor of evaluation that we're putting our vaccines through."

WHO has in the past asked the Chinese company that makes the vaccine, Tianjin CanSino Biologics, for a chance to review the data that supported its licensure. It also made the same request about an Ebola vaccine that has been made and licensed in Russia. "There have been gaps in those submissions for both those products," Salama said. As such, the WHO's vaccine advisers -- a committee [called] the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization [SAGE] -- has not recommended use of either.

However, at least some of the information requested was shared with the WHO earlier this week [week of 8 Jun 2018]. A working group that advises SAGE on Ebola vaccines met in Geneva to look at data on the Chinese and Russian vaccines, as well as the one made by Janssen. "I understand that some of those gaps were addressed by the submissions for the recent SAGE working group," Salama said.

That group will make recommendations to SAGE, which will review them and then update its advise to WHO. The committee is next scheduled to meet in late October [2018]; Salama was not clear if a special meeting will be called to speed up these deliberations.

The outbreak in the DRC, which was declared a month ago, has slowed markedly, although the health ministry reported a new confirmed case on [Thu 7 Jun 2018], the 1st in about 10 days. The patient, who is in Iboko, was in contact with someone who earlier died of Ebola.

Salama reported [Fri 8 Jun 2018] that transmission may have stalled in the 2 larger centers -- Mbandaka and Bikoro -- in this outbreak, with recent cases occurring in Iboko and Itipo, remove villages only accessible by motorbike. Daily case counts -- a combination of confirmed, probable, and suspect cases -- have fluctuated up and down over the past week or 2. That's because the government has been reporting suspect cases without waiting for confirmatory tests. It is not unusual to see 7 suspect cases reported one day and discarded the next. On [Fri 8 Jun 2018], the government reported 59 cases, 7 of which are suspect cases. The combination of confirmed and probable cases -- people who died before testing began -- provides a clearer picture of the trajectory of the outbreak. That number now stands at 52, with 27 deaths.

[It is commendable that the Chinese government is sending personnel to assist in the Ebola response. But it seems rather late in the outbreak, just as it appears to be slowing down, to test the Chinese vaccine, especially given there is no human efficacy data to prove that it is protective. Of course that is the problem with efficacy testing of vaccines and therapeutics aimed at episodic pathogens that cause outbreaks then recede for years. Companies must be ready to deploy them almost immediately upon a pathogen's emergence.

The comments of Michael Osterholm are extremely important to consider, specifically the discussion on how the US response to global health outbreaks has an impact beyond the outbreaks themselves. It should also be recognized that an effective response to outbreaks depends on support for basic research, as it is innovative research that leads to development of new effective diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines that are rapid and sensitive and specific, and that do not require cold chains, to name a few examples. It is research on ecology and epidemiology that allows modeling of pathogen spread and risk assessment. And research on pathogenesis that allows us to address the disease process itself. Steady funding of such research programs is critical to stop current and future outbreaks. - Mod.LK
