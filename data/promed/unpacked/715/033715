Schistosomiasis epidemic, China
----------------
Zhou Xiaonong, director of the National Institute for the Control of
Parasitic Diseases, based in Shanghai, reported that during the first 6
months of 2003, approximately 200 000 people in China acquired
schistosomiasis, elevating the number of infected people in the country to
one million. This news reactivates the health alerts in a country that has
not yet recovered from the crisis caused by the SARS epidemic, which has
already caused the death of 350 persons.
Schistosomiasis began to spread rapidly in 1998, after the Yangtze river
floods, and, according to the data, the epidemic has flared up over the
past few months. The river has carried the parasite to a large portion of
the territory, and it is estimated that 65 million people are at risk of
acquiring the disease.

Nation battling with [schistosomiasis] epidemic
---------------------------------------
With the public health system still recovering from the SARS epidemic, the
central government is facing a new challenge with rapidly-spreading
schistosomiasis. According to Ministry of Health statistics for 2002 more
than 810 000 Chinese were afflicted with the disease, but the current
number might be over 1 million, said Zhou Xiaonong, deputy director of the
Shanghai-based National Institute for Parasitic Disease Control and
Prevention.
Carried by freshwater snails, schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that
attacks the blood and liver in humans. Over time it can be fatal. Chronic
patients, who account for most [of those] who contract the disease, can
experience high fever, weakness of the limbs, and severe stiffness of the
joints.
Following the flood disaster along the Yangtze River in 1998, the disease
began to spread quickly in some regions along the river, Zhou told China
Daily in a telephone interview yesterday. The majority of the 7 regions
where the disease is not being effectively controlled are located along the
Yangtze and include Central China's Hubei, Hunan, & Jiangxi provinces and
East China's Jiangsu & Jiangxi provinces.
The other 2 regions are Southwest China's Yunnan and Sichuan provinces,
where the disease exists in mountainous areas, Zhou added.
There are 3.52 billion square metres of snail [habitat] in the 7 provinces
with a population of about 65 million people.
Meanwhile, the number of acute schistosomiasis patients has been rapidly
increasing this summer, and if effective measures are not taken
immediately, an epidemic could break out in parts of the Yangtze River
Valley, said Wang Liying, an endemic and verminosis division director
with the Diseases Control Department of the Ministry of Health. A 1992
schistosomiasis control project supported by a loan from the World Bank
basically ended in 1998, said Wang. About 1.6 billion yuan (US $193
million) from the World Bank loan and governmental investment was used to
finance the project, but upon completion investment was sharply reduced in
some areas, Wang noted. Presently, the annual investment of governments at
various levels is less than 70 million yuan (US$8.4 million).
According to the instruction of Vice-Premier Wu Yi at a national health work
conference in July 2003, the Ministry of Health is currently drafting a
programme for battling the disease.

[Schistosomiasis is endemic in 7 provinces of China and is well-known to
increase when flooding occurs. Control is partly based on environmental
measures, depriving the intermediate snail host of its habitat, and partly
on treatment of human cases with praziquantel. - Mod.EP]
