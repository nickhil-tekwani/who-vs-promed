Anthrax, affecting both animals and humans, has caused the deaths of
4 persons who ate contaminated meat in Guinea-Bissau, official sources
from the Guinea-Bissau health sector told AFP on Wednesday [8 Jun
2011].

The Veterinary Services Branch of Guinea-Bissau said in communique
that 3 of the deaths were reported last week [week of 6 Jun 2011] in
Mbunhe a locality in the Bissora area [Oio region] (approximately 70
km [44 mi] north of Bissau).

According to the same source, the victims attended a traditional
circumcision ceremony, [where they ate] meat from an anthrax infected
cow. On Mon [6 Jun 2011], a 4th death from the same disease has been
notified in Biombo (in the west of the country), and this person had
also consumed contaminated meat.

Anthrax was reported in February [2011] in the Bissora sector, and
very quickly spread in the Bafata and Gabu regions, more to the east,
the excellent livestock rearing [part of the country] explained the
director of the Veterinary Services, Bernardo Cassama to AFP.

A total of 50 cattle died in these 2 regions, of which 40 were in
Gabu, which provides much of the meat sold in the capital, Bissau.

Health authorities have called on the population of Guinea-Bissau to
consume only meat certified as fit for consumption by the relevant
departments.

There are many illegal slaughterhouses which are beyond our control.
For this reason we ask people to be vigilant, our agents are in the
field working on a vaccination and education campaign, said Cassama.

Caused by a bacterium called _Bacillus anthracis_, anthrax infects
primarily herbivorous animals, but can occur in other mammals and some
birds. It is transmitted to humans directly or indirectly from
infected animals or by consumption of contaminated products and can
cause death if not treated quickly.

[Anthrax is extensively under-reported by the Guinea-Bissau
authorities. It is revealing that in spite of prior extensive
livestock outbreaks this only got reported when there were 4 human
deaths. And the livestock services are not, apparently, initiating
even a minimal reactive livestock vaccination programme. This is the
1st anthrax report we have posted for Guinea-Bissau. - Mod.MHJ]

[It is now recognized that adherence to the concept of "One Health,
One Medicine" is essential to better control those diseases in animals
that are transmissible to humans. This approach uses the collaboration
of various experts, including those from animal health and human
health. Emerging infectious diseases are mainly zoonoses such as
anthrax, for example. It is essential to ensure good surveillance of
these diseases to be able to better prevent and control them. The
animal health experts and human health experts both at the level of
teaching and research, need support to build trust and strengthen
their capacities in terms of information exchange and collaboration.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European
Centre for Prevention and Disease Control (ECDC) 75 percent of newly
emerging diseases that affected humans are from animal origin. Some of
these agents present a high risk to public health because both of
their pathogenicity to man and the diversity in the means of
transmission which can potentially create a worldwide problem. This
information gives an idea of the magnitude of the "zoonotic pressure"
that is potentially exerted on humans.

Involving both human medicine and veterinary medicine, zoonoses
require an integrated and coordinated approach to epidemiological
surveillance, to collect good quality epidemiological data, put in
place means of detection of emerging diseases, and implement
coordinated control programs between the sectors.
