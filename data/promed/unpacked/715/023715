Czech Republic struggles to combat an outbreak of hepatitis A
-------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hepatitis A has affected the Czech
Republic since July [2008]. Although the
epicenter is still Prague, the disease has
already spread to Central Bohemia, and some cases
were also reported from North Moravia.

Approximately 130 people developed symptoms of
hepatitis A in the Czech Republic in 2007. This
year [2008] approximately 440 cases have been
identified and their number is increasing. The
worst situation is seen in Prague, where some 260
infected individuals have been reported "Dozens
of people are still waiting for the results of
blood tests, so the number of infected could rise
significantly within a week," said Michael Vit,
the Director General of Health Services of the Czech Republic.

The mayor of Prague has taken steps to halt the
spread of the disease. In early September [2008],
a mass vaccination of drug addicts and homeless
people was conducted -- that is, the groups at
highest risk. Recently there have been
approximately 40 000 Euros [USD 58 578.00]
earmarked for the disinfection of primary schools
and public transportation, said the health
councilor, Milan Pesek. "We have gone ahead with
the disinfection of public transport means and
urban primary schools last weekend and will
continue with the measure until the situation improves in Prague," noted Pesek.

Central Bohemia detected about 60 individuals
infected with hepatitis A [virus], the largest
number of which live in the cities of Pardubice
and Hradec Kralove. Also the city of Frydek
Mystek in North Moravia, has reported their 1st
cases. According to Michael Vit, the number of
people infected will continue to grow for a
month, at a minimum, and will culminate in late
October or early November [2008] [Interestingly,
here there was the use of the future tense rather
than the conditional tense, presenting a posture
of certainty that the cases will continue and
also the certainty that the epidemic will end by
the estimated timeframe -- late October or early November 2008 - Mod.MPP].

Hepatitis A is transmitted through [contact with
infected] urine, blood and sexual contact.
Although it [hepatitis A] is not as dangerous as
hepatitis B and C, it has a complicated treatment
and spreads easily. [In the overwhelming majority
of cases, there is no real specific treatment
other than avoidance of contact with hepatotoxic
agents such as acetaminophen, and alcohol to name
a few. - Mod.MPP] To prevent transmission,
experts recommend washing hands frequently and
avoid sharing hygiene and personal use products.

Capital, Central Bohemia see epidemic-level rise of Hepatitis A cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the year the Czech capital
and Central Bohemia have seen a marked increase
in the incidence of hepatitis A, a disease that
can be caught from contaminated food or eating
utensils or other objects. Almost 400 people, now
including a number of school children, have come
down with the disease since January [2008] -Â­ a
jump of epidemic proportions from last year's
128. Although hygiene centres, hospitals and
schools have mobilised against the threat, things
are still expected to get worse before the current epidemic is stifled.

Hepatitis A is known as the "dirty hands" disease
in Czech for the ease with which the disease is
transmitted. But it has been a while since Prague
and surrounding areas saw a rise of the disease
in such proportions. The quarantine ward at
Bulovka Hospital for those infected is packed and
every day several new cases are reported. The
disease, which usually begins with flu-like
symptoms and sometimes jaundice and leads to
inflammation of the liver, has already made its
way into schools: 6 children or youths have also
come down with it. What is behind the dramatic
rise in the number of cases? That's a question I
put to Zdena Jagrova, an epidemiologist at Prague's main Hygiene Office:

"Over the last 10 years the incidence of
hepatitis A in the Czech Republic was quite low:
a large group of people here had never come into
contact with the disease. In Western Europe
incidence of the disease was 5 times higher. East
of the Czech Republic, the numbers far greater.
What has happened is that we have seen a mix
within the population: foreigners, but also
drug-users and the homeless, who have contributed
to the spreading. We have been active in making
sure many individuals in such circles have now
been vaccinated, but unfortunately were unable to
prevent the disease from spreading into the general population."

Anyone not vaccinated against the disease may do
well to now consider queuing up for a shot: as
the number of cases, specialists say, is still
expected to go up. Epidemiologist Zdena Jagrova
again: "Preventive vaccination is of course up to
the individual but under the current
circumstances it's a step I'd recommend. Last
week alone Prague saw 54 new cases, so it's not
likely that this week the number will drop. We
expect it will be several more weeks before the
number of cases begin to decrease."

The disease carries an up to 50-day incubation
period, meaning still more cases are likely. Once
contracted, hepatitis A routinely causes
tiredness and discomfort: patients are required
by their doctor to adhere to a strict diet and to
limit physical activities until the disease has
run its course and patients' health begins to
improve, a process which can take months.

[According to the World Health Organisation
hepatitis A, one of the oldest diseases known to
humankind, is a self-limited disease which
results in fulminant hepatitis and death in only
a small proportion of patients. However, it is a
significant cause of morbidity and socio-economic
losses in many parts of the world. Transmission
of hepatitis A virus is typically by the
faecal-oral route. Infections occur early in life
in areas where sanitation is poor and living
conditions are crowded. With improved sanitation
and hygiene, infections are delayed and
consequently the number of persons susceptible to
the disease increases. Under these conditions
explosive epidemics can arise from faecal
contamination of a single source. As almost all
hepatitis A virus infections are spread by the
faecal-oral route, good personal hygiene, high
quality standards for public water supplies and
proper disposal of sanitary waste have resulted
in a low prevalence of hepatitis A virus
infections in many well developed societies.

In some regions of industrialized countries where
sanitary conditions are variable (Southern and
Eastern Europe), children escape infection in
early childhood. Paradoxically, these improved
economic and sanitary conditions may lead to a
higher disease incidence, as infections occur in
older age groups, and reported rates of
clinically evident hepatitis A are higher.The
rise in hepatitis A cases in the Czech Republic
may be due as much to infrastructural problems as
to the presence of foreign immigrants and
homeless people, particularly since targeting
these groups for vaccination does not seem to be
effective in containing the spread of infection.
