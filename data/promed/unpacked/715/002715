[The HPAI epidemic of 2020-2021 is the largest that has occurred in Europe, with more than 3500 HPAI episodes reported in almost 30 European countries. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. Farmers must apply stringent biosecurity measures. - Mod.PMB
