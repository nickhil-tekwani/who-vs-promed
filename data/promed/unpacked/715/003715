Measles kills 19 oeople in Ondjiva
----------------------------------
Angop (AngolaPress) has learned that at least 19 people died of measles in Ondjiva municipal hospital, southern Cunene province, between August and 13 Nov 2012, out of the 247 cases recorded there. The head of statistics of the hospital, Hilario Ndeudalela, said that the cases of measles affected mostly children.

In 2011, the hospital did not record any case of measles.

[No cases of measles were recorded in Cunene province in 2008, whereas 99 cases were reported in 2009 [ProMED-mail Measles - Angola (CU) 20090827.3023]. In the previous update [Measles update 2012: (40)] it was reported that 19 new cases of measles had been diagnosed at the Onahumba Health Centre in Ondjiva, Cunene province, an increase of 5 cases in 48 hours. The total number of cases has reached 247 now and there have been 19 deaths.

It is apparent that measles remains widespread in Cunene province despite continuing vaccination campaigns. Earlier this year a similar outbreak was reported in Huila province (Measles update 2012 (38) 20121021.1356456).

The province of Cunenen is located in the south-west of Angola. A map showing the locations of the provinces of Angola can be accessed at http://www.atozmapsdata.com/zoomify.asp?name=Country/Modern/Z_Angola_Pol2 - Mod.CP]

Outbreak: child dies of measles, 14 others show symptoms
--------------------------------------------------------
Measles claimed the life of a 3 year old boy in a remote village of upper Swat, where 14 others were brought in with similar symptoms on Wednesday [14 Nov 2012]. The child was a resident of Shahoo village of Kalam. Locals have blamed lack of doctors and unavailability of vaccines at local hospitals for the outbreak. A local resident of Kalam complained that there is no mechanism to conduct vaccination drives in the area. Moreover, he said that due to lack of doctors and medicines at local hospitals, people are denied medical treatment, adding that serious patients have to cover a long distance to [reach] to hospitals in Mingora for treatment.

Meanwhile, Expanded Programme for Immunisation (EPI) coordinator Dr Anwar Jamal refuted these claims. He said that EPI teams routinely conduct door-to-door vaccination drives in all areas of upper Swat. "If a case of measles surfaces in the area, special vaccination campaigns are conducted there," he added. He dismissed claims that there is a shortage of measles vaccine, adding that the EPI teams have stocked measles vaccines for over 2 months. When contacted, executive district officer health Dr Khurshid said he has directed the EPI coordinator to take immediate steps to control the situation. He said that in addition to regular teams, emergency teams have been dispatched to conduct vaccination drives in the area. So far, 350 children in the area have been vaccinated, he added.

Just 2 months back, a more pronounced outbreak of measles was reported in Kalam in which more than 100 children were affected. Locals had blamed the lack of doctors and "weak" immunisation campaigns for the outbreak. They maintained that the Central Hospital in Kalam lacks the required health facilities. They had asked the health department to establish permanent vaccination centres in Kalam -- a demand that remains to be fulfilled.

[Swat is the name of a river valley and an administrative district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, near that Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It has recently been a conflict zone and it is not surprising that there have been difficulties in conducting vaccination campaigns and surveillance. Under the prevailing circumstances the number of cases of measles is surprisingly low.

Measles prompts health warning in The Hills and Western Sydney, New South Wales
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Residents in The Hills and western Sydney have been warned about an outbreak of measles after 2 teenagers were diagnosed last week. Sydney Local Health District [SLD] said on 3 and 4 Nov 2012 that a 17 year old female from Marayong and an 18 year old female from Doonside were diagnosed with measles and isolated in 2 different hospitals.

In all 170 cases have been confirmed in this outbreak, mostly in western and south western Sydney. Dr Vicky Sheppeard of the SLD said measles is easily spread, warning residents to be careful and watch out for symptoms. "We encourage people who recently visited the areas of Doonside, Westpoint Blacktown and Rouse Hill Shopping Villages to be vigilant in looking for symptoms of measles," she said. "Measles is one of the most easily-spread diseases and just being in the same room with someone with measles can result in infection. The local health district has isolated and treated these patients and has made contact with people who have associated with these people recently."

The rash starts on the face and then spreads over the body and will last 4 to 7 days. "Anyone who develops these symptoms should seek advice from their GP [general practitioner]," Dr Sheppeard said. "We ask that people ring ahead to say that they could have measles and ask to be seated in a separate waiting room to avoid spreading the disease to others. "It's important for people who haven't been immunised to watch out for these symptoms as they may have come in contact with the disease."

[The continued occurrence of measles virus infection in young adults in the Sydney area of New South Wales is indicative of past failure to achieve comprehensive vaccination of the human population.

Rouse Hill is a suburb of the city of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Rouse Hill is located 42 kilometres (26 miles) north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of The Hills Shire.
