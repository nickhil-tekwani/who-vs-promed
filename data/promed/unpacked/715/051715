With the heavy rains of recent months, leptospirosis or rat disease is back. This disease according to the letter from the ARS [Agence Régionale de Santé/Regional Health Agency] of [25 Mar 2022], has already caused one death, and several patients are currently in intensive care. On average, about 40 cases are diagnosed each year in French Guiana.

About 10 cases in February [2022] and as many in March [2022], 3 to 4 times more than usual for about 6 weeks, are diagnosed. The last episode of grouped cases dates back to May 2020. Most of the patients live in Cayenne; cases have also been identified in Rémire-Montjoly.

"We have a larger number of cases. In a very short period between suspicions and confirmations, we have had between 10 and 15 cases per month since the end of January [2022] at the Cayenne hospital. When there are greater amounts of water, such as in recent weeks, there are increasing incidences. It's known. These larger quantities of water lead to prolonged contact with humans. In French Guiana, we do not have a significant impact as in the West Indies or Reunion. The thresholds remain correct despite this upsurge. However, it is necessary to call for vigilance, wear shoes, and protect homes in the event of flooding and nearby landfills."

The heavy rains of recent months have generated floods, near wild dumps, in informal neighborhoods where rats swarm. An explosive cocktail. Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease whose main reservoirs are rodents, in particular rats. They shed the bacteria in their urine. _Leptospira_, which looks like a small worm, the size of a bacterium, is very resistant. As a result, it is enough to have a small cut or a wound on the foot and to walk in sandals or flip-flops in a contaminated puddle, to be infected.

"The reservoir is the rodents, important elements in the transmission, in the sense that they will transport this bacterium which will end up in external environments, muddy water for example. The infection will be either by direct contact with the skin or by lesions, wounds. There can be transmission by other animals, themselves contaminated by rodents."
- Professor Pierre Demar Magalie, CHC Laboratory, Infectious and Tropical Diseases Units, CHC.

Leptospirosis is treated with antibiotics and its incubation period is 3 to 10 days. There is a vaccine that only immunizes against one form _Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae_; immunity lasts about 2 years.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is widely distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in the urine of chronically infected animals may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Mice, as well as rats, can carry _Leptospira_ in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401/).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against _Leptospira_ infection is predominantly serovar-specific. Different leptospiral serovars may be prevalent in particular geographical regions.

Human activities that place people at increased risk of leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, swimming in rivers and other water sports, gardening or farming, and working in piggeries (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease, such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805) for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this. However, a Cochrane review of clinical research testing whether taking doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis found that data from trials, which "targeted different kinds of people -- travelers and people who live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students -- did not support the practice in all cases, though short-term travelers with a potential for high risk exposure may be helped." (http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/userfiles/ccoch/file/Water%20safety/CD007342.pdf).

Although vaccines are available for immunizing non-human animals against some serovars of _Leptospira_ and are available in some countries for humans, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans in the US.

French Guiana (pop. Almost 300 000 residents in 2022) is one of the overseas regions of France (together with Martinique, Guadeloupe, La Reunion, and Mayotte) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_France); it is located on the northern Atlantic coast of South America and half of its population live in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana). A map showing the location of Cayenne and Remire-Montjoly, a suburb of Cayenne, can be seen at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cayenne,+French+Guiana. - Mod.ML
