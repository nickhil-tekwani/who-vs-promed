Spatial Patterns of Anthrax Outbreaks and Cases among Livestock in Lesotho, 2005-2016
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND: Although anthrax occurs globally, the burden of the disease remains particularly high in Africa. Furthermore, the disease anthrax has significant public health and economic implications. However, sufficient attention has not been given to the geographic distribution of anthrax outbreaks and cases in Lesotho. Therefore, this study investigates the spatial patterns of anthrax outbreaks and cases among livestock in Lesotho from 2005 to 2016.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was adopted to realize the objectives of this study using retrospective data of anthrax outbreaks and cases recorded by the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) between 2005 and 2016. Anthrax outbreaks were geo-coded at village level and aggregated at district level. Proportions and 95% CI of anthrax outbreaks and cases by village and district were calculated. Cartographic maps displaying the distribution of anthrax outbreaks and cases at village and district level were constructed.

RESULTS: A total of 38 outbreaks were reported over the study period, and they were clustered in the Lowlands districts of Lesotho. Most outbreaks (52.6%, 20/38) in livestock were reported in the Maseru district. The Leribe district reported the lowest proportions of outbreaks (5.3%, 2/38) and cases (0.6%, 3/526). At the village level, 18% (7/38) of outbreaks were in Maseru Urban, followed by Ratau (16%, 6/38) and Mofoka (13%, 5/38). The Maseru district reported the highest (1.3%, 369/29 070) proportion of cases followed by Mafeteng (0.9%, 73/8530). The village with the most cases was Kolo (10.5%, 21/200), followed by Thaba-Chitja (7.7%, 33/430).

CONCLUSION: Anthrax outbreaks and cases exclusively occur in the Lowlands districts of Lesotho, with villages such as Mahobong, Pitseng, Kolo, and Thaba-Chitja having a higher risk of anthrax disease. Findings of the present study have serious public health implications in light of the fact that between 2003 and 2008 Lesotho's main abattoir was closed; hence, most of the meat in Lesotho was imported and/or sourced from the informal slaughter facilities. Much larger studies are needed to further investigate factors contributing to spatial disparities in anthrax outbreaks and cases observed in this study. Findings of the present study can be used to guide the formulation of a policy on prevention and control of anthrax in Lesotho.

[This is a vital first step in developing an efficient control & surveillance. Maps are easily read and understood, and will generate community support for when annual livestock vaccination and suspect death reporting becomes compulsory. Also when cases & deaths occur outside the defined areas, they generate more efficient investigations and sometimes the need to redefine the master risk map. The next stage is to carry out an ecological niche mapping to have a more rigorous appreciation of where the spores will survive and where outbreaks may be occurring unobserved and unreported. One should remember that anthrax is a disease which if efficiently controlled also achieves eradication. Although many believe the anthrax spores are immortal, they are not. Essentially spore survival can only occur in alkaline soils with a high calcium content. And even in those soils the spores die. If you go 8 years without an outbreak, they are gone. - Mod.MHJ
