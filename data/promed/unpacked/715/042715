[Ref: K Chittarath et al (2021): First report of _Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus_ and Cassava Mosaic Disease in Laos. Plant Disease 105, first look; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-09-20-1868-PDN]
------------------------------------------
Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) cultivation [in Laos] has expanded. Vegetative seed (stakes) is rapidly multiplied and distributed. One of the most important diseases affecting cassava is Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) disseminated by infected stakes. _Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus_ (SLCMV) is the species causing CMD in Southeast Asia (SEA) and is widespread in Cambodia [ProMED-mail post 20180607.5844264], Viet Nam [ProMED-mail post 20190304.6349348], Thailand and south China.

[In] July 2020, the team surveyed 8 fields along the border with Cambodia, provinces of Attapeu and Champassack, and identified CMD symptoms in one of the Champassack fields. From the 8 fields, [leaf] samples were collected from every 3rd plant for PCRs targeting the [SLCMV] AV1 and BV1 genes.

Out of 60 samples for the Champassack field, 11 (18.3%) [were] PCR positive, but only 4 plants (6.7%) showed symptoms of CMD. None of the samples in the other 7 fields had CMD symptoms nor was SLCMV detected. The presence of CMD symptoms in old leaves of the plants in the affected field suggests that the virus was introduced with contaminated stakes. The complete bipartite genome of one isolate (Champ1), was sequenced. The sequences of the DNA-A and DNA-B components were nearly identical to those of a SLCMV isolate from Cambodia (99.72% for DNA-A and 99.82 for DNA-B). Phylogenetic analysis grouped Champ1 with the cluster of SEA isolates that contain the shorter version of the rep gene which is involved in host responses to SLCMV.

The confirmation of CMD and SLCMV in the border [region] between Laos and Cambodia should be followed by disease containment and management strategies, particularly given that the majority cassava varieties grown in Laos are from neighbor countries, most of which have already reported the presence of CMD.

----------------------------------------
_African Cassava Mosaic Virus_ (ACMV) is one of the major diseases affecting cassava in Sub-Saharan Africa. A survey was conducted [in] 2019 in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Niger and Benue states of the Guinea savannah vegetation zone of Nigeria, to assess the incidence and distribution of ACMV. A total of 81 farms were visited from where 2025 symptomatic and asymptomatic leaf samples (25 per farm) were collected randomly. Fields were assessed for disease incidence and severity by visual observation. FCT had the highest incidence (62%) while Benue had the lowest (18%). FCT also recorded the highest severity while Benue had the lowest.

Samples were subjected to PCR. Further phylogenic sequencing was done to determine the diversity among the isolates obtained. After molecular indexing, FCT recorded the highest incidence of ACMV (22.22%), while no ACMV was recorded in Benue state. The analysis reveals a high diversity among the isolates in the areas surveyed.

This study indicates the presence of ACMV in the Guinea Savannah vegetation zone. [It] has confirmed that cassava Mosaic Disease could be a threat to cassava in the zone [and], therefore, the need for quick diagnosis.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has triggered food emergencies in the past by destroying cassava crops throughout whole regions. It is caused by a number of species and strains in the large genus _Begomovirus_ which seem to be associated with it in different areas (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20160623.4304471). Co-infections as well as genetic recombination between strains have also been reported and recombinant strains can be particularly virulent.

CMD symptoms include leaf mosaic, distortion and stunting of plants, leading to severe reduction of tuber yields. The CMD viruses are spread by whitefly vectors and with infected plant material (including seed tubers, as mentioned in item 1). At least one of the viruses (_African cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in an unrelated alternative host (soybean) suggesting that these viruses may have a wider host reservoir and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Disease management for begomoviruses usually relies on use of resistant crop cultivars, control of their vectors and control of pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants.

Because most traditional cassava cultivars are susceptible to CMD, varieties resistant to different viral strains are being developed for local use. In Africa, this has alleviated the problem in some areas, but in others, the new varieties are being wiped out by cassava brown streak (CBS) disease (caused by viruses in the genus _Ipomovirus_ which are transmitted like CMD). A new CBS viral strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742). Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in affected regions (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643).
