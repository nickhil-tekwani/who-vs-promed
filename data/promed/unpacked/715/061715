13 schoolchildren were hospitalized in Chechnya's Shelkovskoi district
Tuesday, with symptoms of an unknown disease, the emergency situations
center of the southern region told Itar-Tass.
"4 children in the village of Staroglazovskaya are in grave condition. They
have fever, headache and numbness in the limbs, but there's no vomiting,
diarrhea or high temperature," the duty officer said.
The 1st reports about an outbreak of the disease came on 16 Dec 2005. At
that time, 12 pupils of the local school together with 2 teachers were
rushed to the village hospital.
Specialists ruled out food poisoning. Head of the Shelkovskoi district
administration Khusein Nukhayev suggested that the cause is a poison gas,
but its type has defied analysis so far.
A mobile laboratory is to arrive at the village from Rostov-on-Don on
Tuesday. The school has been closed for toxicity expert examination. A
group of doctors from Chechnya's disaster medicine center is working at the
scene.
Chechen prosecutors instituted criminal proceedings over breach of sanitary
and epidemiological norms.

13 children have been hospitalized with food poisoning in Chechnya during
the latest 24 hours. 4 children were staying in severe condition, doctors
said. The latest incident in Chechnya followed the previous hospitalization
of another group of children.
All the patients, majority of them girls, have similar symptoms: fatigue,
asphyxia and headache.
Specialists have not yet identified the type of poison, which affected the
schoolchildren. "A toxicological examination of the patients is required to
diagnose the disease," a Chechen doctor said.
Massive outbreaks of similar diseases have been registered in the same
region of the Chechen Republic 3 times during the past autumn. The symptoms
in all of the 3 incidents were identical, local doctors said.
13 schoolchildren and 2 teachers have been hospitalized in Chechnya's
Grozny since 16 Dec 2005.
Most patients were discharged by Monday, but they were replaced with
another group of sick schoolchildren the same day, Interfax reports.
Specialists say that the reason was not food, which did produce a massive
outbreak of poisoning in Chechnya. None of the hospitalized children has
eaten at the school canteen. In addition, the patients' symptoms show that
the poisoning was caused by toxic substances with neuroparalytic or
psychotropic action.

An outbreak of unknown disease has sickened 31 people in the Chechen
village of Shelkovskaya. 6 pupils, a teacher and a charwoman have been
hospitalized, head of the district security department Kazebek Gatsayev
told Itar-Tass on Tuesday.
"2 children in serious condition were rushed to a hospital in Grozny;
others are in the Shelkovskoi district hospital," Gatsayev said.
The patients show the same symptoms as the 13 schoolchildren who were taken
to hospital in the village of Starogladovskaya on Monday.
In Starogladovskaya, 4 villagers are in serious condition. They are
feverish, and have headache and numbness in their limbs.
The first reports about an outbreak of the disease came on 16 Dec 2005. At
that time, 12 pupils from the Starogladovskaya school together with 2
teachers were rushed to the village hospital.
Specialists ruled out food poisoning. Head of the Shelkovskoi district

[This undiagnosed illness seems to be spreading and seems to be affecting
young people more than older individuals. The symptoms presented in this
article do not jump out at me as having any specific disease association.
I am interested in the results of a toxic panel screen. There is indication
in the article that a tox screen has been run, but no results are included.
We would be interested in these results as well as the results of any other
tests. - Mod.TG]
