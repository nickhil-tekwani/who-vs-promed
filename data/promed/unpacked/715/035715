Florida veterinarians are reporting a troubling spike in cases of a potentially fatal bacterial infection among dogs -- which can be spread to humans.

The disease, leptospirosis, can infect dogs, raccoons, rodents, cattle, pigs and horses. Though it's preventable through a vaccine, many veterinarians don't routinely vaccinate for the bacteria.

"Until recently, we really didn't see any cases here," said veterinarian Carsten Bandt, head of emergency and critical-care services at the University of Florida Small Animal Hospital. "In the 7 years leading up to last August [2013], we had none. Now we have seen 12 cases" -- including at least 2 from Orlando.

The hospital treats only advanced cases referred by other veterinarians. At that point, the disease has turned life-threatening.

Leptospirosis -- often simply called lepto -- typically begins in both humans and dogs with vague and flulike signs, starting with fever. But if untreated with antibiotics, the infection can lead to kidney and liver failure, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord) and severe respiratory distress.

Some veterinary experts think the prevalence of lepto is probably much higher than veterinarians realize because so few dogs are tested for infection and there is no official tracking of animal cases. Kidney failure in senior dogs, for instance, potentially caused by lepto, is usually dismissed as old age.

"Testing is rare," said Anthony Ishak, internal-medicine specialist at Blue Pearl in Tampa, which operates a 24-hour emergency and specialty veterinary hospital. "Overall, it's a conversation most dog owners need to have with their local vet on whether to vaccinate. You need to consider the dog's lifestyle, potential exposure, whether there has been a recent outbreak in your area and whether you have kids who could be exposed."

Humans can be infected through cuts in their skin or by ingesting something contaminated. In 2005, a group of 43 international adventure racers competing near Tampa became infected after swimming in bacteria-laden waters.

In dogs, the risk is greatest for those who play outdoors with other dogs, like to swim in lakes and ponds or romp through the woods. That's because the bacteria, excreted in urine, survive best in water. Bandt suspects heavy rainfall may have led to the most recent outbreak.

But Rick Marrinson, owner and medical director of Longwood Veterinary Clinic, notes that any dog who ventures outdoors can be exposed. "It's a disease carried by wild animals that can be totally nonsymptomatic," he said. "So that raccoon or that possum comes in your yard, urinates on your grass overnight, and your dog goes out the next morning and starts sniffing around and gets exposed -- without ever seeing that animal."

His practice routinely promotes the lepto vaccine and its booster for prevention. But he said many colleagues don't bring it up with clients. That's because, of all dog vaccines -- rabies, distemper, parvovirus, kennel cough -- the lepto vaccine is most likely to provoke an adverse reaction, especially in small, shorthaired breeds such as shorthaired Dachshunds. The reaction itself is easily treatable with Benadryl, Marrinson said. But it is dramatic.

"The face swells up, their eyes get puffy, they get hives and they may vomit," Marrinson said. "Even though it's very rarely life-threatening, owners get pretty freaked out."

For that reason, he tends to administer lepto vaccines in the morning so the dogs can be monitored and, if there's a problem, brought back to his office before closing time.

According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leptospirosis is rarely fatal in humans in the United States, where an average of 100 to 200 people become infected each year, because they seek medical help. About half of those cases are in Hawaii.

"The bottom line is that lepto is both a preventable and a treatable disease," Ishak said. "If your dog gets it, the sooner you treat it, the higher the likelihood that the animal will recover from it. And the less shedding you'll have of the bacteria into the environment, which could expose other animals and people."

What dog owners need to know:

Leptospirosis is a potentially deadly bacterial infection that can be spread through water and moist, contaminated soil. Dogs most at risk are those who play with other dogs or in water or woods.

Infection is preventable through a yearly vaccine that costs USD 20 to USD 35 but can provoke an allergic reaction in some breeds. The reaction can be treated with Benadryl, but all dogs should be monitored after vaccination. The infection itself is treatable if caught early enough.

The infection can be spread to humans through cuts or ingestion -- such as swallowing water while swimming in a contaminated lake. Initial signs vary but typically include fever and can mimic the flu. Experts recommend discussing the vaccine with your dog's veterinarian.

[For the last several years, most state and national veterinary conventions have been reminding veterinarians of leptospirosis and of the new and safer vaccines available.
