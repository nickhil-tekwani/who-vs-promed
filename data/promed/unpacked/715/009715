[The following comment published in posting 20161027.4590589 is applicable here:

"The following information was obtained from a publication titled "Rabies in Kazakhstan" by Sultanov, A. A., Abdrakhmanov, S. K., Abdybekova, A. M., Karatayev, B. S., & Torgerson, P. R. (2016), published in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. The complete article is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4972401/pdf/pntd.0004889.pdf

"This study demonstrates that in Kazakhstan there is a substantial economic cost and health impact of rabies. These costs could be reduced by modifying the vaccination programme that is now practised. The study also fills some data gaps on the epidemiology and economic effects of rabies in respect to Kazakhstan.

Rabies is a fatal viral zoonotic disease largely transmitted to humans from bites by infected animals. Rabies is currently registered in over 100 countries in all continents except Australia and Antarctica. The disease is characterized by neuroencephalitis with 100 perfect case fatality ratio once clinical signs present. Over 55 000 people and over 1 million animals die from rabies annually throughout the world. Direct losses from rabies amount to over EURO 4 billion each year.

Human rabies presents a serious public health threat in Kazakhstan. It is a reportable disease and public health data is available to quantify numbers of cases. Kazakhstan is an upper middle-income country. Previous published data suggested that between 2007 and 2011, 44 cases of human rabies were recorded or a mean of 9 cases per year. Of these, 40 were the result of contact with dogs, 3 cases from contact with cats and 1 case from a fox. The incidence of dog bites was reported as 3700 per million population in 2010 and 4130 per million population in 2011. Post exposure prophylaxis was given to 57 000 individuals in 2009, 59 000 in 2010 and 67 000 in 2011.

Like many endemic countries, animal rabies is registered annually within Kazakhstan. There is also a programme of vaccination of domestic dogs, cats and agricultural animals and a limited programme to vaccinate foxes through the distribution of vaccine impregnated baits. However, a reduction in the disease incidence in animals has not been observed. Thus, one of the objectives of this study was to better understand the epidemiology of rabies by examining the geographical distribution of rabies amongst animals in the country and to evaluate control measures.

The economic and disease burden of rabies has also not been previously estimated specifically for Kazakhstan, although estimates, based on modelling, are available from the global burden of rabies study (GBR). Surveillance data on the number of cases of human rabies, the incidence of animal bites and the numbers of individuals undergoing post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) were used to obtain more precise estimates of the burden of disease. In addition, data from the number of bites received from confirmed rabid animals was used to estimate the burden of disease avoided by the use of PEP and its cost effectiveness. Finally, the economic effects of the disease were estimated from the costs of the animal vaccination programme, the costs of control of potentially rabid animals, the costs of PEP, the loss of income through premature death and the cost of livestock lost to rabies." - Mod.CRD
