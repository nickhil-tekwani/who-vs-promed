NZ concern about typhoid in Samoa
-----------------------------
New Zealand health officials say they are concerned about an outbreak of
typhoid in Samoa. Our New Zealand correspondent Gillian Bradford says more
than 200 Samoans have contracted the disease so far this year.

New Zealand's health authorities are concerned their Samoan counterparts
failed to tell them their country was in the midst of a typhoid
outbreak. Most of the cases were recorded between May and June 2002, but
the New Zealand health ministry says it's only just been informed of the
outbreak.

The ministry's public health advisor Doug Lush says one New Zealand tourist
has been affected, and if the ministry had known earlier, it might have
issued a health warning.

Hundreds of Samoans living in New Zealand usually fly home for Christmas,
and officials are urging them to get immunized or take extra precautions
such as boiling their drinking water.

[ProMED would appreciate more information regarding this outbreak of
typhoid fever on Samoa. In particular, which islands are affected, the
epidemiology of the outbreak, and the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of
the isolate(s). - Mod.LL]

[The recommendation for vaccination as part of the preventive measures is
interesting, as the current vaccines available have an average vaccine
efficacy of approximately 70 percent (see references below). Checking the
CDC website (and the WHO website), one finds the recommendation that
*travellers* to endemic/epidemic regions might also consider vaccination,
with the descriptions of the vaccines summarized (on the CDC website) as:

"Two typhoid vaccines are currently available for use in the United States:
(1) an oral, live, attenuated vaccine, manufactured from the Ty21a strain
of _S. typhi_ and (2) a Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine (ViCPS) for
parenteral use. Both vaccines have been shown to protect 50 percent to 80
percent of recipients."
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/typhoid.htm>

In addition, there is a comment in the technical information section on
typhoid fever (dated December 2001: "The role of new and effective vaccines
as control measures for epidemics and as tools for elimination remains to
be explored."
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/typhoidfever_t.htm>

One hopes that at the time of vaccination of those opting to receive
typhoid vaccine, there is education on the need for other prudent food and
water contact behaviors to prevent disease, as the vaccine efficacy of the
current vaccines available is still not optimal to ensure close to total
protection. See the following URL for an excellent discussion of prudent
food and water contact behaviors to prevent disease.
