SALMONELLA IN LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION 1996
This booklet presents data on salmonella collected and collated by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food during 1996 and also provides
data from previous years for comparison purposes.
Chapters included are:
REASON FOR SAMPLING & PLACE OF SAMPLING
Number of incidents recorded by reason for test and place of sampling in
1996 for slaughterhouses and premises other than slaughterhouses.
Examinations of the tables given under this chapter confirm that only a
proportion of the isolations of salmonella reported to the Ministry came
from incidents of clinical disease. This is particularly striking in the
case of poultry where most of the isolations have been made as a result of
a statutory monitoring programme or as a result of surveillance activities.
In contrast, the majority of isolates of salmonella from other species have
been made as a result of examinations carried out to diagnoses clinical
disease.
REPORTS OF SALMONELLA IN LIVESTOCK, CATTLE, SHEEP, PIGS AND POULTRY
Salmonella/_S. typhimurium_/_S. enteritidis_ on farms and premises other
than slaughterhouses, incidents and isolations by serotype, plus incidents
and isolations of _S. typhimurium_ by definitive type and _S. enteritidis_
by phage type.
Figures here show that the total number of both incidents of salmonella
reported to Officers of the Minister fell in 1996. This is largely due to a
reduction in the number of incidents of _S. typhimurium DT104_ in all
species except chickens and adult cattle. There was a continued reduction
in incidents of _S. dublin_ in adult cattle and a reduction in calves. The
decrease in the number of incidents of _S. enteritidis_ in turkeys, ducks
and geese also continued.
REPORTS OF SALMONELLA IN LIVESTOCK PRODUCTS
Isolations from slaughterhouses & human food premises, by serotype.
Examination of the tables reveal that almost all of these isolates were
made as a result of the monitoring of poultry meat products, and, not
surprisingly, the serotypes of salmonella reported are similar in chickens.
Figures show that the total number of isolations from livestock products in
1996 fell by 45% from the 1995 total, due in large to a marked decrease in
the number of isolations of _S. mbandaka_ in poultry
REPORTS OF SALMONELLA IN ANIMAL FEEDINGSTUFFS
Contamination rates, isolations from various categories of feedingstuffs,
top serotypes of salmonella isolated from compound feed and the major
serotypes isolated from feedingstuff ingredients. PROCESSED ANIMAL PROTEIN
ORDER - contamination rates and serotypes isolated from testing of home
produced and imported processed animal protein.
This chapter contains expanded information on isolates of _S. enteritidis_
and _S. typhimurium_ made from animal feedstuffs. They show that the number
of isolations of these serotypes from feedingstuffs are very low. The
number of isolations of _S. typhimurium_ made from compounded animal
feedstuffs fell for the second year running, although the number of reports
still remains higher than for several years. The results from the statutory
official testing of domestic processed animal protein show that the
contamination rate rose in 1996 but still remained below the artificially
high level of 1994, which was caused by a number of official investigations
at specific premises. The contamination rate for imported processed animal
protein appears higher than for domestically produced material, but testing
is biased towards those consignments most likely to be contaminated.

ANTIMICROBIAL SENSITIVITY IN SALMONELLAS
S.dublin, S.typhimurium, other salmonellas and all salmonellas
_Salmonella dublin_: 99.7% were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobial drugs.
This has been the situation since surveillance began in 1971 and is of
interest because most isolates come from cattle. _Salmonella typhimurium_:
73.9% were DT104 and it's variants. Only 10.8% of the cultures were
sensitive to all the antimicrobials tested, which is a slight increase on
the 7.6% in the previous year.
