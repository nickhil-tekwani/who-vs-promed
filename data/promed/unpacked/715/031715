Steve O'Brien's group at NCI [National Cancer Institute, National
Institutes of Health, USA - Mod. pc] has studied in detail the effects of
population bottlenecks and inbreding on loss of genetic variability and
various immunological parameters and infectious disease processes in
African cheetahs.
For example, reciprocal skin grafts preformed on unrelated African cheetahs
failed to show rapid graft rejection and showed little evidence of slow
rejection. The observation that inbred cheetahs are unable to distinguish
allografts from autografts (although they do reject xenografts from
domestic cats) suggests they lack variation at the MHC and have little
variation in the "minor histocompatibility complex" loci.

This and other electorphoretic evidence for reduced genetic
variability, in effect makes these cheetahs much like genetic clones at
these loci. And inbreeding does indeed appear to impact infectious disease
processes: A retrospective study of an epizootic involving feline
coronavirus among cheetahs in an Oregon zoo revealed that 90% showed
clinical signs of feline infectious peritonitis, with 50-60% mortality.
This is described as "the most extreme response to an FIP virus infection
to date in any feline species [p.1433]."
References: O'Brien et al., 1985 "Genetic basis of species vulnerability in
the cheetah," Science 227: 1428-1434.
Also, O'Brien and Evermann, 1988, Trends in Research in Ecology and
Evolution 3(10), Oct. 1988, 254-259, discuss a canine distemper epizootic
among bottle-necked black-footed ferrets exhibiting reduced genetic
variability, and of a sheep pneumovirus (RSV) epizootics among highly
fragmented populations of bighorn sheep, again with reduced levels of
genetic variation.

Finally, it seems to me that a fundamental point raised by recent success
in sheep (and monkey) cloning has been overlooked. The initial comment made
in ProMED-mail focussed attention on the potentially "important limitation
imposed by infectious disease" inherent in cloning domesticated animals,
namely, of decimating an entire population of susceptible, genetically
idential clones or resulting in a hyper-virulent strain of virus. However,
we should also realize that entirely new avenues of research on the
genetics of infectious disease susceptibility will be opened by the ability
to clone genetically identical research animals.
Furthermore, inbreeding itself is so not of direct interest, except insofar
as inbreeding reflects individuals likely to share copies of a particular
gene which confers susceptibility or resistance to an infectious disease.
The recent finding that individuals homozygous for a mutant allele at the
CCR-5 locus (the co-receptor for macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1)
appear to be protected from infection despite multiple exposure, is
a case in point. That is, the development of the ability to clone
research animals of defined genotype will give genetic epidemiologists
interested in infectious disease tremendous prospects for future research.
[Thanks very much for this information-rich and thoughtful summary of the
implications of cloning for infectious diseases.- Mod. pc]
