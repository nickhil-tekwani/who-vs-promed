China says boy tests positive for bird flu- HK paper
-----------------
A senior Chinese official says H5N1 antibodies have been detected in
a 9-year-old boy in Hunan province, the 1st admission of a human bird
flu infection in China, the South China Morning Post reported on
Wednesday [16 Nov 2005 - time zone difference accounts for this being
posted on 15 Nov 2005 at GMT-5 - Mod.MPP].
The paper, quoting Qi Xiaoqiu, director of the Ministry of Health's
department of disease control, said the government was waiting for
the results of a joint investigation with the World Health
Organisation before confirming whether the boy was the 1st human case
of avian influenza on the mainland.
"During the early stage, antibodies were not found, but now the boy
is positive to antibody tests," the paper quoted Qi as saying.
"We are waiting for the advice of the WHO. The WHO has a set of
procedures to confirm a case and it usually takes 2 laboratories to confirm."
He and his 12-year-old sister fell ill last month and were treated
for pneumonia symptoms. The boy was discharged from hospital last
weekend but his sister died.
Chinese officials said initial tests showed she had tested negative
for bird flu.
The WHO is sending a team this week to the southern province of Hunan
to investigate the cases, which China later said could not be ruled
out as bird flu. The children lived close to the site of a poultry outbreak.
The H5N1 virus has killed more than 60 people elsewhere in Asia since
2003. Almost all had been in close contact with infected birds.

[According to the headlines of the South China Morning Post "A senior
Chinese official has revealed that H5N1 antibodies have been detected
in a 9-year-old boy in Hunan province - the 1st admission of a human
bird flu infection on the mainland." <http://www.scmp.com/>. The
mention of the need for a 2nd laboratory confirmation suggests that
the serologic testing was done by a laboratory in China (either at
the National level in Beijing or at the Provincial level in
Hunan). The 9 year old referred to above is one of the 3 suspected
cases that were under further investigation with WHO (the other 2
cases were his sister -- a 12 year old girl who died, and a 36 year
old teacher who recovered). The Chinese Ministry of Health is to be
commended for the transparency in reporting of findings.
This does represent the 1st confirmation of H5N1 infection on the
Chinese mainland. Readers are reminded of the H5N1 infection
confirmed in a 9 year old boy and his 33 year old father who had
returned from Fujian Province to Hong Kong in February 2003 (see
references below). The boy survived, his father died and his 12 year
old sister had died of an undiagnosed respiratory illness in Fujian
prior to their return to Hong Kong. At that time, the source of
infection was speculated to be in Fujian province where the family
had been visiting, but it was never confirmed. - Mod.MPP]
