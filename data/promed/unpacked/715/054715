The Department of Health (DOH) in the Cordilleras has recorded 8 confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis in the region this year [2018].

DOH-Cordillera Medical Officer Dr. Alexis Marrero said that of the 8; 2 came from Benguet, one from Baguio City while the remaining 5 cases came from outside the Cordillera region and were all admitted in the hospital.

Japanese encephalitis is an infection of the brain caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus. While most infections result in little or no symptoms, occasional inflammation of the brain occurs. Symptoms include headache, vomiting, fever, confusion and seizures which occur about 5 to 15 days after infection. The disease was 1st described in 1871.

Based on the 2015-2017 records of DOH-Cordillera, it listed 75 confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis in the region with 12 cases coming from Benguet, 8 from Baguio City, 3 in Kalinga and Mountain Province, 2 in Abra and Ifugao while the remaining 45 cases come from outside the Cordillera region.

Japanese encephalitis is believed to be caused [transmitted] by mosquitoes, particularly those of the _Culex_ type. Pigs and wild birds serve as a reservoir for the virus. The disease mostly occurs outside of cities while diagnosis is based on blood or cerebrospinal fluid testing.

Japanese encephalitis can be prevented through vaccine.

Records from the World Health Organization said about 68 000 symptomatic cases occur a year with about 17 000 deaths.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occur sporadically in various parts of the Philippines, including Luzon Island. This is the 1st report of JE on Luzon this year (2018). On Luzon Island last year (2017), as of August 2017, the Department of Health (DOH) had recorded a total of 149 cases of JE with at least 22 cases in noted Pampanga, the highest in the Central Luzon region (see Japanese encephalitis - Philippines: (PM) 20170818.5257940). The above report does not mention if any JE vaccination campaigns have been carried out so far this year (2018).

The Cordillera Administrative Region is located in Central Luzon and consists of Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mountain Provinces, as well as portions of eastern Ilocos Norte, eastern Ilocos Sur, eastern La Union, northeastern Pangasinan, western Nueva Vizcaya, and western Cagayan.

JE virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. It is caused by a virus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. Ardeid birds (including herons) are the reservoir species in nature.
