SARS-CoV-2 in animals (inf. with), United Kingdom
-------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 29 Nov 2021
Ended: 7 Dec 2021
Confirmed: 15 Dec 2021
Reported: 22 Dec 2021
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Event morbidity (%): 100
Event mortality: -
Zoonotic potential: no
Diagnostic details: clinical, laboratory test
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: South West England, Surrey, England
Started: 29 Nov 2021
Ended: 7 Dec 2021
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Dogs / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: A 44 kg [97 lb] pet Labrador dog, 4-year-old neutered male (the only pet present) from a COVID-19 positive household, was admitted to a veterinary hospital on 3 Dec 2021. The dog presented with gastric and respiratory clinical signs, including vomiting and diarrhea, inappetence, lethargy, coughing and a slightly increased body temperature, increased heart rate and abdominal distention. The dog was given supportive treatment. Unfortunately, on 7 Dec 2021 the dog's condition deteriorated and he died. Further official tests were performed at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL), APHA Weybridge. Post-mortem examination (PME) confirmed evidence of cardiac insufficiency, but it is not possible to attribute this to SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. RNA from an oropharyngeal swab collected at the veterinary hospital (on 6 Dec 2021) and from a nasal swab, oropharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (collected post-mortem) were tested at the NRL. All samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real time RT-PCR testing.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: direct contact with COVID-19 positive owners (confirmed by official public health PCR testing).

Epidemiological comments: There are no other pets in the household. The case is considered resolved. Conclusions: There is sufficient evidence that the dog was infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate if the dog was clinically affected by the virus, and if its clinical signs, or death were due to SARS-CoV-2. Origin of the infection is considered likely to be direct contact with persons diagnosed with COVID-19 in the same household. Nota bene: The outbreak location used is that of the National Reference Laboratory, APHA Weybridge for data protection reasons.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test result date / Result
Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), Weybridge (national laboratory) / Dog / 1 / Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)/ 13 to 15 Dec 2021 / Positive

[The following is extracted from the OIE technical factsheet "Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in animals" (last updated October 2021) at https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/11/en-factsheet-sars-cov-2-20211025.pdf.

"Biosecurity and hygiene measures are key to preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should restrict contact with mammalian animals, including pets, just like they would with people during their illness.

Animals suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should remain separated from other animals and humans while infected.

Due to their susceptibility, some animal species are being used as models to test vaccines for use in humans.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use in mink and other animal species susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 are in various stages of development and approval". - Mod.CRD
