Abstract
Background: _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis (AK) is a chronic debilitating corneal infection principally affecting contact lens (CL) users. Studies were designed to test claims that the UK incidence may have increased in 2012 to 2014 and to evaluate potential causes.

Methods: Annualised incidence data were collected from January 1984 to December 2016. Case-control study subjects were recruited between 14 Apr 2011 and 5 Jun 2017. Reusable CL users with AK were recruited retrospectively and prospectively. Controls were reusable CL users, recruited prospectively, with any disorder other than AK. Multivariable analysis of questionnaire data measured independent risk factors for AK.

Results: The current outbreak of AK started in 2010 to 2011 with an incidence 3-fold higher than in 2004 to 2009. Risk factors for AK were Oxipol disinfection, CLs made of group IV CL materials, poor CL hygiene, deficient hand hygiene, use of CLs while swimming or bathing, being white British, and for those in social classes 4 to 9.

Conclusion: AK is a largely preventable disease. The current outbreak is unlikely to be due to any one of the identified risk factors in isolation. Improving CL and hand hygiene, avoiding CL contamination with water, and use of effective CL disinfection solutions or daily disposable CLs will reduce the incidence of AK. In the longer term, water avoidance publicity for CL users can be expected to reduce the incidence further. Ongoing surveillance of AK numbers will identify changes in incidence earlier. Evaluation of _Acanthamoeba_ contamination in end-user drinking water would contribute to our understanding of regional variations in the risk of exposure.

[_Acanthamoeba_ keratitis is a rare but well-known infection in users of contact lenses. As pointed out in this study, poor hygiene and inappropriate use, e.g., swimming while wearing the lenses, are risk factors. _Acanthamoeba_ are so-called "free-living amoeba" and are ubiquitous in the environment. - Mod.EP
