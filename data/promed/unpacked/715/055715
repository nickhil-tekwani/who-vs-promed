Suspected Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Following Blood Exposure
---------------------------------------------
An abattoir worker thought to be suffering from the contagious
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is being treated in isolation at Cape
Town's Groote Schuur hospital. Health authorities say neither the man nor
the meat from the abattoir poses a threat to public safety. "There is no
danger to hospital visitors nor the general public," said Health MEC Nick
Koornhof on Sunday. "Since the virus can only survive in a living host,
meat products from the abattoir are also completely safe."
The man, who has not been named, is thought to have been exposed to blood
from an infected animal on Fri 2 Feb 2001 and was admitted to hospital
shortly afterwards. His condition is described as stable. About 90 people
who came into contact with him after he became ill -- including family
members, friends and health workers -- are being monitored, but none has
displayed symptoms of the disease.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is fatal in about 60 percent of reported
cases. Early symptoms are a severe headache, fever and muscular pains.
After about 4 days the virus causes extreme bleeding. "It's difficult to
say if this is a case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever," said Tygerberg
Hospital infectious disease expert Mark Beale. "He has all the clinical
signs, and so we are treating it as that, but his test results have been
inconclusive." Results of a final test will be known tomorrow.
Beale said the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus was prevalent in South
African livestock and did not pose a danger to its animal hosts. "There are
2 ways it can be transferred to humans; through a tick; or through coming
into contact with blood of an animal during the limited period when the
virus [remains viable". He said an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever in ostriches in Oudtshoorn 4 years ago had been investigated by the
National Institute of Virology. "They found that meat and blood can only
infect humans immediately after slaughter. No one who handled the meat
after it had cooled became infected. The virus can't live [survive long
outside the body."

[The first report, posted as "Crimean-Congo hem. fever, suspected - South
Africa 20010212.0286", was clearly erroneous in giving the date of exposure
as 2 Jan 2001. This conflicted with the diagnosis of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever, since Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is characterized
by sudden onset and a short incubation period. - Mod.CP
[It is worth noting that Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has been
transmitted to health care providers from patients (see Morbidity Mortality
Weekly Report, February 22, 1985 / 34(7);94,99-101 at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000489.htm>). Appropriate
precautions, as are used in the management of other viral hemorrhagic
fevers such as those caused by Ebola virus, should prevent this from
occurring in the health care setting. - Man.Ed. DS
