Cuba. 23 Aug 2019. (reported) To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, the authors investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, they show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. The data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. The estimate is that 5707 cases of Zika went unreported in Cuba. The study highlights how Zika virus may still be "silently" spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics.

[A response from Manuel Diaz, a Cuban epidemiologist, states that Zika virus data from Cuba are reliable because diagnosis of suspicious cases is done using PCR. Zika cases in Cuba come from Guyana and Venezuela and do not progress due to surveillance at the border and isolation of suspected cases of travelers in the hospital. Cuba is a PAHO arbovirus collaborative center and provides international biennial update courses. - in Spanish trans. Mod.TY]

- Variable occurrence of microcephaly. 26 Sep 2019. (published) The results of a study indicate that municipalities that show a high incidence of microcephaly tend to be clustered in space and that incidence of microcephaly varies considerably across regions when correlated only with ZIKV, that is, that ZIKV alone cannot explain the differences in microcephaly across regions and their correlation is mediated by regional attributes.

India. 20 Aug 2019. (published) In a recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Jaipur city (Rajasthan, India), a total of 159 cases were reported in September 2018. In order to identify vector responsible for Zika transmission, mosquitoes were collected from houses with reported Zika cases and nearby houses. A total of 108 pools containing 522 mosquitoes were tested for presence of ZIKV virus using RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR. We detected presence of ZIKV in 3 pools of _Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti_ (L.), out of a total of 79 pools with 383 _Ae. aegypti_ through RT-PCR as well as real-time RT-PCR. The presence of ZIKV in _Ae. aegypti_ was further confirmed by DNA sequencing of the partial envelope region of ZIKV. Homology search of DNA sequence revealed highest identity (100%) with a ZIKV isolate from human from the study area which support the role of _Ae. aegypti_ acting as a ZIKV vector. All other mosquitoes (_Ae. vittatus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_) were negative for ZIKV. None of the F1 generation mosquito pools (276 mosquitoes in 43 pools) were found positive. This is the 1st report of presence of ZIKV in _Ae. aegypti_ from the Indian subcontinent.

[To date, and based on ECDC's epidemiological assessment, the probability of ongoing vector-borne local transmission in Hyeres (and surrounding areas) is considered very low because current evidence does not indicate the existence of a more extensive cluster of ZIKV cases.

ref: Robbiani DF, Olsen PC, Costa F, et al. Risk of Zika microcephaly correlates with features of maternal antibodies. J Exp Med. 2019; 216(10): 2302-15
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy causes congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly. However, rates vary widely, and the contributing risk factors remain unclear. We examined the serum antibody response to ZIKV and other flaviviruses in Brazilian women giving birth during the 2015-2016 outbreak. Infected pregnancies with intermediate or higher ZIKV antibody enhancement titers were at increased risk to give birth to microcephalic infants compared with those with lower titers (P < 0.0001). Similarly, analysis of ZIKV-infected pregnant macaques revealed that fetal brain damage was more frequent in mothers with higher enhancement titers. Thus, features of the maternal antibodies are associated with and may contribute to the genesis of ZIKV-associated microcephaly.

Discussion----------
The data show that features of the antibodies that modulate ZIKV infection in vitro are associated with a significantly altered risk of adverse outcome in vivo. Although sera from ZIKV-infected pregnant women showed antibody-enhancing activity in vitro regardless of fetal aberrations, sera from the microcephaly cases correlated with higher enhancing titers and power than non-microcephaly controls. Importantly, this observation was similar to what we observed in macaques.

While the data do not resolve causation versus correlation, they reveal a connection between features of the Zika antibodies and the likelihood of microcephaly. Our findings are consistent with the observation that antibodies that react with ZIKV enhance human placental macrophage infection in vitro and induce fetal loss in murine infection models (Zimmerman et al, 2018; Brown et al, 2019; Rathore et al, 2019).

In summary, the data reveal a correlation between antibody enhancement of ZIKV infection in vitro and pregnancy outcome for ZIKV infection in humans with validation in nonhuman primate models. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that an antibody-mediated mechanism may be associated with the pathogenesis of fetal brain injury and microcephaly, with significant implications for ZIKV vaccine development.

[3] Zika virus in Colombia

ref: Black A, Moncla LH, Laiton-Donato K, et al. Genomic epidemiology supports multiple introductions and cryptic transmission of Zika virus in Colombia. bioRxiv 454777. 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background: Colombia was the 2nd most affected country during the American Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, with over 109 000 reported cases. Despite the scale of the outbreak, limited genomic sequence data were available from Colombia. We sought to sequence additional samples and use genomic epidemiology to describe ZIKV dynamics in Colombia.

Methods: We sequenced ZIKV genomes directly from clinical diagnostic specimens and infected _Aedes aegypti_ samples selected to cover the temporal and geographic breadth of the Colombian outbreak. We performed phylogeographic analysis of these genomes, along with other publicly-available ZIKV genomes from the Americas, to estimate the frequency and timing of ZIKV introductions to Colombia.

Results: We attempted PCR amplification on 184 samples; 19 samples amplified sufficiently to perform sequencing. Of these, 8 samples yielded sequences with at least 50% coverage. Our phylogeographic reconstruction indicates 2 separate introductions of ZIKV to Colombia, one of which was previously unrecognized. We find that ZIKV was 1st introduced to Colombia in February 2015 (95% CI: January 2015-April 2015), corresponding to 5 to 8 months of cryptic ZIKV transmission prior to confirmation in September 2015. Despite the presence of multiple introductions, we find that the majority of Colombian ZIKV diversity descends from a single introduction. We find evidence for movement of ZIKV from Colombia into bordering countries, including Peru, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela.

Conclusions: Similarly to genomic epidemiologic studies of ZIKV dynamics in other countries, we find that ZIKV circulated cryptically in Colombia. This more accurate dating of when ZIKV was circulating refines our definition of the population at risk. Additionally, our finding that the majority of ZIKV transmission within Colombia was attributable to transmission between individuals, rather than repeated travel-related importations, indicates that improved detection and control might have succeeded in limiting the scale of the outbreak within Colombia.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Neurological complications affecting the central nervous system have been reported in adult patients infected by Zika virus (ZIKV) but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that ZIKV replicates in human and mouse adult brain tissue, targeting mature neurons. ZIKV preferentially targets memory-related brain regions, inhibits hippocampal long-term potentiation and induces memory impairment in adult mice. TNF-alpha upregulation, microgliosis, and upregulation of complement system proteins, C1q and C3, are induced by ZIKV infection. Microglia are found to engulf hippocampal presynaptic terminals during acute infection. Neutralization of TNF-alpha signaling, blockage of microglial activation or of C1q/C3 prevent synapse and memory impairment in ZIKV-infected mice. Results suggest that ZIKV induces synapse and memory dysfunction via aberrant activation of TNF-alpha, microglia and complement. Our findings establish a mechanism by which ZIKV affects the adult brain, and point to the need of evaluating cognitive deficits as a potential comorbidity in ZIKV-infected adults.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Purpose. To evaluate visual acuity and visual acuity development in children from the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, who were exposed to the Zika virus (ZIKV) gestationally.

Methods. Children who had been exposed to ZIKV during gestation and age-matched control subjects received visual acuity and funduscopic examination. ZIKV exposure was confirmed by maternal quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing or serology assay. The ZIKV group was divided into 2 subgroups: exposed (ZE), with only the mother having confirmed ZIKV infection, and infected (ZI), with confirmed infection. Visual acuity development was compared with prior norms and quantified by measuring visual acuity correlation with age.

Results. A total of 110 children were included: 47 who had been exposed to ZIKV (ZE, 23; ZI, 24) and 63 controls. Abnormal visual acuity was found in 5 of 24 ZI children. Of the 4 children with microcephaly, only 2 had visual acuity loss (only 1 also had abnormal funduscopic findings). There was significant correlation between age and visual acuity in both the control group (R2 = 0.8; P less than 0.0000) and the ZE subgroup (R2 = 0.6; P less than 0.0000). However, visual acuity did not correlate with age in the ZI subgroup (R2 = 0.04; P = 0.38). Furthermore, the increment in octaves/month was much lower in the ZI subgroup.

Conclusions. Our data indicate that visual acuity losses only occur in infants who suffered gestational-infection, not simply exposure. Lack of correlation between age and visual acuity in the ZI subgroup suggests a slowing of visual development even in the absence of microcephaly. This result may have broad implications for the deleterious effects of ZIKV on the central nervous system.

[6] Vector competence studies

ref: Azar SR, Weaver SC. Vector competence: What has Zika virus taught us? Viruses. 2019 Sep 17;11(9). pii: E867
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The unprecedented outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in the Americas from 2015 to 2017 prompted the publication of a large body of vector competence data in a relatively short period of time. Although differences in vector competence as a result of disparities in mosquito populations and viral strains are to be expected, the limited competence of many populations of the urban mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_, from the Americas (when its susceptibility is viewed relative to other circulating/reemerging mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), and chikungunya viruses (CHIKV)) has proven a paradox for the field. This has been further complicated by the lack of standardization in the methodologies utilized in laboratory vector competence experiments, precluding meta-analyses of this large data set. As the calls for the standardization of such studies continue to grow in number, it is critical to examine the elements of vector competence experimental design. Herein, we review the various techniques and considerations intrinsic to vector competence studies, with respect to contemporary findings for ZIKV, as well as historical findings for other arboviruses, and discuss potential avenues of standardization going forward.

[The elements included]
3. Virological elements
3.1. Effect of arboviral evolution on vector competence
3.2. History of virus stocks used for bloodmeal preparation
3.3. Use of cDNA clone-generated arboviruses in vector competence experiments
3.4. Passage history of arboviruses used for vector competence assessment
4. Mosquito/entomological determinants of vector competence
4.1. Mosquito genus and species.
4.2. Effect of mosquito colonization on vector competence
4.3. The mosquito microbiome
4.4. The mosquito virome (insect-specific viruses)
5. Experimental variables in vector competence assessment
5.1. Bloodmeal titer and viremia
5.2. Elements of artificial bloodmeals
5.3. Sequential bloodmeals
5.4. Extrinsic incubation temperature

In summary, vector competence analyses, which are critical to arbovirology, involve complex and ever-evolving methods. Given the intersection of so many elements (entomology, virology, logistics/containment, etc.), it is not surprising that there is a substantial degree of variability in how these studies are conducted across labs. The ZIKV epidemic in the Americas illustrates how, despite the large amounts of data that have been generated, meta-analyses are currently not possible due to experimental variances. While outright standardization is currently impossible, the increasing calls for standardization in data reporting represent a springboard that the arbovirology community can utilize in some feasible approaches to increase both transparency and reproducibility in vector competence assessments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background. Zika virus infections and suspected microcephaly cases have been reported in Angola since late 2016, but no data are available about the origins, epidemiology, and diversity of the virus. We aimed to investigate the emergence and circulation of Zika virus in Angola.

Methods. Diagnostic samples collected by the Angolan Ministry of Health as part of routine arboviral surveillance were tested by real-time reverse transcription PCR by the Instituto Nacional de Investigacao em Saude (Ministry of Health, Luanda, Angola). To identify further samples positive for Zika virus and appropriate for genomic sequencing, we also tested samples from a 2017 study of people with HIV in Luanda. Portable sequencing was used to generate Angolan Zika virus genome sequences from 3 people positive for Zika virus infection by real-time reverse transcription PCR, including one neonate with microcephaly. Genetic and mobility data were analysed to investigate the date of introduction and geographical origin of Zika virus in Angola. Brain CT and MRI, and serological assays were done on a child with microcephaly to confirm microcephaly and assess previous Zika virus infection.

Findings. Serum samples from 54 people with suspected acute Zika virus infection, 76 infants with suspected microcephaly, 24 mothers of infants with suspected microcephaly, 336 patients with suspected dengue virus or chikungunya virus infection, and 349 samples from the HIV study were tested by real-time reverse transcription PCR. There were 4 cases identified between December, 2016, and June, 2017, that tested positive for Zika virus. Analyses of viral genomic and human mobility data suggest that Zika virus was probably introduced to Angola from Brazil between July, 2015, and June, 2016. This introduction probably initiated local circulation of Zika virus in Angola that continued until at least June, 2017. The infant with microcephaly in whom CT and MRI were done had brain abnormalities consistent with congenital Zika syndrome and serological evidence for Zika virus infection.

Interpretation. Our analyses show that autochthonous transmission of the Asian lineage of Zika virus has taken place in Africa. Zika virus surveillance and surveillance of associated cases of microcephaly throughout the continent is crucial.

[8] Postnatal infection in children
Date: Tue 8 Oct 2019
Source: NIH, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Now [edited]
https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/postnatal-zika-virus-infection-children-does-not-impact-neurological-development


As Zika virus spread across the Americas in 2015 and 2016, public health authorities became alarmed by the increasing number of cases of microcephaly and other fetal abnormalities attributed to Zika virus infection in utero. However, it was unknown whether the virus could also impact the development of young children infected after birth. In a study that began in 2017 in Guatemala, NIAID-supported researchers have been studying sets of mothers and their children who might have been exposed to the Zika virus. Their preliminary results indicate that the virus likely has little or no impact on the neurological development of children who were infected after birth.

Aspects of the study were presented at IDWeek in both an oral presentation and a poster session by one of the co-principal investigators, Flor M Munoz, MD of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Edwin J Asturias, MD is the co-principal investigator from the University of Colorado, in Denver, Colorado. The study, conducted by researchers in both Guatemala and the United States, is funded by NIAID.

The full study enrolled 374 children between one and 5 years old, 500 infants, and 497 mothers in Guatemala, in an area where the related dengue virus is endemic and the Zika virus has been found. Upon enrolling, the volunteers received blood tests to see if they had been exposed to either dengue, Zika, or both. The study began approximately 2 years after the virus was first detected in Guatemala, so researchers were able to safely assume that older children who showed serological evidence of prior infection likely became infected after they had been born. The scientists meticulously tested the infants' and children's early learning abilities, both when they 1st enrolled in the study, and over a 12 month period of time.

Like other research studies that began in response to the arrival of Zika virus in the Americas, the study faced many challenges. Because Zika infection may be asymptomatic, and the outbreak was already dwindling as the study began, the researchers have been unable to confirm children with active Zika infections. However, 25 percent of all children under 5 years of age had serological evidence of prior exposure to the Zika virus. In addition, although the infants in the study performed well on neurological tests, older children generally had lower developmental scores than their US counterparts -- possibly due to reasons including fewer educational resources, malnutrition, or other confounding factors.

However, among children ages 1-5 years old, who could only have been exposed to the Zika virus after birth, the researchers found that prior infection with the Zika virus did not lower their neurodevelopmental test scores. This finding supports theories that children are less vulnerable to Zika's neurodevelopmental effects if infected after birth. However, the researchers recognize the limitations of this study, including the need to conduct follow up for neurologic and neurodevelopmental outcomes over a longer period of time.

This research is the first to study the impact of Zika virus infection in children in such detail. While the researchers still need to complete a full analysis of the samples and test results that they collected before making final conclusions, the research that they completed in Guatemala provides a firm groundwork for future studies.

Abstract
--------
Background. Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) is seen in 5-12% of newborns from Zika virus (ZIKV)-infected pregnancies and includes severe neurologic abnormalities. However, the majority of ZIKV-exposed newborns do not have CZS. The risk for neurodevelopmental impairment for infants without CZS following in utero ZIKV is not well known. The objective was to determine whether infants without CZS exposed to ZIKV in utero, have normal neurodevelopment.

Methods. We performed a longitudinal study of neurodevelopment in Colombia for infants exposed to ZIKV in utero who had a normal fetal brain MRI (Mulkey et al, JAMA Peds 2019) and normal head circumference at birth. Infant development was assessed by the Warner Initial Developmental Evaluation of Adaptive and Functional Skills (WIDEA) and the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) between 6 and 18 months of age. In-person training was done by a neurologist. The AIMS were video-recorded and scored centrally. Interrater reliability for the novel method of video-based AIMS was determined. WIDEA and AIMS scores were converted to Z-scores compared with normative samples. We also compared development between infants with normal and nonspecific findings on cranial ultrasound (US).

Results. There were 72 non-CZS infants who had neurodevelopmental tests; 40 were at a mean (SD) of 5.7 (0.9) months and 66 were at 13.5 (3.2) months of age; 34 had 2 wo assessments. The total WIDEA, social cognition, and mobility domain scores became more abnormal with postnatal age (figure). The AIMS scores were similar to the normative sample. There were 3 infants who had an AIMS score < 2 SD's below the norm. On cranial US, 19 infants (26%) had a nonspecific finding (lenticulostriate vasculopathy, choroid plexus cysts, subependymal cysts, and/or calcification). Infants with a US finding had a lower WIDEA mobility score than infants with normal US (P = .054). There was a trend toward lower AIMS scores in infants with US findings compared with infants with normal US (P = .26). AIMS Interrater agreement on video-based scoring was good (ICC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.42, 0.87).

Conclusion. ZIKV-exposed infants without CZS are at risk for neurodevelopmental delay. Nonspecific cranial US findings may represent mild ZIKV-related injury. Long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up is important for all ZIKV-exposed infants.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We review the body of information that was acquired during the pandemic and discuss the epidemiologic trends, current knowledge about the transmission and natural history of ZIKV infection and its sequelae, and the principles of diagnosis and clinical management.

The public health community was unprepared for the emergence of ZIKV and the dramatic and unexpected consequences of ZIKV infections during pregnancy. However, the response to the Zika crisis, including the declaration by the WHO of a public health emergency of international concern, was enormous, as exemplified by the identification of the causal link between ZIKV and birth defects, more than 6000 scientific publications on ZIKV, approval of new diagnostic tests, and development of vaccine candidates that have entered clinical trials -- all within the past 3 years. Furthermore, the pandemic increased positive awareness about critical social justice issues, such as stigma toward and isolation of families of infants with congenital Zika syndrome, the reproductive rights of women, and access to safe abortion and contraception in Latin America.73 Of note, although abortion policies remained unchanged in many countries, the ZIKV outbreak in Brazil was associated with a decrease of more than 100,000 births between September 2015 and December 2016, which may have resulted from postponement of pregnancies and an increase in clandestine abortions.

The experience of the pandemic highlights important deficiencies in our understanding of ZIKV (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix) and the barriers to translating evidence into implementable guidelines, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The pandemic is illustrative of the universal failure of vector-control programs in regions where rapid urbanization and interconnectivity promote epidemic spread. However, new vector-control approaches, such as those that involve genetically modified mosquitoes, wolbachia-transfected mosquitoes, and pyriproxyfen-based larvicide, are under evaluation. Current diagnostic testing remains suboptimal for the detection of congenital ZIKV infections, which in turns hampers implementation of clinical management. Although the pandemic has subsided, we lack sufficient information on ZIKV seroprevalence to evaluate the potential for future epidemics among the more than 2 billion people who live in regions at risk for ZIKV transmission (Figure 1). Furthermore, the majority of this population resides in resource-poor settings in which there is no access to diagnostic testing and limited capacity to conduct screening and evaluation of pregnant women and infants who have been exposed to ZIKV infection -- a difficult task to implement even in high-resource countries.

The ZIKV pandemic has waned, but the virus still poses a public health threat, as shown by continued reports of outbreaks in Asia, India, and Africa. Although at present we do not have the tools to predict where and when the next large epidemic will happen, the large numbers of susceptible persons residing in _Aedes_-infested regions make a reemergence of ZIKV likely. Thus, there is a critical need to mobilize support and improve capacity in low- and middle-income countries to respond to future ZIKV epidemics and the next emerging pathogens.

Valdes V, Zorrilla CD, Gabard-Durnam L, et al. Cognitive development of infants exposed to the Zika virus in Puerto Rico. JAMA Netw Open. 2019; 2(10): e1914061
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key points
----------
Question. Is prenatal maternal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) associated with cognitive scores among infants after adjusting for confounders, including demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, maternal mental health, and exposure to Hurricane Maria?
Findings: In this cross-sectional study of 65 Puerto Rican infants aged 3 to 12 months, those with prenatal ZIKV exposure had lower receptive language scores. Exposure to ZIKV and Hurricane Maria both were significantly and inversely associated with receptive language scores.

Meaning. Even among infants without microcephaly or congenital Zika syndrome, prenatal maternal ZIKV infection is associated with lower receptive language scores during the 1st year of life; however, exposure to ZIKV does not appear to be associated with other domains of cognitive development.

Abstract
--------
Importance. Existing research has established a causal link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and severe birth defects or consequent health impairments; however, more subtle cognitive impairments have not been explored.

Objective. To determine whether infants of mothers with at least 1 positive ZIKV test show differences in cognitive scores at ages 3 to 6 months and ages 9 to 12 months.

Design, setting, and participants. This cross-sectional study recruited infants enrolled in existing ZIKV study cohorts associated with the Maternal-Infant Studies Center and the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico and from the broader San Juan metropolitan area. The study took place at the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium at the University of Puerto Rico. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling if their mothers underwent ZIKV testing prenatally and were at the target ages during the study period. Infants who were born preterm (<36 weeks' gestational age), with low birth weight (<2500 g), or with a known genetic disorder were excluded. Infants were tested from ages 3 to 6 months or ages 9 to 12 months from May 2018 to April 2019. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2019.

Exposures. Zika virus status was measured prenatally and in the early postnatal period using real-time polymerase chain reaction or a ZIKV IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Main outcomes and measures. The infants' development was assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (translated to Spanish and adapted for Puerto Rico), and assessors were blinded to each infant's ZIKV status.

Results. A total of 65 study participants were included. The mean (SD) age of the infants at the time of cognitive testing was 8.98 (3.19) months. Most of the infants were white (55 [84.6%]) and Puerto Rican (64 [98.5%]); 38 of the infants were male (58.5%). General cognitive and domain-specific scores did not differ significantly between prenatally ZIKV-positive and ZIKV-negative infants except for receptive language score (mean differenceâ=â5.52; tâ=â2.10; Pâ=â.04). Exposure to ZIKV (Bâ=â-5.69; betaâ=â-0.26 [95% CI -11.01 to -0.36]; Pâ=â.04) and a measure of Hurricane Maria exposure (time without water, Bâ=â-0.05; betaâ=â-0.27 [95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01]; Pâ=â.03) were both independently and significantly associated with receptive language scores after adjusting for key confounders.

Conclusions and relevance. Although infants exposed to ZIKV prenatally showed unaffected motor and visually mediated cognitive development, they did show deficits in receptive language scores. Receptive language skills were also associated with the degree of exposure to Hurricane Maria, with those who spent more time without water after the hurricane having lower receptive language scores.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Mosquito borne flaviviruses cause a series of important diseases in humans and animals. These viruses are maintained in cycles involving replication in mosquito and in vertebrate hosts. Most natural hosts are vertebrate animals living in sylvatic or peridomestic environments. Human contact with these environments may result in host shifts that lead to the establishment of urban transmission cycles. Zika virus is a _Flavivirus_ that persists in nature in a transmission cycle involving non-human primates (NHP). Its recent emergence in Brazil has shed light upon the importance of surveying this agent in Brazilian sylvatic environments. Here we present histopathological and molecular evidence that free ranging howler monkeys (_Alouatta guariba_) in Southern Brazil are infected by ZIKV closely related to African lineage MR766 and 9 NHP were nested RT-PCR positive for ZIKV RNA. Sequence analysis revealed 96 to 98% identity to ZIKV MR766 and 85% identity to ZIKV P6-740, the current epidemic strain. The affected howler monkeys presented discrete inflammatory infiltrates in several tissues and immunohistochemical (IHC) labeling of viral antigen was observed in placenta. These findings point to the circulation of African lineage Zika virus in the Americas in non-human primates. And raises the possibility that ZIKV was introduced into the Americas on more than one occasion.

[The evidence for Zika virus infection of howler monkeys in Brazilian forests raises the question about transmission mechanisms. It is tempting to speculate that Zika virus is transmitted in the same or similar a sylvan (forest) cycle that yellow fever virus is via _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_ mosquitoes. If this is shown to be the case, the bad news is that eradication will not be possible and underscores the importance of an effective vaccine to protect the human population. - Mod.TY]
