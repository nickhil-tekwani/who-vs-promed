-----------------------------------------------------
I would appreciate it if you would post our response to the recent
media coverage concerning tuberculosis (TB) in Nepal elephants.
We (Elephant Care International) are supporting an elephant veterinary
fellowship. This will be a dedicated position designed to assist the
Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation [Nepal] to
address this complicated issue on a long-term basis. The position will
be based at the Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science in Nepal.
The position will begin July 2007 and we hope that this spurt of
articles will not jeopardize this effort and collaboration.
The following statement is also posted on our website
<http://www.elephantcare.org>:
Nepal: A Leader in Addressing Tuberculosis (TB) in Elephants
Recent news reports have suggested that Nepalese authorities have been
"apathetic" in treatment and care of elephants diagnosed with TB. The
reality is that Nepal has taken the lead amongst all elephant range
countries by initiating a program to examine its elephants for TB.
However, Nepal lacks the resources necessary for complete diagnosis
and treatment of this disease in elephants. Nepal is not alone in this
situation. Even in wealthy nations like the United States, the
diagnosis and treatment of TB in elephants is undergoing intense
scrutiny and change. New diagnostic methods have evolved and are only
now being reviewed.
The initial investigation of TB in the elephants of Nepal was
performed by a team of experts from Nepal and Elephant Care
International, a U.S.-based charity organization devoted to elephant
healthcare. A full report including recommendations for segregating
"high risk" (for TB) elephants was delivered to Nepal authorities in
December 2006. It is the understanding of Elephant Care International
that the government of Nepal has taken the appropriate action of
segregating "high risk" elephants from the public and other elephants.
Elephant Care International is funding a fulltime Elephant Veterinary
Fellow who will operate under the auspices of The Institute of
Agriculture and Animal Science (IAAS) of Nepal. This Nepali
veterinarian will work with designated personnel from the Department
of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation to collect blood, culture,
and other samples from elephants. The Fellow will play an integral
role in the overall surveillance and health management and treatment
program.
The process of establishing this program was slowed by the tragic
helicopter accident last year [2006] in Nepal that killed many
prominent conservationists and government officials, including several
ministers and department heads.
Though Elephant Care International is obviously focused on elephants
throughout Asia and Africa, TB is a devastating disease amongst
humans. Nepal must rightly deal with the human situation first. In
this context, we also point out that with regard to the threat to
humans posed by TB, that threat is far greater from human contact than
from casual elephant contact.

[The following query was received from Richard I. Frankel, M.D.,
M.P.H., F.A.C.P., Emeritus Professor of Medicine, University of Hawaii:
"It would be useful to know what is meant by the statement "the
elephants have tested positive for TB..." Are these elephants ill and
was that the reason for testing? Were they tested by skin test or by
some other means? Do they have latent infection or tuberculosis
disease?"
The following information is derived from the 2005 paper:
"A review of tests available for use in the diagnosis of
tuberculosis in non-bovine species" by D.V. Cousins & N. Florisson.
Rev. sci. tech.
Off. int. Epiz., 24 (3), 1039-1059:
"In elephants, culture of trunk washes is accepted as the gold
standard diagnostic test. The tuberculin test is considered to perform
poorly and is not validated and there are limited data available from
alternate tests. It should be remembered that most of the cases of
tuberculosis in elephants are due to _M. tuberculosis_ rather than _M.
bovis_; _M. tuberculosis_ presents an important zoonotic risk to
zookeepers, animal handlers and the public, despite the fact that the
animals may have contracted the disease from their own keepers or
handlers. Elephants are valuable animals and treatment is sometimes
attempted, so improved diagnostics would be useful for the few zoos
that are affected".
