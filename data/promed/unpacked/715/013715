EEE Confirmed in Unvaccinated Florida Horse
-------------------------------------------
The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [14 Apr 2016] that an unvaccinated 18-month-old Quarter Horse residing in Polk County, Florida, has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The horse had not been off his home property in the last 6 months, the EDCC statement said. "Clinical signs began [4 Apr 2016] and the horse passed on the same day," the statement read. "The case was confirmed positive on [14 Apr 2016]."

The EDCC said this is the 1st confirmed case in Polk County and the 1st positive in Florida since the beginning of the year [2016].

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 percent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3 to 6 week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[This is a virus infection that can and does kill horses. Horses in areas and regions of known risk need to be vaccinated each year in the spring and it is well worth the investment. In areas where the disease is endemic the severity of human cases is reduced -- in Louisiana we rarely see a hospital case with persistent neurological symptoms -- but in places where it is more sporadic, e.g., New England, it can be routinely severe. But in horses it is a different story, so if you are in an area with EEE get your horse vaccinated ASAP. - Mod.MHJ
