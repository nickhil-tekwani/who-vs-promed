New polio case forces fresh drive in 5 districts
------------------------------------------------
Alarmed at the detection of a fresh polio case in the state [West
Bengal] in the midst of an intensified campaign against the disease
the state government has been compelled to conduct a polio
immunisation drive in 5 selected districts, including Kolkata.

Officials said the polio immunisation drive has been ordered after an
18-month-old child of Panchla in Howrah [district] was found to be
suffering from poliovirus type 1 [infection]. In 2008, a child was
detected to be suffering from poliovirus type 3 in the same area.

A senior official of the state health department said the [decision]
has been taken to administer drops of monovalent type-1 poliovirus to
18 lakh [1.8 million] children in districts, including Howrah,
Hooghly, Kolkata, and North and South 24-Parganas. This special polio
immunisation drive started yesterday [13 Feb 2011] and will continue
till Tue 15 Feb 2011. A senior member of the World Health Organisation
and senior officials of the National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP)
have reached the village to monitor the special polio immunisation
drive.

Ms Swati Dutta, chief medical officer of health (Howrah), said the
girl was admitted to Gabberia State General Hospital on 20 Jan 2011
with weakness in her legs. Doctors feared she might be suffering from
polio and prescribed the necessary tests. Reports of the tests,
conducted in the Enterovirus Research Centre (ERC) in Mumbai,
confirmed she was suffering from type 1 poliovirus infection. The
child has been transferred to Dr BC Roy Polio Clinic and Hospital,
Beliaghata today [14 Feb 2011] for further treatment. She said in such
cases it is important to know the origin of the disease and after
examining her strain it was found that the disease originated from
Delhi. Later, it was found that the child's father, who is an
embroidery worker, went to Delhi a few years ago.

An NPSP official said that earlier it was not possible to conduct the
polio immunisation drive properly in this area for various reasons and
necessary steps have been taken to create awareness among people of
the area in this regard.

[One new case (described above) was reported in the past week (WPV1
from Howrah district, West Bengal). It is the 1st confirmed case in
the country in 2011. The total number of cases for 2010 remains 42.

This most recent case is in a district next to the mega-metropolis
Kolkata [Calcutta]. A mop-up is currently underway in response to this
case, targeting 1.8 million children under the age of 5 years. To
support the mop-up and follow-up activities, 5 Surveillance Medical
Officers (SMOs) from Bangladesh, and 15 Bengali-speaking SMOs from
other parts of India, are in the process of being deployed to Howrah
and Kolkata.

The area of the case is in a part of Howrah with large mobile
population groups. Genetic sequencing of the virus indicates it is
related to a virus last detected in the 2nd half of 2010 in Delhi, in
an environmental sample. (For further details see the ProMED-mail post
Poliomyelitis - worldwide (29): India (Delhi) sewage, 20101207.4372).
As such, it is not linked to the separate outbreak currently affecting
Murshidabad, West Bengal.

India continues to report record-low levels of polio, in particular
in the traditional reservoir areas of Uttar Pradesh (last case: 21 Apr
2010) and Bihar (last case: 1 Sep 2010). However, confirmation of this
recent case linked to the Delhi environmental sample, along with 2
other known transmission chains (in Mumbai and Murshidabad)
underscores the very real risk ongoing low-level transmission
continues to pose to the country's eradication effort.
