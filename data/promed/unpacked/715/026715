In the original post, a great question was posed: Did the isolates from the Oregon zoo elephants match genotypes of isolates from prior TB outbreaks in elephants at other facilities? I verified with the National Veterinary Services Laboratory that the elephants' genotype have never been isolated in elephants in the US. In fact, most of the TB infections in elephants are new introductions and do not match genotypes of isolates from prior TB outbreaks in elephants. The Hawthorn Circus strain is associated with a different genetic lineage. Thanks again for posing this important question.

[ProMED-mail thanks Amy Zlot for her prompt response to a question posed in a recent ProMED-mail post that concerned an outbreak of tuberculosis in elephants at the Multnomah County (Oregon) zoo. She is the corresponding author of the MMWR report of the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak that was the subject of several ProMED-mail posts in 2013 and 2014. (See prior ProMED-mail posts: Tuberculosis, elephant - USA (02): (OR) update 20140618.2548517; Tuberculosis, elephant - USA: (OR) update 20140417.2411578; and Tuberculosis, elephants - USA: (OR) 20130730.1853103.)

We were told in the MMWR report that the _M. tuberculosis_ isolates from the elephants and a zoo keeper at the Oregon zoo have a unique genotype, not matched locally or nationally, and we are now told that this genotype also does not match genotypes of isolates from prior TB outbreaks in elephants at other facilities, including the Hawthorn Circus strain. - Mod.ML
