Apart from dengue-causing _Aedes_ and malaria-causing _Anopheles_, public health experts are worried about the _Culex_ mosquito, which causes [transmits] Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus].

National Vector Borne Disease Control programme data show that the number of people testing positive for JE [in Tamil Nadu state], a viral disease, is rising, from 11 cases in 2011 to 53 in 2015. The entire data for this year [2016] is not available, but the number of cases collected from different districts so far is 36.

"What is more worrying is the number of people with acute encephalitis syndrome being tested positive for JE, despite the massive vaccination programme," pointed out a senior public health official refusing to be named.

Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a group of neurological diseases caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, chemicals and toxins. Those tested for AES are also tested for JE. In 2010, 2.3 percent of people with AES tested positive for JE; in 2016, it is 6 percent, he said.

The number is worrying because the disease, which causes mental disturbances, paralysis, seizures, coma and death, can be prevented by vaccines. JE occurs across many countries in Asia, where about 68 000 cases are reported annually, according to the World Health Organization, though the number of cases is thought to be vastly underreported. In India, the virus is concentrated in Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.

There is no cure, and health officials can only try easing the symptoms, providing drugs to treat fevers and convulsions or inserting feeding tubes when children become unconscious. In 2013, the Union health ministry launched a mass vaccination drive in select districts of the 5 states. In Tamil Nadu, 13 districts, including Tiruvallur, Tiruvannamalai, Trichy, Madurai and Virudhunagar, were chosen. While all children between 9 months and 15 years get the vaccine at the launch, follow-up vaccines are given to those under 2 years. "The vaccination programme is working well," said state director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy. "We have been reporting an increase only because our quality of surveillance is better than many other states. We are aware of the increasing numbers. In a large state like ours, it is not unusual. What is important is that the state and several other agencies are continuously monitoring it," he said.

In high-prevalence districts, health officials test people with symptoms. "The mosquitoes are ground and tested for viral content. Besides JE, we are working on controlling other encephalitic and waterborne diseases such as hepatitis," he said.

But doctors, particularly paediatricians, say it is important to ensure that every case of AES is notified. "We see a lot of AES cases, but many aren't sent for testing for JE because it is not treatable," said Dr S Balasubramanian, head of the department of paediatrics at Kanchi Kamakoti Childs Trust Hospital. "It is not mandatory to report this, but it is certainly underreported. If we make reporting of this disease mandatory, we will be able to increase surveillance."

[It is important that as many cases of AES as possible are tested for JE. Even though the percent attributable to JE virus infection may be low, knowing when and where these cases occur provides guidance for JE vaccination campaigns. JE virus vector mosquito control is difficult and likely to be ineffective, making vaccination the best measure to prevent cases. As the above report indicates, determining the etiological agents responsible for AES is challenging because so many agents have been implicated. However, until those agents are identified, prevention and appropriate AES treatment will be difficult.
