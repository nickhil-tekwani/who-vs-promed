More Deaths From Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Iran
-------------------------------------------------
TEHRAN: The Iranian official news agency IRNA reported on Thu 20 Jun 2002
that 10 Iranians suspected of being infected with Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic
Fever (CCHF) virus have died since the new Iranian year starting from 21
Mar 2002. Behrouz Ataie, a specialist in infectious diseases, told a
conference on CCHF held at the central Iranian city of Isfahan that the
victims are among 28 suspected patients, who have been identified since
March as having contracted the viral disease. CCHF virus infection has been
confirmed in only 3 cases so far, the specialist said, adding that there
are no exact statistics on the rates of infection with this disease,
because there are no modern laboratories to diagnose the disease in Iran.
The specialist said that the southern and southeastern provinces of Fars
and Sistan Baluchestan as well as central Tehran province have the highest
rates of infection with CCHF virus. "In Isfahan province alone, 26 people
suspected of having the disease were identified last year, 6 of whom died,"
Ataie said. Unlike in other parts of the world, where the disease is
transmitted through tick bites, the most common [source of] contagion in
Iran is contact with contaminated meat, and thus butchers and housewives
are the most frequently infected persons in Iran.
Behrouz Yassemi, a senior veterinary official of the state veterinary
organization, tried to play down rising concern about the disease, saying
that only 123 people have been identified so far as CCHF virus-positive.
The official had earlier rejected reports that 30 percent of Iranian cattle
were infected with CCHF virus, stressing that the results of samples taken
from smuggled cattle from Afghanistan, where the disease is said to have
originated from, had indicated only a 1.6 percent rate of infection.
CCHF is endemic in parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia,
parts of southern Europe and most of North Africa. In Iran, CCHF virus was
first detected in the northeastern province of Khorassan in 1978. The virus
had reportedly entered the country through imported cattle from the eastern
borders.
