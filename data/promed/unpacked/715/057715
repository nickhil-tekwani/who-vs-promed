[The location of this outbreak is the very most north
western piece of real estate in Iran, somewhere near the
Aras River. West Azerbiajan is nestled between the borders
of Turkey, Armenia, and Azerbiajan.
While we are happy to have the negative tests for avian
influenza, it would be very helpful to know more about the
geography of this outbreak in relation to the migratory wild
bird pathways and the other outbreaks in the region (Romania
and Turkey have been confirmed to be H5N1). A definitive
diagnosis of what is killing these birds would be most
helpful, or a negative H5N1 from a world reference lab would
be useful in solving this unknown outbreak. Any information
would be appreciated. - Mod.PC]
