Anthrax fear dies out, big cats safe for now
--------------------------------------------
The tiger reserves in the state are no more under the threat of the deadly anthrax virus [sic], as the spores detected in Thalavadi forest range of Sathyamangalam Forest Division on the Tamil Nadu border have died away.

The alert sounded at Bandipur Tiger Reserve and Biligiri Ranganatha Swamy (BRT) forests under the Kollegal Forest Division, which borders Sathyamangalam, have been withdrawn. An elephant calf was found dead on 8 Nov 2013 near Kodapampalli Thoddi village in Thalavadi range and the [necropsy] revealed that the elephant died due to anthrax. It had created a scare among forest officials of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, as anthrax is known to wipe out wildlife once it strikes.

"It is nearly 10 days since the elephant calf died because of anthrax. No other animal has been found suffering from the [bacillus], and it is unlikely that there could be any more cases. We had constituted multiple monitoring teams to track the movement of elephants. The teams have not come across any animal found weak or suffering from anthrax. Generally, any elephant that is infected gets isolated and becomes weak within a few days," said N. Satish, Deputy Forest Officer, Sathyamangalam Division.

The official said they followed all necessary procedures while disposing the elephant carcass. Water bodies in the area were chlorinated and ring vaccination was carried out among cattle to stop the spread of [disease]. "We were successful in our attempt and the anthrax spores have died away," he said.

Mr Ajai Mishra, CCF (Project Elephant), said: "Our monitoring teams have not found anything worrying."

[I apologise for the lateness of this posting but somehow it got shuffled into my "Junk" folder. The moral of this is to check your junk file every few days even if it seems to be 100 percent junk. How this young elephant got infected is still unclear. But one must applaud the park authorities for taking it very seriously and actively searching for other cases, which, fortunately, have not appeared, as well as vaccinating nearby cattle.

To find the Sathyamangalam Forest and Wildlife Sanctuary, go to:
http://wikimapia.org/18484274/Sathyamangalam-forests or
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sathyamangalam_Wildlife_Sanctuary. The sanctuary is home to some 850 Indian elephants, making it the the largest elephant habitat in the country.

I have a request of those of you who read the Anthrax Postings: Rob Fairley, a veterinary pathologist in Christchurch, New Zealand, is in need of fixed tissue from an anthrax case or cases so he can train his eye for what he should be looking for in case that this disease might have slide under the radar into his country. The last recorded case of anthrax in New Zealand was in 1954. And he has no personal experience of this disease when he was working previously as a veterinary pathologist in California and Saskatchewan. If any of you can help him with tissue blocks, or stained or unstained slides, his e-mail address is: Rob Fairley <Rob.Fairley@gribbles.co.nz>. Thank you. - Mod.MHJ
