A neighborhood in northern Turkey was placed under quarantine over suspicion of an anthrax outbreak among livestock. Local authorities declared a quarantine for Yemisli in the Surmene district of the Black Sea province of Trabzon on Tuesday [18 Aug 2020]. An unspecified number of people fell ill after eating meat from a bull suspected of having the disease. An investigation is underway.

The local branch of the general directorate of food and control said in a written statement that samples from the slaughtered animal were being examined. Initial results pointed to anthrax. Meat from the animal that had not been consumed was destroyed. Meanwhile, other cattle that have not been infected are being vaccinated against the disease.

Anthrax, an infection caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, is commonly seen in animals that accidentally consume the bacterium's spores while grazing. It affects the skin and lungs in humans. Though it cannot spread directly from person to person, clothing and bodies contaminated with anthrax spores pose a danger to human health. In 2018, 2 rural neighborhoods in Istanbul were quarantined over an anthrax scare that led to the hospitalizations of 6 people who suffered from skin lesions.

[The 2018 outbreak referred to is covered in the following report: Anthrax - Turkey (04): (AN, IB) bovine, human 20180903.6005067.

In the last outbreak in Trabzon, some 74 people were suspected infected (see Anthrax - Turkey: (Trabzon) bovine, human 20180212.5623312).

Trabzon is on the northeast coast of Turkey facing the Black Sea. For a map, see http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/turkey_pol_2006.jpg.

Western Turkey has a long history of enzootic anthrax affecting their livestock. The lesson from this, that we have seen many times before, is to not slaughter and butcher a sick bovine, whether a cow or a bull. - Mod.MHJ]
