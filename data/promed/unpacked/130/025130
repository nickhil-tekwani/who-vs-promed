Muhammad Shah, the district health officer (DHO), told The Express Tribune that 2 farmers in the Zhob district of Balochistan have died after suffering from Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), also known as 'Congo virus' [Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus].

At least 4 people, including a woman, were infected with the virus in the small village of Killi Blump near Meena Bazaar, located 40km from Zhob city.

The deceased were identified as a 30-year-old man, who died in the Combined Military Hospital, Zhob, and another man, age 60. Meanwhile, the 30 year old was admitted to Quetta's Jilani Hospital and discharged after receiving treatment. A woman was also admitted to Fatima Jinnah TB Sanatorium, according to DHO Shah.

The village where the deaths took place consists of 12 to 13 houses. DHO Shah said the 2 farmers contracted the disease in mid-July [2014] and the virus was confirmed after blood tests [were done]. While the 1st man was sent to Quetta for treatment, the 2nd was sent to Multan.

The medical superintendent of the District Headquarters Hospital Zhob, Abdul Rehman, said animals in the village have been vaccinated, as well as family members of those affected in order to avoid the spread of the virus. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can also occur.

[The accounts of the 4 cases are not altogether clear. The 30 year old farmer apparently returned to the hospital, was admitted and died there. No details are provided about the exposure and outcome of the infected woman. No information at all is provided about the 4th case. Western Pakistan and its border with Afghanistan are endemic areas for Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus.

CCHF virus is a tick-borne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
