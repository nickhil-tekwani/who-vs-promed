Hendra virus infection near Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia
--------------------------------------------------------------
On 8 Aug 2009, a phone call was received by Biosecurity Queensland on
the 'Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline' advising of a horse that
had died with clinical signs highly suggestive of Hendra virus (HeV)
infection. Samples were collected immediately and the property, which
held 23 horses including foaling mares and young horses, was placed
in quarantine prohibiting the movement of horses onto or off the
property.

A PCR positive for HeV was reported on 10 Aug 2009. Tracing of horses
that had moved off the property commenced and people who had been in
contact with the dead horse were advised of the zoonotic nature of
the HeV.

In the previous 2 weeks, 2 horses had died on the property. One old
pony died the previous day, 7 Aug 2009, with clinical signs not
suggestive of HeV infection, however a sample of blood stored at the
veterinarian's premises was tested on 14 Aug 2009 and it was positive
on PCR.

One horse died on 28 Jul 2009 with clinical signs attributed to a
snake bite, but in retrospect suggestive of HeV infection. No
investigation was conducted at the time and no samples were
available, therefore HeV testing could not be carried out. All
response decisions were made on the basis of this horse being
infected with HeV.

After the positive diagnosis the property where the horses died was
designated an 'infected premise'. Quarantine conditions have been
increased to stop the movement of potentially HeV contaminated
equipment as well as horses.

A property with one horse that had nose-to-nose contact with horses
on the infected premise, and a property that shared horse equipment
with the infected premise were also placed in quarantine, with the
same conditions as the infected premise.

Samples were collected on all horses on these 3 properties and tested
for viral genome and serologically. If any factor was identified that
increased the risk of HeV infection in a horse, such as increased
temperature, sign of ill health, or being held in an area where a
horse died, or a suspect result was received, further tests have been
undertaken.

Eleven horses were traced to 8 properties, including one to New South
Wales, in the trace forward period of 21 days prior to 28 Jul 2009.
These horses were placed on a form of quarantine, with conditions
including the traced horses not moving from the property, daily
monitoring of the horses' health, and recording of all horses that
moved off the property after the trace forward horse had arrived at
the property. These measures were taken to assist disease control in
the unlikely event that the traced horse was infected and spread
infection to other horses on the new property.

Samples from traced horses were tested by PCR and serologically, but
other horses on the trace forward properties were not tested. The
pony that died on 7 Aug 2009 had been on 2 properties in the 21 days
prior to its death. Similar restrictions were placed on these trace
back properties that had been placed on the trace forward properties.

To date no test results other than 2 of the 3 dead horses have
resulted in a diagnosis of HeV infection. All HeV serum
neutralization tests for antibodies have been negative.

Four horses have been positive or marginally positive to the ELISA,
that is used as a screening test and false positives are not
unexpected.

One horse on the property where the horses died gave a very low
positive on Taqman PCR for both the N and P genes on a sample
collected on 11 Aug 2009, but the sample collected the next day was
negative. This horse was ELISA positive on 11 Aug 2009, and its ELISA
titre was higher in a sample collected on 14 Aug 2009. This horse was
moved into the stable in which the horse [had] died on 7 Aug 2009 one
day after the death.

All Queensland properties referred to above remain in quarantine.

From a human health perspective, Queensland Health has been liaising
closely with Biosecurity Queensland in response to the outbreak. All
people who had contact with the confirmed or highly suspect horse
cases were assessed for level of exposure and provided with
information about the disease. Depending on level of exposure and
person's concern, baseline serological testing was offered. Four
people with extensive exposure to the nasal secretions or blood of
confirmed or highly suspect horse cases were admitted to hospital for
a 5-day course of prophylaxis comprising intravenous ribavirin and
oral chloroquine, on the recommendation of infectious disease
physicians with experience in Hendra management. [This combination of
drugs, while hopefully prophylactic, may have made individuals feel
quite ill. Not everyone tolerates chloroquine well, and the
combination may have been quite poorly tolerated. However, if it was
life saving, then it may well have been worth the ill feelings for a
short time. - Mod.TG]

One of the people trialled on prophylactic ribavirin subsequently
became ill and was readmitted to hospital. Hendra virus infection was
confirmed in this person by PCR.
