A 17-year-old youth who worked as a ranger in the rural area of the Colonia department died as a result of [a] hantavirus [infection], as confirmed to El Pais digital sources of the Ministry of Public Health [MSP].

This case is isolated, the sources explained, and now studies of the family and friends are done with no indication of symptoms. The Office of the Director of Health of the department assessed the area where the youth could have contracted the virus.

The hantavirus [infections] are registered sporadically in Uruguay. The 1st case was registered in 1997 and up to 2010 all the cases have been registered only south of Rio Negro. In January [2013] the MSP has requested [that people adopt] extreme precautions and classified the disease as emerging.

The virus is present in feces, urine and saliva of mice that when dried remain in the dust deposited in the soil and other surfaces, and get into the air as aerosols. Because of this, the MSP recommends that houses and rooms that have remained closed for a lot of time be ventilated for at lest 30 min before being entered for cleaning. People must take precautions to not breathe the dust.

Hantavirus [infections] produce fever over 38 C [100.4 F], chills, thirst and headache. In 2012, there were 13 infected people, more than double in 2011 when there were 6 cases. In 2012, 2 of the infected people died.

[The report above does not mention which hantavirus was responsible for this or previous cases in Uruguay. Although not mentioned specifically, the infections, and certainly the deaths, resulted from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Central Plata hantavirus could be the etiological agent responsible for these HPS cases. Its rodent host is _Oligoryzomus flavescens_ complex rodents.
