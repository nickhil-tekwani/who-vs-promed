Utah public health officials are investigating after recent cases of _E. coli_ have been linked to chicken salad purchased at Costco.

So far, cases have been reported in 7 states, including 5 cases in Utah. Those sickened in Utah are between the ages of 9 and 84 and include 3 women and 2 men. Two people in Utah have been hospitalized; no deaths have been reported. The cases in Utah were reported from 17 to 30 Oct 2015.

The Utah Department of Health is working with health partners, including the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Utah's local health departments to investigate the illness. The UDAF assisted in the investigation by gathering product samples for testing and encouraged stores to remove the product from sale. Most of the cases, including 4 out of the 5 Utah cases, reported eating Costco chicken salad.

The Utah Department of Health said in a news release:
"Although the chicken salad has not tested positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7, there is a strong association between reported illness and eating the salad. Out of an abundance of caution, Costco removed the chicken salad from their Utah stores on Fri 20 Nov 2015. However, people who bought chicken salad may still have the product in their refrigerators."

Consumers with "Chicken Salad made with Rotisserie Chicken" -- item number 37719 -- purchased from Costco in Utah should not eat it or feed it to your pets.

Other states with confirmed _E. coli_ cases linked to the chicken salad include Colorado, Montana and Washington.

The Department of Public Health and Human Services, along with the CDC, notified Costco customers on Tue 24 Nov 2015 to not eat chicken salad purchased at the store between 18 Oct 2015 to 23 Nov 2015 because of _E. coli_ concerns.

Since late October 2015, 6 people in Gallatin, Lewis and Clark, and Yellowstone counties have become ill from _E. coli_ bacteria. Two of those people were hospitalized, officials said.

The cases are part of a larger outbreak involving multiple states. The origin of the outbreak is unknown.

Others states with confirmed _E. coli_ cases linked to Costco chicken salad include Colorado, Utah and Washington, officials said.

Investigations have determined Costco chicken salad to be a risk factor. Costco already has voluntarily removed the chicken salad, item No. 37719, from its shelves, and no other products are a concern at this time, DPHHS officials said.

[Chicken as well as turkey are unusual primary sources of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections in humans. It is possible that another ingredient in the chicken salad is the vehicle or that the chicken was cross-contaminated with the pathogen during or after cooking by poor kitchen hygiene. ProMED awaits more information regarding the scope and source of this ongoing outbreak.

The 1st post states that 7 states are involved, but only Montana, Utah, Colorado, and Washington have been named. - Mod.LL]
