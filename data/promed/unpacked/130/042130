Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: further investigation is continuing through
virus isolation and virus neutralization. Genotyping of the virus is
being performed. Three positive samples are being sent to the
Community Reference Laboratory (Virology Institute, Veterinary
University of Hanover [Germany]) for further investigation. All pigs
from the infected farm were culled and delivered to a rendering plant.
Yesterday and today [10, 11 Jul 2009] all small holdings within the
3km (2mi) radius zone (protection zone) around the Rabiki farm (27
keepers who keep 41 pigs) and within the 10km (6mi) radius zone
(surveillance area) (46 keepers with 71 pigs) were additionally
inspected and no clinical signs were observed. No movement, no trade
(in or out) of pigs from the infected farm was done since [17 Feb
2009] till now.

Measures applied by the State Food and Veterinary Service to control
this classical swine fever (CSF) outbreak are:
1. Intensive clinical and laboratory surveillance is being carried out
in commercial pig holdings throughout the country and in particular in
in-contact holdings according to the CSF diagnostic manual laid down
in Decision 2002/106/EC;
2. Ban for dispatching [exporting] pigs from Lithuania;
3. Samples are taken for laboratory investigation from pig holdings
that have dispatched pigs to other countries during the last 2 months;
as from next week [week of 13 Jul 2009], if all controls are negative,
a derogation will be possible to dispatch pigs outside Lithuania only
for direct transport to the slaughterhouse under the authorization by
the competent authority following the satisfactory clinical and
laboratory results in accordance with the CSF diagnostic manual;
4. Reduced introduction of pigs from other countries;
5. An official veterinarian has been designated to an in-contact
holding within the restricted area in Panevezys region;
6. Strict implementation of measures foreseen in Directive 2001/89/EC
in particular in the 3km and 10km restriction zones;
7. Reinforced hunting and testing of hunted and found dead wild boar;
8. Information campaign in the country;
9. Review of the above measures in place in the light of the new
epidemiological information available.

No other outbreaks of CSF have been detected.

Control measures
Measures applied:
- control of arthropods
- control of wildlife reservoirs
- stamping out
- quarantine
- movement control inside the country
- screening
- zoning
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
- dipping / spraying
- vaccination prohibited
- no treatment of affected animals

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Food and Veterinary Risk Assessment
Institute (national laboratory)
Species: swine
Test: reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Test date: 10 Jul 2009
Result: positive

Future reporting: the event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports
will be submitted.

[While it is good there are intensive surveillance measures being
applied to small holder swine owners in the surrounding areas, this
outbreak occurred on a comparatively large farm which housed swine
imported from Denmark -- see references below. Although these swine
have been destroyed, it would still be useful to complete the outbreak
investigation, which should not only include virus isolation and
genotyping but also good shoe-leather epidemiology and intensive
outbreak investigation techniques.

The county of Panevezio (in Russian, Penevezhsky okrug), one of
Lithuania's 10 main administrative regions, is situated in the
northeast. See maps at
