The Georgia Department of Agriculture confirmed 3 EIA cases in Lamar County in August 2018.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 2 Nov 2018 that the Georgia Department of Agriculture had issued an update on the equine infectious anemia (EIA) cases found in Lamar County in August 2018. [ProMED-mail posted on those cases in August 2018: Equine infectious anemia - USA (06): (GA) 20180810.5957983].

On 6 Aug 2018, the EDCC said: "The Georgia Department of Agriculture has confirmed ... EIA in 3 horses in Lamar County. The positive horses were identified through surveillance for an EIA trace initiated in another state and were euthanized. The remainder of the herd is under quarantine pending following up testing in 60 days."

On 2 Nov 2018, the EDCC reported the department lifted the quarantine on one premise after follow-up testing revealed no additional cases.

"A 2nd premise remains under quarantine pending results from follow-up testing," the EDCC said.

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA. Most U.S. states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test in order to travel. Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease.

Not all horses show signs of disease, but those that do can exhibit:
- Progressive condition loss;
- Muscle weakness;
- Poor stamina;
- Fever;
- Depression; and
- Anemia.

There is no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with EIA dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards away from unaffected equids) for the rest of life.

[It is nice to get a follow up regarding release of quarantine on one of the premises. Hopefully, the other will get release soon with no positive cases.

Sadly, there is no vaccine for this disease. It is a very sad disease, and in most states it is regulated with strict quarantine issues for the life of the horse or euthanasia. Perhaps we will have a vaccine someday, or dare we dream for no insects capable of transmitting this and other diseases?

"Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a non-contagious, infectious disease of horses and other Equidae. It is caused by an RNA virus classified in the _Lentivirus_ genus, family Retroviridae. EIA can present as an acute, subacute, or chronic infection. On occasion, the virus can be a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The most frequently encountered form of the disease is the unapparent, chronically infected carrier. This chronic carrier state is the reason for some of the regulations when equids go to a show or event or are shipped for any reason.

Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily bloodborne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and, to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host-defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.

No specific treatment or safe and effective vaccine is available. Because equids infected with EIA virus present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 meters [219 yd]) from other equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of seropositive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to the virus after ingesting colostrum. In most cases, passive antibody against EIA virus wanes and is no longer detectable in the Coggins test by 6-8 months of age; detectable antibody may persist up to 12 months, however, if ELISA testing is used." - Mod.TG
