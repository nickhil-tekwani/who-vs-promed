If someone has recently been bitten by a rat or come into contact with rodent droppings and develops a fever above 38 C [100.4 F] for unknown reasons, they should seek proper medical attention as soon as possible.

Recently, a 30-year-old fish farmer in Doumen District of Zhuhai, Mr. L, developed high fever, headache, and red eyes the day after being bitten by a rat. After undergoing treatment at a local hospital without improvement, he was transferred to the infectious disease prevention and control center of Zhongshan University Attached No. 5 Hospital.

Examination found that Mr. L's platelet count had dropped to 21.0*10 to the power of 9/L (normal range is 125-350*10 to the power of 9/L), and [he tested] positive for epidemic hemorrhagic fever IgM antibodies. [He received a] confirmed diagnosis of epidemic hemorrhagic fever. Following anti-viral treatment and treatment of symptoms by the infection prevention and control center of the hospital in conjunction with the dialysis center, laboratory, transfusion department, and other departments, Mr. L gradually recovered and has been discharged.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dan Silver for submitting this report.

The above report does not indicate what the etiological agent of the epidemic hemorrhagic fever is nor the species of the rat that bit the man. The rat bite suggests Seoul hantavirus might be involved.

Seoul hantavirus infection is common in China and occurs in localities where the natural host, the brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), is found. Interestingly, in early June [2020], a driver in Guangdong province also developed hemorrhagic fever with kidney failure, a feature of Seoul virus infection, which is not mentioned specifically in the above report. However, that report does mention treatment in the dialysis center, indicating kidney failure.

A photo of the brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_) can be seen at https://www.biolib.cz/IMG/GAL/41858.jpg.

Low platelet counts, mentioned above, occur with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus infection, but it is tick transmitted, and there is no mention of ticks in the above report. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is mosquito borne. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information about this case. - Mod.TY
