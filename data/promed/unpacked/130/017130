YELLOW FEVER VACCINE SHORTAGE - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
*******************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Jack Woodall <woodall@promedmail.org>

In February 1999, it was reported that "For the past few weeks,
yellow fever (YF) vaccine has not been available in the UK owing to a
production failure." (see ref. below). Today [Mon 31 Jan 2005],
messages have appeared on the TRAVELMED list reporting critical
shortages of YF vaccine in Italy and South Africa. Experts from the
United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO), based in Rome,
who travel to rural areas in many countries in Africa & South America
endemic for YF, are having difficulty in getting 1st vaccinations or
boosters. This presumably also affects business travelers and people
who travel to rural areas in endemic zones to visit family.
Since many YF endemic countries do not require visitors to be
vaccinated, this may not impact their work or visit, but because of
the presence of the YF vector mosquito in many urban areas of those
countries, this situation significantly increases the risk of an
unvaccinated visitor contracting YF in the interior and being
hospitalized in a city where (if they are in an unscreened room) they
may be bitten by mosquitoes and start an urban epidemic. This would
be a huge disaster if the patient were hospitalized on return to Asia
(see refs. below).
ProMED would like to know whether other countries are experiencing a
similar YF vaccine shortage, and what is being done to resolve the
problem.
