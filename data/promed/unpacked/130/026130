MSF case studies show 1st 2 babies reported to be born Ebola-negative to mothers with the virus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontiéres' (MSF) case studies published in The Lancet this month [see [2] below] examine the 1st 2 Ebola-negative babies ever known to be born to Ebola-positive mothers. Both the mothers and babies received trial Ebola treatments while in an MSF-supported Ebola treatment center (ETC) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Historically, nearly all babies born to Ebola-positive mothers have been miscarried or stillborn, or died shortly after birth. While the survival of these 2 newborns could signal that babies at risk of Ebola may benefit from these medicines immediately after they're born, more research is needed before any conclusions can be made, said the international medical humanitarian organization.

"MSF has been working with affected countries to fight Ebola outbreaks for decades," said Dr Saschveen Singh, tropical infectious diseases advisor for MSF and one of the authors of the report. "These cases provide hope that Ebola may no longer be a death sentence for babies born to mothers with the virus. We can't say for certain that these antibody therapies are the answer to preventing the spread of Ebola from mothers to their babies, but we can say these observations from our work in DRC are very encouraging and that more research should urgently be done for vulnerable groups like pregnant women and their babies."

The paper published documents 2 babies who were born in an MSF-supported ETC in Beni, DRC in 2019 during the 2018-20 Kivu Ebola epidemic. Each set of mothers and infants were given monoclonal antibody treatment (mAB114 or REGN-EB3) as part of the PALM randomized controlled trial, which was led by the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale, DRC Ministry of Health, and the National Institutes of Health. In addition to these medicines, strict infection prevention and control measures were in place at the ETC, which helped reduce the possibility of the babies being exposed after birth. Neither newborn developed Ebola while in the hospital and bothe were able to be discharged home approximately 21 days after they were born.

Historically, babies born to mothers with Ebola are infected with Ebola themselves and very rarely have survived. Only 15 babies were reported to be born alive to Ebola-positive mothers before 2015, but all were infected and subsequently died within 28 days. Before these 2 babies observed in MSF's case studies, only 2 others had been reported to survive past 28 days, but both were Ebola-positive at birth -- one in Guinea in 2015 who received new treatments that were being studied at the time and one in DRC in 2019 who was born to a mother who was uninfected at the time of delivery after recovering from Ebola 3 weeks earlier.

"When Ebola hits a community, it hits hard," Dr Singh said. "The neonatal mortality rate during the West African Ebola epidemic was practically 100 percent for infants born to mothers with Ebola. Only one infected newborn who was given new Ebola treatments that were being studied was known to survive the West Africa outbreak. That means almost every single mother who contracted Ebola lost her baby. Most of those mothers tragically also lost their lives."

Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever that has killed anywhere from 25 percent to 90 percent of infected people in past outbreaks, causing terror among affected communities. Until very recently, no effective treatments existed against Ebola. However, new tools have become available in the last several years to help fight the virus, including 2 effective vaccines and two antibody treatments that have been shown to reduce the risk of death if given to people with Ebola early in the course of their infection. In the past, vulnerable groups like pregnant women and babies born to Ebola-positive mothers had been left out of most research and clinical trials, so health workers didn't know exactly how to treat them to give them the best chance of survival. During the 2018-2020 Kivu Ebola epidemic in DRC, pregnant women and babies were offered new treatments and showed some promising outcomes, though further research is needed to determine the best possible care for these groups.

Summary
-------
Background
Few fetuses survive childbirth when the mother is positive for Ebola virus, with almost all being miscarried or stillborn, or dying shortly after birth. Before 2019, only 2 infants had been reported surviving past 28 days, of whom one tested positive for Ebola virus and subsequently received experimental therapies. Little is understood regarding the care of surviving neonates born to Ebola virus-positive mothers in the postnatal period and how novel anti-Ebola virus therapies might affect neonatal outcomes.

Methods
In this case series, we report on 2 neonates liveborn during the 2018-20 North Kivu Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo who, along with their Ebola virus-positive mothers, received investigational monoclonal antibody treatment (mAB114 or REGN-EB3) as part of a randomised controlled trial (NCT03719586).

Findings
Both infants were born Ebola-negative and progressed well while in the Ebola Treatment Centre. Neither neonate developed evidence of Ebola virus disease during the course of the admission, and both were Ebola-negative at 21 days and remained healthy at discharge.

Interpretation
To our knowledge, these neonates are the 1st documented as Ebola virus-negative at birth after being born to Ebola virus-positive mothers, and only the 3rd and 4th neonates ever documented to have survived into infancy. Although no conclusions can be drawn from this small case series, and further research is required to investigate the neonatal effects of antibody therapies, these cases warrant review regarding whether post-delivery antibody therapy should be considered for all liveborn neonates of Ebola virus-positive mothers. In the context of a low resource setting, where survival of low-birthweight infants is poor, these cases also highlight the importance of adequate neonatal care.

[This is a very small series of only 2 cases, but it nevertheless provides additional support for the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody treatments against Ebola virus disease, and the full article is well worth reading.

To recap the background of these treatments, mAB114 is derived from a single antibody recovered from an Ebola survivor in the DRC in 1995, and REGN-EB3 is a cocktail of 3 monoclonal antibodies against Ebola. Both treatments were among the experimental therapeutics approved by the DRC in June 2018, and among the 4 agents subsequently included in the PALM study, an unprecedented clinical trial that was carried out during a full-blown Ebola epidemic and amidst violent civil conflict in North Kivu province in 2018-2019 [1,2].

As part of this clinical trial, both mothers randomly received mAB114 within hours of admission to the Ebola treatment center and one neonate received mAB114 whereas the other received REGN-EB3 within hours of birth. Both mothers unfortunately died shortly after childbirth of uncontrolled hemorrhage, but both infants survived through discharge while remaining negative for Ebola virus infection and disease.

The New England Journal of Medicine article reporting the remarkable effectiveness of these 2 monoclonal antibody therapies against Ebola was published almost exactly one year ago [12 Dec 2019], and yet that seems eons ago and nearly forgotten amidst the overwhelming COVID-19 pandemic that followed almost immediately afterwards. In recalling the results of the PALM trial, one wonders why antibody therapies directed against SARS-CoV-2, whether in the form of convalescent serum or monoclonal antibodies, have yet to demonstrate comparable effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 disease.
