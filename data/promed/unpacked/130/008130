FDA Panel OKs First Lyme Vaccine
The first vaccine against Lyme disease passed a major hurdle as government
advisers reluctantly backed its sale, despite a list of safety concerns.
Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted Tuesday that SmithKline
Beecham's LYMErix vaccine meets federal requirements for U.S. sale to
certain people at risk of the tick-borne illness. But the FDA panel had
numerous caveats: --Nobody knows how many booster shots are needed and
whether getting boosters year after year will prove safe. The panel only
backed the initial three doses of LYMErix.
--No one knows whether it's safe for people with chronic arthritis or
undiagnosed Lyme disease.
--Unlike any other vaccine, it takes a year for LYMErix to build up optimal
immunity.
--And while children most urgently need a vaccine, LYMErix initially is
just for people over age 15 because SmithKline is only now beginning
pediatric studies.
"It's rare that a vaccine be voted on with such ambivalence and a stack of
provisos," said Dr. Patricia Ferrieri of the University of Minnesota, who
chaired the FDA advisory panel. Because Lyme disease is a serious threat in
parts of the country, "the benefits are on the side of the vaccine in the
short term," said Dr. Dixie Snider of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. "In the long term, we don't know."
The FDA is not bound by its advisers' recommendations but typically follows
them.
SmithKline already has begun studies to answer some of the panel's
questions, particularly about the booster doses. But the FDA panel also
demanded that SmithKline study the vaccine's long-term safety after it
begins selling.
In a study of 10,936 people in high-Lyme states, LYMErix proved 79 percent
effective at preventing Lyme infections after the third dose. But the third
dose is given a full year after the first shot, and the vaccine is only 50
percent effective in that first year. So FDA's advisers urged that people
be warned to continue to use insecticide, avoid tick-prone areas and check
carefully for tick bites.
But the FDA's biggest question is safety. LYMErix's main side effects were
soreness and swelling at the vaccination site, plus a few days of joint
pain, fatigue and fever. There is another concern: A small number of people
with advanced Lyme disease get untreatable rheumatoid arthritis, associated
with natural development of antibodies to Osp-A. Scientists wonder whether
the vaccine itself could occasionally cause serious arthritis, and if so,
whether some people are genetically vulnerable.
SmithKline insisted that people vaccinated so far have no more joint
problems than people testing a dummy vaccine. Still, two people with a
certain genetic immune trait did develop temporary but unusual
arthritis-related symptoms in some joints, and panelists urged further study.
