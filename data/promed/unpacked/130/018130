Kentucky animal health officials have reported the commonwealth's 1st case of Potomac horse fever (PHF) in a 4 year old thoroughbred filly from Bourbon County.

E S Rusty Ford, equine operations consultant for the Kentucky state veterinarian's office, said in a statement that the filly presented on 1 Jun 2018 with profuse watery diarrhea, lethargy, and a fever of about 104 F [40 C]. The filly was isolated at a hospital, and PCR testing (fecal swab/feces) confirmed the PHF diagnosis. "Following treatment, the symptoms began resolving over the weekend," Ford said. "This morning (Mon 4 Jun 2018), the patient is described as being significantly improved with a favorable prognosis."

Potomac horse fever is an acute enterocolitis syndrome that presents as mild colic, fever, and diarrhea in horses of all ages, Ford's statement said. The resulting illness can also cause abortion in pregnant mares. The causative agent, _Neorickettsia risticii_, is a Gram negative bacterium.

It is believed most horses contract PHF after inadvertent ingestion of aquatic insects that carry _N. risticii_. The disease is often found to be associated with pastures bordering creeks or rivers and has an incubation period of 10 to 18 days.

"Historically, it is a bit later in the year when we begin recognizing PHF in Central Kentucky and believe the early detection this year [2018] is likely a result of the unusual climatic conditions we experienced these past 8 weeks that include abundant rainfall during the month of April 2018 and continued with record breaking heat temperatures throughout May 2018," Ford said.

"Horsemen are encouraged to review the environment that their horses are housed in and consult their veterinarians on strategies they may use to mitigate disease risk," he added. "Minimizing insect ingestion in stabled horses by turning off barn lights at night, which normally attract the insects, has been suggested."

To quote my able colleague Mod.TG, this disease goes by many names and can mimic conditions such as salmonellosis, which can complicate the diagnosis.

Potomac horse fever has several names, including equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, ditch fever, Shasta River crud, and equine ehrlichial colitis. You will note that some of these synonyms are descriptive of the water as well as the condition.

Potomac horse fever (PHF) is an acute enterocolitis syndrome producing mild colic, fever, and diarrhea in horses of all ages, as well as abortion in pregnant mares. The causative agent, _Neorickettsia risticii_ has been reported in dogs and cats; cattle appear to be resistant to infection.

The clinical features of PHF are typified initially by mild depression and anorexia, followed by a fever of 102-107 F (38.9-41.7 C). At this stage, intestinal sounds may be decreased. Within 24-48 hours, a moderate to severe diarrhea with feces ranging in consistency from that usually seen in cows to watery develops in approximately 60 percent of affected horses. The onset of diarrhea is often accompanied by mild abdominal discomfort. Some horses develop severe signs of sepsis and dehydration. Clinical signs can be indistinguishable from those of salmonella and other infectious causes of enterocolitis.

Several months after clinical disease in pregnant mares, abortion due to fetal infection with _N. risticii_ may occur. Experimentally, pregnant mares infected at 100-160 days of gestation abort at 190-250 days of gestation. The abortion is accompanied by placentitis and retained placenta. Fetal lesions include colitis, periportal hepatitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia of mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen. Necropsy findings in nonpregnant horses with enterocolitis are nonspecific and reveal diffuse inflammation, mainly in the large intestines.

A definitive diagnosis should be based on isolation or identification of _N. risticii_ from the blood or feces of infected horses by cell culture or PCR. Serologic testing is of limited value as a diagnostic tool.

Treatment with oxytetracycline intravenously is the recommended treatment. The article nicely described prevention of the disease, especially as it relates to lights and the attraction of the flies.

Perhaps someday, we will have a better vaccine that will include the various strains and be more protective.
