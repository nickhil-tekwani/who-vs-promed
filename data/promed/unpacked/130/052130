In Kherson region, one lethal case of botulism has occurred; the press service of the Health Ministry reported a man presented for the medical service too late and it was not possible to save him. He was taken to Kherson regional hospital in the evening of 10 Sep 2018 in extremely serious condition. He died an hour after hospitalization. His wife, who is also in serious condition, remains in intensive care. The probable cause of the infection is homemade smoked fish.

The Health Ministry noted that it is the 8th lethal case of botulism in 2018 and urges people to seek medical attention if there is the slightest suspicion of infection. According to the ministry, 80 cases of botulism were reported in Ukraine since the beginning of 2018, with 93 patients, 8 of whom died.

Earlier the Chief Department of the State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Protection in Kharkiv region reported that a member of one family was hospitalized with suspicion of botulism. The police have begun the investigation due to the death from botulism in Kharkiv.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound) and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the most common. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (1,2). In Ukraine, many of the cases are type E related to the ingestion of salted or dried fish, as here. - Mod.LL
