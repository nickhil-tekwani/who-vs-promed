10 horses died and 41 were positive during the 2 months of Nile virus
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Just 2 months after confirmation of the 1st outbreak of West Nile
fever in Andalusia, and especially in Jerez, the number of horses
that have tested positive has amounted to 41, of which 10 have died.

With respect to Jerez, a town in which the 1st cases of infected
horses and the 1st death were registered, so far the number of cases
has risen to 14, of which 4 horses have died according to information
provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of the Junta de
Andalucia. The alarm has been raised in Guarena, where a horse
breeder had 3 of his horses test positive for the West Nile Virus, 2
of which died.

The evolution of the disease in Andalusia has prompted a coordinated
action protocol to be launched to prevent further cases. With the
passing of the days Jerez has united with Chiclana, Vejer, San
Fernando, Medina, Los Barrios, Barbate and Conil, in the province of
Cadiz. Some municipalities were affected in the province of Seville,
as Lebrija, Las Cabezas de San Juan and El Cuervo.

Though the outbreak seemed to be restricted to Cadiz and Seville, on
26 Oct 2010 officials confirmed a case in Estepona in the province of
Malaga. Since then, there have been 3 cases: in El Cuervo, Las
Cabezas de San Juan, where the horse died, and one near Jerez, at
Sanlucar. The West Nile encephalitis is a non-contagious infectious
disease that is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito that primarily
affects migratory birds, which are the main epidemiological reservoir.

[According to OIE's data from Spain, last updated 3 Nov 2010
(follow-up report Number 2), the total number of WNV outbreaks in
horses, since the start of the epizootic on 26 Aug 2010, reached 31
and the disease was, reportedly, "continuing."

Between 14 and 27 Oct 2010, 15 new outbreaks started, all in
Andalucia; out of 659 susceptible horses in the said 15 locations, 19
showed clinical disease and 1 died. See, with a map, at
