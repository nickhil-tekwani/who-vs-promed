The number of cumulative cases [of Marburg virus disease] has grown to 15: 2 confirmed, 4 suspected, 3 probable cases and 6 ruled out.

In Kween district, our team managed to get a high-risk contact who has been in hiding and was found to have developed Marburg-like symptoms.

This patient is a 38-year-old male, brother to the confirmed case and the probable case. Because of his close contact with the probable and confirmed cases, he was listed as a high-risk contact. However, he refused review and follow-up by the contact tracing/surveillance team despite several attempts to do so. On the 24 Oct 2017, however, he accepted to speak to the contact tracing team, which noted that he had developed Marburg-like symptoms. He was transported to the isolation unit with fever, body weakness, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, joint pains and history of vomiting blood while at home. Despite the tireless efforts from a dedicated case management team to revive this case, he unfortunately passed away earlier today [26 Oct 2017]. A blood sample picked from this patient was sent to Uganda Virus Research Institute and tested positive for Marburg virus disease.

The other suspect case is a 25-year-old female from a village called Government Lodge, Kawowo parish, in Kapchorwa district, who presented with Marburg-like symptoms. She has since been isolated, and a sample was collected for confirmation. A pregnancy test was done and is positive. Her condition is, however, stable.

The new probable case is a 23-year-old male from Toywo village, Western Division, Kapchorwa Municipality. He shared a ward with and his bed was next to the deceased confirmed case. A blood sample was collected, and the case is still under isolation at Kapchorwa hospital in stable condition. His lab results are expected by tomorrow [27 Oct 2017].

The total number of contacts under follow up currently stands at 130, 85 from Kween, and 45 from Kapchorwa district. None of the contacts has developed symptoms today [26 Oct 2017].

As of this evening [26 Oct 2017], 32 out of the 77 contacts from Kapchorwa district had either completed the recommended 21 days after exposure, or are no longer being followed because the case they were exposed to turned out to be negative.

Our multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder teams of experts will remain on ground in Kapchorwa and Kween districts until the outbreak is fully contained.

The Ministry of Health appeals to the general public to remain alert and observe the following precautions to control the spread of the Marburg virus:
- Report any suspected patients immediately to a nearby health facility.
- Avoid direct contact with body fluids of a person presenting with bleeding tendencies or symptoms suggestive of Marburg virus disease.
- Health workers are further reminded to wear gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when taking care of ill patients or suspected cases.
- Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.
- Avoid contact with persons who have died from the disease.
- Allow health workers to perform dignified burials among victims who might have succumbed to the disease so as to minimise its spread to others.

[The number of suspected and probable cases continues to grow. A new suspected female case has occurred in a different district, apparently with no contact to the cases in the Kween district. Health authorities are proactively finding contacts and monitoring them. This is an important step in surveillance necessary to detect new cases, should any new ones occur. One hopes that the Ministry of Health recommendations are followed by the general public.
