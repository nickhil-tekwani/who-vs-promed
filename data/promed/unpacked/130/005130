WHO will treat sleeping sickness
-----------------------------------
The Maharashtra government, in coordination with the World Health
Organization (WHO), has initiated steps to treat the 1st person with
suspected Trypanosomiasis, or African sleeping sickness, in the country,
according to official sources here.
"WHO was informed the moment the rare infection was detected in a person at
Shivani village, in Chandrapur district, in [the] Vidarbha region of the
state," Ravindra Katti, deputy director of Health Services, told reporters.
He said that a WHO official, who is an expert in the field, visited the
patient and took his fluid samples for testing in a laboratory in France.
Katti, who is entrusted with the case, said that, although the Indian
veterinary laboratories had confirmed the detection of a protozoan parasite
causing Sleeping Sickness in the patient, physicians are awaiting the
results of a report from WHO, expected this week [3rd week of December
2004], before medicines, brought by the WHO expert because they are not
available in the country, will be given to the patient. The patient is
under observation, and his condition is improving, with a decrease in the
intensity of the symptoms, mainly fever, severe headaches, irritability,
extreme fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and aching muscles and joints, he added.
Katti said the case is a complicated one, because the protozoa parasite had
so far only been detected in Africa. He added that the parasite must be one
found in animals, and the patient might have contracted it from an infected
animal, since he worked as a veterinarian and treated cattle.

Comment on triatomid bugs in Southeast Asia
-------------------------------------
Concerning RFI 20041208.3259, in fact, there are several species of
_Triatominae_ present in Southeast and South Asia, most notably the
tropicopolitan species _Triatoma rubrofasciata_. At least 7 species of
_Triatoma_ have been identified in Southeast Asia, and one other genus
(_Linchcosteus_) from India. _T. rubrofasciata_ is a commonly encountered
species in Asia (urban and rural) that will occasionally feed on humans, a
bite that often leads to significant local swelling and sometimes severe
systemic reactions. This bug is also responsible for transmission of
_Trypanosoma conorhini_ in rodents (_Rattus_).
The suspicion that a patient in India may present a patent infection of
some form of trypanosomiasis is not entirely improbable. On the contrary,
suspected human cases of _Trypanosoma lewisi_, another murine parasite,
have been reported in India (2 cases, 1974) and Malaysia (one case, 1933).
There have been other incidental reports as well. However, unlike _T.
cruzi_, _T. lewisi_ is transmitted by fleas (notably, the notorious plague
flea _Xenopsylla cheopis_). The morphology of _T. lewisi_ can be easily
distinguished from _T. cruzi_. Moreover, assuming no travel-related
exposure or blood transfusions in the recent case, it appears nearly
impossible that _T. cruzi_, and most certainly the 2 African trypanosomes,
would be endemic in India.

[We are grateful to those who have written to ProMed about the report of a
trypanosome parasite infecting an India patient (20041208.3259). Perhaps
the following additional points will be of interest. There are some 120
species of triatomine bugs belonging to 17 genera, the most widely known
being _Triatoma_. 106 species only occur in the New World, 7 species (all
in the genus _Triatoma_ ) are found in Asia, and 6 species, belonging to
the genus _Linshcosteus_, occur in India, mainly in the south. As Dr.
Michael Bangs reports, _Triatoma rubrofasciata_ is common in Asia, but it
is also found in Africa, the New World, including the USA, and, among the
many Asian countries, it occurs in India. It is the most cosmopolitan
triatomine bug. In addition to _Xenopsylla cheopis_, another vector of _T.
conorhini_ is another rat flea, _Nosopyllus fasciatus_.
Trypanosome parasites are found in a great variety of mammals, but less
well known trypanosomes are found in fish (vectors being leeches),
amphibians (vectors are mainly leeches), reptiles (vectors are phlebotomine
sandflies, tsetse flies and leeches), and finally, avian trypanosomes
transmitted by mosquitoes, simuliid black-flies, hippoboscid flies and the
chicken mite (_Dermanyssus gallinae_). I agree with Dr. Bangs that we
cannot rule out trypanosome transmission to a patient in India, although I
would guess it is unlikely. However, there can only be speculation until
the source of the infection in the Indian patient is identified - Mod.MS]
