Department health authorities turned on the alarms in Santander after the National Institute of Health confirmed the 1st case of measles in a 6-year-old child from Venezuela residing in Bucaramanga.

The Secretary of Health of Santander, Luis Alejandro Rivero Osorio, explained that "this minor who arrives from Venezuela does not have any vaccines. Fortunately, in the department we try to make sure that parents have their children up to date with their vaccinations."

Rivero Osorio emphasized that the protocols of treatment and follow-up were already activated in the event cases are presented from the Hospital Local del Norte, where the minor from the state of Valencia [Venezuela] was treated, to give attention also to the family and to avoid the spread of the virus.

In Santander there are about 50 possible cases of measles pending confirmation, and since the beginning of this 2018 hospitals and health centers remain alert to the risk posed by the massive arrival of Venezuelans to the region without the complete set of vaccines.

Decades of progress in reducing the spread of measles have been stymied by outbreaks in Europe and the Americas, particularly in Venezuela. According to a recent report [see reference below] authored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of cases of the highly contagious disease reported worldwide has jumped by 31% between 2016 and 2017.

Measles is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable infant deaths.

Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every 2-3 years and measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. Thanks to modern healthcare and vaccination policies, the spread of the disease has been greatly reduced. For instance, between 2000 and 2017, reported measles cases dropped by 80% worldwide (from 853 479 to 173 330). During this time, researchers estimate that vaccination prevented 21.1 million deaths.

However, when vaccination coverage is poor, measles can easily resurface even in regions where it had previously been eradicated, largely due to international travelers carrying the virus. Just 2 years ago, the WHO stated that measles was no longer circulating in the Americas. Today, endemic measles is back on the American continents, largely due to a terrible outbreak in Venezuela: the country where inflation reached 1 million percent and whose public system has gone into disarray could no longer afford to properly organize vaccination campaigns. Today, there are 3545 confirmed cases of measles in Venezuela since 2016, which have resulted in 62 deaths.

From there, Venezuelan refugees have spread the disease to other parts of the continent -- especially in Brazil.

Measles outbreaks have also appeared elsewhere, including Europe and some parts of the United States. This time, however, the stead of the disease was not triggered by civil upheaval and economic collapse, but rather by the refusal of some parents to vaccinate their children. From 2016-2017, the number of cases of measles in Europe rose by 458%, to 24 356.

According to the latest entry in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, there were 173 300 cases of measles reported worldwide in 2017, compared to only 132 328 in 2016. That's still a much better situation than the world was facing only 2 decades ago. However, it's disappointing to see how so much hard-earned progress is [lost].

This study shows just how vulnerable populations can be, even in places where measles had been previously all but eradicated.

The Davao City Epidemiological Surveillance Unit (Davao CESU) recorded 22 measles deaths from January to September 2018.

In the data from CESU, there are 602 suspected cases of measles in the city from January to September 2018 and 45 of those are confirmed cases.

District C consisting of [10] barangays [smallest administrative division] has 83 suspected measles cases and 5 deaths, the highest so far in the city.

The data prompted the city government of Davao to intensify vaccination and immunization to children through the School-based immunization of the City Health Office (CHO) last August 2018; however, the CHO has low turnout as parents continue to fear Dengvaxia [vaccine for dengue fever].

"Measles (vaccine) has been given for decades with no complications and dengvaxia is new, we are not giving it [to the public]," CHO head Dr Josephine Villafuerte said on a text message to SunStar Davao on [Tue 4 Dec 2018].

Chief Technical Division of the CHO Doctor Julinda Acosta said yesterday [4 Dec 2018] the school-based immunization program continued to have a low turnout and this has become a problem.

"Ang measles ay hindi pa nawawala," [measles has not disappeared yet] she said, adding that their office may have to give the vaccines to private schools to be used since parents from public schools refuse to have their children immunized and vaccinated.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported over 17 200 measles cases in the Philippines in 2018 or 367 percent increase compared to last year [2017].

[4] Vaccination: measles and chicken pox
Date: Sun 2 Dec 2018

Health officials express concerns over recent outbreaks of measles and chickenpox.

Officials say many of today's parents who are deciding not to vaccinate their children have no firsthand experience with measles and chickenpox. There are cases popping up all over, and there's a simple reason behind it.

At a private school in North Carolina, 36 children developed chickenpox in a community that has the highest rate of vaccination exemptions for religious beliefs.

In New Jersey [USA], one county has 18 people infected with measles in an outbreak state health officials continue to monitor.

In Rockland county in New York, 87 people have received diagnoses with measles in an on-going outbreak after local residents visited Israel, where an outbreak has infected nearly 900 people.

New York state health officials warn people that measles is one of the most contagious viruses on Earth and, as a result, 90 percent of unvaccinated people exposed to the virus contract it.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently warned that reported cases of measles spiked in 2017 because multiple countries -- due to gaps in vaccination coverage -- experienced severe outbreaks of the preventable disease.

WHO estimates 110 000 died from measles last year [2017].

Overall, reported cases have increased by more that 30 percent across the globe since 2016.

The worst appears to be happening in the Americas, the eastern Mediterranean region, and Europe, according to a new report by leading health organizations.

In some countries, such as Afghanistan -- which leads the globe in measles infection rates -- access to potentially life-saving medicine is in short supply and hard to come by.

In other countries, many people opt out of vaccinations for a variety of personal and religious reasons.

Dr Soumya Swaminathan, deputy director-general for programs at WHO, says the resurgence of measles "is of serious concern," and the most troubling areas are those that were close to eliminating measles.

"Without urgent efforts to increase vaccination coverage and identify populations with unacceptable levels of under or unimmunized children, we risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating but entirely preventable disease," she said in a statement.

Opting out of vaccinations
------------------------
Diseases such as measles and chickenpox are seeing a resurgence because of an increasing number of parents who opt out of vaccinating their children, officials say.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the percentage of 2-year-olds who have never received a single vaccination has quadrupled since 2001, reaching 1.3 percent of children born in 2015.

While that's still a relatively low number, it does reflect a change.

There appears to be distrust in vaccinations in a generation who may not have any firsthand knowledge of the diseases routine shots prevent. This includes the once-common chickenpox and measles.

Herd immunity -- when large swaths of the population are immunized -- is one of the best defenses humanity has against diseases like measles, which are easily spread through sneezing and coughing.

For protection against measles, about 93 percent of a community needs to get vaccinated, according to Dr Sharon Nachman, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Medicine in New York.

For other diseases, it can be as low as 80 percent.

"Remember, no vaccine is 100 percent effective, so protection depends on the uptake of vaccine in the community, plus how effective the vaccine is, plus how infectious the illness is," Nachman told Healthline. "It's really a complicated equation."

Out of sight, out of mind
-------------------------
Because some diseases, such as measles, have been removed from society for so long, many people don't have firsthand knowledge of what it's like having the disease: the high fever, itchy and painful rash, and even bronchitis, pneumonia, and encephalitis, or swelling of the brain.

Measles was actually considered eradicated, or not continually being transmitted year-round, in the United States in 2000, says the CDC.

"But if we look at how the incidence of measles has been reduced from a million cases a year to thousands of cases a year, that means millions of children will never have to know what measles is like," [Dr Randy Bergen, a pediatrician with the Permanente Medical Group in Northern California] said. "The other thing that I wish parents who are risk adverse would take into consideration is that their decision not to vaccinate their children would be considerably riskier if many other parents made the same decision."

It goes back to herd immunity. Children who aren't vaccinated are still protected by those who did vaccinate their children.

To Bergen, there's a clear societal benefit -- and therefore an obligation -- to consider the health of all children within the community.

"I think that sometimes parents who make the decision not to vaccinate their children do not consider the health of other children as much as they should," he said.

The bottom line
---------------
Health officials say recent outbreaks of measles and chickenpox in North Carolina, New York, and New Jersey are due, at least in part, to parents who decide not to vaccinate their children.

Officials say there's been an increase since 2001 in the number of young children who have never received a vaccination.

[Vaccine hesitancy is a global problem that appears to be growing. One would think education of parents would solve the problem, but that doesn't appear to be the case as people reject the scientific evidence demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Losing a child to a vaccine-preventable disease is totally unnecessary and a terrible thing. - Mod.LK
