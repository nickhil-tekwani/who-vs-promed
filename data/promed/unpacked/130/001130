1st confirmed report of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ in Switzerland
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Switzerland recently informed EPPO of the 1st official finding of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (_Pospiviroid_, PSTVd - EPPO A2 List) on plants of _Capsicum annuum_ (various seedless cultivars) on its territory.

In March 2016, PSTVd was simultaneously detected (RT-PCR, sequencing) in 2 distinct places of production (greenhouses) located in the cantons of Zurich and Aargau. The infected capsicum plants belonged to the same lot which had been imported from a Dutch nursery in which PSTVd has recently been found [ProMED-mail post 20160422.4175522]. Affected plants did not show any specific symptoms.

Official measures have been taken to eradicate PSTVd. All capsicum plants belonging to the infected lot have been destroyed by incineration and as a precaution, hygiene measures have also been imposed until further notice at the 2 production sites. Investigations are currently being carried out on other plant lots and species of _Solanum_ at both places of production whether mechanical transmission or transmission via irrigation water has occurred.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops including potato, tomato, and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic") disease in potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses can be up to 65 per cent in potato and up to 50 per cent in tomato. Many solanaceous ornamental and weed species are also susceptible to PSTVd and may serve as pathogen reservoirs. PSTVd has been included on the EPPO A2 quarantine list.

Symptoms in potato may include spindly shoots, stunting of plants, severely distorted tubers ('spindles'), and delayed sprouting. In tomatoes, symptoms include leaf chlorosis and distortion, shortening of internodes, stunting of plants, and absence of flowers. Capsicum plants show stunting and a loss of plant vigour but often display only mild symptoms of leaf distortion. Infection of solanaceous ornamentals is often symptomless. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, but mild strains causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 per cent, depending on the host cultivar. It is assumed to have spread among potato germplasm collections all over the world via infected true seed. Tomato seed has also been shown to constitute a considerable quarantine risk (ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560). Spread occurs also via infected plants or vegetative plant parts (potato seed tubers, tomato, and capsicum explants), pollen, mechanical means (including insects and during handling procedures), and plant-to-plant contact. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_ can PSTVd also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_).

Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large number of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are complicated. The presence of PSTVd (and other pospiviroids) in a number of symptomless reservoir hosts has been reported from several countries and must be considered a threat to crops. Furthermore, PSTVd is exceptionally stable and can survive in dried sap or plant residue for considerable times. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other possible sources of inoculum, phytosanitary procedures, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free seed and other planting material.

The current PSTVd outbreak on seedless capsicum in Netherlands (ProMED-mail post 20160422.4175522) has been traced back to propagation material imported from Israel in 2014 and 2015. Planting material was produced from these cultivars and distributed in the Netherlands and other European states. A similar PSTVd sequence has been found in all samples. Infected plants are being burnt, neighbouring plantings will be tested and other production sites surveyed.

Pospiviroids are considered an emerging phytosanitary threat worldwide because of their potential effects on a number of very important crops. Commercial imports of seed or planting stock carry a high risk of an incursion and the importance of reliable certification and screening schemes before release to growers has been recognised.
