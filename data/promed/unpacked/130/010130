The Kathmandu Post reported on 13 Sep 2009 peste des petits ruminants
[PPR] has occurred in goats in Mahottari District, in [the Central
Region of] Nepal bordering India. Local farmers have suffered heavy
losses since the outbreak. More than 20 villages in the area raise
goats as their primary activity. Last week [week of 7 Sep 2009], 37
goats in local villages died and many more were infected.

[PPR is endemic in Nepal; though its presence in the Indian
subcontinent was first recognised in 1987, experts are of the opinion
that it had been present there for many years before -- maybe even
before its initial identification in West Africa (reference below).

Its presence in Nepal, and the disease dynamics there, were discussed
in 2 ProMED-mail postings during 1998.
