A mosquito-borne disease has been plaguing Territorians, with case
numbers already reaching record highs this year [2009]. The data from
the [Australian] Centre of Disease Control shows confirmed cases of
the Ross River virus have been rampant. Up to 203 Territorians have
been infected with the energy sapping virus from January to March
[2009] -- the highest number since 1990. At the same time last year
[2008] 94 cases were reported.

Senior medical entomologist Peter Whelan said the numbers were "very
high" compared to other states. He said people infected with the
virus could carry it [its effects] for months. "Some people can take
weeks to get over it," he said. "Others can take months."

The statistics showed the Darwin region accounted for most of the
cases. Mr Whelan said the rapid increase may have been caused by the
amount and timing of rain in the Territory. But he said the movement
of people has also contributed to the jump with population numbers
moving further into mosquito breeding grounds. "The rural area is
expanding rapidly," he said. "That's because people may have less
sophisticated houses out there in terms of screens, as well as that
they may live closer to mosquito-breeding areas now."

Ross River virus [infection] results in swelling and pain in muscles
and joints, fever, lack of energy, chills, sweating, headache, and a
rash.

Leanyer and Holmes jungle swamps are some of the urban breeding hot spots.

Extensive helicopter controls have been in place to reduce the
numbers of infection. But Mr Whelan said the health department had
not yet reached an agreement with the Palmerston City Council to
manage the region.

[This is the 1st report of a Ross River virus outbreak in the
Northern Territory since 2001. In ProMED-mail archive no.
20010205.0237, posted on 5 Feb 2001, Dr David Peacock, Head of
Surveillance, Centre for Disease Control, Darwin, NT, reported on
Ross River virus mosquito vectors:

"The principal mosquito vectors for RRV are the following:
_Aedes vigilax_ ("salt marsh mosquito") in the Top End of the
Northern Territory (Darwin Region, East Arnhem, and Katherine
District), a salt marsh mosquito principally occurring within 10 km
(6.2 mi) of salt marsh and tidal rivers in late dry to early wet
season (August to January). This mosquito bites day and night.
_Aedes normanensis_, a flood water mosquito principally present for 2
weeks following wet season flooding. It is found from subcoastal
areas to midway between Tennant Creek and Alice Springs and bites by
day (in shaded places) and in the evenings and night.
_Culex annulirostris_ ("common banded mosquito") has a Territory-wide
distribution from December to June. It breeds in shallow permanent
and temporary water and bites after sundown and night. Finally, to a
lesser extent, the mosquito _Aedes notoscriptus_, which breeds in
artificial receptacles in urban areas and bites throughout the day,
like _Ae. normanensis_."

Mod.CP provided an excellent summary of the Ross River virus
situation in Australia in ProMED-mail archive no. 20040403.0916:

"Epidemics of benign polyarthritis were recorded in Australia as
early as 1927, and the etiologic agent was isolated in 1963. Ross
River virus was shown to be a mosquito-transmitted virus belonging to
the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_. Ross River virus
is endemic in most coastal regions of Australia and since the 1980s
appears to have extended its geographical range to include most of
the island communities of the South Pacific. The animal reservoir
species are various, and humans exhibit a significant viraemia such
that some epidemics are maintained in a human-mosquito-human
transmission cycle. The mosquito vectors vary according to the local
environment. Fortunately, illness in humans -- although occasionally
prolonged and painful -- is not fatal, and recovery is complete."
