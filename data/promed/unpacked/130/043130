Panna CMHO [Chief Medical & Health Officer] Dr. LK Tiwari said 2 deaths due to scrub typhus have been reported in Jabalpur Medical College.

While coronavirus is causing infections and deaths all across the state [Madhya Pradesh], bacteria called scrub typhus [the rickettsia-like bacterium called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ causes the disease called scrub typhus] infected people in 11 districts and claimed 2 lives. People of 11 districts around Panna and Jabalpur districts have been found infected with the bacteria.

Four persons of Panna district showing symptoms of scrub typhus were brought to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Medical College, Jabalpur. Two of the patients died on Thursday [12 Nov 2020], confirmed Panna CMHO. Four patients who were sent to Jabalpur Medical College hail from Pawai, Amanganj, Ajaygarh of Panna districts.

Additional director health Dr. Vina Sinha said, however, said there is nothing to be worried about, as it is nothing like coronavirus. "Scrub typhus spread every year normally. We have sent the team to look into the cases in Panna and other districts," he added.

Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus, is a disease caused by bacteria called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. Scrub typhus is spread to people through bites of infected chiggers (larval mites). The most common symptoms of scrub typhus include fever, headache, body aches, and sometimes rash.

[Madhya Pradesh is a state in central India and is made up of 10 divisions and 52 districts (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_of_Madhya_Pradesh). Jabalpur is the third-largest city in Madhya Pradesh, with a population of over 1.2 million residents, and is the administrative headquarters of Jabalpur district. Panna is one of 6 districts of the Sagar Division in Madhya Pradesh, and Ajaigarh, Amanganj, Pawai and Panna are subdivisions within Panna district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panna_district). A map showing the location of districts and divisions in Madhya Pradesh can be found at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Distrikte_von_Madhya_Pradesh_2015.svg.

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792), and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions. The laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated.

ProMED has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED post Scrub typhus - India (05): background 20111208.3546. - Mod.ML
