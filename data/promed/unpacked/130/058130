[From an interview by a correspondent from IA "24.kg" with Jalalidin
Gaibulin, Director of the Centre of Quarantine and Dangerous
Infections, Ministry of Health, Kyrgyz Republic]

In 2007, 23 human cases were recorded, but in 2008 the number of human
cases increased to 47.

Most cases (25 cases) were recorded in the Jalal-Abad region
[province] with Osh, Batken, and Chuy provinces next in the ratings.
This bad situation is connected with the high number of ground foci of
anthrax. Altogether in the republic, 1234 [sic: total of numbers below
= 1244. - CopyEd. MJ] such places have been registered, with 485 foci
in Chuy province; 354 foci in Jalal-Abad province; 247 foci in Osh
province; 124 foci in Issyk-Kul [Ysyk-Kol] province; 23 foci in Talas
province; 5 foci each in Naryn and Batken provinces; and 1 focus in
the city of Bishkek.

The main reason for this ongoing situation is incomplete vaccination
coverage of livestock. The inhabitants also facilitate the situation.
They slaughter animals without veterinary inspection and sell the meat
of sick animals at markets. So, not only the people who slaughtered
the animals and contracted the disease, but also sellers and
customers, are at risk. The effective measure is compensation for
slaughtered animals. But the question now is not resolved.

[There are a number of productive systems in place around the world to
encourage reporting possible anthrax deaths. The best is probably the
Canadian system of paying the owner CAD 500 (USD approx. 405) when a
case is diagnosed to defray the costs of properly disposing of the
carcass. This has worked well for some 50 years but latterly it was
noted that ranchers put off vaccinating and then used the CAD 500
after the event to vaccinate their herd, which is patently the wrong
way round for preventing outbreaks. So the view now is to only pay
the CAD 500 if the herd had been vaccinated previously, that is, in
the spring, working when the herd gets its usual vaccine shots.
Obviously CAD 500/carcass is way beyond the capacity of the Kyrgyz
government ... and it would foster an epidemic of outbreaks! But
compensation based on the local market value of the dead animal might
work.

Another advantage of encouraging unexpected livestock-death reporting
is that it would reveal the numbers of animals dying of anthrax that
did not result in human cases, which is all that the present system
does. It significantly ignores the larger livestock problem by
concentrating just on the human cases. That number could be up to x10
larger than the animal cases presently reported, and by seeing "the
larger picture" vaccination programs could better target the real
risks and would be certainly more cost effective. Also it would
provide the data for better livestock extension projects to educate
owners on the better prophylactic care of their animals. Though I
research anthrax I am fully aware that clostridial diseases kill tens
more livestock than anthrax does and their vaccines are very effective.

This needs to be seen in the broader context of the Kyrgyz veterinary
service, and its problems: maintaining standards, weak funding, proper
academic training of veterinarians, relative absence of rural
veterinarians, transport and vehicular costs, all of which are common
to many countries these days. - Mod.MHJ
