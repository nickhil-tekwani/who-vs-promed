Headlines
- The 19th report of the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) has been published. The IMB notes the strong resumption of polio campaigns following the temporary pause due to COVID-19 and commends the programme for supporting COVID-19 response efforts. The IMB points to several pivotal challenges which the programme must tackle with urgency to achieve success and offers a set of 17 key recommendations to capitalize on the momentum of resumed immunizations.

- The GPEI has published a global cVDPV resource document aimed at providing a high-level overview of cVDPVs [circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses], their importance to the programme, and strategy for responding to them, including novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2). Available here in various languages, this resource can be used at global, regional, and country levels, for high-level advocacy with government counterparts, internal staff, donors or other partners, as appropriate.

[The cases continue to arise. In the week since the prior global update 30 cases were reported -- 1 attributable to infection with the wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and 29 attributable to infection with a circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2). These occurred in 4 countries -- Pakistan (1 WPV1 case and 11 cVDPV2 cases), Burkina Faso (6 cVDPV2 cases), Chad (2 CVDPV2 cases), and South Sudan (10 cVDPV2 cases). In addition positive environmental samples were found in 3 countries -- Afghanistan (2 WPV1 and 23 cVDPV2), Benin (1cVDPV2), and South Sudan (1 cVDPV2). The significance of the positive environmental samples is that the virus identified is circulating in the population near where the environmental samples were taken.

In the past week we posted a report on cases in Afghanistan -- 5 in Khost and 1 in Paktika province (Poliomyelitis update (23): Afghanistan (KT, PK), RFI 20201222.8039231). These cases are not reflected in the global report above. Perhaps the next global report will validate the media report we had.

It continues to be a bad year for polio, with 139 cases attributable to WPV1 and 873 cases due to infection with a cVDPV, with 24 countries having reported cases during the year.
