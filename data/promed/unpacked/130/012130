Tasmania confirms second outbreak blueberry rust
------------------------------------------------
Two years ago [2014] the deadly plant mould blueberry rust was detected in Tasmania for the 1st time [ProMED-mail post 20150105.3072963]. The disease has now struck again in north-west Tasmania, this time at Sulphur Creek.

The new outbreak comes less than a month after the authorities declared the region disease-free. Rae Burrows, [Biosecurity Tasmania], said it was a devastating blow. "Industry, government, even the community were involved in getting this area back."

The cause of the latest outbreak is not yet known. It is also unclear whether it has spread beyond the affected property. Ms Burrows said an "infection point" was still being established.

Biosecurity Tasmania is surveying other farms within a 20-kilometre [12.4 mi] radius. It has also notified other plant health authorities and is calling on growers to be vigilant in reporting any signs of the disease.

[Blueberry (leaf) rust can be caused by the fungus _Thekopsora minima_, as is the case in Australia, and also another rust species (_Naohidemyces vaccinii_) elsewhere. The rust affects a range of plants in the Ericaceae family, including blueberry, bilberry, cranberry (_Vaccinium_ spp) and ornamentals such as rhododendrons and heathers. Symptoms may include yellow leaf spots on the upper surfaces of young leaves, followed by orange pustules developing on leaf undersides which release the spores. In severe cases or on highly susceptible cultivars, leaves turn brown and drop prematurely resulting in serious defoliation and potentially death of the plant.

Rust spores are spread by wind over long distances and by splashing rain and mechanical means locally. Infected plant material, including fruit and budwood, poses a high risk of spreading the disease. The rusts can overwinter on evergreen blueberry leaves or alternative hosts in milder climates. Southern highbush varieties are most susceptible. Disease management for rusts is extremely difficult and relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, phytosanitation, and control of pathogen reservoirs. Crop monitoring for early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum.

In Australia, _T. minima_ has previously been present in New South Wales and Queensland. Its spread to Victoria and soon after to Tasmania was reported in September 2014 (see ProMED-mail post 20150105.3072963 and links below). The source or route of spread have not yet been identified.
