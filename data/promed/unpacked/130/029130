Subject: Raptor Droppings
-------------------------
Regarding Promed Digest V2010 #137, "Avian influenza, poultry vs
migratory birds - Bulgaria:" The Moderator states that "Buzzards ...
can play their potential epidemiological role by dropping their
(infected) droppings while flying above (susceptible) poultry
premises. And they can repeat this stunt above additional premises
along their route."

Bird species vary in their defecation habits. Since raptors tend to
defecate predominately while roosting (including during or after
eating), there is little likelihood that even one domestic flock might
become infected from raptor droppings released in-flight. (Ducks and
geese tend to defecate where they walk or swim; this may be one reason
why they are such effective vectors for avian influenza. Seed-eating
songbirds defecate in flight, making them excellent vectors for seed
distribution.)

Re: Poultry versus Migratory Birds, Ref 20100331.1022
-----------------------------------------------------
There should no longer be a need to reopen the debate on the role of
poultry versus wild birds. It was largely settled in 2005 when the 1st
wild bird cases occurred in Mongolia in places largely devoid of
poultry.

Both trade in poultry and wild birds play a role in transmission of
highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype, with
wild birds almost certainly playing a much greater role in long
distance transcontinental / transoceanic) spread than poultry trade
over the past 5 years. The available genetic and epidemiological
evidence points strongly to wild bird introductions of Clade 2.2
viruses to Europe and Africa in 2005-06, to Japan and the Republic of
Korea in 2006-07. Clade 2.3.2 viruses were introduced to the Republic
of Korea and far Eastern Russia in 2008, and Mongolia and Russia in
2009, with the 2009 cases following a similar pattern of spread to
Clade 2.2 viruses in 2005. Unfortunately genetic data on wild bird
cases in Qinghai, China from 2009 that preceded the Russian and
Mongolian cases are not yet available in the public arena.

What is more interesting is the apparent absence of new Clade 2.2
cases over the past 12 months in wild birds or in places currently
free from infection visited by migratory birds. This finding suggests
that an independent cycle of transmission in wild birds with Clade 2.2
viruses has not been sustained in northern Asia and Europe. The only
wild bird isolates in public databases from north of China in the past
12 months are Clade 2.3.2 viruses.

[Les Sims, a veterinary consultant, co-authored with Clare Narrod, an
economist, FAO's comprehensive document "Understanding avian
influenza" -- a "review of the emergence, spread, control, prevention
and effects of Asian-lineage H5N1 highly pathogenic viruses." Its 1st
installment includes Chapter 1, "Introduction" (4 pp); Chapter 2,
"Current state of knowledge on HPAI" (15pp); Chapter 3, "H5N1 HPAI in
different species" (15 pp); and bibliography (16 pp).

The preface says: "Understanding avian influenza explores the various
mechanisms of persistence and spread of H5N1 HPAI viruses -- both
confirmed and possible -- in order to understand better the sources of
virus and the modes of transmission. It does this in an effort to
separate science from perception, and to highlight areas where
uncertainty remains."

Key areas discussed include the role played by domestic ducks in the
development of the current epizootic, issues related to whether the
disease emerged from intensively-reared poultry, and the relative role
of wild birds and trade in poultry in disease spread.

Subscribers are encouraged to visit this well-documented review at
<http://www.fao.org/avianflu/documents/key_ai/key_book_preface.htm>.

[Members are strongly recommended to read this document. But there is
an interesting paragraph in the 2.6 Conclusions in Chapter 2:

"Asian-lineage H5N1 HPAI viruses have now spread across 3 continents.
The mode of spread of these viruses is still not entirely clear. Trade
in poultry and poultry products and movement of wild birds have played
a role, although the relative contributions of these in the initial
introduction into countries previously free from infection has not
always been determined. Much of the evidence supporting these various
modes of introduction is circumstantial and complicated in many cases
by failure to detect the initial incursion of virus. Molecular
epidemiology has assisted greatly in assessing links between various
isolates."

And they should look out for the 'Conclusions and Recommendations' of
the Scientific Task Force on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds, Third
Technical Meeting on 15-16 Mar 2010. - Mod.MHJ]

Migration of Waterfowl in the East Asian Flyway and Spatial
Relationship to HPAI H5N1 Outbreaks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary. Poyang Lake is situated within the East Asian Flyway, a
migratory corridor for waterfowl that also encompasses Guangdong
Province, China, the epicenter of highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) H5N1. The lake is the largest freshwater body in China and a
significant congregation site for waterfowl; however, surrounding rice
fields and poultry grazing have created an overlap with wild
waterbirds, a situation conducive to avian influenza transmission.

Reports of HPAI H5N1 in healthy wild ducks at Poyang Lake have raised
concerns about the potential of resilient free-ranging birds to
disseminate the virus. Yet the role wild ducks play in connecting
regions of HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Asia is hindered by a lack of
information about their migratory ecology. During 200708 we marked
wild ducks at Poyang Lake with satellite transmitters to examine the
location and timing of spring migration and identify any
spatiotemporal relationship with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks. Species included
the Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), northern pintail (Anas acuta),
common teal (Anas crecca), falcated teal (Anas falcata), Baikal teal
(Anas formosa), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), garganey (Anas
querquedula), and Chinese spotbill (Anas poecilohyncha).

These wild ducks (excluding the resident mallard and Chinese spotbill
ducks) followed the East Asian Flyway along the coast to breeding
areas in northern China, eastern Mongolia, and eastern Russia. None
migrated west toward Qinghai Lake (site of the largest wild bird
epizootic), thus failing to demonstrate any migratory connection to
the Central Asian Flyway. A newly developed Brownian bridge spatial
analysis indicated that HPAI H5N1 outbreaks reported in the flyway
were related to latitude and poultry density but not to the core
migration corridor or to wetland habitats. Also, we found a temporal
mismatch between timing of outbreaks and wild duck movements.

These analyses depend on complete or representative reporting of
outbreaks, but by documenting movements of wild waterfowl, we present
ecological knowledge that better informs epidemiological
investigations seeking to explain and predict the spread of avian
influenza viruses.
