China's Ministry of Agriculture on Tuesday [5 Jun 2007] warned the
country's pig breeders that they are entering the peak season for the
highly pathogenic blue ear disease, also known as porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which has already killed 18 000 pigs this year
[2007].
Between January and May 2007, 45 000 pigs contracted the disease, but a
ministry source failed to specify what provinces and regions had reported
outbreaks. Earlier reports said south China's Guangdong Province and
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had reported outbreaks.
The source said 12 factories are producing new-type vaccines for the
disease, under the supervision of China's Veterinary Medicine Supervisory
Institution.
The ministry has instructed PRRS-affected regions to implement all disease
control measures and prevent the infection from spreading, and it has
dispatched inspection teams to supervise this work. Pig breeders have been
ordered to establish a nationwide immunization system, which covers
disinfection and proper treatment of dead animals and of their excrement.
The ministry has also implemented a complete ban on the sale, transport,
and processing of pigs that have died from the disease. It is also
establishing a central monitoring system for signs of PRRS virus mutations,
which should be completed by the end of June [2007].
The outbreaks have contributed to rising pork prices in some areas. It is
believed the price hikes will help raise the country's consumer price index
(CPI) to a new high for May [2007].

[The publication above provides some new information, especially regarding
the scope of the efforts required for the containment of the emerging
disease in swine, which was initially (2006) denominated by the Chinese as
"swine high fever disease" (SHFD; a multifactorial syndrome), and recently
as PRRS. The PRRS virus was among the disease agents reportedly involved in
SHFD. Regardless of the nomenclature -- SHFD or PRRS -- the very severe
losses are beyond doubt, and accurate epidemiological information is deficient.
During the recent months, contradictory information on the incidence and
distribution of the disease in China and on its etiology, has been
published by official and unofficial sources. According to one of them,
(Guangxi News -- Modern Life Daily, 12 May 2007, translated from Chinese,
and posted in ProMED-mail 20070514.1533), SHFD had already been discovered
in vast areas of the Guangxi Autonomous Region, while during the previous
months, it had been reported "in Anhui, Hunan, Guangdong, Shandong,
Liaoning, Jilin, and other provinces", causing the deaths of "more than 20
million pigs, with extremely heavy economic losses". A look at a map of
China <http://www.fas.usda.gov/pecad/remote/china/chinamap.gif> will show
that, if the above information is accurate, the disease has spread across
eastern China, from Jilin in the north east, to Guangdong and Guangxi in
the south east and south, a distance exceeding 3000 km (1864 mi) within the
pig-breeding provinces of China.
The blurred picture has already bred suspicions on the possible involvement
of various disease agents, in addition to PRRSV, including FMD, avian
influenza, classical swine fever, and even African swine fever; to
(hopefully) exclude them and to enable a realistic assessment of the
situation, an official OIE (Office International des Epizooties; World
Organization for Animal Health) update is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
