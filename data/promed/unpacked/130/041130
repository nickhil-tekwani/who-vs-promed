Composition of the 2011-12 Influenza Vaccine
--------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological
Products Advisory Committee recommended that the 2011-12 trivalent
influenza vaccine for the United States contain
A/California/7/2009-like (H1N1), A/Perth/16/2009-like (H3N2), and
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like viruses. This represents no change to any of
the 3 components from the 2010-11 influenza vaccine formulation used
in the United States or from the current formulation of the 2011
Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.

These recommendations were based on antigenic analyses of influenza
viruses that circulated in the United States and worldwide during
2010-11, epidemiologic data, postvaccination serologic studies in
humans, and the availability of candidate vaccine strains and
reagents.

[[Although the formulations of the flu vaccines are coincidentally
the same for both the North & South Hemispheres this year, people who
spend part of each year in each of them during the flu seasons still
need to be vaccinated twice, 6 months apart, to maintain protection. -
