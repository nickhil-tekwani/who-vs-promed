More than 1.5 million children around the world have lost a parent, grandparent, or other caregiver to COVID-19, according to the first global study of its kind.

In the study, published yesterday in The Lancet, a team led by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) scientists used death and fertility data to model minimum estimated COVID-19-related deaths of primary or secondary caregivers of children 18 years and younger in 21 countries. Indirect coronavirus deaths, such as those related to lockdowns or decreased access to medical care, were also included. [Hillis SD, Unwin HJT, Chen Y et al. Global minimum estimates of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and deaths of caregivers: a modelling study. The Lancet. 20 July 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01253-8]

The countries, which represent 77% of global COVID-19 deaths in 2020 and early 2021, were Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, England and Wales, France, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, the United States, and Zimbabwe.

Parents and custodial grandparents were considered primary caregivers, and grandparents or other relatives 60-84 years old living with a child were classified as secondary caregivers.

From 1 Mar 2020-30 Apr 2021, an estimated 1 042 000 children were orphaned; 1 134 000 lost a primary caregiver, including at least one parent or custodial grandparent; and 1 562 000 lost at least one primary or secondary caregiver.

Countries with primary caregiver death rates of 1 or more per 1000 children were Peru (10.2 per 1000 children), South Africa (5.1), Mexico (3.5), Brazil (2.4), Colombia (2.3), Iran (1.7), the United States (1.5), Argentina (1.1), and Russia (1.0). Amid a COVID-19 surge in India, researchers identified an 8.5-fold rise in newly orphaned children in April over March [2021] (43 139 vs 5091, respectively).

Because men--particularly those who were middle-aged or older--died of COVID-19 at higher rates than women in every country except South Africa, 2-5 times more children lost fathers than mothers.

In a Lancet news release, lead study author Susan Hillis, PhD, a member of the CDC COVID-19 Response Team, said, "For every 2 COVID-19 deaths worldwide, one child is left behind to face the death of a parent or caregiver. By 30 Apr 2021, these 1.5 million children had become the tragic overlooked consequence of the 3 million COVID-19 deaths worldwide, and this number will only increase as the pandemic progresses."

Grandparents, who are especially susceptible to COVID-19, often support their grandchildren's psychosocial, practical, or financial needs--particularly when they live in increasingly common multigenerational households, the authors wrote.

For example, in the United States, 40% of grandparents who share a household with their grandchildren are their primary caregivers, and 70% of children in Brazil receive financial support from their grandparents. Their loss is tied to the need for parents to work, poor school attendance, lower educational attainment, and poor communication skills, the researchers said. Further, "up to 23% of children in countries considered in this analysis are raised by single parents, whose death can have extreme consequences for children," they wrote. "Increases in orphanhood that are associated with COVID-19 occur against a backdrop of more than 140 million existing orphans in need of global health and social care prioritisation."

The authors also noted that children who are orphaned or are grieving their caregivers often are also subject to poverty, abuse, mental illness, institutionalization, and physical, emotional, and sexual violence. These experiences can in turn lead to teen pregnancy, infections (e.g., HIV/AIDS), and chronic diseases, and institutionalization or foster care placement can result in developmental delays and more abuse.

In a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) news release, co-senior author Charles Nelson III, PhD, of Boston Children's Hospital, said that caregiver loss can upend children's lives and affect their development. "If we take into consideration variants of concern or possible severity of illness among youth, we must not forget that the pandemic continues to pose a threat to parents and caregivers--and their children," he said. [https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-07/tl-tl1071921.php].

The authors called for support for extended or foster families of orphaned children, including economic support, parenting programs, school access, and vaccination of caregivers of children. "Our findings highlight the urgent need to prioritize these children and invest in evidence-based programs and services to protect and support them right now and to continue to support them for many years into the future--because orphanhood does not go away," Hillis said in the Lancet release.

In a commentary in the same journal, Rachel Kentor, PhD, of Baylor College of Medicine, and Amanda Thompson, PhD, of Inova Schar Cancer Institute, said that while the number of children who lost caregivers amid the pandemic may seem small compared with the 140 000 million total orphans worldwide , they constitute a large group of children in need of support. [Kentor RA and Thompson AL. Answering the call to support youth orphaned by COVID-19. The Lancet. 20 July 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01446-X]

"By answering the authors' call to expand our worldwide pandemic response to include caring for children, the global community can capitalise on this momentum," they wrote. "We can harness the current global attention on children bereaved by the pandemic to mobilise resources and implement systemic, sustainable supports for bereaved youth around the world."

[Study author Professor Lucie Cluver, Oxford University, UK, and the University of Cape Town, South Africa, says: "We have strong evidence from HIV and Ebola to guide solutions. We need to support extended families or foster families to care for children, with cost-effective economic strengthening, parenting programs, and school access. We need to vaccinate caregivers of children -- especially grandparent caregivers. And we need to respond fast because every 12 seconds a child loses their caregiver to COVID-19."

Before this report, there were no global figures to quantify how many children have been affected by the loss of a caregiver during the COVID-19 pandemic, either directly (due to the virus) or indirectly (due to another condition that was exacerbated due to the pandemic). ...

As part of this work, the authors developed a real-time COVID-19 calculator [7], providing ongoing updated estimates of COVID-19-associated orphanhood and death of caregivers for every country in the world. These estimates as of the end of April 2021, along with an evidence-based strategy for action as described in the paper, can also be found in a policy report authored by the Global Reference Group for Children Affected by COVID: "Children: The Hidden Pandemic 2021 - A joint report of COVID-19-associated mortality and a strategy for action."

[2] USA (Virginia): school bus riders

A study yesterday in the Journal of School Health finds that while 39 elementary and high school students in a Virginia public school district rode school buses while infected with SARS-CoV-2, investigators found no evidence of viral transmission to other students or adults.

A team led by Eastern Virginia Medical School researchers tested all 1154 in-person students in grades 1-12 every 1 or 2 weeks in the first 7 months of the 2020-21 school year, during the period of highest community transmission.

15 school buses with 462 riders ran at near capacity, with 2 or 3 students in each seat and universal face coverings. Drivers were required to open the middle and last 2 bus windows 1 inch [2.5 cm]. There was no barrier between the driver and the 1st row of students. Each one-way ride ranged from 36-74 minutes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends physical distancing of at least 6 feet [1.8 m] on public transportation but doesn't distinguish between public and school buses.

37 students, one driver, and one aide rode the buses while infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, resulting in the quarantine of 52 students, none of whom tested positive 7-10 days later. Universal testing and contact tracing found no evidence of viral transmissions among students or adults from the bus.

"This study demonstrates a model for the safe operation of school buses while near capacity," the study authors wrote. "COVID-19 transmission can be low during student transport when employing mitigation including simple ventilation, and universal masking, at minimal physical distances and during the highest community transmission."

In a news release from Wiley, which published the journal, lead author Dana Ramirez, MD, noted that many public schools don't have enough buses and drivers to keep riders 6 feet [1.8 m] apart or block off rows of seats. At the same time, as more students returned to in-person instruction, safe transportation became an equity issue, because many parents can't drive their children to school each day.

"We recognize that schools are under pressure to make data-driven operational decisions," Ramirez said. "We hope the model we describe and our data can be of assistance in demonstrating that school buses can safely operate at normal capacity even at high community COVID-19 case loads."

An independent school in Virginia monitored 1154 students in grades 1 to 12 with asymptomatic PCR testing every 2 weeks from August 24, 2020-March 19, 2021, during the highest community transmission. 15 buses served 462 students while operating at near capacity of 2 students in every seat, using a physical distancing minimum of 2.5 ft (0.8 m), universal masking, and simple ventilation techniques.

2 case-control studies yesterday found high vaccine effectiveness (VE) after complete vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID vaccine, both of which are based on mRNA technology.

The 1st study matched 54 360 veterans with COVID-19 in the Veterans Affairs COVID-19 Shared Data Resource database with non-COVID veterans in the same system from 15 Dec 2020-4 Mar 2021. Less than 1 in 5 (18%) of those who were vaccinated tested positive for COVID-19; whereas, 32.8% who did not have COVID-19 were vaccinated. The researchers calculated that 7 days after the 2nd dose, VE was 97.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.6% to 97.5%), with Pfizer at 96.2% and Moderna at 98.2%.

VE remained above 95% regardless of sex, age-group, race, or comorbidity presence, the researchers write, noting that the cohort's median age was 61, 83.6% were male, and 62% were White.

The 2nd study looked at COVID-19 cases in California from 24 Feb-29 Apr [2021]. The researchers matched people by age, sex, and geographic region from a pool of 525 adults infected with COVID-19 and 498 who were not (with at least 90% of each subgroup included in VE estimation). During the course of the study, the predominant COVID-19 strains went from B.1.427/429 (50%-60%) to alpha (B117, 49%).

2 weeks after receiving the 2nd dose of COVID vaccine, VE was 87.0% for Pfizer and 86.2% for Moderna (95% CIs, 68.6%-94.6% and 68.4%-93.9%, respectively). Fully vaccinated participants receiving either showed 91.3% VE against symptomatic cases and 68.3% for asymptomatic cases (95% CIs, 79.3%-96.3% and 27.9%-85.7%, respectively).

All 18 people who were hospitalized for COVID-19 by the time of the researchers' telephone interview were either unvaccinated (15) or only partially vaccinated (3).

"Vaccine hesitancy among historically marginalized and rural populations, which account for a substantial proportion of all COVID-19 cases in California to date, presents a barrier to reaching coverage levels needed for herd immunity," the researchers add.

[3B] Israel: Pfizer vaccine efficacy decline
Date: Tue 20 Jul 2021
Source: YNET News [edited]
https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bytq34n0u


Israel on Tue [20 Jul 2021] reported a sharp decline in the efficacy of Pfizer/BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine after receiving data from a recent analysis.

Data from the analysis conducted by the Health Ministry suggest the efficacy of the vaccine declines over time in preventing infection and severe illness.

Health officials presented their findings during a meeting of the ministry's Epidemic Management Team on Mon night [19 Jul 2021], which showed that protection from coronavirus infections among vaccinated people decreased by 42% since the start of the inoculation drive in Israel.

In addition, protection from severe illness has also recorded a sharp drop of up to 60% among those who were inoculated in the early stages of the vaccine rollout.

However, most people who had been vaccinated at the early stage of the vaccine drive appear to be over the age of 65 and findings may not reflect the vaccine's efficacy among those in other age groups.

Ministry officials deemed the findings disturbing but claimed those were only preliminary analyses of very raw data. It was not yet clear whether the results were linked to an apparent erosion of the vaccine's protection against the virus or greater resistance of the delta variant to the inoculation.

Health Ministry Director General Prof. Nachman Ash is expected to convene further rounds of consultations on the data with health experts. He is also scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Tue afternoon [21 Jul 2021].

The premier and health officials will discuss various solutions to the surging morbidity and may entertain the possibility of administering a 3rd booster shot to the country's elderly population.

Last week, Israel began administering a 3rd shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech inoculation to patients with compromised immune systems, including people who have had heart, lung and kidney transplants.

[It would be helpful to have some exact dates in this report rather than generalizations such as "decline over time", what length of time?, and "decreased by 42% since the start of the inoculation drive in Israel', which is when? Nonetheless, it is concerning. - Mod.LK]

[With regard to potential contributors to the apparent decline in vaccine over time, the comment by Dr. Steve Berger in ProMED COVID-19 Update (245), section 2[C] regarding the Israel Pfizer vaccine experience is highly relevant: "Early serological testing of all new COVID-19 cases -- particularly those who were previously "immunized" -- will be useful to more accurately assess the effectiveness of vaccines."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
BACKGROUND
The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has contributed to a surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the United Kingdom. The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear.
METHODS
We used a test-negative case-control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients' vaccination status.
RESULTS
Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of 2 doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons
with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant. With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of 2 doses was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant.
CONCLUSIONS
Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the 1st dose. This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with 2 doses among vulnerable populations. (Funded by Public Health England)
