[Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a disease of cattle and water buffalo caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _Mycoides_ (_M. mycoides_). As the name suggests, it attacks the lungs and the membranes that line the thoracic cavity (the pleura) causing fever and respiratory signs such as laboured or rapid respiration, cough and nasal discharges.

Because it is highly contagious with a mortality rate of up to 50 percent, it causes significant economic losses. CBPP is a prominent cattle disease in Africa.

Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is one of the diseases for which the OIE has official recognition status.

Humans are not known to be susceptible to contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, so there is no public health risk http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/CBPP-EN.pdf.
