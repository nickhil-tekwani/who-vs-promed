A Comment on the Vaccine Trial
------------------------------
An interesting vaccine trial that raises a couple of questions:
(1) If my memory is correct, both ProMED-mail and the journal "Science" had
data/information indicating that prior vaccination gave protection
regardless of the time interval between vaccination and exposure [see above
references for the ProMED-mail data; (2) while blistering/scab formation
correlate with protection, what are the data indicating that antibody
formation or cytotoxic T-cell assays also correlate with protection?
I'm constantly intrigued by the "belief" that in vitro assays or antibody
synthesis per se always indicate immunity to infectious diseases. There is
much published data indicating the contrary.

Another Comment
---------------
Perhaps it would make sense to conduct a trial with people who *were*
vaccinated before 1972? A diluted vaccine might have more of a chance of
raising their immunity to a desired level?

[Anyone care to respond to these different comments? The apparent
reluctance of people to participate in this diluted vaccine trial may be a
limiting factor for further studies in this area. - Mod.CP
