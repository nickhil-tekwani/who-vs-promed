Three persons associated with teams competing in the Commonwealth Games at
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia have been [diagnosed as having dengue fever. The
persons are the New Zealand physician, an Australian official; and the wife
of an Australian competitor.
The team physician and [a second person have been hospitalized; the third
person is said to be under treatment at the Games village.
Australian doctor Brian Sando said there were serious concerns for the
[second person, who was taken to hospital three days ago with severe
muscle aches, headaches, joint pains, a fever and nose bleeds. She had all
the symptoms but the virus had not shown up in blood tests yet, Sando said.
The team physician is expected to be released from the hospital in a few
days.
Commonwealth Games medical committee chairman Abu Bakar Suleiman denied
there was an outbreak but also urged athletes to take extra care against
mosquito bites. "It is an individual case and we are taking all possible
measures at the Games village to prevent any further incidents of dengue
fever," he said.
New Zealand chef de mission Les Mills said every precaution was being taken
and the team had asked for a thorough check of the team quarters for
potential mosquito breeding sites.
There were about 20,000 cases of dengue in Malaysia last year with 52
reported deaths.

[If any of these cases have been diagnosed by laboratory methods, rather
than solely on clinical grounds, then the Commonwealth Games medical
committee chairman is either uninformed or not releasing the information.
It certainly is strange that the Malaysian Government seems to be building
a record of confusion with regard to diseases in that country. What
possible medical good could come of denying the obvious? John Snow ("On
the Mode of Communication of Cholera - 1854) said: "The communicability of
cholera ought not to be disguised from the people, under the idea that the
knowledge of it would cause panic, or occasion the sick to be deserted." -
