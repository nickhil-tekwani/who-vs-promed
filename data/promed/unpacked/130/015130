China's recent SARS outbreak: important lessons for global public health -
2 Jul 2004
-----------------------------
It has been more than 2 months since the Ministry of Health of China
notified WHO and the world about an outbreak of SARS in Beijing and Anhui
Province. Since then, WHO experts have been supporting the Chinese
authorities in their investigation into the cause of the
laboratory-acquired cases, and in assessing the effectiveness of measures
taken to control the outbreak.
On 1 Jul 2004, the Ministry of Health of China released its status report
on the investigation. The outbreak has now been successfully contained, but
initial findings from the investigation and the assessment of control
measures have raised several important lessons for global public health.
Investigation into the source of the outbreak
---------------------------------------------
During the investigation, a substantial amount of information was gathered,
although all the practices within the National Institute of Virology in
Beijing have yet to be thoroughly assessed. Although not all detailed
information has been made available to WHO, the following conclusions have
been made about the source of the outbreak:
- the National Institute of Virology in Beijing was the most likely source
of the outbreak.
- at least 4 individuals may have been infected with SARS at the Institute.
These include the 2 laboratory workers reported in April, and 2 additional
laboratory workers. These 2 additional laboratory workers appear to have
suffered from SARS-like illnesses in early February 2004. Recent laboratory
tests performed at a national reference laboratory were positive for SARS
antibodies.
- the use of inactivated SARS coronavirus, which was not tested to
determine the effectiveness of the inactivation, in a general laboratory at
the Institute appears the most likely cause of the outbreak.
During the investigation, it became apparent that all the positive
laboratory workers worked in the same general laboratory at the Institute.
Although no research involving live SARS viruses was known to have taken
place in this laboratory, SARS coronavirus that had been inactivated in a
Biosafety Level 3 laboratory in the Institute was used on several occasions
during the early months of 2004 in experiments carried out in this area.
The timing of the use of inactivated SARS coronavirus in the general
laboratory coincides with the presence there of all the positive workers
and with their likely incubation periods.
WHO recommends that further work is needed to verify the effectiveness of
the method used to inactivate the live SARS virus. At the same time, other
possible explanations of the cause of the outbreak cannot be fully excluded.
Biosafety concerns raised by the outbreak
-----------------------------------------
The incident at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing has raised
concerns about biosafety in general, and the way in which inactivated viral
material is handled in particular. "In light of the investigation, WHO
believes that Member States should carefully review biosafety standards and
strengthen them to avoid further incidents," said Dr Shigeru Omi, regional
director of WHO's Western Pacific Region.
WHO will be working with Member States and expert groups to develop country
and regional strategies to strengthen biosafety. Core components of such
biosafety programmes at country level are likely to include:
- a containment policy to reduce the number of laboratories storing and
working on SARS coronavirus.
- a legislative framework and independent advisory body to assist in the
development, implementation and evaluation of a national biosafety
programme and in the investigation of biohazard incidents and the
dissemination of lessons learned to the global scientific community.
- a laboratory accreditation system based on standardized biosafety criteria.
- an occupational health service to monitor the well being of laboratory
workers.
- comprehensive biosafety and training programmes in all diagnostic and
research institutes supported by a management framework that facilitates
compliance with evidence-based guidelines and the adoption of a positive
biosafety culture.
WHO also emphasizes that scientists working with highly pathogenic viruses
such as SARS need to handle inactivated material with the utmost caution.
In particular, WHO recommends that:
- researchers use appropriate and internationally accepted methods for
validating the inactivation of live viruses.
- inactivated material should be handled only in laboratories at biosafety
level (BSL) 2 or above.
- researchers handling inactivated material should wear appropriate
personal protective equipment.
- new methods for inactivation should be adopted only after rigorous testing.
- clear and comprehensive protocols should be available for all
inactivation techniques.
Assessment of effectiveness of outbreak control measures
--------------------------------------------------------
In addition to supporting the investigation into the possible source of the
outbreak, WHO has worked with Chinese authorities to evaluate the
effectiveness of the outbreak control measures. Joint WHO-Ministry of
Health teams have visited all the hospitals where the recent cases were
treated before they were admitted to designated SARS facilities. In
addition, WHO experts have reviewed data on contact tracing and other
control measures.
"Overall," said Dr Omi, "WHO believes that the Chinese authorities acted
swiftly and effectively to control the outbreak once the alarm had been
raised. Extensive contact tracing was undertaken in a matter of hours, and
the effective isolation of cases and identification of contacts appears to
have ensured that the outbreak was contained with remarkable speed."
But there was a delay in detecting the initial cases. As a consequence, 2
generations of transmission occurred and the application of effective
hospital and community control measures took place late in the outbreak.
The Ministry of Health of China has acknowledged this and is looking to
strengthen further the current detection and response system.
There are a number of lessons from this outbreak that are important
globally, for member states and for WHO itself:
- health care workers, laboratory workers and people in close contact with
certain animals are at risk of contracting a range of infectious diseases
with outbreak potential. Disease detection systems need to be designed to
take these risk factors, as well as clinical information, into account --
and to be robust enough to ensure that nobody slips through the net and
evades detection.
- health care workers need to be aware of the risks associated with certain
occupations (including their own) and to be able to take a detailed
occupational history from a patient.
- health care workers also need to be aware of the importance of asking
about the health of close contacts of anyone with a potentially contagious
respiratory illness. Quickly identifying possible clusters of respiratory
illness is important in the control of such diseases and the detection of
new or rare infectious diseases.
- all health care workers should be empowered to initiate effective
measures to protect themselves and others from potentially contagious
diseases, in a "safety first" approach. This means that health care workers
should be aware of potential clinical and epidemiological risk factors;
have ready access to the equipment and knowledge needed to protect
themselves and others; and be allowed to initiate the most appropriate
infection-control measures immediately -- with validation and approval from
senior members of staff later.
This recent outbreak has demonstrated once again that SARS is a containable
disease. WHO commends the Chinese authorities for taking swift action to
control the latest outbreak. WHO will be working closely with the Chinese
authorities to assist in the strengthening of biosafety, and to build a
long-term strategy for strengthening laboratory research and diagnosis in
China.
WHO looks forward to working with China in its efforts to tackle SARS and
other public health issues in the future. For more information, please

[This WHO/WPRO Press release is much clearer than that in the last
ProMED-mail posting of 2 Jul 2004, which relied upon newswires and machine
translations of the abstract available on the Chinese Ministry of Health
website. The breach in laboratory safety protocols (working with a
supposedly inactivated virus in an open laboratory without testing the
efficacy of the inactivation process) seems likely to have led to a
contamination of the environment with a live SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
It remains curious that the initial infections were in February and the 2nd
wave of infections occurred in late March and mid-April (see SARS -
worldwide (18): China, cases 20040423.1125). As correctly noted, in
addition to the breaches in laboratory protocols, of the 4 cases linked to
laboratory exposure, 2 went completely undetected until a serosurvey, and
both of the 2nd-round cases had significant delays in diagnosis, despite
working in a virology laboratory where the SARS-CoV had been handled and
having clinical illnesses compatible with SARS-CoV infection. Once
identification of SARS-CoV as the etiology of the illnesses in April 2004
was made, then appropriate and rapid case containment measures were
implemented and further transmission was interrupted.
This incident highlights the ever-present concerns about early detection of
emerging and reemerging infectious diseases with a key focal point for this
activity being the "point of service" when cases first come to the
attention of the health sector. Lessons learned in reviewing the
identification of newly emerging infectious diseases such as HIV-related
illness, nipah virus infection, and SARS-CoV infection include the
importance of the "astute" clinician to alert the public health sector that
"something different" was going on. A challenge to the public health arena
is how to shorten the time between the onset of illness, the identification
of the problem, and the implementation of investigation and control
measures. - Mod.MPP]
