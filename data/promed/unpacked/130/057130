2001/066 - New host plants of Potato T trichovirus [edited
-------------------------------------------------------------
_Ullucus tuberosus_ (ulluco), _Oxalis tuberosa_ (oca) and _Tropaeolum
tuberosum_ (mashua) are reported as new host plants of Potato T trichovirus
([PVT, EPPO A1 quarantine pest). These plants are Andean tuber crops which
are often grown in small plots in association with potatoes in the Peruvian
Highlands. The virus was isolated from leaves of naturally infected plants.
[No variability in PCR and restriction enzyme digests was observed when PVT
isolates from these new host plants and potato (_Solanum tuberosum_ subsp.
_tuberosum_ x _S. tuberosum_ subsp. _andigena_) were compared.

[Although ProMED-Plant does not monitor diseases on these 3 crops, this
report of new hosts for PVT is of sufficient interest to plant virologists
that it be published. PVT is transmitted by pollen to the seed (10-72% in
solanaceous hosts) by grafting, but not by contact between plants. In
potato, the disease is symptomless, but mild leaf mottling may occur
occasionally. PVT occurs in Peru and Bolivia. The symptomless nature of PVT
in potato means that ulluco, oca, and mashua plants intended for export for
germ plasm research or other purposes should be tested for the virus. -
