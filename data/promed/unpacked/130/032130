Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Akphivoath Village, Pal Hal, Tbaeng Mean Chey, Preah Vihear
Started: 27 May 2021
Epidemiological unit: village
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 365 / 81 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: LSD affected in cattle backyard farms in the village.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: cattle movement from affected neighboring country.

Epidemiological comments: on 30 May 2021, Provincial Office of Animal Health and Production (POAHP) of Preah Vihear notified about severe skin disease and abscesses in a backyard cattle farm in Phoum Akphivoad, Sangkat Palhal, krong Preah Vihear, to Preah Vihear province to National Animal Health and Production Research Institute (NAHPRI). The clinical appearance in some of the animals included several skin nodules, high fever, inappetence, and swollen lymph nodes. The initial diagnosis after the clinical examination was suspected with lumpy skin disease (LSD). Therefore, POAHP of Preah Vihear and NAHPRI officers further investigated the case and collected samples according to the LSD clinical surveillance guideline provided by NAHPRI earlier. The collected samples (whole blood in EDTA, scab and skin lesions) were submitted to the NAHPRI for laboratory analysis.

Control measures applied in domestic: zoning; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; quarantine; movement control inside the country; disinfection; control of vectors; screening; traceability
Control measures to be applied in domestic: official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products; vaccination in response to the outbreak (s); vector surveillance

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Animal Health and Production Research Institute (NAHPRI) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result

["LSD is currently endemic in most of Africa, parts of the Middle East, and Turkey. Since 2015, the disease has spread to most of the Balkan countries, the Caucasus, and the Russian Federation, where the disease continues to spread, making the risk of an imminent incursion into other unaffected countries very high. Since 2019, several outbreaks of LSD have been reported by Members in Asia (Bangladesh, India, China, Chinese Taipei, Viet Nam, Bhutan, Hong Kong (SAR-RPC), Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Thailand, as of [2 Jun 2021]."

Detailed information summarizing relevant information on the activities that the Asia and Pacific region have been working on, as well as OIE recommendations on LSD, is available at https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/projects/lumpy-skin-disease-lsd/.

"Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam have been assessed at high risk of LSD introduction with moderate uncertainty due to the presence of LSDV in South Asia and China, the high number of susceptible cattle and buffalo, significant informal trade in cattle and buffalo and their products between these countries and LSD-affected countries, poor biosecurity in cattle/buffalo pro duction systems and along the value chain, the moderate abundance of competent vectors during October-December, and the current absence of vaccination."
