10th TB positive Herd Found in Minnesota
----------------------------------------
The Minnesota Board of Animal Health today announced that cattle from
a Roseau cattle operation tested positive for bovine tuberculosis.

The newly detected beef herd was tested because of its proximity to
an operation that tested positive for bovine tuberculosis (TB) in
2005. The Roseau County herd tested negative in 2005 and 2006 but
during a 3rd round of testing earlier this month (February 2008), 2
animals tested suspect for bovine TB. Tissue samples were submitted
to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, where a
diagnosis of bovine TB was confirmed. Minnesota has now detected
bovine TB in 10 beef herds.

Minnesota Board of Animal Health Executive Director and State
Veterinarian Bill Hartmann said if another infected herd is found
Minnesota's TB status may be downgraded. "Conversations are ongoing
with the United States Department of Agriculture about Minnesota's
future TB status should we find one more herd," said Hartmann. "It's
important that we prepare for all possibilities and unfortunately,
one scenario would see the downgrading of our status from Modified
Accredited Advanced to Modified Accredited, the middle rung in an
international 5-tier ranking system for cattle TB eradication."

Federal interstate movement requirements would change with the
status. Other state's requirements could also change, so producers
should plan to contact the animal health agency in the state they are
shipping to for their import requirements. A list of these agencies
is available on the Board website. Visit <http://www.bah.state.mn.us>
and click on Export Regulations under the Quick Links drop down menu.

"All shipments of cattle moving across the border must meet both
federal and state import requirements," said Hartmann. "The state is
currently reviewing these regulations to determine what the
interstate movements would be if the status changes. We will be
contacting cattle producers to inform them of those requirements as
soon as we have more information."

The Board is currently planning meetings throughout the state to
present this information to cattle producers and allow producers to
give their input directly to the state agencies involved. Details
will be available soon.

Exposure to bovine tuberculosis through the milk or meat supply is
unlikely. Meat inspectors check all cattle entering the marketplace
for signs of the disease before and after slaughter. Any animals
showing signs are withheld from the food supply. In addition,
adequate cooking destroys the bacteria.

More information on bovine TB in Minnesota and the testing campaign
can be found on the Board's website by clicking Bovine Tuberculosis
under the Hot Topics menu or by calling the Minnesota TB Hotline at
1-877-MN TB FREE (668-2373).

[This herd in 3rd round of testing is likely to affect the state's
status. This is critical to cattle industry with regard to movement of
animals both into and out of the state. It will cost producers extra
to test their animals in both time and finances. We will stay tuned to
see if other herds test positive. - Mod.TG]
