Suspected acute haemorrhagic fever in the Republic of the Congo
---------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) has received preliminary reports of 5
suspected cases, including 3 deaths, with acute haemorrhagic fever from
Mokouangonda, an isolated forest village of about 100 inhabitants in Mokoke
district, Region of Sangha, in northern Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville).

The 3 deaths were among male forest hunters from Mokouangonda who presented
similar symptoms of epistaxis (nose bleeds), bloody diarrhoea, cough, and
fever prior to deaths after a 1-2 week long hunting expedition in the
Odzala National Park.

A joint Ministry of Health (MoH) and WHO team is currently in the field to
assess the situation and to collect clinical samples for diagnosis. These
will be tested by the Centre International de Recherches Medicales de
Franceville (CIRMF) Gabon, and Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale a
Kinshasa, DRC.

A Regional Coordination Committee to contain the outbreak has been
established in Ouesso, Sangha Region, under the Direction Generale de la
Sante, assisted by WHO and other international partners including the
Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Congo and the Museum National
d'Histoire Naturelle in France. Measures to respond to the disease outbreak
including epidemiological investigation, social mobilization, and infection
control are being implemented in the area.

[Further information is awaited. The suspicion must be that this may be an
outbreak of the Ebola hemorrhagic fever which has afflicted neighbouring
Democratic Republic of Congo in recent years, although the most recent
report there in 2009 was not confirmed (see references below).
