Three new positive cases of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, have been reported in the district since [1 Feb 2020].

On [1 Feb 2020], the blood samples of a 39 year old woman from Genasinakuni village in Sagar taluk [administrative subdivision] tested positive for KFD. She was suffering from fever and joint aches since [16 Jan 2020]. At present, she is being treated at Government Sub-divisional Hospital in Sagar town. The woman was administered 3 doses of vaccine against KFD, but she has tested positive.

In Tirthahalli taluk, blood samples from 2 people -- one from Sindhuwadi village and another from Kuduvalli village -- tested positive on [2 Feb 2020]. The patient from Kuduvalli had received the primary dose of vaccine against KFD, and the booster dose was scheduled for the 2nd week of February [2020].

Ashoka MV, Tirthahalli taluk health officer, told The Hindu that the 34 year old person from Sindhuwadi village who tested positive for KFD was a migrant agriculture labourer. Mr Ashoka said that, as the white blood cell and platelet count of the labourer was low, he has been admitted to a private hospital in Manipal for additional treatment. His health condition is being closely monitored.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_, characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The virus was first identified in 1957 after it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka State, India. The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html).

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. The recommended preventive measures include using tick repellents, walking along clear trails, avoiding contact with weeds, and wearing full-sleeved clothes and long pants to reduce exposed skin to decrease contact with ticks and subsequent tick bites.

Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality, as there is no specific treatment for KFD. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD (https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf). - Mod.UBA
