Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Turkey 24 Oct 2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On [17 Oct 2014], WHO EURO was notified by the National IHR Focal Point [IHR NFP] for Turkey of a laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). On [11 Oct 2014], the patient died. This is the 1st MERS-CoV case in Turkey.

Details of the case are as follows:
The case was a 42 year old male, Turkish citizen known to be working in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). On [25 Sep 2014], the patient developed symptoms in Jeddah. Initially, he sought medical care in KSA; however, on [6 Oct 2014], as symptoms worsened, he travelled with a direct flight from Jeddah to Hatay, Turkey. Upon his arrival, he was admitted to a local hospital. On [8 Oct 2014], he was transferred to the University Hospital in Hatay.

Public health response
----------------------
Additional information about the flight and any contacts that may be linked to the same flight are now being investigated; the health condition of the cabin crew is being monitored. Also, contacts of the case during his symptomatic phase ([25 Sep 2014 - 6 Oct 2014]) when he was still in Jeddah are being examined, including contacts in health care facilities in KSA. WHO EURO and EMRO IHR Contact Points are facilitating direct communications between the IHR NFP Turkey and KSA.

Globally, WHO has received notification of 883 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 319 related deaths.

[We'd like to commend the MOH of Saudi Arabia for the addition of information on other high risk exposures as part of the daily reports on newly laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Beginning yesterday (23 Oct 2014) there is now information on contact with known or suspected MERS-CoV infected individuals in the healthcare setting (hospital/clinic) and in the community. Given this new information, the patient that was reported yesterday had no known high risk exposures identified that would indicate where she may have been exposed to the MERS-CoV -- she had no history of contact with animals, no history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases in hospitals or clinics, nor did she have a history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases in the community -- hence, she remains an enigma. The possibility of exposure to someone with MERS-CoV in whom the infection was not suspected must be considered.

With the newly reported case in Saudi Arabia on 24 Oct 2014, the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2014 is now 774 including 329 deaths (case fatality rate 42.5 per cent). This 45 year old Saudi male with a history of co-morbidities, did give a positive history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases in the healthcare environment as the probable source of his infection with the MERS-CoV.

According to WHO's 24 Oct 2014 update, there have now been a total of 883 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 319 related deaths that have been reported and confirmed by WHO. With the report from Turkey, 23 countries have now reported cases of MERS-CoV, with all reported cases outside the Middle East having a direct connection to the Middle East or contact with someone recently returned from the Middle East with MERS-CoV infection. According to the latest ECDC epidemiologic update on MERS-CoV (published on 22 Oct 2014), as of 21 Oct 2014, a total of 906 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to public health authorities worldwide, including 361 deaths (see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1093).

The WHO confirmation of the earlier reported case in Turkey provides more as yet preliminary information, including the observation that the patient had lived and worked in Jeddah (where there had been significant transmission of MERS-CoV in the healthcare environment earlier this year, April/May/June/July 2014). The last reported case of MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah was on 4 Jul 2014, a 52 year old expat male, non-healthcare worker with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities (see MERS-CoV (05): Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO, RFI 20140710.2592792) who was reported to have died on 16 Jul 2014 (see MERS-CoV (06): Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO 20140718.2620907).

In addition, with the information that the patient was clinically ill with symptoms related to MERS-CoV infection while travelling back to Turkey, the possibility of transmission of the MERS-CoV infection to contacts while travelling exists. Time will tell.
