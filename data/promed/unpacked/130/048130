[I am going to assume that the ducks mentioned in this report are raised
for food and not waterfowl, thus they can be appropriately called poultry.
Based on this report, currently diagnosed Newcastle disease occurs in
Apure, Aragua, Cojedes, Monagas and Nueva Esparta. Other provinces,
including Bolivar, Carabobo, Falcon, Guarico, Lara, Miranda and Yaracuy,
for example, have reported Newcastle disease previously; see references below.
A quick scan of the map at
<http://www.mapsofworld.com/venezuela/venezuela-political-map.html>
shows that even without including the pending diagnoses, broad areas of
Venezuela are infected. Given the widespread nature of an outbreak of this
serious disease (former OIE List A disease) and the recent report of
Newcastle Disease in Brazil (which had not previously reported the disease
since 2001), one would have thought that there would be an official report
to OIE at some point in the outbreak. - Mod.PC]
