ROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER - BRAZIL (MINAS GERAIS)

Rock Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) is a serious rickettsial disease affecting
man that is trasmitted by several different species of ticks. Illness is most
commonly characterized by acute onset and fever and usually accompanied by
myalgia. It requires prompt diagnosis and the patient needs care before lab
confirmation is obtained. RMSF is caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_ and, in
Brazil, transmitted by ticks of the species _Amblyomma cajennense_ affecting
horses, cattle, dogs, small rodents and human populations.
I just received a message from Ezequiel Dias Foundation, Otavio Magalhes
Institute (IOM/FUNED), one of the 16 WHO Centers for diagnosis of the disease
world-wide, reporting that RMSF is now a public health problem in the State
of Minas Gerais, resulting in an increasing number of deaths. Cases have
been referred to the Institute from the health services and hospitals in the
State since 1992. However, most cases are not usually diagnosed or reported
to local surveillance systems. Diagnostic techniques used by the Institute
are: Weil-Felix Technique (WF), Indirect Immunofluorescence for _R.
rickettsii_ (IFI) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
IFI results for RMSF diagnosis (_Rickettsia rickettsii_) between 1992 and
1997 in IOM/FUNED from SUS (Unified Health System) in the State of Minas
Gerais were:
1992/997 - 1252 sera sent for diagnostic tests, 78 positive cases (6.2%)
Deaths (identified by the laboratory):
in 1996, 3 of 9 positive cases were fatal
in 1997, 2 of 11 positive cases were fatal

[_R. rickettsii_ has been isolated from dogs, opossums, and wild rabbits in
Brazil. It would be useful to study the molecular genetics of a Brazilian
strain of _R. ricketssii_, comparative studies such as are being done in
France (Zuzana Sekeyova, e-mail: coxiella@medecine.univ-mrs.fr) and at
CDC/Atlanta rur1@cdc.gov>.
I apologize for not being able to determine the particular person who sent
this message. Nonetheless, there should be more than enough information for
anyone who wants to contact one of the principal investigators. -- Mod CHC]
