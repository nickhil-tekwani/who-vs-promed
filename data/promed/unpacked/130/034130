Spain (2097), Germany (1459), and France (1210) are major contributors to this increase as well. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 55.7% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe. There were 18 other countries with more than 30 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 7171 deaths have been reported, 3945 outside mainland China.

For the 19th consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. And for the 3nd day, the number of newly confirmed cases from South Korea was less than 100. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, a total of 80 881 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from China, representing an increase of 21 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (15 Mar 2020) report was prepared.

It is now the 8th consecutive day that the number of newly reported cases in a 24 hour period was less than 50. While there are still suspected cases reported that presumably are waiting for laboratory confirmation, fingers are crossed this adequately represents China approaching interruption of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the country. In addition, 13 deaths were reported, all of them by Hubei province. Nine new cases were reported from Hong Kong.

There were 20 imported cases into China confirmed, representing 95.2% of all reported cases in the past 24 hours. Hence, all but 1 of the newly confirmed cases were imported cases - approaching interruption of transmission! Cases were reported by Beijing (9), Shanghai (3), Guangdong (3) Zhejiang (1), Shandong (1), Guangxi (1) Yunnan (1), and Shaanxi (1), bringing the total number of imported cases to 143. As I keep mentioning, a challenge will be to prevent importations from starting new chains of transmission within China. The 1 remaining case with local transmission, was from Wuhan in Hubei province. Interpretation: Wuhan is the location within China where the SARS-CoV-2 is still being transmitted. Albeit it appears to be approaching interruption of transmission. I remain interested in seeing a table of locations of origin of imported cases.

A map of China showing provinces can be seen at https://www.chinadiscovery.com/china-maps/china-provincial-map.html and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7101282,155. - Mod.MPP]

Additional information from the 16 Mar 2020 English language webpage (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030):

- Epidemiological links have been found for 80.7% of the total cases; 19.3% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 1 [at the URL above) Distribution of the cases by sex and age groups are as indicated in Table 2. A graph of imported cases by period and region of origin is provided in Figure 1.
- 5 additional confirmed cases have been reported from the call center located in Guro-gu, Seoul, amounting to a current total of 129 confirmed cases from the call center since [8 Mar 2020]. As of now, 14 confirmed cases in Gyeonggi Province has been traced to have come in contact with a confirmed patient who is a worker at the 11th floor call center at a religious gathering. Further investigation and tracing are underway.
- A current total of 47 confirmed cases have been reported from a church (Grace River Church) in Gyeonggi Province since 9 Mar 2020. Further investigation and tracing are underway.
- In light of the recent emergence of new confirmed cases by local transmission at close-contact indoor gatherings, the KCDC again strongly recommended that all such gatherings be canceled or refrained as best as possible.
- In light of 4 new confirmed cases from airport quarantine during [14-15 Mar 2020], the KCDC urged all travelers to take caution; the Special Entry Procedure has been extended to travelers from all European regions as of 0:00 [16 Mar 2020], which requires the traveler to provide a confirmed contact information and report their symptoms daily for the next 14 days via self-diagnosis app on their mobile device.
- Travelers who have visited Europe in the past 14 days are advised to minimize movement, adhere to personal hygiene measures, and keep watch for fever or respiratory symptoms carefully for the next 14 days. Upon noticing symptoms, they should visit a medical center with a screening facility with a mask on or call the KCDC at 1339.
- As of 0:00 [14 Mar 2020], 714 patients (8.8% of 8086 confirmed cases as of [14 Mar 2020]) have been discharged from isolation. On average, it took 14.7 days (median value: 15 days) from confirmed diagnosis to discharge. By age groups, the discharge rate was 9.7% for ages below 60 and 5.7% for those aged 60 or above.
- Although the growth rate of new cases in Daegu and Gyeongbuk regions is showing a decline, the KCDC stressed the need to continue to stay vigilant, as smaller case clusters continue to emerge from community and religious facilities. The KCDC emphasized that the strict adherence to infection prevention measures should remain a top priority in everyday life and should become a "new normal", stressing that workplaces and schools as well as society at large need to create an environment that strongly encourages those with suspected symptoms to stay at home and watch their symptoms.
- The KCDC recommended that businesses and workplaces improve their on-site environment to enable distancing measures, periodically ventilate and disinfect their facilities, and adopt remote working environments for employees such as work-at-home and online collaboration.
- The KCDC stressed the importance of continued adherence to social distancing measures to prevent transmission to high-risk groups. Expressing concern that the virus may be contracted by healthy adults and children via workplaces and schools and transmitted to the vulnerable groups such as the elderly and people with underlying illnesses via healthcare facilities, social welfare centers, religious gatherings, or other community spaces and events. the KCDC strongly advised that the elderly stay at home as much as possible and refrain from visiting places visited by a large number of people.
- The KCDC urged everyone to continue to adhere to personal hygiene and social distancing measures, and encouraged businesses and public facilities to keep hand wash and sanitizers in stock and put up posters to remind users to practice hand hygiene in all places.

[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 84 cases and 6 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (15-16 Mar 2020) when there were 74 newly confirmed cases. The epicenter of this outbreak is still Daegu province with 6098 reported cases and the surrounding province of Gyeongbuk with 1169 reported cases. That being said, there is still significant activity seen in Seoul (12 new cases) and Gyeonggi (31 new cases). Daily case counts are slowing down with only 5 newly confirmed cases in Gyeongbuk in the past 24 hours, and only 32 cases reported from Daegu. There were 11 provinces not reporting any new cases. Interestingly there are now 6 individuals in quarantine (up from 4 the day before), detected through airport screening, who have tested positive.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now, 27 980 cases, including 2158 deaths, up from 24 747 cases and 1809 deaths reported on 14 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 15 and 16 Mar 2020 was 3233 newly confirmed cases, compared with 3590 newly confirmed cases between 14 and 15 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (14 649), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (3522), and Venice (2473), all in the northern part of the country. These 3 provinces account for 73.8% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was changed to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, there is no trend for stabilizing or decreasing the daily number of new cases that are confirmed. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

Iran on Monday [16 Mar 2020] closed 4 key Shiite pilgrimage sites to stop the [COVID-19] outbreak. The holy shrines of Imam Reza in Mashhad, Fatima Masumeh in Qom, and Shah Abdol-Azim in Tehran were shut until further notice "upon the orders of the anti-coronavirus headquarters and the health minister," state television said. Qom's Jamkaran mosque also said it would close its doors, the official IRNA news agency reported. People angry over the decision protested outside Qom's Fatima Masumeh shrine, some chanting "religious slogans" and damaging the entrance door, IRNA reported.

The coronavirus outbreak has spread to all of Iran's 31 provinces since it first emerged last month [February 2020] in Qom, which is among the worst-hit regions along with Tehran and Khorasan Razavi, where Mashhad is located. Health Minister Saeid Namaki said the shrines and "other holy sites" had agreed to close until after the New Year holidays, which start on Friday [20 Mar 2020].

The move came after Iran said the COVID-19 disease killed another 129 people, taking the country's overall toll to 853 dead out of 14 991 cases of infection.

"Our plea is that everyone take this virus seriously and in no way attempt to travel to any province," health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said. The disease has now killed at least 12 Iranian politicians and officials, both sitting and former, and infected 13 more who have either been quarantined or are being treated. The latest was Ayatollah Hashem Bathayi Golpayegani, a member of the Assembly of Experts -- an 88-strong body of clerics that appoints and monitors the country's supreme leader. The ayatollah, who was 78, died 2 days after testing positive for the disease and being hospitalised, state news agency IRNA reported.

The novel coronavirus also claimed the life of prominent economist and political activist Fariborz Rais-Dana on Monday [16 Mar 2020]. A prolific writer with a PhD from the London School of Economics, he had spent time in prison after being convicted of spreading propaganda against the system.

Iran has been scrambling to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19 since the authorities announced the 1st 2 deaths in Qom on [2 Feb 2020]. It has since shut schools, postponed cultural and sports events, and discouraged travel ahead of the New Year holidays. Iran has also cancelled the main weekly Friday prayers, closed parliament and put off the 2nd round of legislative elections. In addition, the judiciary has sent 83 000 inmates on temporary leave from jails, apparently over concerns of the virus spreading in the prison system.

But Iran has yet to impose a lockdown, and the official number of deaths and infections has continued to grow exponentially. According to the health ministry, the rising trend is due to the increasing number of tests being carried out. It says many patients started showing symptoms days after they were infected.

The health ministry's latest figures showed that Tehran province had the highest number of new infections with 200 cases. The central province of Isfahan followed with 118 cases, with Mazandaran in the north of Iran coming next with 96.

[In the 24 hours from 15 to 16 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 13 938 to 14 991 an increase of 1053 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 724 to 853, an increase of 129 deaths in the 24 hour period. The number of cases continues to grow at an alarming rate, with reports of deaths of many notable figures in the country and of international fame. This seems to be a repetitive story, countries' health sectors being overwhelmed with the pandemic. Wuhan China began, followed by Italy, and now Iran.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 am CET.

Highlights
----------
- Four new countries/territories/areas (African Region [2], European Region [1] and Region of the Americas [1]) in have reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- The total number of cases and deaths outside China has overtaken the total number of cases in China. From today [16 Mar 2020], total cases from China will no longer be featured separately (former Table 1).

- The WHO COVID-19 Incident Management Team is working closely with partners across all levels to provide support to countries, strengthen technical and operational networking and collaboration, and support operational coordination of the global response. For more information, please see the 'subject in focus' below.

- Two new technical guidance documents were published today: Critical preparedness, readiness, and response actions for COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/critical-preparedness-readiness-and-response-actions-for-covid-19) and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Action Plan Guidance (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/risk-communication-and-community-engagement-(rcce)-action-plan-guidance)

Subject in focus: partner coordination
--------------------------------------
The WHO COVID-19 Incident Management Team is working closely with partners across all levels to provide support to countries, strengthen technical and operational networking and collaboration, and support operational coordination of the global response.

To strengthen day-to-day operations, key agencies are embedded in the global team, including UNICEF, the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The major partner coordination mechanisms are the Emergency Medical Team (EMT) Initiative; the Global Health Cluster (GHC); and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), which includes technical agencies, major NGOs, including Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) International, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the IFRC, and other international organizations.

The core elements of health operations include clinical care and management, laboratory capacity strengthening, surveillance, case and contact tracing, infection prevention and control, risk communications and community engagement. These core elements are supported by technical networks worldwide, which draw on and support capacities in GOARN, GHC, and EMTs. In the area of risk communications and community engagement, IFRC, UNICEF and WHO have established a dedicated tripartite group to scale up and implement activities globally.

In response to the call from WHO, GOARN partners have mobilized international technical assistance to support preparedness and response missions at country request and to also support capacity in WHO regions and headquarters in Geneva. In addition, Public Health England, the Indo-Pacific Health Security Centre, the Australian government, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention have sent staff to WHO to work on COVID-19 response in Geneva, Switzerland, Manila, Philippines, and New Delhi, India.

The GHC and country Health Clusters have placed heavy emphasis on the following:
- readiness planning;
- support to in-country key pillar leads and agencies;
- mapping partner capacity and geographical presence;
- ensuring coordination and collaboration on technical guidance and support for preparedness and response for fragile and vulnerable populations

The EMT initiative is working with the global and regional networks of emergency medical teams currently on the front lines of major national outbreaks and supporting international deployment of support where needed and requested.

A major focus of the response is on case detection and contact tracing. To support country activities, partners are working closely on the deployment and implementation of Go.Data, an outbreak investigation tool for field data collection during public health emergencies. Over 50 countries have requested support, and GOARN partners are implementing a strategy for wide-scale rollout including direct country support, technical briefings, webinar/online presentations, and comprehensive remote support.

[The figures summarized the report below are the figures from the National Health Commission of China from 15 Mar 2020. The 16 Mar 2020 figures are included in sections [1] and [2] above.

**Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 150. This includes 12 countries (including 1 territory) from the Western Pacific region, 55 countries (including 4 territories) from the European region, 8 from the Southeast Asia region, 17 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 34 countries (including 8 territories) from the Americas region, and 24 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 86 434, including 3388 deaths. The countries of the WHO/EURO region have reported a total of 56 834 cases (64.9% of total cases reported outside of China) and in the past 24 hours have reported 10 668 newly confirmed cases representing 76.3% of the newly reported cases outside of China.

Figure 2 . Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [16 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the exponential growth in reported cases starting late February 2020, with the major driving force being the reported cases from Europe.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
