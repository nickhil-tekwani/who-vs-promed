Florida: state medical alert for West Nile virus lifted
-------------------------------------------------------
TALLAHASSEE: A state medical alert for West Nile virus and other
mosquitoborne diseases that covered 39 different counties was lifted on Fri
10 Jan 2003, Florida health secretary John Agwunobi said. "The medical
alert has been lifted based upon a considerable drop in virus activity
reported by our interagency surveillance program," Agwunobi said. "Although
we experienced an increase in human West Nile virus cases this year,
people's diligence in taking precautionary measures undoubtedly played a
role in keeping this number much lower than the number of cases seen in
other states."
West Nile virus was first identified in Florida in July 2001 and since then
40 human cases have been reported. Only 2 deaths from the
encephalitis-causing virus have been reported, both last month. Agwunobi
said that people in areas with high concentrations of mosquitoes still need
to take precautions, such as wearing mosquito repellent and eliminating
stagnant water in birdbaths, ponds, and other receptacles in which
mosquitoes might breed.

Comment on current mosquito control practice
--------------------------------------------
The statement in the report entitled "Ecological Impact of West Nile Virus"
[in West Nile virus update 2003 - USA (01) 20030103.0016] that "vertical
transmission of West Nile virus could make insecticides -- which typically
kill only adults -- less effective", is not an accurate assessment of
current mosquito control practices.
While ratios of larviciding to adulticiding will vary based on terrain,
climate and economic resources, a survey of mosquito control agencies in
the US would probably reveal that an average of 75 per cent of the
insecticides used are for larval control. There are sound economic and
environmental reasons for this situation, not to mention efficacy of control.
Firstly, the kill ratio is much higher for larvicides, and no mosquito
larvae ever swan out of its aquatic habitat to escape the larvicide.
Secondly, while an acre [4047 square metres] of mosquito-breeding water can
be treated with less than 1 pound [about 0.5 kg] of larvicide, the
mosquitoes emerging from these water could easily disperse over 1 square
mile [about 2.56 square km] and would require some 130 pounds [about 59 kg]
of adulticide using malathion or about half that using a synthetic pyrethroid.
Finally, using a helicopter to treat 1 acre would cost far less than using
that same helicopter to treat 640 acres. Anyone who has done basic research
into mosquito control operations will have learned from the web page of the
American Mosquito Control Association (<http://www.mosquito.org>) that the
mosquito control community has signed on to the Environmental Protection
Agency's Pesticide Environmental Stewardship Program (PESP) which clearly
defines acceptable practices consisting of surveillance, habitat management
(or sanitation), chemical control, and education.
