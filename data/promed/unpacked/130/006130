The World Health Organization stated on Thu 17 Nov 2005 that it sees no
sign that avian influenza is being passed from person to person after China
reported its first cases of human infection. "There is no evidence for
human transmission so far," said Henk Bekedam, the WHO representative in
China. "If there would be something like that, we would expect more people
would be unexpectedly dying of very severe pneumonia."
The Chinese Health Ministry reported on Wed 16 Nov 2005 China's first human
cases of bird flu. It said there were 2 confirmed cases -- a 24 year old
woman who had died and a 9 year old boy who had recovered. It said the
boy's 12 year old sister, who died, was a suspected case.
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has killed at least 64 people in Asia since
2003 and experts have warned that it could mutate into a form that can
easily spread between people. Millions could die in a pandemic. Asked
whether there was any sign that China was facing a flu epidemic, Bekedam
said, "If there's evidence of human-to-human transmission, there will be
small clusters. We are not at that stage."
But he warned of the need to be vigilant. "We need to closely monitor the
virus," Bekedam said. "The key is that at a certain moment, there will be
changes, that we will be able to detect it early." That means strong
surveillance systems and quick responses, he said. "That's also a challenge
not only for China, but a challenge for the whole world," he said.
Officials had warned that a human infection was inevitable in China, which
has seen 11 outbreaks of bird flu since October 2005 among its vast poultry
flocks.
Chinese officials initially said that a 12 year old girl who died in the
central province of Hunan, where an outbreak was reported in poultry,
tested negative for the virus, as did her brother and a schoolteacher who
fell ill at the same time. But the government later asked the WHO to help
re-examine the cases. The teacher, who cut his hand while handling a
chicken that may have been sick, was recovering in hospital, state media
said. The WHO said the man was under observation and tests were still being
carried out to see if he had contracted the virus. WHO said Chinese
investigators were confident the girl died of avian influenza, but she
couldn't be considered a confirmed case under the agency's guidelines
because her body was cremated and there weren't adequate samples for testing.
The 24 year old woman who died was a poultry worker in the eastern province
of Anhui, which suffered an outbreak on 20 Oct 2005. Bekedam said the woman
didn't live near that site but had been infected by birds that died in her
village in a possible unreported case.
Health officials were also monitoring a poultry worker in Liaoning province
in China's north east, which has seen 4 outbreaks, prompting the
vaccination and slaughter of millions of poultry. This woman had tested
negative for the virus and was leaving the hospital within 10 days, the
China Daily newspaper said Thu 17 Nov 2005, citing Liaoning health
officials. Meanwhile, the government has ordered all ports to require
passengers to fill out health forms, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
In Guangdong province in the south, the cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai will
check the temperatures of departing passengers, Xinhua said.
Also on Thu 17 Nov 2005, market operators in Shanghai were seeking to
reassure shoppers about the safety of their chickens. Sales of live
chickens at Shanghai's Sanguantan Poultry and Eggs Wholesale Market have
dropped recently by 90 per cent to 5000 a day, said a report posted on the
city government's website. All retail and wholesale markets are being
disinfected several times a day, it said.

China & Indonesia: avian influenza situation -- WHO update 41
-------------------------------------------------------------
China
-----
The Ministry of Health in China has confirmed the country's 1st 2 human
cases of infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The first case is a
9 year old boy from the southern province of Hunan. He was hospitalized
with respiratory symptoms on 17 Oct 2005 and has since returned home, fully
recovered.
The 2nd case is a 24 year old woman who worked as a poultry farmer in the
south eastern province of Anhui. She developed symptoms on 1 Nov 2005, was
hospitalized with severe pneumonia on 7 Nov, and died on 10 Nov 2005.
Testing was conducted by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and
Prevention in Beijing. An additional 2 possible human cases have been
investigated in Hunan Province. The 1st is the boy's 12 year old sister.
She was hospitalized on 16 Oct 2005 and died the following day of severe
bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Samples from
the girl are inadequate for testing, and the cause of her death will
probably never be known with certainty. Although evidence pointing to H5N1
infection is considered substantial by Chinese experts, WHO reports only
laboratory-confirmed cases.
The additional case under investigation in Hunan is a 36 year old
schoolteacher. He was hospitalized with pneumonia on 24 Oct 2005.
Definitive test results are pending. A WHO team with expertise in virology
and laboratory diagnosis has collaborated with national experts in the
investigation of the cases in Hunan.
Surveillance for human cases in China intensified over the past month
following a recurrence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in
poultry. Since 19 Oct 2005, China has reported 11 fresh outbreaks of the
disease in 6 provinces, from Liaoning in the northeast of the country to
Xinjiang in the far west. Hunan and Anhui -- the 2 provinces with confirmed
cases -- are among the recently affected provinces.
Indonesia
---------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has today confirmed a further 2 cases
of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Both cases were
fatal. The first newly confirmed case was a 16 year old girl from Jakarta.
She developed symptoms on 4 Nov 2005, was hospitalized on 6 Nov, and died
on 8 Nov 2005.
The 2nd case was a 20 year old woman from Jakarta. She developed symptoms
on 5 Nov, was hospitalized on 9 Nov, and died on 12 Nov 2005.
Both cases were confirmed by a WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong. Field
investigations are under way. The newly confirmed cases bring the total in
Indonesia to 11. Of these, 7 have been fatal.

Indonesia has had 2 more deaths from H5N1 avian influenza confirmed by a
laboratory in Hong Kong, bringing the total [number of deaths] to 7 in the
country, the Health Ministry said on Thu 17 Nov 2005. Hariadi Wibisono, a
senior official from the Ministry, said that the tests were from a 20 year
old woman who died last weekend and a 16 year old girl who died last week.
Both victims, who died in Jakarta, had contact with dead chickens, he said.
"We received the test results this morning and both victims were positive
for [avian influenza virus infection]," Wibisono told Reuters. He said that
[brought] the total confirmed deaths to 7, with 4 positive cases where
patients survived.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia,
where it is known to have killed more than 60 people. But experts fear the
H5N1 virus could mutate into a form that passes easily among people, just
like human influenza. If it does, millions could die because they would
have no immunity.
On Thu [17 Nov 2005], the Health Ministry said it would more than double to
100 the number of hospitals designated to treat bird flu patients across
the world's 4th most populous country. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
has made fighting bird flu one of the government's top priorities. On
Monday he outlined measures to tackle the virus that included seeking
licenses to make antiviral drugs as well as reviewing the budget to see if
more funds could be allocated. But the government has largely resisted
calls to mass-cull chickens, saying it did not have the money to compensate
owners. Most human bird flu cases in Asia have been blamed on direct or
indirect contact with infected chickens.

[In essence the situation is unchanged since yesterday's reports. 2 human
cases of avian influenza in China have been confirmed on the basis of
laboratory tests: a 24 year old woman in Anhui province who died and an 8
year old boy in Hunan province who survived infection.
The boy's 12 year old sister died in hospital as a consequence of a
respiratory illness, but was cremated before appropriate tests could be
competed. Therefore it cannot now be established whether this incident
ranks as a "cluster" of H5N1 avian influenza cases, particularly as the
children's teacher -- although still in hospital -- has not been confirmed
as suffering from avian influenza virus infection.
As of Thu 17 Nov 2005, the cumulative numbers of WHO-confirmed human cases
of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection since the beginning of the East
Asian outbreaks in December 2003 are the following: Indonesia, 11 cases
with 7 deaths; Viet Nam, 92 cases with 42 deaths; Thailand, 21 cases with
13 deaths; Cambodia, 4 cases with 4 deaths; and China, 2 cases with 1
death; giving an overall total of 130 cases and 67 deaths. - Mod.CP]
