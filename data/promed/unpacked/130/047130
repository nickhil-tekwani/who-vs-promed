Kazakhstan's emergencies ministry confirmed Friday that 2 people hospitalized
in the western region of Kazakhstan had been infected with anthrax. The 2
people became ill after eating meat from a calf they bought at a local market.
The emergencies ministry said the calf had died of anthrax and had been sold
at the market by the owner. A criminal investigation by the police is under
way and veterinary authorities are taking measures to prevent the spread of
the disease.
The authorities fear further outbreaks, mostly due to uncontrolled sales and
consumption of diseased animals' meat.
A woman died of anthrax on 20 Jun 2006 after eating the meat of a diseased
sheep in the Southern Kazygurt region of Kazakhstan.
Also a 94-ton consignment of pork infected with anthrax was seized by the
police in the city of Semipalatinsk in the east of Kazakhstan on 22 Apr 2006.
