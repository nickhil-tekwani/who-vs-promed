Health ministry increases efforts to contain brucellosis
-----------------------------------------------
The Chinese Ministry of Health said in Beijing on Fri 17 Dec 2004 that
China faces a "serious" brucellosis epidemic and that the country is
scaling up efforts to curb it from spreading further.
"China reported 5753 human cases of brucellosis in the first half of 2004,
which is close to the total number of reported cases last year [2003]," the
ministry said in a press release. "The situation is stark."
Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus
_Brucella_. These bacteria are spread primarily among animals, including
sheep, goats, cattle, deer, pigs and dogs. Humans become infected by coming
in contact with animals, or animal products, that are contaminated with
these bacteria.
In humans, brucellosis can cause a range of symptoms similar to influenza
and may include fever, headache, back pain, and physical weakness. Severe
infections of the central nervous systems or lining of the heart may occur.
Brucellosis can also cause long-lasting or chronic symptoms that include
recurrent fever, joint pain, and fatigue.
The Ministry of Health noted that it has issued a notice, together with the
Ministry of Agriculture, ordering local health and agricultural departments
to take rigorous quarantine and disinfecting measures, and, to conduct
strict animal culls on sick livestock to halt the spread of the disease.
The 2 ministries asked local agencies to improve health education to raise
people's awareness of the disease, the Ministry of Health said. Meanwhile,
the Ministry of Health said the 2 ministries also asked local agencies to
enforce efforts in disease monitoring.
"The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture will readjust and
increase the key national monitoring posts according to the development of
the epidemic," the Ministry of Health said.
Local health institutions were asked to cooperate with agricultural
departments closely, and to report disease information immediately, the
Health Ministry said.

[No information is given regarding the manifestations of brucellosis in the
cases or how the diagnosis was made, by culture, by serology, or just
empirically.
Brucellosis is considered to be a Category B bioterrorism agent which is,
in nature, acquired as a zoonotic infection by humans. Its manifestations
are protean, including undulant fever, with positive blood and/or bone
marrow cultures, and it is a cause of localized disease in many organ
systems including skeletal, urinary tract, central nervous system, liver,
cardiac and lung. The reader is referred to Young EJ. Human brucellosis.
Rev Infect Dis 1983;5:821-839 for a review of these manifestations. - Mod.LL]
[China's (annual) reports to the OIE related to the brucellosis situation
there are available only for 1999 (_B. suis_ and _B. abortus_ "present", no
_B. melitensis_ reported) and 2002. The latter report says "no cases."
However, a recent detailed review, "Epidemiology and control of brucellosis
in China," was published in December 2002 by Shang Deqiu, Xiao Donglou and
Yin Jiming (Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Chinese Academy of
Preventive Medicine, Beijing) in Veterinary Microbiology 90, 1-4, pp
165-182. Based on the analysis of 3425 _Brucella_ strains isolated from
humans and animals in 21 provinces, the data revealed 73.79 percent
infected with _B. melitensis_, 13.64 percent infected with _B. abortus_,
5.78 percent infected with _B. suis_, 0.05 percent infected with _B. ovis_
(which is generally not regarded as zoonotic!), and 6.70 percent infected
with atypical _Brucella_ strains. For the entire country, _B. melitensis_
was the predominant strain associated with outbreaks, but there were some
differences from province to province, for example _B. suis_ in Guangxi and
_B. abortus_ in Sichuan were the predominant strains isolated. In most of
the epidemics, the predominant strain was _B. melitensis_, with either _B.
abortus_ and/or _B. suis_. - Mod.AS]
