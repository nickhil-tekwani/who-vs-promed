Stanislaus County reported this year's 1st human case of St. Louis encephalitis Monday [8 Nov 2021], a woman in her 50s. The woman had neurological symptoms from the mosquito-borne virus, but the severity was not disclosed in the news release from the Health Services Agency.

St. Louis is less common than West Nile virus but can still do harm to a small percentage of the people who are bitten. The symptoms can include fever, headache, confusion, vomiting, seizures, and paralysis and can result in death.

The agency reminded residents to protect themselves when mosquitoes are active by wearing repellent and long sleeves and pants. They also should reduce standing water in flowerpots and other breeding sites.

The woman tested positive for encephalitis in September [2021], the same month that the county reported this year's 1st infected mosquito. The test was later confirmed.

More information on the disease is on the websites of the California Department of Public Health [https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/SLE.aspx] and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [https://www.cdc.gov/sle/].

To report mosquito problems north of the Tuolumne River, contact the Eastside Mosquito Abatement District at 209-522-4098 or <www.eastsidemosquito.com>. Other county residents can reach the Turlock Mosquito Abatement District at 209-634-1234 or <www.turlockmosquito.org>.

[St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was detected earlier this year (2021) in nearby Fresno County in mosquitoes in September. SLE virus is sporadically active in California. There were 5 human cases last year (2020) in the state (see St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA: (CA) human, mosquito, 2020 20210105.8071912).

The US CDC reports that most people infected with SLE virus have no apparent illness (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/). The 1% who become ill develop fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. Severe neuroinvasive disease (often involving encephalitis) occurs more commonly in older adults. Rarely, long-term disability or death can result. Unfortunately, there are no vaccines or medications available for human use. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
