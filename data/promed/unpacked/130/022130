Uruguayan health officials Thursday [22 Dec 2022] reported 8 people have died of a strong form of [group A streptococcus (GAS)] after cases were detected between 3 Nov and 12 Dec 2022 in the South American country.

According to official sources, 21 patients had been hospitalized due to this particularly invasive form of contagion [iGAS] by 19 Dec 2022 nationwide. Of the 21 cases, 7 were adults over 15 years of age and the rest were children between 1 and 7 years old. Among the 8 fatalities, there were 4 children and 4 adults aged 69 to 79 [years old].

In this [context], health authorities have upped the monitoring of possible outbreaks and requested the population to take the necessary measures in case of suspicion of infection, while the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has been briefed on the latest developments. The Uruguayan authorities said that "infection committees were requested to immediately notify any invasive form of the bacterium, as well as to send the isolated strain to the National Public Health Laboratory for study." In addition to that, a communications strategy has been devised as per guidelines stemming from World Health Organization (WHO) steps taken "in several European countries" where the pathogen has been detected lately.

The _Streptococcus pyogenes_ bacterium causes infections leading to mild symptoms, such as pharyngitis or scarlet fever, to severe clinical manifestations. It is transmitted by contact with droplets emitted by an infected person when coughing or sneezing. The symptoms of pharyngitis include a sore throat, fever, headache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, redness of the pharynx and tonsils, bad breath, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck.

The most frequent symptoms of scarlet fever are a red and sore throat, fever (38.3Â°C or higher), red rash with sandpaper texture, bright red skin in the folds of the armpit, elbow, and groin, whitish coating on the tongue or the back of the throat, "raspberry" tongue, headache, nausea or vomiting, swollen glands, and body aches.

In the presence of any of these symptoms, patients are advised to consult a certified physician and avoid self-medication with antibiotics.

[Fatal invasive group A streptococcus (also called GAS or _Streptococcus pyogenes_) infections are currently being reported in the USA, Canada, the UK and the EU in the midst of increasing cases of localized GAS infections (for example, pharyngitis, scarlet fever). The above news report adds Uruguay to the expanding list of countries affected by fatal GAS infections in children and adults.

GAS commonly causes scarlet fever, pharyngitis, local suppurative extensions to involve the middle ear (otitis media) and sinuses (mastoiditis), and superficial skin infections (impetigo, cellulitis). Scarlet fever is caused by erythrogenic toxin-producing GAS and usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis, but may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever), or even the skin lesions of chicken pox. Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than 1%.

GAS can also cause potentially fatal invasive infections (iGAS), including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur after GAS pharyngitis.

GAS pharyngitis has rarely caused bacteremia that can lead to infections at distant sites (http://www.jstor.org/pss/4456639, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19812863). Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently, GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/groupa-strep/emm-background.html). Over 200 emm types have been identified. Molecular analysis of the isolates emm aids in documenting a common source of an outbreak. Serotypes M1 and M3, in particular, have been associated with invasive infection.

GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowding in schools and in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person. - Mod.ML
