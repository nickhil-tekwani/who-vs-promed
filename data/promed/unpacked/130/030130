There is an increase in the number of stranded California sea lions along the entire Oregon coast due to leptospirosis, a naturally-occurring bacteria that can also sicken dogs, people, other wildlife, and livestock.

Dogs are most at risk of getting the disease while the risk to people is small. Dog and horse owners should discuss the merits of vaccination for leptospirosis with their veterinarian. ODFW and Oregon Parks and Recreation urge beachgoers to leash their dogs and keep at least 150 feet away from live or dead sea lions.

The disease can spread when an animal or person is in contact with urine or other bodily fluids of an infected or dead sea lion.

Leptospirosis outbreaks occur sporadically in marine mammals. Outbreaks can result in increased strandings and mortalities among sea lions. The Oregon Marine Mammal Stranding Network documented over 150 sick or dead sea lions along the Oregon coast since the current outbreak began in late July 2022. Necropsies on 7 sea lions confirmed all tested positive for leptospirosis.

Sick or injured seals, sea lions, whales or dolphins can be reported to OSP at 1-800-452-7888.

All marine mammals are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and it is a violation of federal and state laws to harass, touch, or feed marine mammals. Marine mammals on the beach are often just resting or are sick and should be left alone.

[The first mortality event in sea lions (_Zalophus californianus_) caused by _Leptospira interrogans_ was reported in 1970, in wild populations along the coast of California and Oregon (USA). Thereafter, leptospirosis outbreaks have been occurring at regular intervals, and leptospirosis has been implicated as a cause of premature parturition in California sea lions. The serovar implicated is Pomona. The occurrence of the disease appears to be cyclic. Every 4-5 years there are peaks of exposure (seroprevalence increases), which coincides with sea lion strandings due to leptospirosis.

In Sep-Dec 2017 there was an outbreak of sea lions along the Oregon Coast (see ProMED post the Oregon Coast (see ProMED post 20171030.5413664). - Mod.PMB
