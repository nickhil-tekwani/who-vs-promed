The total number of chikungunya cases has risen to 369 as of Monday evening [3 Jan 2017], according to the data received by the Karachi health director Dr Waheed Panhwar.

The majority of the cases have been reported in Khokhrapar, Ghariababad, Kalaboard, and Ghazi Goth areas in District Malir and a few adjoining union councils of Korangi [Karachi, Sindh].

"Although the ratio of patients suffering from the chikungunya virus has been decreasing due to the measures being taken by the health department, there is still more to be done," Panhwar told The Express Tribune.

According to him, 49 and 48 cases were reported on [19 and 20 Dec 2017] respectively, whereas, the figure dropped to 5 and 11 cases on last Sunday and Monday [1 and 2 Jan 2017] respectively.

Initially, 9 samples were sent to the National Institute of Health in Islamabad from where 4 cases were tested as positive, said Panhwar, adding that the government will not be sending the blood samples of all the victims as the existence of a novel but non-fatal viral fever has been confirmed and relying on the clinical examination, the health department has initiated the treatment of all 369 victims.

According to World Health Organisation's definition of chikungunya and the data collected by the health department, all 369 chikungunya virus cases have been put on treatment as, without laboratory investigation, they share symptoms similar to those patients who have tested positive for the virus, he said, adding that Sindh has no laboratory kits to diagnose the disease.

"The vector needs to be controlled so the infectious virus can be stopped from spreading," he said, while suggesting the method to stop mosquito-borne diseases from taking shape of an epidemic.

This mosquito-breeding cycle needs to stop, he said, suggesting that larvicidal activity and fumigations need to be carried out to stop mosquitoes from breeding. As a precautionary measure, indoor residential sprays have been carried out in more than 15 000 rooms in the residential areas of Malir that were affected by the virus, said Panhwar.

However, he said that all other 4 districts of Karachi are free of chikungunya fever, while referring to the reports received by him through the district health officers. Earlier, the 1st 3 cases of the disease were confirmed positive on [22 Dec 2016], when 5 blood samples were sent to Islamabad after a hype created by the media regarding the identification of the viral fever.

[According to data communicated by the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit in Karachi, from [19 Dec 2016 to 4 Jan 2017], 399 suspected cases of unexplained fever with joint pain (chikungunya suspected cases) were identified and registered according to the WHO recommended case definition, with the majority belonging to the 30-39 years age group.

"A person with acute onset of fever (102 deg F/38.9 deg C) and severe arthralgia or arthritis not explained by other medical conditions, and who resides or has visited epidemic or endemic areas within 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms"

Vector surveillance done by team of entomologists from the Malaria Control Program Sindh found a high density of chikungunya vector (_Aedes aegypti_) adult and larval forms in affected areas.

Chikungunya cases have started to come down as prompt vector control measures were initiated in the affected areas. However, continued efforts and measures are required to sustain low transmission of the disease. - Mod.UBA
