Since 2 Jun 2006, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF; doctors without borders)
medical teams have been monitoring and treating victims of a pneumonic
plague outbreak in north eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
As of 19 Jun 2006, 22 deaths had been confirmed out of 144 identified cases
so far in the Ituri region of the DRC. There are now 12 zones in Ituri --
with total population of almost 100 000 -- affected by the plague outbreak.
Pneumonic plague is an extremely contagious airborne disease. Bubonic
plague, a less contagious form of the disease, is endemic to Ituri.
Faced with a constant increase in the number of patients affected by the
disease, MSF has deployed teams of medical volunteers to the area. They have
set up 2 isolation centers for the treatment of patients in Kwandroma (Rethy
medical district) and in Vedza (Linga medical district).
MSF is concerned that if rapid control measures are not put in place, the
outbreak could soon spread to some populations where access is restricted
due to some security constraints, particularly around Budza, Djubate, Lailo
and Zali, all located in the Rethy medical district.
