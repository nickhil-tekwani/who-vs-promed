Ending Ebola in 2015 Depends on Locals as Much as Foreign Aid
-------------------------------------------------------------
Whether the world's worst-ever Ebola outbreak can be wiped out in West Africa in 2015 is uncertain. To a large extent, it depends as much on locals changing their practices and beliefs as it does on continued international assistance.

The World Health Organization [WHO] now says there are enough beds to isolate and treat Ebola patients, but not all are in the hotspots where the disease is spreading fastest. The United Nations [UN] estimates that the number of scientists needed to track the outbreak must be tripled.

WHO is also working to speed testing of experimental Ebola vaccines but even if an effective shot is found, it would still take months to ramp up production.

One of the biggest problems is finding all contacts of confirmed cases. Teams are in place in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the 3 worst-hit countries, to monitor suspect cases, but too little is known about where the virus is spreading. Typically, every confirmed Ebola case has about 12 to 20 possible contacts who must be monitored. In Sierra Leone, the epicenter of the current crisis, officials are reporting just 8, leading to suspicions that contact tracing is inadequate.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon previously said the epidemic could be over by mid-2015 but WHO is now declining to set a specific timeline after having been burned on previous predictions. Last October [2014], WHO expected that all Ebola patients [would be safely buried] by 1 Jan [2015], but [the] goal was not met. There are now burial teams trained to provide safe and dignified burials for all Ebola victims, but the under-reporting of deaths means it's impossible to tell if all people killed by Ebola are safely buried and whether there are unknown chains of transmission.

Among concrete progress since the crisis gained international attention last summer, a major initiative led by the U.N. has been put into place, including:
- Building 41 Ebola treatment centers
- Setting up 23 laboratories
- Sending hundreds of staff from Britain, Canada, Cuba, China, the U.S. and elsewhere

Still, more health workers are needed and officials are still struggling to build more basic Ebola centers, which won't treat patients but simply isolate them while they await test results. There are also plans to set up more mobile labs and to send specially-trained anthropologists to work with villages hostile to Western help. Some villagers suspect the moon-suited Ebola doctors are bringing the virus to their communities, instead of saving them from it.

"We cannot control the outbreak if there is no trust from the population," said Brice de la Vigne, director of operations for Doctors Without Borders [MSF] in Belgium. De la Vigne said convincing West Africans to change deeply engrained but risky burial practices or to seek help from Western doctors instead of traditional healers will also be difficult.

"We need to spend a lot more time listening to the people and readapting our messages because there is no 'one size fits all' approach to this," he said.

[2] Impact of sequester on research and development funding

U.S. sequester took big bite out of global research and development spending
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the outbreak of Ebola in West African spiraled out of control in the middle of 2014, health-care advocates pointed to it as a reason why countries like the United States need to engage in health globally. There are many other problems that affect more people than Ebola and that also pose a threat to Americans. It all comes at a time when the United States is making cuts to vital research and development supporting drugs and vaccines for neglected tropical diseases, say advocates.

The world spent USD 3.2 billion on research and development for neglected diseases in 2013. That is USD 193 million less than what was spent in 2012, and it is pretty much all at the fault of the United States. The budgetary stand-off in Washington, D.C., that ended in the sequester led to a USD 188 million cut for the U.S. National Institutes of Health [NIH]. Blame is not solely on the United States, says the new G-FINDER report, published by the research group Policy Cures. The pharmaceutical industry spent USD 74 million less than it did in 2010. In sum, the industry contributes to only 12 percent of neglected disease spending globally.

"If we want effective medicines for diseases like Ebola, TB and malaria, then governments and industry do need to do better. Too many of the world's big economies, and too many of the world's top drug companies, are still missing from the funding table," said Dr. Mary Moran, executive director of Policy Cures.

Pharmaceutical companies are working quickly to develop and test new treatments for Ebola in response to its unprecedented spread across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. This week saw the launch of a new vaccine trial in Oxford, England. Johnson and Johnson is testing a small group of volunteers to test the safety of the vaccines. If all goes well, they will progress on to the next stage of clinical trials with the hopes of making the vaccine available in West Africa by the middle of this year. It is one of at least 4 vaccine trials currently under way. They all show how the global health community to take action and produce results.

"We all want the momentum and sense of urgency to continue," said WHO director-general Dr. Margaret Chan, to the media this week. "Previous experts agreed that vaccines will have an impact on the Ebola epidemic in any future scenario, whether worst-case or best-case. I see no indication that this view has changed."

The problem for other neglected diseases is that urgency is not the same. "The total amount being spent is woefully insufficient. Over the long term, there are not really new resources available for global health when they are needed," said Dr. Mel Spigelman, president and chief executive officer of TB Alliance in an interview with Humanosphere.

[TB is a major concern.] Malaria is showing resistance to one of the best drugs against it and the bed-nets that protect people from mosquitoes. Dengue makes a deadly surge each year in places like India and diarrheal disease is one of the leading killers of children around the world. All are serious threats that require a strong health response, from trained medical professionals to well-maintained health centers to cutting edge drugs and vaccines.

Doing so requires political will. Spigelman says he learned from the Ebola outbreak just how much fear can drive action. He says there are some politicians in Washington, D.C. who support global health investments, but they need more. That burden rests with the advocates to make a compelling case for increasing funds.

"We have to make the economic argument for R&D as an investment," said Spigelman. "I think we need to get a hard-core number of people in positions of power who realize and take it as a cause and form it as a base to push for the advocacy for this. I think it always starts with champions and we have to generate those champions."

[3] Responses to Ebola update (09): WHO, suitcase diagnostic lab, susp 20150109.3082431
Date: Sat 10 Jan 2015
From: Prof. H. Tolou <h.tolou@sfr.fr> [edited]


I wish to add a comment to the message "Lab in a suitcase" you published [yesterday, 9 Jan 2015]. Indeed, making reliable diagnosis of Ebola infection accessible for every people, everywhere, whatever are the available facilities (energy supply, low temperature storage, protecting and decontaminating equipments) is cornerstone in the fight against the epidemic. Mobile, autonomous laboratories certainly are a solution. However, they must offer validated techniques for diagnosis, they must also guarantee the safety of the technicians and the protection of the analyses against contaminations, protection or decontamination procedures must be available and validated.

Possibility to perform other important analysis (such as malaria diagnosis) or to pack and store samples at low temperature for later analysis would be very appreciated. Such laboratories already exist, just as the one proposed by the French company K-Plan (http://www.k-plan.fr/) that is currently deployed in Guinea. This equipment offers the possibility to perform already validated techniques (molecular biology, serology, plus) that are necessary for reliable diagnosis of Ebola infection and other viral, parasitic or bacterial infections. It is easily transportable and it proposes autonomous energy supply, recording informatic device and protective equipments (class II / III safety cabinet).

Yours sincerely,

Hopefully the Germans have submitted it to some robust testing. In my years with anthrax I have seen a lot of rapid tests proposed but few survived in the field. But I feel better about this. However, one must always have back up if you can, to lab test both field test positives and negatives.

From Roger Breeze <rgbreeze@centaurscience.com>
Although PCR machines are becoming smaller, they are not suitable for remote locations with no electricity and refrigeration, so Ebola samples have to be transported under controlled conditions to remote labs. Such a method is not only risky -- recently a vehicle carrying infected Ebola material was stolen -- but introduces delays in an outbreak control process that needs rapid results to be effective.

Note: interest peaked in the USA in the week of 12 Oct 2014, when the Liberian case died in Texas, USA, and 2 nurses who had cared for him fell ill. From the week of 12 Oct 2014 to 1 Dec 2014, world interest declined dramatically in spite of increased cases in West Africa.

9 Jan 2015: Ebola vaccine: Only government investment in private labs can achieve it
http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_27263297/ebola-vaccine-only-government-investment-private-labs-can

Drug and vaccine development is costly, risky and time-consuming. In fact, a new study from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development found that the cost of bringing a new drug to market has doubled in the past 11 years and now costs USD 2.5 billion. Yet there is no viable commercial market for products for neglected tropical diseases and potential bioterror threats, therefore there is no commercial means to recoup these development costs.

So, if governments want private companies to invest in developing drugs and vaccines for diseases such as Ebola, Marburg, smallpox and pandemic flu, they must take the risk out of that investment by providing development funding, demonstrating a government procurement market and providing clear regulatory pathways.

Fortunately, the U.S. government has put in place a system for the public and private sectors to work together on the development and stockpiling of drugs and vaccines for national security threats such as Ebola and smallpox.

Through partnerships with the National Institutes for Health, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the BioShield Special Reserve Fund, industry has pushed forward the development of more than 100 medical countermeasures that may otherwise have sat on a shelf. In fact, all of the Ebola drug and vaccine candidates in development have been supported by U.S. government investment.

The problem is that funding for these programs is inadequate and erratic, making it difficult to plan investments in the complex, risky and decade long drug development process. ... --more

A rapid airport test for Influenza A or B as a cause of fever
-------------------------------------------------------------
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tue 6 Jan 2015 granted a waiver to allow a nucleic acid-based test to be used in a broader selection of clinical settings. Before the FDA's waiver, the Alere i influenza A & B test was allowed only for use in certain laboratories.

FDA's waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) means the test can be used in, for example, physicians' offices, emergency departments, and health department clinics and in airports, when evaluating causes of fever.

Alberto Gutierrrez, PhD, with the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said that the newer method allows healthcare workers to receive results more quickly to help guide diagnosis and treatment decisions.

The Alere test uses a nasal swab sample and produces results in as little as 15 minutes, allowing the patient to remain present during testing. The FDA said that the Alere i Influenza A & B test demonstrated high accuracy when identifying patients with or without influenza A and influenza B by users untrained in laboratory procedures.
