Lawyers hunt for BSE clues in files of Whitehall
A WHITEHALL hunt is under way for the "smoking gun" that might implicate
officials or former ministers over the BSE crisis. A team of legal
troubleshooters has been hired to search for memorandums, correspondence
and other documents that could provide the key to the Conservative
Government's handling of the issue.
While the Scott inquiry into arms for Iraq was virtually stalled for a year
as civil servants trailed their own documents, the BSE inquiry, headed by
Lord Justice Phillips, has insisted on an independent search of files.
About 20 lawyers have been sent to government departments to conduct the
trawl, with most information coming from the Ministry of Agriculture and
the Department of Health. Material has also been retrieved in the Welsh,
Scottish and Northern Ireland offices. So far the team has scoured 1,000
files containing about 150,000 sheets of paper to work out the chronology
and the role of various officials, scientists, veterinary surgeons and
ministers. A total of 60,000 documents has been collated as "of interest."
The findings will govern the line of questioning over the next two months
when officials will be called to give evidence for the first time. About
300 administrators and 30 scientists have been asked for written evidence,
but only about 50 are likely to be questioned in public.
Richard Packer, Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, has
made clear to his staff that they should speak freely to the inquiry. He is
among senior civil servants who are to appear before the inquiry in
September. About 150 former ministers are scheduled for November and
December.
Last night a senior Whitehall source made clear that Lord Justice Phillips
did not wish to be "judgmental" in his inquiry, and that all actions were
governed in the context of the knowledge of BSE at the time.
