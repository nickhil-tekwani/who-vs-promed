[Fox rabies re-emerged in northeastern Italy in 2008, in an area bordering Slovenia. Oral vaccination (with baits) has been carried out for many years. The rabies situation has changed drastically in all European countries where oral vaccination campaigns of red foxes against rabies have been implemented. However, this finding alerts that the virus is circulating in the fox population despite vaccination efforts.

The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Slovakia can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/4NKN. - Mod.PMB]
