Grain growers in the Victorian Mallee have lost nearly 20 percent of their
wheat crop in the worst outbreak of Take-all disease in over a decade.
In some cases, entire crops have been wiped out by the disease which is
being blamed on short crop rotations, late grass control and not enough
rain to break down disease in the soil, earlier in the season.
Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment Agronomist, Rob
Sonoghan, says the disease has hit in a year when crop yields were
predicted to be well above average.
According to Sonoghan, some paddocks have up to 80 percent loss and many
have 10 to 20 percent. Crops [with yield potential] of 12 to 15
[bags/hectare fell] to almost nothing overnight. He indicated that 10 to 20
percent of the Mallee's wheat crop could be affected.

[Take-all disease of wheat, caused by _Gaeumannomyces graminis_ var.
_tritici_was first recognized in Australia in 1852 and is considered the
most serious root disease of cereals worldwide. Its major hosts are wheat
and barley. The disease is favored by cool temperatures, wet soil
conditions, and continuous cropping to wheat. The pathogen is maintained
in soil on diseased plant tissues from wheat, barley and grassy weeds.
Apparently no wheat cultivars with specific resistance to the pathogen are
currently available but there are tolerant cultivars. Crop rotation is
also used in disease management. For a useful source of information about
this disease, see the following web site:
