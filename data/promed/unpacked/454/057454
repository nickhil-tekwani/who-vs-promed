Ongoing outbreak of measles linked to the UK in an ultra-orthodox Jewish
community in Israel
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On 4 Aug 2007, a 22 year old male tourist from London presented at a
hospital in Jerusalem, Israel, with general malaise, a high fever, and a
blotchy maculopapular rash over his face trunk and limbs, including palms
and soles. A junior health officer recommended hospital admission, which
the patient refused, partly because there was no definitive diagnosis.
Later the same day, the patient visited a private urgent care centre in
Jerusalem. Although the patient lacked the typical symptoms seen in the
early stages of measles, such as Kopliks' spots, dry cough and
conjunctivitis, the physician in the centre suspected measles. He had seen
very few cases of measles previously, but as the staff of the clinic are
kept informed of infectious disease outbreaks globally by the focused use
of Google Health News installed on desktops at the clinic, he was aware of
recent outbreaks of measles in parts of the United Kingdom (UK), including
London, which had been reported [1,2]. This, coupled with the patient's
rash and his other symptoms, led to a suspicion of measles, against which
the man had not been vaccinated due to adverse reaction in a sibling.
On 7 Aug 2007, measles was laboratory-confirmed in the Central Virology
Laboratory of the Ministry of Health at Tel Hashomer (Sheba Medical
Center): serology was strongly positive for rubeola (measles) antibodies
(IgM). The virus genotype responsible for the outbreak was D4, the same
genotype prevalent in the ongoing outbreak in the UK [3]. The test was
organised by the Public Health Services of the Ministry of Health, to which
the suspected case was reported -- measles is a notifiable disease in
Israel. The patient's history revealed earlier oral lesions and
conjunctivitis. He could not indicate the source of infection, but recalled
having visited his general practitioner in London several weeks earlier,
where another patient in the waiting room may have had a rash.
Upon admission, our patient was isolated in a separate room and treated for
malaise, fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and dehydration. Intravenous
fluids were given daily over a 4 day period. He recovered and was
discharged 2 weeks after admission. His 8 month old son was given gamma
globulin, while the rest of his household was contacted by the Jerusalem
branch of the Ministry of Health and vaccinated where necessary.
On 1 Aug 2007, the patient had attended a wedding in Jerusalem with an
estimated 2000 guests, almost all of whom were members of the Toldot Aharon
(literally "generations of Aaron"), also known as the Satmar, an
ultra-orthodox Jewish movement with sizeable communities in the UK, the
United States, Belgium, Switzerland, Argentina, and Israel. Globally, there
are thought to be around 20 000 members of this movement. Guests at the
wedding came from Israel, Europe, and the United States. Considering the
incubation period of measles (10-12 days), these people may have been exposed.
The last cases of measles in the Jerusalem district were in November 2004,
following an outbreak that originated in a kindergarten in the
ultra-orthodox community. The genotype responsible was D4. There was also
an outbreak in the ultra-orthodox community in Jerusalem in 2003, with the
index case being a 2 year old unvaccinated child, and 107 cases reported
within 3 months [4]. That outbreak was caused by the D8 genotype, and is
thought to have been imported from Switzerland, where there had been a
large outbreak involving genotypes D8 and D5 [4,5]. Following these
outbreaks, outreach programmes were launched to raise immunisation coverage
and achieve herd immunity in the ultra-orthodox communities involved.
Taking the success of those campaigns into account, it was not considered
necessary to trace all 2000 guests who attended the wedding on 1 Aug 2007.
Since August 2007, there have been about 50 cases of measles in Israel,
most of which have been serologically confirmed. Most cases have been
concentrated around the Jerusalem area, with almost all patients from the
ultra-orthodox community. In the 3rd week of August, a member of the
nursing staff at a private urgent care centre in Modiin, 35 kilometres
[21.7 miles] outside Jerusalem, developed measles. Due to comprehensive
computerised records of visits to these centres, all contacts were traced
within hours of the request by the Ministry of Health, and all those at
risk were recalled for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisation. A 3
year old girl who was treated in hospital in Jerusalem in mid-August with
measles encephalitis was also ultra-orthodox and non-immunised, but she was
neither a tourist nor from the Satmar community. Her contact was traced
back to an ultra-orthodox unimmunised child who had travelled from London
(with her parents) to a different wedding in Jerusalem that took place
earlier in the summer. The 3 year old was treated in an intensive care unit
for a few days and appears to have made a full recovery. Two more children
were reported to have been hospitalised on 16 Sep 2007 [6], meaning that
the infection is now in its 3rd generation, as every 2 weeks those in
contact with an infected person can themselves become infected.
Routine measles immunisation was introduced in Israel in 1967, and a 2-dose
schedule for the MMR vaccine at the ages of 12 months and 6 years was
introduced in 1994 [7]. Israel's Ministry of Health has estimated that
coverage for MMR in the ultra-orthodox community is between 60 and 70 per
cent [Y Amitai, personal communication]. It is likely to be lower in the
Satmar, a group who are known not to officially recognise state
institutions. Nationally, an estimated 94-95 per cent of the general
non-ultra-orthodox population take up the first dose of the MMR vaccine
according to Ministry of Health recommendations, and the coverage for the
second dose is 95-97 per cent [8].
There is no religious reason for Jews not to vaccinate against disease --
in fact, Judaism obliges its followers to prevent illness in themselves and
others. The Oral Law specifically states that "All of Israel is responsible
one for the other" (Shavuot 39a, Sotah 37a, Rosh Hashanah 29a), the clear
message being that one should not rely on others to immunise in order to
enjoy herd immunity.
Like most Hasidic sects, the Satmarim are exceedingly disciplined, and the
hierarchal structure of the movement can be very successful at motivating
large groups of people to one course of action. If the elimination of
measles in the World Health Organization European Region by 2010 is to
remain a realistic goal, more work will have to be done in future to
understand the social structure and establish lines of communication with
the key contact points of this and other hard-to-reach communities.
