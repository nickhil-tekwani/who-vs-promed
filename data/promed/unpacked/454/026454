Scientists say ticks can now survive in environments where they would have frozen to death 30 years ago. Scientists believe climate change and the bacteria ticks carry is helping extend their range. Researchers are tracking the ticks to see how to help protect the public and their pets from possible infections.

It's a bitter cold February day but that's just the way Chuck Lubelcyzk and Libby Henderson like it. The vector ecologist and field biologist from Maine Medical Center's Research Institute want to know how [blacklegged ticks] live through harsh Maine winters.

The tiny parasites are in containers called tick traps -- buried in the ground. Biologists clear snow and check to make sure the traps are intact. The ticks are disease free and inside small bottles. They are being monitored all winter in different types of conditions.

Some bottles are under leaves -- others are exposed. So far, data show the ticks -- which look like moving poppy seeds -- can hibernate in leaf cover.

The snow cover acts as a thick insulating layer and things under it survive; the snow cover actually protects what is below from a real killing frost or cold, said Lubelcyzk, a vector ecologist at the MMC Research Institute. No snow cover and a sudden drastic drop in temperatures usually spells doom -- but even exposed ticks can survive at a rate as high as 40%.

Another concern -- ticks are on the move. Cases of Lyme have exploded from 71 in 2000 to 1310 in 2018. Southern Maine is considered the epicenter for Lyme -- but cases are being reported in every county in Maine, even in Aroostook County where [blacklegged] ticks haven't been spotted yet.

"Where are the ticks heading? Where is their optimal range? It's very important for predicting the distribution of disease," said Michelle Volk, University of Maine graduate student. Researchers in southern Maine are sharing data with Volk, who is tracking tick migration in northern and downeast Maine.

[This is another example of arthropods that are vectors of important pathogens expanding their geographic range. Climate change, with warmer winter temperatures, can certainly be an important factor in this expansion. In the case of blacklegged ticks (_Ixodes scapulars_), not only does this have consequences for transmission of Lyme disease borreliosis but also for Powassan virus. Powassan virus infections in humans occur much less frequently than Lyme disease, but can cause encephalitis. Powassan virus (POWV, Flaviviridae) is the only North American member of the tick-borne encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses. Humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from the natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV is the causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness with 50% of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae. A previous ProMED-mail post (see Powassan virus encephalitis - USA (04): (ME) 20170601.5077456) cites a study by tick biologists in the Maine Medical Center Research Institute's "tick lab" who collected adult and nymph (immature) blacklegged ticks from 30 towns across 11 of Maine's counties between June 2015 and December 2016. They found that out of 203 pools of adult ticks, 15 tested positive for Powassan [virus]. The virus was found largely in the southern part of the state, but also in Augusta and on Swan's Island in Hancock County. Residents and visitors in Maine and other localities where Lyme borreliosis and Powassan virus occur are well advised to heed the following CDC advice to avoid tick bites.
- Choose light-colored clothing so it's easier to spot ticks; wear long sleeves and tuck your pants into your socks.
- Use an EPA-approved insect repellent.
- Check your skin and clothing for ticks and remove them promptly. Don't miss warm moist areas such as the ears, armpits and neck, and have someone else check your back.
- Wash possible tick bites with soap and water and apply an antiseptic.
- Keep your lawn mowed and tidy to remove tick habitat.
- If you spot an embedded tick, use a tick spoon or tweezers to grasp its mouth [at skin level] and pull it out with steady pressure. Don't use petroleum jelly, hot matches or nail polish remover, which can increase the risk of infection.

The public needs to be aware of those localities in Maine where blacklegged ticks occur as the geographic range of this vector arthropod changes. - Mod.TY
