The information provided by Donald Seedle ["Ehrlichiosis,
canine - Vietnam", promed archive.960318, and the discussion
about canine ehrlichiosis (tropical canine pancytopaenia), has
certainly been of interest to the New Zealand Ministry of
Agriculture.
New Zealand has been reviewing importation policy for cats and
dogs over the last year. The changes have focussed on a review of
rabies safeguards (for acceptable risk countries, moving from
extended quarantine periods to vaccination, rabies antibody titre
confirmation and shorter post-arrival quarantine periods).
Safeguards to prevent canine ehrlichiosis incursion into New
Zealand have also been considered during this review. New Zealand
currently requires all dogs from ehrlichiosis infected areas to
be tested using the indirect fluorescent antibody test for
Ehrlichia canis. Debate recently centred on the appropriate
response to a positive test. Dogs are eligible for entry into New
Zealand after 14 days treatment with doxycycline following a
positive test.
Australia also recently reviewed policy, and currently does not
accept the risk associated with treatment failure for canine
ehrlichiosis. I understand this to have followed several
instances of positive dogs in post-arrival quarantine with
infections seemingly refractory to all treatments, as well as a
review of published information on the efficacy of treatment
against canine ehrlichiosis.
A major factor in setting the level of acceptable risk with
regard to canine erlichiosis safeguards is the presence of the
tick vector (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) in Australia, and not New
Zealand.
Until recently New Zealand also required imported dogs be tested
for Ehrlichia platys (causing canine infectious cyclic
thrombocytopaenia). Problems with the availability of testing for
this organism has led to this requirement being dropped.
