Federation during 1995 to 1997 and 514 cases in 2004. _Trichinella

[Even though wildlife is the main source of infection in the
outbreaks reported above, infected pork is also a risk. The many
outbreaks illustrate that trichinellosis is still a real risk in
Russia and in other former Soviet countries, even when consumption of
wildlife is disregarded. - Mod.EP]
