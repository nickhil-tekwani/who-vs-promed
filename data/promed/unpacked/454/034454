Pennsylvania: Hepatitis A Outbreak Toll Reaches 500
---------------------------------------------------
The number of people infected in a hepatitis A outbreak linked to a western
Pennsylvania restaurant has exceeded 500 and is likely to continue rising
for another week, state Health Department officials said on Sat 15 Nov
2003. Three people infected with the virus have died, and thousands have
lined up for inoculations since the outbreak was reported in early November
among people who ate at a Chi-Chi's Mexican restaurant. A Chi-Chi's
executive said the company had adopted "extraordinary measures"
company-wide, including sickness logs for employees and asking workers to
sign "wellness statements" asserting they are not ill, in an effort to
prevent similar outbreaks elsewhere.
As of Sat 15 Nov 2003, 510 cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed in the
outbreak, said Richard McGarvey, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Health
Department. He said more infections were expected because people who
contract hepatitis A typically do not exhibit its early flu-like symptoms
for 30 days. The state started offering antibody inoculations on 5 Nov 2003
to anyone who ate at the restaurant after 22 Oct 2003. The antibody reduces
the risk of hepatitis A developing, but it must be given within 2 weeks of
exposure. People exposed before 22 Oct 2003 could still start showing
symptoms through next weekend. In severe cases, the virus can lead to liver
failure. Health officials expect the number of new infections to level off
after 22 Nov 2003 and eventually stop, Mr. McGarvey said.
About 8500 people have received the shots because of the outbreak linked to
a Chi-Chi's at the Beaver Valley Mall, about 25 miles northwest of
Pittsburgh. All 60 employees of that restaurant will remain under medical
supervision until each has been cleared, said Bill Zavertnik, chief
operating officer of Chi-Chi's, which is based in Louisville, Kentucky. The
Beaver Valley branch is closed until 2 Jan 2004. Eleven employees who
tested positive for hepatitis A remain under medical care and the rest were
given antibodies, Mr. Zavertnik said.
Health investigators said they still did not know the source of the virus.
They are looking at foods, including green onions, that are difficult to
clean and have been linked to smaller outbreaks in other states. Chi-Chi's
has removed green onions from all of its restaurants as a precaution, Mr.
Zavertnik said.

[At present there seems to be no basis for implicating green onions as the
cause of this outbreak, other than their association with the earlier
state-wide outbreak in southern states. - Mod.CP]
