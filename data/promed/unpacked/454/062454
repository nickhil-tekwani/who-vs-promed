In the past 2 weeks, we have had a few patients returning to Calgary following pilgrimage to Mecca present at our emergency department at Foothills Medical Center. We have had, so far, 2 laboratory-confirmed influenza A cases in patients who were being worked up for (assessment) as MERS-CoV patients.

We are concerned about a possible outbreak of influenza originating in Saudi Arabia with the potential to spread successfully throughout the world.
