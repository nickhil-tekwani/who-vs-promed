Mycobacterium tuberculosis Transmission in a Newborn Nursery and
Maternity Ward --- New York City, 2003
-----------------------------------
Evaluating young children recently exposed to airborne _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ is a public health priority. If infected, children aged
less than 2 years are at high risk for severe tuberculosis (TB)
disease (e.g., TB meningitis) (1). In Dec 2003, infectious pulmonary
TB disease was diagnosed in a foreign-born nurse working in the
newborn nursery and maternity ward of a New York City hospital
(hospital A); the nurse had declined treatment for latent TB
infection (LTBI) after testing positive 11 years earlier. An
investigation including medical evaluation of contacts in the nursery
and maternity ward was conducted by the Bureau of TB Control (BTBC)
at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene,
hospital A, and CDC.
This report summarizes the results of that investigation, which
determined that approximately 1500 patients had been exposed to the
nurse but the majority could not be located for evaluation. Among
those who were tested, 4 infants had positive tuberculin skin test
(TST) results, likely attributable to recent transmission of _M.
tuberculosis_. The findings emphasize the difficulty of conducting
contact investigations in certain settings and the importance of
effective LTBI testing and treatment programs for health care workers
(HCWs) to prevent TB disease and subsequent health care-associated
transmission.
In Dec 2003, a female nurse (nurse A) working in the newborn nursery
and maternity ward at hospital A received a diagnosis of acid-fast
bacilli (AFB) sputum smear positive, noncavitary pulmonary TB
disease. 11 years earlier, nurse A had LTBI diagnosed with a TST
result of 15 mm induration during screening for employment at
hospital A, after emigrating from the Philippines. She had elected
not to take the isoniazid prescribed for treatment. The reason nurse
A gave for declining treatment was that most adults from the
Philippines, where TB is endemic, have positive TST results and
generally do not take treatment for LTBI. She also stated that the
positive TST result might have been caused by her bacille
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination for TB disease at birth or
potential exposures while she was employed as a nurse in the
Philippines. Nurse A had an annual TB symptom screen on 8 other
occasions and had one other chest radiograph (when she began work in
a different area of the hospital) without evidence of TB disease.
Nurse A's symptoms began in Sep 2003 as a productive cough, wheezing,
and shortness of breath. Her initial chest radiograph was interpreted
as "normal heart and lungs" by a radiologist at hospital A. She was
symptomatically treated for asthma with inhaled beta-agonists,
inhaled steroids, oral steroids, antihistamines, and a cough
suppressant. After her symptoms persisted for approximately 8 weeks,
she underwent a chest computed tomography scan (CT) and,
approximately one week later, bronchoscopy. The CT revealed bilateral
upper-lobe disease with volume loss and calcified mediastinal lymph
nodes. The leading diagnosis at the time was hypersensitivity
pneumonitis. Specimens from a transbronchial biopsy, routinely sent
for microscopic examination, revealed rare AFB; culture of bronchial
alveolar lavage subsequently yielded _M. tuberculosis_ that was
susceptible to the 4 first-line anti-TB drugs. Genotyping of the _M.
tuberculosis_ isolate did not match any pattern in the New York City
or national databases. Nurse A subsequently was screened for human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and had a negative HIV test result.
On the basis of nurse A's AFB smear status at start of treatment, her
infectious period was defined as 1 Sep - 29 Nov 2003. Work schedules
and hospital records for all coworkers and patients in the newborn
nursery and maternity ward who were contacts of nurse A during this
period were reviewed to identify and prioritize contacts and to
assess risk factors for transmission. During her infectious period,
nurse A worked 60 night shifts at hospital A and potentially exposed
32 coworkers, 613 infants in the newborn nursery, and 900 patients in
the maternity ward. During a 7-month period, hospital A and BTBC took
the following measures to notify contacts: 1) mailing certified
letters, making telephone calls, and attempting home visits to
hospital patients and to mothers and guardians of all infants; 2)
faxing notifications to all pediatric providers in the area; and 3)
cross-matching the list of exposed infants with names in the city's
immunization registry. All contacts were offered a free medical
evaluation, including a TST; if indicated, contacts also were offered
chest radiography and sputum specimen collection to exclude a
diagnosis of TB disease. Results were reviewed to estimate the extent
of transmission.
Of the 32 potentially exposed coworkers, 25 (78 percent) had a
previously documented positive TST baseline result, and none had
taken treatment for LTBI. On screening, none of these 25 persons had
symptoms for TB; they were offered LTBI treatment, but all 25
declined. TSTs were administered to the remaining 7 coworkers, all
with negative results.
The majority of patients in the maternity ward had received TSTs and
HIV screening during the prenatal period. Extensive outreach by the
hospital and city health department workers resulted in medical
evaluation of 227 (37 percent) of the 613 infant contacts and 216 (24
percent) of the 900 female contacts. None of these contacts were
determined to have TB disease. TST results were positive (induration
larger than 5 mm) for 5 (2 percent) of 227 infants, including one who
had received BCG vaccination during a family trip to the Dominican
Republic. A positive TST result among infants was determined to be
associated with cesarean delivery (relative risk [RR] = 11.8, 95
percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-103.1). TST results of 19 (9
percent) of 216 women with a prior negative test changed to positive
(greater than 5 mm). Change in TST result was associated with foreign
birth among women (RR = 5.9, CI = 1.4-24.5).
No association was evident between a positive TST result or change in
TST result and duration of contact (e.g., estimated time in the
hospital while nurse A was working) or type of contact (e.g.,
receiving direct care) with nurse A.
Of the 900 patients admitted to the maternity ward during nurse A's
infectious period, 807 were admitted for postpartum care and 93 for
gynecologic indications or complications during pregnancy.
Documentation of HIV test results were available for 806 of the 807
postpartum patients; 16 (2 percent) tested positive for HIV
infection. Of these HIV-infected females, 13 delivered infants
admitted to the newborn nursery (12 single infants and one twin
birth).
These 16 women and 14 infants were assigned the highest priority for
follow-up testing. 3 of the women and 7 of the infants were located
and tested for TB; none had evidence of LTBI or TB disease.
BTBC recommended LTBI treatment with isoniazid daily for 9 months for
all contacts with a positive TST result, after TB disease was
excluded. BTBC also recommended LTBI treatment for all HIV-infected
persons exposed to nurse A and infants whose mothers had known HIV
infection, regardless of their TST results, after TB disease was
excluded (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4906a1.htm>).

MMWR Editorial Note
--------------
The findings in this report underscore the difficulty and substantial
resources required to conduct contact investigations and provide
appropriate follow-up for patients exposed to _M. tuberculosis_ in
health-care settings. Despite extensive outreach efforts,
approximately 70 percent of nurse A's patient contacts could not be
traced. Hospital A was located in an economically depressed
community. Hospital records of telephone numbers and addresses for
many of the patients were incorrect. Nonetheless, evidence indicated
that limited transmission of _M. tuberculosis_ had occurred in
hospital A. The strongest evidence of transmission was that 4 infants
had positive TST results (a 5th infant tested positive but had
recently received BCG vaccination), which in children is a sentinel
indicator for recent transmission of _M. tuberculosis_.
In this investigation, the only risk factor significantly associated
with _M. tuberculosis_ transmission to the infants was cesarean
delivery. Post-cesarean infants might have required more nursing
care, thus resulting in more exposure. A major limitation of this
investigation was the incomplete follow-up of all exposed patients.
In addition, the extent of _M. tuberculosis_ transmission to the most
heavily exposed group, nurse A's coworkers, was difficult to
ascertain because 78 percent had positive TST baseline results.
Nurse A underwent bronchoscopy before TB disease was clinically
suspected. Because bronchoscopy is a cough-inducing procedure that
can result in increased transmission of _M. tuberculosis_, diagnosis
of TB disease and microscopic examination of sputum for AFB should be
considered before bronchoscopy (3). CDC recommends avoiding
bronchoscopy if possible for patients with suspected or confirmed TB
disease or postponing the procedure until the patient is determined
to be noninfectious by confirmation of 3 negative AFB sputum smear
results. If the patient cannot produce sputum, CDC recommends
considering sputum induction before bronchoscopy (3).
11 years after her LTBI was detected, nurse A had infectious
pulmonary TB disease diagnosed. An opportunity to prevent TB disease
was missed when she did not complete treatment for LTBI [The report
does not specifically mention any chemopreventative therapy for LTBI
- Mod.LL]. In light of the investigation described in this report,
hospital A began exploring ways to promote LTBI treatment for
employees with positive TST results during annual screenings for TB.
Although the nurse did not have HIV infection, it is the greatest
risk factor for progression from LTBI to TB disease (2). Therefore,
voluntary HIV counseling, testing, and referral should be routinely
offered to all persons at risk for LTBI. Health care settings should
be particularly aware of the need to prevent transmission of _M.
tuberculosis_ in settings where persons infected with HIV might be
encountered or might work.
In 2002, the incidence of TB disease among foreign-born HCWs in the
state of New York was 17.5 per 100 000, compared with 2.0 among
USA-born HCWs (4). During 1998-2002, among 297 HCWs (employed in
hospitals, home health care, nursing homes, and ambulatory care
facilities) who were reported to have TB disease, 221 (74 percent)
had had LTBI diagnosed previously. Of these, 111 (50 percent) had met
criteria for treatment for LTBI, but only 26 (23 percent) of these
received treatment (4). Those data and the circumstances described in
this report support the need for effective LTBI testing and treatment
programs among HCWs, particularly those born outside the USA.
Studies have demonstrated poor adherence to LTBI treatment among HCWs
(5). HCWs might attribute a positive TST result to BCG vaccination
(6). Compared with USA-born physicians, foreign-born physicians in
one USA medical residency program were less likely to recommend LTBI
treatment for themselves, their family members, or recent immigrants
if they had received BCG vaccination (7).
However, in the absence of _M. tuberculosis_ infection, tuberculin
reactivity caused by BCG vaccination wanes over time and is unlikely
to persist longer than 10 years after vaccination (8). Current
guidelines recommend considering treatment for HCWs who have a TST
result of greater than 10 mm, especially if they emigrated from a
country with high TB prevalence during the preceding 5 years (3). A
history of vaccination with BCG should not influence the decision to
treat LTBI.
The proportion of HCWs in the USA who were born outside the country
is growing (9,10). Approximately 25 percent of all USA practicing
physicians graduated from medical schools outside of the country (9).
Moreover, the shortage of registered nurses in the USA is anticipated
to increase from 6 percent in 2000 to 29 percent by 2020, and
foreign-born nurses likely will increasingly be sought to fill this
gap (10). All HCWs in the USA, particularly those foreign-born or
foreign-trained, should be encouraged to follow USA guidelines for
LTBI treatment. Guidelines for preventing transmission of _M.
tuberculosis_ in health care settings, including baseline and
periodic TB screening and effective LTBI treatment programs for HCWs
in high-risk settings, should be followed (3). In addition,
infection-control programs in health care settings should implement
interventions to increase adherence to treatment for infected HCWs
working in high-risk settings. On-site, directly observed preventive
therapy is one such option.

A New York City maternity ward nurse who had infectious tuberculosis
exposed as many as 1500 patients to the disease over 2 months in
2003, and most likely infected at least 4 infants, according to a
joint investigation by the city's health department and the CDC.
More than 1000 of the patients the nurse came in contact with could
not be found, the CDC said. It is not clear whether any of them
contracted the disease, but city health officials say they have all
the patients' names and are watching TB registries to see if they
appear. The CDC says it believes that transmission was limited.
So far, the only patients known to have been infected are the 4
infants, who were treated and are now healthy, city health officials
said. So is the nurse, whose identity was not revealed.
While the agency declined to name the hospital, health officials
confirmed that it was the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center.
Dr. Kenneth G. Castro, director of the Division of Tuberculosis
Elimination at the CDC, said New York was fortunate to have a health
department with an active tuberculosis control program, because if
the infection of the 4 infants had not been detected, the number of
those who caught the disease could have grown exponentially. Still,
the case underscores the difficulty of providing appropriate
follow-up care for patients exposed to TB in hospitals and other
health-care settings.
Infectious tuberculosis can be treated with an aggressive and
extensive drug treatment regimen, but it is essential that the
regimen be followed precisely and the disease diagnosed early. The
case also highlights a challenge that increasingly worries
public-health officials: screening and treating foreign-born
health-care workers for tuberculosis.
Most people with latent tuberculosis never develop the more deadly
form of the disease and therefore are unlikely to submit to the
9-month course of medication treatment requires. In fact, a recent
survey by the department found that fewer than 1/4 of health care
workers eligible for TB treatment actually receive care. Still,
scares like the one at Bronx-Lebanon are very rare.

[Early trials of tuberculosis chemoprevention were carried out using
isoniazid between 1955 and 1964. The studies were performed in the
USA as well as Denmark, Tunisia, Kenya, Japan, the Netherlands, and
the Philippines. An extensive monograph by Ferebee published in 1970
(1) reviewed the data, which showed by treatment with isoniazid
greatly reduced -- but not completely prevented -- the incidence of
clinically apparent TB as compared with placebo. Its use is based on
this reduction balanced against the risk of hepatotoxicity, which can
be severe enough to result in the need for liver transplantation (2).
Given the observations that the amount of use of this therapy in
health care workers is not substantial and the treatment is not
completely preventative, it is vitally important for the health care
worker individually to seek medical care and diagnosis for any
respiratory illness lasting more than 1-2 weeks or so. Because of
the risk of risk of TB and a variety of other respiratory diseases,
this should be the case whether the individual is known to be
tuberculin-reactive or not. In this case, the index case was
symptomatic for 8 weeks and even when seen with a history of a known
reactive tuberculin test, the diagnosis was not suspected. Even when
a CT scan showed upper lobe volume loss in a patient with a known
reactive tuberculin test, the diagnosis was not suspected.
It is fortunate that the infants found did not have progressive
infection, although it is certainly possible that morbidity and
mortality occurred among the large number of infants and mothers lost
to follow-up.
