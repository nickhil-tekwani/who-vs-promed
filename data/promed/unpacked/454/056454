An epidemic of yellow fever rages in the north of Cote D'Ivoire, with
12 cases confirmed today [Thu 24 Dec 2009], causing the government
and the World Health Organization (WHO) to launch a vaccination
campaign, it was learned today from an official source.

An unexpected epidemic in the Denguele region, declared by the WHO
and the Ivorian authorities in mid-November 2009, was extended in
this area and old savanna region (in the far north, bordering on
Mali), stated the Ivorian Minister of Health and WHO in a joint
statement. "Right now, 36 suspected cases, of which 12 are confirmed
by Institute Pasteur of Cote D'Ivoire, were reported, with 19
deaths," he stated.

"With the technical and financial support from WHO, the Ministry will
vaccinate about 300 000 people in the region of Denguele from 26-31
Dec 2009 to prevent the spread of the epidemic and to protect persons
not [yet] affected."

The major proportion of cases are fatal. Yellow fever is a disease
caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes.

[Epidemics of yellow fever are often unexpected. A few weeks ago,
ProMED-PORT reported on cases of yellow fever in Senegal. This was an
error; the cases were in Sierra Leone. - Mod.JLS]

[This is a further report of the continuing yellow fever outbreak
that emerged in the Denguele region in November 2009. One hopes that
the rapid response of the Ministry of Health will halt transmission
and the outbreak.
