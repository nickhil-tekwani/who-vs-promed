[The report on the 2 cases of WPV1-associated disease in Pakistan is confirmation of the earlier media report posted on ProMED-mail (see Poliomyelitis update (21): global (Nigeria), Pakistan 20190321.6379811). A disturbing addition is the 15 positive environmental samples reported from Pakistan with dates of collection 27 Feb 2019 to 12 Mar 2019 from sites located in all 4 provinces of the country, signaling continued widespread circulation of the WPV in Pakistan. Further discomforting information is that since the beginning of this year (1 Jan 2019) there have been a total of 65 environmental-positive samples in Pakistan, whereas in the entire year last year (2018), there were a total of 140 positive environmental samples. It is possible that this is good news and represents enhanced environmental sampling (remembering the 2 adages: "Seek and ye shall find," or its corollary, "Don't look, and it ain't there." Or perhaps this is not-so-good news that this year (2019) has more circulation of the WPV1 in the country. Time will tell. Do read the media report below to get a feel for the huge effort ongoing in Pakistan to interrupt transmission, as well as some of the obstacles faced in the country.

Further disconcerting information in the above report is the continued identification of cVDPV2 in Nigeria, with 2 newly confirmed cases: 1 in Kwara (a relatively new state reporting transmission) and 1 in Borno state, where there had been WPV1 circulating in 2016. The key concern here is the persistent presence of a susceptible population that facilitates the circulation of the cVDPV2.

Hopefully the absence of reports of additional cases of cVDPVs in other countries where cases have been identified in the past year is a reflection of good control measures implemented, leading to interruption of transmission of the cVDPVs.

[2] Vaccination campaign postponement: Pakistan - media report
Date: Tue 26 Mar 2019

The Levies and Khasadar personnel in several tribal districts boycotted duty during the anti-polio campaign on Monday [25 Mar 2019].

They vowed to continue the boycott till acceptance of their demands. The Levies and Khasadar personnel in the merged districts anonymously announced to boycott security duty during the anti-polio drive. The decision was made in a meeting of core committee of both the forces in all merged district. The Khasadar and Levies personnel have presented a 22-point charter of demands to government.

The boycott forced the health department to postpone the scheduled 3-day campaign against polio in several areas of Bajaur tribal district. Sources said that senior officials of the local administration and the health department earlier did not take the decision regarding boycott by personnel of both forces seriously, and termed pressure tactics for acceptance of their demands.

However, they said that senior officials held a meeting with the representatives of both forces on Sunday evening [24 Mar 2019] but failed to persuade them to provide security to the teams of vaccinators. The health department and World Health Organisation showed concerns over postponement of the anti-polio drive in several localities of the district.

In the Mohmand tribal district, Levies and Khasadar forces boycotted polio duty to pressurise the government to accept their demands. In parts of Safi tehsil, security forces provided security to polio teams, while in the rest of 7 tehsils, the campaign was postponed. The Levies and Khasadar personnel also staged a protest in Ekkaghund in favour of their demands and rejected extension of the police system to tribal districts. In Orakzai, Levies and Khasadar forces also boycotted polio duty. They threatened to continue the boycott till acceptance of their demands.

In Khyber, the authorities started vaccinating Afghans of all ages at the Torkham border as part of the global polio eradication initiative and the country's emergency action plan to stop poliovirus transmission into its territory from across the border.

An official at a ceremony held at Torkham border said that travellers of all ages and genders would be vaccinated against polio alongside provision of a health card to them by the health teams of both countries with the sole purpose of timely interrupting poliovirus circulating in the regions on both sides of the border.

They said that poliovirus mostly infected children below the age of 5, but adults could also act as carriers of the virus. "All-age vaccination is a step forward and an effective way to put an end to poliovirus movement across the border," they said.

The countrywide 3-day anti-polio campaign was launched in 3 subdivisions of Khyber on Monday [25 Mar 2019] amid the Khasadar and Levies boycott of providing security to the health teams. The administration deployed personnel of Frontier Constabulary to provide security to the teams of vaccinators.

In Lakki Marwat, several children of reluctant parents were immunised against polio on the 1st day of the 3-day campaign started on Monday [25 Mar 2019]. The deputy commissioner visited rural localities when field staffers informed him that parents were not willing to get their children vaccinated. He monitored the anti-polio drive in Tajazai, Ghaznikhel, Jabukhel, and other rural localities.

In Lower Dir, the 3-day drive against polio was started in all parts of the district. The deputy commissioner and district health officer inaugurated the drive by administering anti-polio vaccine to children below 5 years. Both officials paid a detailed field visit to monitor the drive.

The deputy commissioner urged the health workers to put in their efforts to eradicate poliovirus in the region. He said that the campaign would be made a success by adopting a reward and punishment policy.

[This media article was included to illustrate both the massive effort underway in Pakistan to meet the goal of polio eradication along with the challenges the country faces. Violence targeting polio-vaccination teams and individuals has been an unfortunate occurrence in Pakistan, necessitating security details to accompany teams in the field. The above-mentioned striking workers are security details that have been working to protect the polio vaccinators. The geographic area affected by these striking individuals is in the Tribal Areas, where security is a major concern. - Mod.MPP]
