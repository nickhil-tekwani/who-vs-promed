VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVER PRECAUTIONS
===================================
[see
Lassa fever - Sierra Leone (07) 970502155227]

From: "Jon Rosenberg M.D. C" <HW1.JROSENBE@HW1.CAHWNET.GOV>
I appreciate Dr. McClain's comments, and would like to continue the
discussion only to the extent to indicate and expand upon these separate
issues:
(1) what "special isolation precautions (barrier nursing) were being
referred to and used in Sierra Leone for Lassa fever patients;
(2) what precautions have been recommended for the management of patients
with suspected viral hemorrhagic fever by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) in the United States;
(3) what evidence exists for airborne transmission of viral hemorrhagic
fever (VHF) viruses.
.........
(1) The note to which I directed my comments referred to "special isolation
precautions (barrier nursing) in Sierra Leone." Barrier nursing is not a
term in common use here, presumably involves gloves and gowns and other
barriers, and may not involve the use of surgical masks to prevent
transmission by airborne droplets, which are large-particle droplets (>5
microns) generated from a source person primarily during coughing, sneezing,
talking, or during the performance of certain procedures such as suctioning
and bronchoscopy. Large-particle droplets do not remain suspended in the air
and generally travel only short distances, usually 3 feet or less, through
the air. Special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent
droplet transmission, which is assumed to be the mode of transmission for
invasive H. influenza type b disease, invasive N. meningitidis, diphtheria,
Mycoplasma pneumonia, pertussis, pneumonic plague, influenza, mumps,
Parvovirus B19 and rubella (CDC 1996: Guideline for Isolation Precautions in
Hospitals, published in Am J Infect Control and Infection Control and
Hospital Epidemiology).
Barrier precautions, in contrast, presumably refer to what the Guidelines
now call Standard Precautions, which include the use of those barriers
previously incorporated under Universal Precautions or Body Substance
Isolation, which are used to prevent transmission of bloodborne viruses
including hepatitis B and HIV, and Contact Precautions, which call for the
use of gloves and other barriers with any skin-to-skin contact.
Airborne precautions are restricted to agents transmitted by airborne
droplet nuclei and include measles, varicella, and tuberculosis.
I have no direct information on the precautions used in Sierra Leone but
suspect that they do not include patient placement in negative air pressure
isolation rooms and the use of respirators. Perhaps a ProMED-mail
correspondant can inform us to what extent the precautions used there are
"special' and differ from those used routinely.
(2) Existing CDC guidelines for management of patients with suspected VHF
are not decisive on the need for respiratory isolation. The above cited
Guideline of Isolation Precautions in Hospitals indicates that Contact
Precautions are indicated, but with a footnote that "state health
departments and CDC should be called for specific advice about management of
a suspected case." In "Update: Management of Patients with Suspected Viral
Hemorrhagic Fever- United States" MMWR 1995;44:475) it is stated:
"Epidemiologic studies of VHF in humans indicate that infection is not
readily transmitted from person to person by the airborne route. Airborne
transmission involving humans has never been documented and is considered a
possibility only in rare instances from persons with advanced stages of
disease (e.g., one patient with Lassa fever who had extensive pulmonary
involvement may have transmitted infection by the airborne route). In
contrast, investigation of VHF in nonhuman primates (i.e., monkeys) has
suggested possible airborne spread among these species."
The recommendations include "Patients in a hospital outpatient or inpatient
setting should be placed in a private room. A negative pressure room is not
required during the early stages of illness, but should be considered at the
time of hospitalization to avoid the need for subsequent transfer of the
patient ... Caretakers should use barrier precautions .... For patients with
suspected VHF who have a prominent cough, vomiting, diarrhea, or hemorrhage,
additional precautions are indicated to prevent the possible exposure to
airborne particles that my contain virus. Patients with these symptoms
should be placed in a negative-pressure room. Persons entering the room
should wear personal protective respirators as recommended for care of
patients iwth active tuberculosis."
Although in my initial response I was referring to the precautions used in
Sierra Leone, I apologize for not citing these more stringent, conservative
recommendations for use in the United States.
(3) The evidence for airborne transmission of VHF, as evidenced in the above
citation, is extremely limited. In the study of Jaax et al (Lancet
1995;346:1669) two of three control monkeys that did not have direct contact
with experimentally inoculated monkeys became infected. These monkeys were
located about 3 feet away from the inoculated monkeys, and in the words of
the authors "pulmonary, nasopharyngeal, oral, or conjunctival exposure to
airborne droplets of the virus had to be considered as the most likely mode
of infection." Thus, the evidence for airborne transmission is primarily
limited to this one laboratory occurrence, and could have been limited to
large-particle droplets for which surgical masks rather than
negative-pressure rooms and respirators would suffice for protection.
Admittedly, in the rare event of management of a patient with suspected
viral hemorrhagic fever in the United States it will be prudent to place
that patient in a negative-pressure isolation room, if one is available. At
the same time, it would be helpful if observations during current and future
outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever could shed light on the potential for
these pathogens to be transmitted via droplets in air, and over what distances.
