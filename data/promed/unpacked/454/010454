Excessive rainfall in parts of [Tamil Nadu] has worried farmers, who are afraid of a crop loss. Crops such as black gram and green gram were vulnerable to such a situation. Hence, the farmers would face a minimum of 50 per cent crop loss.

P. Murugesan, Southern Dry Land Farmers' Association, said that 'yellow mosaic', a virus disease, had started attacking black gram and green gram. Hence, the farmers need guidance in preventing pest attack, he added.

[The local terms black (_Vigna mungo_) and green (_V. radiata_) gram refer to different types of mungbeans which are important food legumes in the region.

The problems mentioned above are likely to be due to _Mungbean yellow mosaic virus_ (MYMV; genus _Begomovirus_) or _Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus_, the most serious problem of mungbean on the Indian subcontinent. These viruses cause yellow leaf mosaic and thin pods on the crops in southern Asia and can also affect other legumes such as soybean, cowpea and pidgeonpea. They are transmitted by whiteflies and vector numbers are likely to have increased with the reported humid conditions above. Vector control may help to limit further spread. Several local viral strains are known to exist which may vary in host preferences and/or induced symptoms. For resistance breeding of crops it is important to know which strains are present in a location.

However, similar symptoms may also be caused in _Vigna_ spp. by other viruses, including _Bean yellow mosaic virus_, _Bean common mosaic_ (both genus _Potyvirus_, aphid transmitted) and _Bean golden mosaic_ (_Begomovirus_, whitefly transmitted). Molecular methods are needed for reliable diagnosis.
