----------------------------------------------------------------------
A potentially ambitious and, I hope, ultimately successful effort by
Defra to control bovine tuberculosis [bTB] in badgers as part of the
overall effort.

I can, however, see it being a relatively hard road to tread given
the polarization of views relating to management of the wildlife
vectors of livestock-mediated zoonotic diseases.

I am not fully conversant with bTB in badgers, but wonder whether an
'age-based' culling strategy may also be applicable -- viz. cull the
aged badgers, vaccinate the young, tag them all, and revisit them
systematically over time to repeat the process. Age-based culling
strategies have been a quite effective way to rapidly reduce the
prevalence of shedding-transmitting cases in a number of susceptible
species, thereby enabling a less than perfect (intradermal +/-
serological) test and slaughter program (or any other partially
effective counter-measures) to progressively get ahead and stay ahead
of the natural re-infection rate. On pure cost-benefit when dealing
with replaceable livestock species, it is probably not as effective
as de-stock and repopulate, but arguably the next best option
initially, and badgers are not readily replaceable livestock.

My understanding, however, with regard to badgers is that they often
become infected relatively early in life and may progress to shedding
and being infectious for other in-contact susceptible species quite
quickly compared to many other Tb susceptible species -- would be
happy to stand corrected on that.

[The bTB experience in the Pacific region includes the eradication of
_Mycobacterium bovis_ in Australia (last occurrence in 2002), and the
recent advances in its control in cattle and farmed deer in New
Zealand. The latter has required several decades of efforts,
including tackling infected feral Australian brush-tailed possums
(_Trichosurus vulpecula_), a main _M. bovis_ reservoir in several
regions of New Zealand. To address this problem, both population
control measures and vaccination have eventually been applied.

Dr Thomson probably refers mainly to possums as "other Tb susceptible
species" (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090325.1160). - Mod.AS]

[In brush-tailed opossums, bovine tuberculosis is usually a
fulminating pulmonary disease that typically lasts 2 to 6 months. In
the final stage of the disease, animals become disoriented, cannot
climb, and may be seen wandering about in daylight. In contrast, most
infected badgers have no visible lesions and can survive for many
years. In symptomatic badgers, bovine tuberculosis is primarily a
respiratory disease. Perhaps a plan to watch for signs of respiratory
disease in older badgers may be of use. - Mod.TG]
