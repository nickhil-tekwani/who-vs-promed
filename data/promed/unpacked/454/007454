A 2nd coyote has tested positive for rabies in Addison county, a week and a half after a rabid coyote attacked an elderly couple in Salisbury.

[The couple] were walking on their Salisbury property on the morning of [1 Apr 2019] when they were attacked. [The man] reportedly kicked the coyote in the head, but when it continued to attack him and his wife, he retrieved a shotgun and shot and killed the animal at point-blank range. The couple, both in their 70's, were treated at Porter Medical Center in Middlebury, where they received rabies shots, and were treated for bites on their arms and legs.

The 2nd infected coyote was found later in New Haven following reports of aggressive behavior. No one reported being bitten by the animal.

[The 76-year-old woman], told the Times Argus the coyote "just came out of nowhere" as the couple was leaving their barn and headed back to their house, which they have owned for 50 years.

Louis Porter, commissioner of the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department, said they suspect both coyotes were infected by skunks, based on the smell around the areas where the animals were found. Porter said they are running tests to determine exactly what strain of rabies the coyotes had, but that it's common for skunks to be infected by raccoon strains, so it might be hard to know for sure where the rabies came from.

The viral disease is deadly, and infects mammals, including humans, according to the Department of Health. Coyotes can live in all Vermont habitats, including suburban areas. The release noted that raccoons, skunks, and other wildlife might also be sick and capable of spreading the disease.

Porter said it's "quite rare" to see coyotes with rabies, especially 2 within a relatively short distance of each other. Coyotes are smart and know to avoid animals acting strangely; however, it's not common for coyotes to get bitten when they kill a skunk.

The Department noted that these are the 1st coyotes to test positive for rabies at the Health Department Laboratory since 2005. Porter said one reason rabies remains uncommon is because the USDA and Agency of Agriculture work together to drop rabies vaccines in rural areas to stop the spread of the disease.

Rabies is spread through the bites of infected animals, and can only be transmitted through an open cut, or mucous membranes like the mouth or eyes. The Department noted that petting or handling animals or animal waste does not spread the disease.

"There's no reason for people to be afraid to go in woods or be outside," Porter said. "This is very rare, and even if people do come into contact, the post-exposure vaccine is very effective. And coyotes play an important part in ecosystem in Vermont, there's no reason for people to fear them."

In North America, rabies is maintained by bats and wild carnivores. The variant of terrestrial rabies present along the east coast is maintained by raccoons, and this strain is called the raccoon rabies variant (RRV) (see https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html). While RRV is predominantly maintained by raccoons, other carnivores may become infected, for instance skunks, gray foxes, red fox, coyotes, cats, and dogs. - Mod.PMB]
