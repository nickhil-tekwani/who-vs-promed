Norwalk-like virus probably caused illness at pre-"Oscar" ceremony
------------------------------------------------------------------
LOS ANGELES: A disease that spreads through food infected with sewage
pollution likely was probably responsible for a mystery illness that
overcame at least 100 guests at a pre-"Oscar" ceremony earlier this month,
public health officials said. The event at the Regent Beverly Wilshire
Hotel in Beverly Hills on 2 Mar 2002 honored scientific and technical
achievement in cinema. About 500 people attended the dinner and awards
presentation. Days afterward, dozens of guests began complaining of
vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. The illness lasted several days in most
cases. Stool specimens from some of those infected revealed that
Norwalk-like virus, a common infectious agent that causes gastroenteritis,
[was the cause of the illness, according to Dr Lauren Mascola, head of
infectious diseases for the Los Angeles County Department of Health.
Investigators are unsure how the virus spread. Mascola said: "We haven't
narrowed it down to a particular food item or determined what caused this
outbreak. Unfortunately, we don't always find out what happened."
Norwalk-like virus traditionally spreads through food tainted by fecal
material, often shellfish infected by raw sewage pollution in the ocean or
meat tainted by stool from sick food handlers. Investigators don't believe
the outbreak resulted from deliberate contamination and said it does not
seem to be the result of faulty preparation at the hotel.

[There are other modes of transmission of Norwalk-like viruses in addition
to those described for specific outbreaks of limited extent such as
originally in Norwalk and subsequently at other sites in the USA as
exemplified by the above report. The Norwalk-like viruses are a
heterogeneous group, and there may be distinct predominant modes of
transmission. Outbreaks of "winter vomiting" are common in Europe and are
something of an emergent disease. Readers are referred to previous posts on
ProMED-mail for further discussion of this topic. - Mod.CP
