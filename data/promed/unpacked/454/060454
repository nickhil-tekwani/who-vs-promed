A quarantine on cattle in the county has been extended by a month to contain an outbreak of anthrax. Agriculture Executive Paul Mbuni said movement of animals would remain banned to give veterinary officers time to wipe out the disease.

He told traders who were demanding the re-opening of animal markets to be patient, adding that the disease was still in some parts of the county [Vihiga county, in the former Western Province]. "Traders selling cattle will have to wait for another month as the department intensifies the anti-anthrax vaccination campaign. I want to assure farmers that the government will deal with the disease." He said areas that had been hard hit by the disease included parts of Hamisi and Luanda sub-counties.

"Veterinary officers are in the field visiting farmers and vaccinating their animals. We are doing the exercise in collaboration with ward administrators, chiefs, and their assistants because they are close to the affected farmers," he said. Mbuni also pointed out that he was impressed with the response after the vaccination drive was launched in villages. He urged farmers to report any cases of anthrax to his office for quick action to be taken.

The county last month [May 2018] banned movement of cattle following the outbreak. Last week [week of 11 Jun 2018], traders appealed to Governor Wilber Ottichilo to intervene and have the ban lifted, claiming the disease had been contained. They said the closure of all animal markets in the county was hurting their businesses.

[The local veterinary service is clearly following the correct policy of ensuring that all the cattle get checked and vaccinated. Even with microchipping individual animals and a modern computerised surveillance system it would be difficult to ensure that all the animals in a village had been vaccinated if movement was allowed. A few weeks of inconvenience is worth the benefits gained from vaccination. Vihiga county is small, 563 sq km [about 217 sq mi], which means that its borders are close as are its neighbours, and the risks immediate.
