Advantages of Horses as Sentinels
---------------------------------
I would like to encourage state officials to consider utilizing their
native equine populations for surveillance purposes. Chickens have failed
as sentinels. Confirmed wild bird deaths appear to be the best indicator at
least of infected birds in an area, but relying on the public to report is
not reliable and may reflect such factors as (human) population density and
level of public education rather than true extent of viral activity.
Mosquito trapping and testing is also problematic, with positive mosquito
pools seeming to correlate fairly well with human risk but positive results
not necessarily predating human cases.
On 4 occasions in 2000, a horse symptomatic with West Nile virus infection
was the first evidence of viral activity in an area - no previous positive
birds, mosquitoes, sentinel chickens or humans. Serological surveying of a
state's native horses has advantages in that: - cost is low (blood
collection and testing only); - the horse is the most susceptible domestic
species - more horses documented as infected (and symptomatic) this year
than any other mammalian species - more than all other mammalian cases
combined; - the horse is highly attractive to mosquitoes and normally kept
under management conditions (outside or in non-screened barns) that
maximize risk of exposure; - the horse represents an interface between
feral conditions and suburban/urban; - a large percentage of the equine
population will rarely, if ever, travel outside the state - or even outside
the county or home farm.
Seroconversion or rising titers in equines that are permanent residents
would constitute de facto evidence of infected mosquitoes. The horses would
efficiently target areas for focused activity such as mosquito collections
to determine species involved, etc.
Horses represent a considerable financial, time and often emotional
investment for their owners and contribute significantly to the economics
of their region. Horses are at the highest risk for fatality should they
become infected, and may also run a higher risk of clinical disease with
infection than other mammalian species, including humans. I believe
actively targeting native populations for serological surveillance offers
many benefits for both monitoring officials and the equine community.

[The high frequency of clinical disease following infection with West Nile
virus would probably be the greatest advantage of the use of horses as
sentinel animals. On the other hand, the distribution of horses may not
reflect human population density closely enough for accurate assessment of
risk of human disease. - Mod.CP
