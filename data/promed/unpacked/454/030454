----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mention was made [in ProMED-mail post Streptococcus group A, scarlet
fever - China (02): (HK,MO) 20110623.1918] of an on-going varicella
outbreak [at the SA Tin Ka Ping Kindergarten in Sha Tin, Hong Kong,
that the boy who died attended]. Streptococcal (and staphylococcal)
secondary cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis and/or toxic shock are
recognized as potentially fatal complications of chickenpox. Clues to
such complications are fever that persists beyond the 1st few days or
that worsens or returns after initially resolving, increased erythema
around or purulent discharge from varicella lesions, or the
development of a sandpapery or blanching sunburn-type rash. Is it
known how many of the other cases have been associated with varicella
infections? Since the incubation period for varicella can be up to 3
weeks (4 if the child has received immunoglobulin) it might be
necessary to close the involved schools for more than one week.

[Dr Lenoir raises several interesting and important points about
scarlet fever and chickenpox (varicella). It is likely that the
varicella outbreak in the Hong Kong kindergarten is occurring among
children who have not been vaccinated against varicella or who have
only received a single dose. The varicella vaccine is a live,
attenuated vaccine. Two doses are recommended; the 1st dose is
administered at 12 to 15 months and a 2nd dose at age 4-6 years. For a
discussion of chickenpox, see ProMED-mail post: Chickenpox, children -
India: (AS) 20110511.145.

A varicella outbreak that occurred in 2004 in a Beijing primary
school affected about 80 per cent of children in one preschool
classroom. (Huilai Ma, Fontaine R. Varicella outbreak among primary
school students --- Beijing, China, 2004. MMWR 2006; 55(SUP01); 39-43,
April 28 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su5501a10.htm).
High attack rates of chickenpox (40 per cent to 80 per cent) occurred
in classrooms from which students with rash were not sent home
immediately. Prompt isolation was associated with lower attack rates.
Although the Chinese Food and Drug Administration licensed the
Oka-strain varicella vaccine for children aged over 12 months in 2003,
but varicella vaccine was not included in national or provincial
vaccination programs. A major obstacle to widespread varicella
vaccination in China was said to be the high cost of this vaccine. To
stop this outbreak, investigators recommended both prompt isolation at
home of pupils at onset of their rash and varicella vaccination.

The authors concluded, "Universal vaccination at school entry might
be the only reliable method of controlling varicella. In addition to
preventing deaths, vaccination might also reduce hospitalizations from
other varicella-related complications. More parents would be likely to
have their children vaccinated if they understood the effectiveness of
vaccine and the consequences of varicella illness. A stronger policy
to encourage varicella vaccination in schools in China should be
developed. Careful assessment of the cost of vaccine compared with the
cost of disruption of school activities would be valuable in assisting
provinces, educational authorities, and individual schools in
developing a vaccination policy."

The following is extracted from the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention recommendations for control of a varicella outbreak
(CDC. Prevention of Varicella. Recommendations of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 2007; 56(RR04); 1-40.
Available at
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5604a1.htm#tab1):

"Varicella vaccination is recommended for outbreak control. Persons
who do not have adequate evidence of immunity should receive their 1st
or 2nd dose as appropriate. Additionally, in outbreaks among
preschool-aged children, 2-dose vaccination is recommended for optimal
protection, and children vaccinated with one dose should receive their
2nd dose provided 3 months have elapsed since the 1st dose. State and
local health departments may advise exposed persons who do not have
evidence of immunity to contact their health-care providers for
vaccination, or they may offer vaccination through the health
department or school (or other institutions) vaccination clinics.
Although outbreak control efforts optimally should be implemented as
soon as an outbreak is identified, vaccination should be offered even
if the outbreak is identified late. Varicella outbreaks in certain
settings (e.g., child care facilities, schools, or institutions) can
last as long as 4--5 months. Thus, offering vaccine during an outbreak
might provide protection to persons not yet exposed and shorten the
duration of the outbreak. Persons receiving either their 1st or 2nd
dose as part of the outbreak control program may be readmitted to
school immediately. Those vaccinated with the 1st dose as part of
outbreak control measures should be scheduled for the 2nd dose as age
appropriate. Persons who are unvaccinated and without other evidence
of immunity who do not receive vaccine should be excluded from
institutions in which the outbreak is occurring until 21 days after
the onset of rash in the last case of varicella. In addition, for
school-aged persons covered by the 2-dose school vaccination
requirements, exclusion during an outbreak is recommended for those
vaccine recipients who had received the 1st dose before the outbreak
but not the 2nd as part of the outbreak control program. Persons at
increased risk for severe varicella who have contraindications to
vaccination should receive VZIG within 96 hours of exposure."
