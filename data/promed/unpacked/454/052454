The General Department of Preventive Medicine under the Ministry of Health warned of a hand-foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the country.

Tran Dac Phu, head of the Department of Preventive Medicine said since early in 2014, the country has had over 17 400 hand-foot-&-mouth cases in 62 out of 63 provinces and cities. The most cases are in Ho Chi Minh City with nearly 2700 cases, an increase of 29 percent; the Southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau with over 1100 cases, an increase of 34 percent; Ca Mau province in the southern tip of Viet Nam with 940 cases and the highlands province of Kon Tum at 112 cases. Phu said hand-foot-&-mouth disease takes place all year round and its peaks often are in March to May and September to December.

This disease starts with a fever, poor appetite, a vague feeling of being unwell (malaise), and sore throat. The sores are often in the back of the mouth. The rash is usually on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; it may also appear on the knees, elbows, buttocks, or genital area. Most of cases are slight. However, the disease may cause some fatal complications including viral or "aseptic" meningitis, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), or acute pneumonia. The biggest difficulty is that there currently is no vaccine against the disease.

The Ministry of Health warned people to observe strict personal hygiene including washing hands with soap usually after and before meals and after going to the toilet. People must eat well cooked food and pasteurize [sterilize] all handkerchiefs, dishes, spoons, and toys. Schools and day care centers have to disinfect toys, floors, and tables.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is a generally mild viral infection caused by a variety of viruses in the enterovirus family. However, more serious episodes have occurred in epidemic form in the Far East, primarily caused by enterovirus 71 rather than one of the coxsackie viruses. - Mod.LL]
