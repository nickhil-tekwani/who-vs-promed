2000/171 Situation of several quarantine pests in Germany in 1999 and 2000
[edited]
----------------------------
The German NPPO recently informed the EPPO Secretariat of the following:
Pepino mosaic potexvirus [PepMV] (EPPO Alert List) was found in Thuringen
on [tomato transplants from the Netherlands growing under glass]. Fruit
symptoms occurred on _Lycopersicon esculentum_ cv. Clarence. Leaf symptoms
were observed on cvs Starfighter and Tradiro, without any impact on yield.
[PepMV] was detected serologically, and even symptomless samples had high
virus concentrations. [The entire production area (10 ha) was disinfected
and all tomato plants were burned].
Present: only in some areas of one state (Thuringen) in protected cultivation.
Plum pox potyvirus [PPV] (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was found in June 2000
in Thuringen, a state [previously considered free of] the disease. It was
found in a nursery, during a routine inspection for the issuance of [a]
plant passport, on 2000 plants (_Prunus domestica_) in containers that had
previously been imported from Hungary. [PPV] was detected on the basis of
symptoms and its presence was confirmed by ELISA tests. No other symptoms
were observed in the nursery and its surroundings. All infected plants
were destroyed. It is assumed that this finding is [associated with] the
[importation] of [plants already infected]. In Germany, plum pox potyvirus
is present in many areas where host crops are grown.
