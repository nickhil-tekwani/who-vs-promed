A Utah County woman has died from [a] hantavirus [infection], prompting health officials to warn Utah residents to take precautions with potential rodent infestations. The Utah County Health Department described the woman as between the ages of 18 to 44 years old with no other apparent health issues. She was the 2nd person to die from hantavirus pulmonary syndrom (HPS) this year in Utah.

Hantaviruses are spread through the urine, droppings and saliva of infected rodents. People typically contract the virus by inhaling [small particles floating in] air that are contaminated; it also can be transmitted when people are bitten by infected rodents or touch objects or eat food that has been contaminated.

People may be at particular risk in previously-vacant buildings, while housekeeping, or while camping and hiking, the department warned. Anyone working in areas with signs of rodent droppings or nests should spray the area with disinfectant and wait 15 to 20 minutes before cleaning, Clegg said.

Early symptoms of hantavirus infections include fatigue, fever, and muscle aches, as well as headaches, dizziness, chills and abdominal pain. An infected person may experience coughing and shortness of breath 4-10 days after the 1st signs of illness, as the lungs fill with fluid, the department wrote in a press statement.

HPS is fatal in more than 1 in 3 of all reported cases; surviving patients likely will make a full recovery. Anyone with symptoms and who has been exposed to rodents should seek medical help immediately.

Health officials are urging the public to reduce risk of HPS by following protocols dubbed "Seal Up, Trap Up and Clean Up":

- air out closed-up buildings before entering;
- trap mice until they are gone;
- do not sweep rodent droppings into the air, where they can be inhaled. Instead, wear gloves and soak the droppings with bleach before picking them up with paper towel. Then clean and disinfect the whole area. For heavy infestations, use gloves, goggles, protective clothing and a respirator;
- do not store hay, wood or compost piles near homes;
- remove junk piles;
- tightly store all food, pet food, trash and animal feed to prevent rodents from accessing it, and do not leave pets' food and water where mice can reach it;
- seal holes inside and outside of homes;
- keep grass and shrubbery well-trimmed;
- elevate hay and trash at least 1 foot off the ground.

[This is the 2nd case and fatality in Utah due to HPS (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160603.4264532). The 1st one occurred in May of this year (2016). The specific hantavirus involved in this and the previous case is not reported. Most likely it is Sin Nombre virus. Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in the western USA, including Utah. The spring and summer seasons often bring sporadic cases of hantavirus infections, as cabins and other buildings unused over the winter are opened up and cleaned in the western USA. Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir host of the virus and shed it in feces, urine and saliva. Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate associated with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Prompt medical attention is essential.
