Skunks blamed for rabies outbreak in township
-----------------------------------------------
Six adults may have come in contact with infected livestock at 2 farms
Public Health officials have confirmed 4 animals in Woolwich Township
have tested positive for rabies, the 1st cases of the disease to hit
the region this year [2007].
The infected animals, which were found on 2 farms in Woolwich
Township, included 2 cows, a horse and a skunk. All the animals have
been destroyed.
Six adults who may have come in contact with the infected livestock
at 2 different farms are being treated with rabies shots as a
precaution, said Curt Monk, manager of Public Health Protection for
the Region of Waterloo.
The source of the outbreak is being attributed to rabid skunks in the
north end of the township. The owners of the rabid animals said both
cows and the horse were exposed to a wild skunk before they fell ill,
Monk said. "Rabies is endemic in the wildlife population," he said.
"Right now, we are experiencing an increase in activity specifically
around Woolwich Township and the increase seems to be concentrated in
the skunk population."
While this particular outbreak happened in north Woolwich, the threat
isn't isolated in that area, he said. "People need to exercise
caution around wild animals no matter what part of the region they
are in," he said.
Skunks, raccoons and foxes are the animals primarily responsible for
spreading rabies in Ontario, which was once known as the "Rabies
Capital of North America," because of the high number of reported
cases in the province.
But efforts to combat the disease in the last 15 years have largely
proved successful. The number of cases have fallen by 95 per cent
since 1992, and there hasn't been a report of infection with the
raccoon-strain of the disease in nearly 2 years, according to the
Ministry of Natural Resources.
Both the vaccination of domestic animals and baiting programs -- in
which bait-covered rabies vaccine is dropped in high risk areas --
have largely brought the problem under control in the fox and raccoon
population, said Adam McAllister, of the Ministry's rabies research
and development unit.
Despite these efforts, one rabies carrier still poses a problem. "The
challenge of dealing with rabies anywhere in North America is largely
dealing with skunks," he said.
While any mammal can carry any strain of the disease, the Arctic Fox
strain, also carried by the red fox, is most commonly found in skunks
in southern Ontario, he said.
STOPPING RABIES
Here are some tips to help stop the spread of rabies:
Ensure all pets, even ones that stay indoors, are vaccinated.
Don't let your pet roam free, and keep them indoors at night.
Remove all outdoor food sources that could attract wild animals.
Be cautious around unfamiliar pets and wild animals.
If you think your pet is sick, call your veterinarian.
If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, wash the wound
immediately, call a doctor or go to the emergency room and report the
bite to your local public health officials.

[There are adequate vaccines for horses, cattle, most livestock and
certainly our companion animals. This illustrates the need to
vaccinate farm animals as well. It is very cheap insurance to prevent
human exposure. - Mod.TG]
[More information on the strain of rabies involved would be of
interest, as well as the control measures that have lead to the
marked reduction in rabies cases in Ontario. - Mod.MPP]
