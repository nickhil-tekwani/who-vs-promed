Bird flu has hit 2 more poultry farms in southern Viet Nam, forcing
the slaughter of hundreds of geese last week, animal health officials
in the communist country said Wednesday [2 Jan 2008].
More than 600 of the birds were culled after the virus killed several
geese in 2 flocks in Da Loc commune of Tra Vinh province, where an
outbreak was also reported earlier in December 2007, the Animal
Health Department said.
Viet Nam's government has warned of a higher risk of avian influenza,
as the northern winter months favor the spread of flu viruses and
ahead of February's [2008] Tet lunar New Year, when travel and
poultry consumption go up.
A 4-year-old Vietnamese boy died of bird flu on 16 Dec 2007, becoming
the country's 5th victim of the H5N1 strain in 2007 and the 47th
since late 2003, when bird flu 1st hit the Southeast Asian country.

The H5N1 bird flu virus has been detected in another poultry farm in
northern Bangladesh, forcing authorities to cull nearly 300 chickens,
officials said on Wednesday [2 Jan 2008].
The latest infection was at Dinajpur town, 410 km (250 miles) from
the capital, said Salehuddin Khan, director of the government's
livestock department.
Bird flu was 1st reported near the capital in March last year [2007]
and has since spread mainly to northern districts, forcing
authorities to kill more than 300 000 chickens.
Since March 2007, 69 farms in 20 districts have been infected with
the H5N1 virus.
There are around 150 000 poultry farms in Bangladesh, with an annual
turnover of USD 750 million, officials said.
About 4 million Bangladeshis are directly or indirectly associated
with poultry farming, but so far, there have been no cases of human
infection in the densely populated country, government and health
officials say.
