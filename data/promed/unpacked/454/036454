SSO disease (_haplosporidium costale_) in Canada
----------------------------------------------
Emergency report
Information received on 26 Mar 2003 from Dr Brian Evans, Executive
Director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa:
Report date: 24 Mar 2003.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: early 2003.
Estimated date of first infection: unknown.
Location/ number of outbreaks
Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, province of Nova Scotia (Atlantic coast)/1
Northern Cape Breton, province of Nova Scotia (Atlantic coast)/1
Description of affected population: American oysters (_Crassostrea virginica_).
Diagnosis: SSO infection was found in samples collected as part of the MSX
survey [A preliminary, histology-based survey to determine the distribution
of MSX disease in _Crassostrea virginica_ oysters throughout Atlantic
Canada; see the 2 references. - Mod.AS].
A. Laboratories where diagnosis was made:
- The presumptive diagnosis was made by the Shellfish Health Unit, Gulf
Fisheries Centre (Fisheries and Oceans Canada), Moncton, province of New
Brunswick.
- Diagnosis was confirmed by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science,
United States of America (OIE Reference Laboratory for MSX and SSO diseases).
B. Diagnostic tests used: histology and PCR.
C. Causal agent: _Haplosporidium costale_.
Epidemiological details:
- No deaths have been associated with these infections, which were so light
that it required PCR confirmation to determine haplosporidian and species
identity.
- There is no evidence of proliferation or spore formation to date.
- SSO is not a human health concern.
- This is the first report of this parasite in Canadian American oysters.
Cases of abnormal mortality and oysters destined for live transfer between
Atlantic provinces are routinely examined histologically by shellfish
health pathologists at the Gulf Fisheries Centre laboratory (Fisheries and
Oceans Canada) in Moncton, province of New Brunswick. No evidence of SSO
has been detected in any of these investigations over the last 15 years.
- Additional samples from Gulf New Brunswick oysters will be checked for
both SSO and MSX using PCR and histology.
Control measures: the Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans and
provincial authorities have been notified. SSO identification will not
change any of the precautionary controls put in place for MSX disease in
the Atlantic Region in November 2002.

[Haplosporidiosis, one of the 5 diseases of molluscs which are notifiable
to the OIE, is caused by 2 protistans of the phylum Haplosporidia:
_Haplosporidium nelsoni_, commonly known as MSX (multinucleate sphere X)
and _H. costale_, commonly known as SSO (seaside organism).
_H. costale_ is reported in Long Island Sound, New York to Cape Charles,
Virginia, USA, causing seasonal mortality between May and June.
The Haplosporidium spp. life-cycle is unknown, but an intermediate host is
suspected. For further details, see CHAPTER 3.1.2. in OIE's Diagnostic
Manual for Aquatic Animal Diseases - 2000
