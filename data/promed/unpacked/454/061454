As of 21 Sep 2015, a total of 558 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Poona have been reported from 33 states. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: Alaska (12), Arizona (95), Arkansas (8), California (120), Colorado (17), Hawaii (1), Idaho (20), Illinois (8), Indiana (2), Iowa (1), Kansas (2), Kentucky (1), Louisiana (4), Minnesota (29), Missouri (9), Montana (14), Nebraska (5), Nevada (11), New Mexico (27), New York (5), North Dakota (3), Ohio (2), Oklahoma (12), Oregon (17), Pennsylvania (2), South Carolina (8), South Dakota (1), Texas (24), Utah (46), Virginia (1), Washington (18), Wisconsin (29), and Wyoming (4).

Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from 3 Jul 2015 to 11 Sep 2015. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 99, with a median age of 16. 52 percent of ill people are children younger than 18 years. 54 percent of ill people are female. Among 387 people with available information, 112 (29 percent) report being hospitalized. 3 deaths have been reported from Arizona (1), California (1) and Texas (1).

Investigation Update
--------------------
CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory conducted antibiotic resistance testing on clinical isolates collected from 6 ill people infected with one of the outbreak strains. Of the 6 isolates tested, all (100 percent) were susceptible to all antibiotics tested on the NARMS panel. CDC's NARMS laboratory continues to conduct antibiotic resistance testing on additional clinical isolates collected from ill persons infected with the outbreak strains. Results will be reported when they become available.

ProMED awaits more information regarding the scope of this substantial and still growing multistate outbreak. Since cucumbers, like cantaloupes that have been associated with _S._ Poona infections, grow on ground vines, they are even more susceptible to contamination by pathogen-containing irrigation water. The exact method of contamination related to this outbreak, however, is unclear. - Mod.LL
