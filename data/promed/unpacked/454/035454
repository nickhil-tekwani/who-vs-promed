Croatia bans pigs imports from countries with swine disease
-----------------------------------------------------------
ZAGREB: Croatia banned, Fri 10 May, the import of pigs and pork products
from Romania, Bulgaria and Luxembourg due to outbreaks of classical swine
fever in those countries.

The agriculture ministry said it was also banning the transit of those
products through the country in hopes of preventing the spread of the
disease, which is highly contagious and can be fatal for infected pigs. The
disease does not affect other animals or humans.

The ministry, citing the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), said
the disease has surfaced recently in the Romanian region of Arada, several
areas in Bulgaria and in Luxembourg.

The European Union banned imports of pigs from Luxembourg in February. At
that time, Luxembourg said it had quarantined the affected farms and
imposed a ban on pig transports in and around the country.
