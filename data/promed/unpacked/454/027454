No fewer than 922 463 residents of Enugu State will be vaccinated in the ongoing yellow fever vaccination in 3 local council areas with confirmed cases. Dr George Ugwu, executive secretary, Enugu State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (ENS-PHCDA), told newsmen yesterday [19 Nov 2020] that the councils included Igboeze North (333 551 residents), Nsukka (398 094), and Isi-Uzo (190 818), adding that the number represented 85% of the entire population in the affected local councils.

He said that the state had enough stock of the yellow fever vaccines for the vaccination and had fully trained and mobilised vaccinators to the Primary Health Centres (PHCs), special outreach centres, as well as house-to-house approach. Besides, Ugwu stated that the massive vaccination was meant for people between the ages of 9 months and 44 years, adding that everyone within the age range would be expected to receive the vaccination in the 3 councils. He said after vaccination in the affected local councils, the exercise would be extended to about 10 neighbouring councils before the vaccination of the entire state.

"There is no need to panic or send the wrong information; the government is in control of the yellow fever outbreak clinically and has taken the right and appropriate steps to see that our people are protected," he said. "Already the agency has continued to engage in robust community mobilisation, sensitisation, health education, and promotion. Also, the state government has fully mobilised and continued with fumigation of the Ette community and its environs as well as all other communities directly affected in the outbreak.''

Ugwu expressed appreciation for Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi's personal concern and timely intervention, which had led to the control and robust capacity to tackle the outbreak.

[It appears that the local health authorities are ready to initiate the yellow fever (YF) vaccination campaign and expand vector mosquito control efforts. This is timely, since the YF outbreak has been expanding into new localities over the past 2 months. Although insecticide fumigation may reduce the vector mosquito population short term, the vaccination campaign is the most effective measure to halt the outbreak. - Mod.TY
