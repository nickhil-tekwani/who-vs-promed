Four workers to undergo 'Nipah' test
------------------------------------

Four people here believed to be infected with the Nipah virus will be
transferred to the Sarawak Hospital in Kuching for a thorough medical
examination. State Assistant Minister for Public Health, Dr Soon Choon Teck,
said the two farm workers and two abattoir workers had shown symptoms of the
disease. According to the State Health Department the four had developed
antibody against the virus after they were infected. Dr Soon, who visited
them at the hospital here on Saturday, dismissed rumours that one of them
was suffering mental distress. He said they were worried that their families
might face financial difficulties, adding that the Welfare Department was
looking into ways to help them.

State Veterinary authorities have decided to cull some 600 pigs from another
farm at KM18, Jalan Oya, as some of the animals there were reported to have
fallen sick. A similar exercise to destroy more than 4500 animals from two
other pig farms owned by the same operator [at Jalan Oya entered its fourth
day yesterday. The farms were among 15 which were placed under quarantine
for suspected Nipah virus. Tests conducted in Australia from the blood
samples were found to be negative and the government lifted the quarantine
order for eight of the farms. Decision on the remaining farms is expected to
be made after the results from the tests conducted on their owners, workers
and family members are known.

Further comment on the current situation in Sarawak
---------------------------------------------------
The current situation in Sarawak is that three farms with over 5000 pigs in
Sibu have been culled due to "exposure" to the Nipah virus. The authorities
apparently [have adopted the following main criteria (among others) to
require culling of affected farms: (1) Samples of pig serum testing
positive to both ELISA (done in the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) and
SNT tests (carried out in Australia); (2) Farm workers or owners living
in/near farms detected with positive IgM titres. Any of the above
conditions would result in the order to cull with financial relief provided
by the government in line with those provided in Peninsular Malaysia.
For the farming community, the situation has [become confused by the fact
that samples considered positive by ELISA test in Malaysia have been scored
negative by SNT in Australia. Whether there is any problem in the
processing or handling of the samples prior to despatch to Australia is
something no one wants or is ready to answer. How good are the ELISA tests
done by UNIMAS and VRI? Although these tests are undertaken [according to
the guidelines of CDC and CSIRO, have they been properly validated? How
specific and sensitive are the ELISA (IgM or IgG) tests used for screening?
Are there any publised report or authorities that can be cited? Although
acceptable for surveillance or monitoring, can ELISA tests (or serial
positive ELISA tests) be used as the basis or culling? The VRI is carrying
out PCR and immunoperoxidase tests on samples obtained from some of the
farms in Sarawak. Early indications are that viral antigens similar to
Nipah virus has been identified in samples obtained from Sibu farms. Up to
this moment no clinical signs has yet been seen in the pigs in farms where
the initial ELISA tests were positive and where workers/owners tested
positive with IgM titres. Should the pigs in farms in this category be
culled? Should we wait until we are sure that the "viral agent" does cause
clinical disease in pigs and human? It is understandable that the
authorities should choose to err on the side of caution and in the overall
interest of human health. However,the impact of [such decisions, if the
policies of the Federal government are followed, are not only going to
cause great financial hardship and emotional distress in the pig farming
community, but they may be a blow from which the pig industry here may
never recover. Comments, proposals and directions are welcome by a farming
community under great stress.

[The situation regarding Nipah virus infection in Malaysia remains unclear.
The second post raises legitimate doubts about the scientific basis for some
of the government of Malaysia's interventions. These two postings have been
held up briefly to see if further clarification would materialize.
Unfortunately the situation remains unclear: as yet there appear to be no
confirmed cases of human or animal disease. - Mod.CP
