Republic Blood Transfusion Centre enmeshed in hepatitis C scandal
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A group of parents of children with leukemia who became infected with
hepatitis C declared that the Republic Blood Transfusion Centre was
responsible for transfusing contaminated blood to their children. The
administration of the Transfusion Centre has responded that there were no
deficiencies in their work and they will take appropriate steps to confirm
this. The parents' group claims that about 150 children acquired hepatitis
C infection because the donors were not tested properly by the Republic
Blood Transfusion Centre. The director of the centre stated that their
diagnostic test systems are the latest currently available anywhere in the
world and one of the most advanced in the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent
States], and that all donor blood was tested properly. In addition, he said
that samples from all the blood donations are still available and they will
be re-tested. The director expressed readiness to defend the centre's
reputation and an internal investigation is under way. However the parents'
group demands that the attorney general and the police participate in this
investigation.

[In 2007 a court in Kazakhstan found 21 medical workers guilty of causing a
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) outbreak, which resulted in the deaths
of 10 children. At least 119 children and babies contracted HIV infection
after receiving treatment in hospitals in Shymkent in southern Kazakhstan.
The judge said that the accused had acted recklessly, and that corruption
and malpractice led to the outbreak.

The investigation established that the outbreak had begun in the previous
year (2006) and concluded that many children had received unnecessary and
often multiple blood transfusions, and that medical equipment was often not
sterilised properly.

It is unclear whether these cases of hepatitis C virus infection in
leukemic children in Almaty are a consequence of faulty medical procedures
or have been highlighted by a group of parents seeking legal compensation.
However, the transmission of hepatitis C virus only, and not other common
bloodborne infections such as HIV, suggests that there may have been
deficiencies in the screening of blood donors for hepatitis C virus infection.
