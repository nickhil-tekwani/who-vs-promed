At least 38 people have fallen sick after being exposed to anthrax
contaminated beef in Shahjadpur upazila of Sirajganj. The people were
affected after they came into contact with beef. Some of the victims
might have eaten the contaminated beef, District Health Department said.

Two medical teams from Dhaka visited the area on Friday [20 Aug
2010], reports our Sirajganj correspondent.

Local sources said 2 sick cattle were slaughtered at Chithulia
village on 27 Jul 2010, and the beef was sold among the villagers at
a cheap rate. The affected villagers went to the local upazila health
complex from where the civil surgeon's office raised the alarm.

[One can only hope that this may result in the annual vaccination of
the cattle in this and adjoining villages over the next 3 years. Such
preventive proactive action is significantly cheaper than handing out
antibiotics after such an event and treating the sick in hospital. - Mod.MHJ]
