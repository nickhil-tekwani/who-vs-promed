The Ministry for Primary Industries has confirmed another farm has tested positive for the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_ bringing the total number of infected properties to 21.

The ministry said 13 of them are in Canterbury, 6 are in Southland, one is in Hawke's Bay and one - the latest - in Middlemarch, in Otago.

The disease, which can cause lameness, mastitis and abortions in cows, is spread through nose-to-nose contact.

South Island cattle breeders had to withdraw their entries from last week's [week of Sun 28 Jan 2018] New Zealand Dairy Event in Feilding because of fears it could spread the disease.

The disease was 1st detected in July last year [2017] on a farm in the Waimate district in South Canterbury.

[New Zealand is currently involved in a survey to determine if they pursue eradication of this disease, or manage it. They expect some positives in their survey, and there is substantial more survey work to be done before a determination as to a course of action is determined.
