Bovine TB discovered in South West France
-----------------------------------------
On a farm in Ariege in the Southern of France, bovine tuberculosis
(bovine TB) has been detected on a farm. The 83 animals on the farm
have been culled as a precaution. 12 other farms in the area are under
supervision.

The authorities have informed the farmers about the disease and the
precautions in the region during a meeting in Maz d'Avil. The
suspicion dates back to April [2010] when one of the animals appeared
to have [lesions], as shown during a routine inspection at the
abattoir. However, it took several weeks before the authorities could
definitively say it concerned bovine TB.

The prefect -- the regional representative of the state -- offered all
affected farmers all possible help and assistance. In addition, both
the prefect as a representative of the regional meat organization
emphasized that there is no danger to public health.

In France, an average of 30 cases of the disease is detected per year.
Bovine TB is common in Great Britain. Thousands of farms in England
and Wales are affected and every year thousands of animals are culled.

[The slaughter of all(?) 83 bovines on the affected farm seems to be
in line with France's policy regarding bovine tuberculosis. It will be
interesting to note if the organs of the culled animals have been
examined, how many of them may have been found affected, and how old
were the lesions. The final results of the epidemiological
investigation into the origin of infection -- in France or elsewhere
-- is anticipated with interest; it may include examinations of other
species on the affected premises, such as domestic cats and dogs. It
will be also interesting to obtain data on the breed/type of the
affected (dairy or beef?) cattle.

According to France's annual OIE report for 2009, the disease is
present in certain regions.
