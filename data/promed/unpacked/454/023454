An outbreak of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, related to shellfish, has been declared following 9 confirmed cases in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. "As Public Health continues to investigate the specific cause of the outbreak, I am advising all New Brunswickers to ensure that they obtain shellfish and other seafood from a licensed establishment or harvest shellfish from fishing zones which are currently open by Fisheries and Oceans Canada," said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. "Cook all shellfish such as mussels, oysters and clams thoroughly before eating."

_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is commonly associated with the consumption and handling of raw shellfish such as oysters, clams, and mussels.

The confirmed cases have been reported in the northern and eastern parts of the province. New Brunswick typically averages 2 to 3 cases of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ a year.

"New Brunswickers are encouraged to enjoy healthy seafoods such as clams, mussels, and oysters but should be aware that warmer temperatures may increase the risks of bacteria in these foods," said Russell. "The risk of food poisoning can be minimized by following some simple food safety guidelines such as washing your hands before and after handling these foods; store raw shellfish and seafood at 4 deg C (39 deg F) in the refrigerator or on ice before cooking and refrigerate leftovers promptly."

_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ are a naturally occurring bacteria in sea water. The bacteria can grow in shellfish such as clams, oysters and mussels when seawater temperatures are warmer such as in summer months. Handling or eating raw or undercooked shellfish can result in illness. Symptoms usually appear within 12 to 24 hours after a person becomes infected. Most people who become ill have diarrhea, but they can also have headache, nausea, vomiting and fever. Symptoms usually last less than a week. The illness is not spread from person to person.

[_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ causes a gastrointestinal illness, primarily with diarrhea.

It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ spp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is commonest in warmer waters such as those of, in the western hemisphere, the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska, and British Columbia, accentuated by global warming, can also be associated with shellfish-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Indeed, eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in its name may decrease eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the northern hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the old adage is not very helpful anymore. - Mod.LL
