A respiratory virus affecting children in many areas of the country has now been confirmed in South Dakota. The state health department says 7 of the samples sent in tested positive for enterovirus D68. All of the cases were west of the Missouri River, and those hit with the virus ranged in age from 11 months old to 19 years old. The previously uncommon EV-D68 can be serious for infants, children and teenagers, particularly children with asthma.

29 states and the District of Columbia now have a total of 213 confirmed cases of enterovirus D68, the severe respiratory illness that typically targets children, US health officials are reporting. Officials said the 29 states are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Utah, Washington and West Virginia.

So far, all the cases have involved children, except for one adult, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Enterovirus D68 is part of the family of viruses that includes the common cold. It can sometimes require hospitalization, especially for children with asthma. More cases will be confirmed in the coming weeks because the testing for enterovirus D68 is complex and can only be done by the CDC and a small number of state-run laboratories, the CDC said. The 1st cases were diagnosed last month [August 2014] in Midwestern and Western states.

Enteroviruses are common in September as kids head back to school, with an estimated 10 million to 15 million people infected each year. But doctors believe this particular type of enterovirus is causing more severe cases than in the past. The virus is also hard to track because it causes symptoms similar to many other infections, including the common cold, according to health experts. It is important that we follow common sense rules to prevent the spread of this virus, as we do for flu and other contagious illnesses," New York state acting Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said in a statement. "Because there is no specific treatment or vaccination against this virus, our best defense is to prevent it by practicing proper hygiene."

Illness associated with the enterovirus D68 infection typically lasts about a week. Antibiotics won't work against a virus, and there is no antiviral treatment available for enterovirus D68, health officials said.

The CDC is asking doctors and public health officials to consider enterovirus D68 as a potential suspect if widespread respiratory illnesses start occurring in their communities. Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told HealthDay that good hygiene is the best defense against a child catching Enterovirus D68. "Hand washing is paramount, and teaching kids not to touch their faces with unwashed hands is the point," Horovitz said. "Any child or adult with flu-like symptoms or common cold symptoms should be seen, evaluated and followed by doctors for any respiratory complications." The virus tends to "produce severe shortness of breath in children who may not have asthma. Therefore, children with asthma must be watched closely by doctors if they contract the virus," Horovitz said.

[No new features of significance have been reported. Enterovirus D68 remains associated with childhood disease except for very few older children and a single adult so far. The virus is no longer restricted to the Midwestern US and is likely to be identified throughout the whole of North America as diagnostic capability becomes generally available. It would be interesting to have information of the enteroviruses detected where enterovirus D68 appears to be absent or still rare. - Mod.CP
