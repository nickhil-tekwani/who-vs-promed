[1] FAO call for alertness during Qingming festival

Call to stay alert for influenza A(H7N9) in China
-------------------------------------------------
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) urges people to stay alert for influenza A(H7N9), especially in light of the upcoming Qingming festival on 5 Apr 2014, which is celebrated in China and some of its neighbouring countries and will last approximately 3 days. The festival, which is a yearly family event for honouring ancestors, is predicted to correspond to an increase in the purchase, slaughter and consumption of poultry as people may travel back to their hometown to celebrate with their families.

Even if reports on influenza A(H7N9) have declined in recent world news, there is a need to remain cautious with the increased evidence that the H7N9 virus continues spreading in poultry in China. Furthermore, human cases are still being reported, with over 30 percent of human infections having a fatal outcome. According to figures from the World Health Organization (WHO), in the 2nd and currently ongoing wave of H7N9 there are already twice as many reported human cases as compared to the 1st wave, which lasted from February 2013 to June 2013.

Even though the traditional winter influenza season is now coming to an end and the number of reported human H7N9 cases is expected to continue declining, an overview of last year's [2013] sequence of events, when the H7N9 virus 1st emerged in China, shows that human infections continued to be reported even after the Qingming festival, which is usually celebrated at the beginning of April. FAO and other United Nations agencies such as WHO consistently emphasize the importance of good biosecurity and hygiene practices to reduce risks to animal health and human health. These can be found in the latest publication on 'Addressing Avian Influenza: Risk Management Along the Food Chain' (see at http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3609e/i3609e.pdf), which includes crucial information on measures to mitigate the spread of H7N9 in poultry, such as implementing routine live bird market rest days, regularly cleaning markets and reporting sick or dead animals to the local veterinary or public health services. Human exposure to zoonotic pathogens, including H7N9, can further be minimized by following good hygiene practices, from avoiding the slaughter of animals in non-dedicated professional areas (e.g., at home) to washing hands before and after preparing food and eating only well-cooked meat products.

Because the influenza A(H7N9) virus creates a 'silent' infection in birds, it is not possible to know whether a bird is sick or not unless it is tested for the virus by submitting samples to a laboratory. This is one of the reasons why the 1st official notification of the H7N9 virus being detected in a farm, rather than a live bird market, dates only very recently to 18 Mar 2014 in Zhuhai, China [ProMED-mail archive no. 20140326.2358899; see comment]. Timely detection of the virus in poultry farms is further challenged by difficulties encountered when attempting trace back of the virus from positive live bird markets to the farms from which the infected birds might have been sourced. Such investigations are facilitated by implementing poultry traceability systems, including source and trader registration at market level.

Both WHO and FAO stress that human cases of infection with avian influenza H7N9 virus are expected to continue to be reported as long as the virus is circulating in birds. With the knowledge that influenza A(H7N9) is still circulating in poultry in China, continued vigilance and monitoring is therefore essential. In addition to live bird markets, farms in high-risk areas should be routinely investigated through risk-based surveillance and laboratory testing. Areas at highest risk of an H7N9 incursion are those that have live poultry trade links with, or directly border on, affected areas. The spread of the virus in poultry populations will be facilitated in areas where poultry density is high and trade networks are extensive. More information can be found in FAO's H7N9 Risk Assessments issue no. 1 (http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3598e/i3598e.pdf) and issue no. 2 (http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3631e/i3631e.pdf).

[2] Analysis of H7N9 test results

China Ministry of Agriculture Publishes H7N9 Test Results
---------------------------------------------------------
As the current (2nd) wave of human cases of infection with avian influenza H7N9 appears to be waning, we take a look at some interesting information about the extent of infection in birds in China.

We were recently made aware by a ProMED posting that the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture publishes H7N9 test results [see in commentary to posting 20140326.2358899]. These reports are headed "National Animal H7N9 bird flu monitoring". The reports have been published monthly since April 2013, and since January 2014 they have been published 3 times each month.

The reports show, by province, the number of sites, samples and positive results for serological surveillance and pathogen monitoring. Serological testing measures prevalence; the positives indicate infection at some time. Pathogen testing measures incidence: the positives indicate current infection.

We have collated the data and done some initial analysis. It's interesting to note that:

1. Between April 2013 and March 2014, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture performed 1.4 million tests for H7N9.

2. Of these, 440 were serologically positive and 116 pathogen positive.

3. Serological positives peaked in September to November 2013 and were highest in Shandong, Hunan and Qinghai.

4. Pathogen positives peaked in December 2013 and were highest in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Shanghai.

5. Generally where there were no positive results at all; there have also been no human cases reported (except for Beijing, which had no positives but 2 confirmed human cases).

There are many more questions raised than answered by this data; for example, what type of sites were included -- farms or live bird markets; and what species were tested -- wild birds, chickens, ducks? It is clear that avian influenza H7N9 is widespread in certain provinces of China and will continue to pose a threat to humans that come into close contact with infected birds.

[H7N9 infection in birds has, so far, remained subclinical, humans becoming the sentinels of the virus circulation. The most recent graph of the disease incidence in humans since the start of the event in the 8th week of 2013, "Number of confirmed human H7N9 cases by week as of 11 Mar 2014", is provided by the WHO in its periodic report No 15, available at http://tinyurl.com/pdvebn7.

China's 1st report on H7N9 in a commercial poultry farm was reported to the OIE on 24 Mar 2014 addressing a farm near Zhuhai in Guangdong province. This farm was visited and tested because it was identified as the origin of a chicken imported to Macau and found there to be H7N9-infected on 12 Mar 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140323.2351275).

The H7N9 situation in China and its control policy have been recently described and discussed, in a video conference, by China's Vice Minister of Agriculture, Yu Kangzhen (see, in Chinese, at http://www.moa.gov.cn/sjzz/syj/dongtai/201403/t20140320_3823171.htm). Interestingly, he referred -- on top of the need to reduce the risk of virus transmission to humans, also to "reducing the risk of the spread of the virus from the live bird markets to poultry farms," stating that "according to monitoring reports from the national agricultural sector, the current H7N9 virus remains mainly in the field of live poultry markets, the virus not bring detected in poultry farms." According to our understanding (depending on accuracy of machine translation), he said also that surveillance and epidemiological investigations should include the poultry farms.

As mentioned in the analysis, by New Light Intelligence, of China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) H7N9 surveillance data (item 2 above; gratefully acknowledged), and indicated in the commentary to posting 20140326.2358899, the data published by China's MOA do not specify the source of the samples tested; no information is available on active H7N9 surveillance on farms in China. Such information, if available, will be welcomed.
