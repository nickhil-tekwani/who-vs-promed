Avian influenza virus in pigs - An update
Following OIE's press release of 22 Aug 2004, the Veterinary Authorities of
the People's Republic of China have at the request of the OIE, provided
additional details concerning the isolation of H5N1 strain of influenza
virus in pigs.
They have confirmed that one H5N1 strain was isolated in 2002 from
materials collected from pigs in the Fujian province in 2001. Subsequently,
1936 samples were collected in 2003 from pigs in 14 provinces including
Fujian and again one H5N1 strain was isolated from that province. These 2
isolates have been subjected to detailed analysis and have been shown to be
highly homologous to the duck-derived H5N1 virus isolated recently in birds
in China.
According to the Chinese authorities, no variation in the virus has been
observed. More recently, as part of their ongoing epidemiological
surveillance programme, 1.1 million samples including 4447 from pigs have
been collected and analysed between April and August 2004 from 10 provinces
including Fujian, and no infection from H5N1 has been detected in pigs.
The above findings do not at this stage indicate any major evolution
regarding H5N1 infection in pigs.
However, the OIE wishes to insist on the necessity for Member Countries
affected by avian influenza to increase their epidemiological surveillance
to better understand the implications of the existence of H5N1 virus in pigs.

[We hope that OIE's call for greater emphasis on swine influenza is
accepted by all members, not just in the letter of the regulation but also
in its spirit. FAO has also highlighted this need by emphasizing the need
for sub-regional surveillance networks (see 20040827.2401 below).
Calls by OIE, FAO and WHO for a greater focus on the status of H5N1 in
swine are entirely appropriate but should be accompanied by a reminder that
transparency of results and particularly publication of data is crucial
when a significant new finding affecting the epidemiology of the influenza
virus comes forth. The salient feature of transparent reporting systems is
not only that everyone in the world knows what is going on, but they know
it in a timely fashion. Clearly in this case timeliness was an issue, as
many of these isolations occurred a few years ago [see the comments of
Mod.CP in 20040822.2330 below].
The H5N1 virus appears to have evolved in China. We must study its
evolution and epidemiology wherever and whenever the disease occurs.
Chinese scientists will be the leaders in this effort, but the results must
be open to scientists everywhere. Publications like the one Chen and
Webster submitted to the National Academy of Science in the USA are very
helpful in this regard, as they are immediately accessible to a wide
spectrum of scientists all over the world. Clearly, scientists from outside
China should pay better attention to Chinese journals such as the Chinese
Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine (see 20040822.2330) as well --
even if they have to get help with articles published in Chinese.
Since the SARS epidemic, China has made significant strides in
transparency, as evidenced by a surveillance program testing 1.1 million
samples since April and the publications cited above. The problem in this
case -- as in many other situations with a potentially explosive disease in
a reservoir host -- is that findings of the H5N1 virus in pigs does not
mean that there is a clinical epidemic in pigs, in production facilities or
on small farms, which is a point with which Chinese agricultural
authorities are obviously concerned.
Until the data from these virus isolations -- and, more importantly, future
surveillance information on H5N1 in swine now being gathered -- are
incorporated into regular and detailed surveillance reports, questions will
linger. This situation is too important to both human and animal health
authorities worldwide for any unnecessary unanswered questions. For
example, Dr. Marty Zaluski of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture
wanted to know the significance of the results given; we didn't know
whether the swabs were from nasal or tissue swabs. Mod.AS had a similar
query in 20040823.2345. Transparency means providing the salient details --
and with this virus, the more we know, the better prepared we can be. - Mod.PC]
