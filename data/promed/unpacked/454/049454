[According to a media report, "the disease was found in 2 dead wild boars that may have crossed the border into the Zlin region of the country. Representatives of Czech State Veterinary Administration (SVS) have been inspecting 2 farms near Zlin that keep 5000 pigs. If domesticated pigs catch the disease, they have to be put down. A 10-km [6.21 miles] zone around Zlin has been cordoned off. In the zone, wild boars must not be hunted or fed, and hunters must actively seek and report dead wild boar. Breeders must report all the pigs on the farm and manage them to avoid them getting in touch with feral pigs." http://china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2017-06/28/content_41108799.htm

The following is an abstract from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the epidemiological analyses of African swine fever in the Baltic countries and Poland, published on 23 March 2017 and available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2017.4732/full

Abstract:
--------------
"African swine fever virus (ASFV) has been notified in the Baltic countries and the eastern part of Poland from the beginning of 2014 up to now. In collaboration with the ASF-affected Member States (MS), EFSA is updating the epidemiological analysis of ASF in the European Union which was carried out in 2015. For this purpose, the latest epidemiological and laboratory data were analyzed in order to identify the spatial-temporal pattern of the epidemic and a risk factors facilitating its spread. Currently, the ASF outbreaks in wild boar in the Baltic countries and Poland can be defined as a small-scale epidemic with a slow average spatial spread in wild boar subpopulations (approximately from 1 in Lithuania and Poland to 2 km/month in Estonia and Latvia). The number of positive samples in hunted wild boar peaks in winter which can be explained by human activity patterns (significant hunting activity over winter). The number of positive samples in wild boar found dead peaks in summer. This could be related to the epidemiology of the disease and/or the biology of wild boar; however, this needs further investigation. Virus prevalence in hunted wild boar is very low (0.04-3 percent), without any apparent trend over time. Apparent virus prevalence at country level in wild boar found dead in affected countries ranges from 60 percent to 86 percent, with the exception of Poland, where values between 0.5 percent and 1.42 percent, were observed. Since the beginning of the epidemic, the apparent antibody prevalence in hunted wild boar has always been lower than the apparent virus prevalence, indicating an unchanged epidemiological/immunological situation. The risk factor analysis shows an association between the number of settlements, human and domestic pigs population size or wild boar population density and the presence of ASF in wild boar for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania".
