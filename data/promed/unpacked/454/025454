A total of 7 people, including a child, died from this pneumonic plague between [25 and 30 Aug 2021], according to a Russian media report citing the local Ministry of Health. 3 patients died in a medical facility, the rest of the disease was diagnosed during a postmortem examination. Currently, 22 patients are being treated.

Cases of pneumonic plague are concentrated near the capital, in the center of the island. According to the source, the last time pneumonic plague was recorded in 2017.

The disease is fatal, but curable if treated in time.

If the infection reaches the lungs, this poses a great threat to others, since there is an active release of the pathogen into the external environment of microbes for the spread of others. On the first day of the lung disease, chills, headaches, discomfort in the lower back, limbs, weakness, nausea and vomiting, redness and puffiness of the face, fever up to 38-41 deg C [100.4 to 105.8 deg. F], a feeling of compression in the chest, difficulty breathing, anxiety, and rapid pulse can occur. In the agonal period, shallow breathing and pronounced weakness are noted. A weak cough is recorded, the sputum contains streaks of blood and a significant amount of plague microbes.

Plague is an endemic disease in Madagascar that appears every year. According to the Pasteur Institute, the country accounts for 75% of all cases of diseases worldwide.

Plague infections in Madagascar have been relatively quiet since the dramatic outbreak in 2017.

The following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al. Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998;4(1):101-4, PMID: 9452403; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm:

"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However, since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45% of all the cases of plague in Africa."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node that drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the "black plague," and also may spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission. Not all initial cases of plague pneumonia occur with a preceding bubonic phase and when the lung infection spreads from person-to-person, there is no bubonic stage. - Mod. LL
