NEW US RULES PROPOSED FOR TRANSPORTING PATHOGENS
==================================================

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has proposed new
rules that will impose additional requirements on facilities that ship or
receive (interstate, or intrastate between different facilities) certain
infectious agents "capable of causing substantial harm to human health."
The facilities covered are laboratories operated by government agencies,
universities, research institutions and commercial entities.
Among other obligations, a facility would have to register with the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, or with other organizations
authorized by the Secretary of HHS, and affirm that it meets the appropriate
level of biosafety for pathogens it receives and transfers. The pathogens
that would be covered under the new rules include 14 viruses, 8 bacteria, 3
rickettsiae, 1 fungus and 14 toxins taken from the Australia List; and
certain genetically modified recombinant organisms and molecules.
There are 6 fundamental components of the proposed new regulations:

(1) A comprehensive list of select infectious agents;
(2) a registration of facilities transferring these agents;
(3) transfer requirements;
(4) verification procedures including audit, quality control, and
accountability mechanisms;
(5) agent disposal requirements; and
(6) research and clinical exemptions.
The proposed rules, which were structured by the US CDC in collaboration
with the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health, are
designed to:
"Collect and provide information concerning the location where certain
potentially-hazardous infectious agents are transferred;
Trace the acquisition and transfer of these specific infectious agents;
and
Establish a process for alerting appropriate authorities if an
unauthorized attempt is made to acquire these agent."
These proposed rules were promulgated to meet the mandate of "The
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, enacted 24 April
1996. Current rules can be found at 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 72,
as updated in 1980. Comment on the new rules are invited and must be
received on or before 10 July.
The full text and instructions for commenting may be viewed (and downloaded)
from the WWWsite of the American Society for Microbiology.
