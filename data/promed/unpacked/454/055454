An outbreak of West Nile fever has been registered in the Astrakhan region
[oblast]. [As of 9 Sep 2005] 60 cases of the disease have been recorded in
the region, more than 2 thirds (41 cases) in the oblast centre. Fatal
outcomes have not been observed. Health officials have declared that the
situation this year is similar to that observed in 1999, when an abrupt
increase in West Nile fever was observed and by the middle of September 5
people had died in the Astrakhan region and 53 in the adjacent Volgograd
region.
Disinfection of cellars and reservoirs to prevent an increase in the
population of mosquitoes is considered by the local authorities to be an
effective means of limiting the spread of the disease. A sum of 90 000
roubles [USD 3184] has been allocated from the Astrakhan city budget for
this purpose. 60 per cent of the city reservoirs (43 hectares in all),
located near apartment houses, have been treated, and the remainder will be
treated within a week. The treatment of cellars was begun last week. The
essence of the process is the creation of a protective skin of insecticide
on the surface of reservoirs. All adult mosquitoes will also be destroyed
by the treatment.
Beginning in 2006, the treatment of cellars and reservoirs to eliminate
mosquitoes will be included in the city of Astrakhan disinfection plan.
Disinfection will be carried out 3 times during the year -- at the
beginning of summer, in August, and in the middle of September.

[The Astrakhan region is located in the extreme southeast of the European
part of Russia. The region occupies an area of 44 000 sq km. The Astrakhan
region borders the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Turkmenistan,
and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Within the Russian Federation the
Astrakhan region borders the Volgograd region and Republic of Kalmykia. -

West Nile virus -- before its inadvertent introduction into North America
in 1999 (probably from Israel or Egypt) -- was known to be present
throughout Eurasia. The virus was first isolated in the West Nile District
of Uganda in 1937 and subsequently has been recorded throughout Africa and
Eurasia, probably radiating from Africa northwards to the Mediterranean and
southern European regions, eastwards to India, central and southern Asia,
and finally to Australia as Kunjin virus. The natural life cycle of this
virus involves ornithophilic mosquitoes (mostly but not exclusively _Culex_
species) and birds that migrate between Africa, Europe, and Asia.
Non-migratory birds become infected when West Nile virus-infected
mosquitoes feed on them. Infection of humans and mammals (horses in
particular) throughout the African and Eurasian ranges is sporadic and
rare. But significant outbreaks, like the current outbreak in Astrakhan,
have been recorded previously. An epidemic in Romania involved hundreds of
human cases with 17 fatalities, and sporadic West Nile virus cases have
been recorded in Israel over several years. Recently outbreaks have
occurred in horses in France and Italy. West Nile virus-seropositive birds
have been recorded in Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom
(see: Buckley A, et al. J Gen Virol 2003; 84: 2807-17). Further information
would be welcomed concerning any common features associated with the West
Nile fever outbreaks in Astrakhan in 1999 and 2005. - Mod.CP]
