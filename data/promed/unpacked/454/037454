BRAIN TISSUE IN MEAT - GERMANY

Some meat may contain undeclared brain material. Some German sausage may
contain undeclared brain tissue banned in Britain because of fears of mad
cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) scientists have warned.
Scientists, using a new technique to test for brain and spinal cord
material, found up to 15 percent of German liverwurst and mettwurst were
partly made from brain. Even high quality products which are not supposed
to contain any offal apart from liver contained cheap and potentially
dangerous brain tissue. The scientists say the use of such tissue is
"unacceptable with regard to the development of new variant CJD" (nv-CJD).
Cow brains and spinal cord is banned from human food products in Britain
and other countries because it is the tissue most likely to be contaminated
with BSE. New variant CJD is now recognized as BSE in another guise and
emerged as a result of people eating infected beef. The European Commission
wants all member countries to impose a brain ban as a precaution. But
Germany refuses, insisting there is no BSE in its cattle and no widespread
use of brain in its meat products.
Researchers from Giessen University collected 440 samples of local
ready-to-eat sausage and 126 samples of liverwurst from all over Germany.
They then used artificial antibodies to test for protein from glial cells
in the brain and for an enzyme called enolase, which comes from brain
cells. The results, reported in New Scientist magazine, showed blood
sausage and nearly all frankfurters were brain-free. But brain matter
turned up in 9 percent of liverwurst and 15 percent of mettwurst.
The test cannot distinguish between cow or pig brain, or brain from
uninfected cattle. However researcher Ernst Lucker said: "If there is any
brain when the label says there should be none, we should be cautious." He
pointed out that Germany imports some of its sausage meat.
Although meat from countries with BSE should not contain brain, before now
it had been impossible to tell if the ban is enforced.
