Viet Nam: Further Information on the 3 Most Recent Cases
--------------------------------------------------------
3 more Vietnamese residents have contracted avian influenza, taking the number
of infections in the country to 52 since Dec 2004, 18 of whom have died, a
health official was quoted on Thursday as saying. [Reported by WHO on Wed 8
Jun 2005, and posted on ProMED-mail as "Avian influenza, human - East Asia
(82): Viet Nam 20050608.1592. - Mod.CP]
The 3 cases, a 30-year-old man and 2 women, were detected in Hanoi since the
middle of May 2005, Trinh Quan Huan, head of the Health Ministry's Preventive
Medicine Department, was quoted as saying by e-newspaper VNExpress on its Web
site, <http://www.vnexpress.net>.
"All the 3 were infected in relation to sick poultry," Huan said in an
interview. "Their condition is not serious and by now the 30-year-old man has
been discharged." The 2 women were still being treated in a Hanoi
hospital. "The outbreak has slowed recently," he added.
A World Health Organisation statement [issued on Wed 8 Jun 2005] said
Vietnam's Health Ministry had informed the WHO of the 3 infections. It said
the ministry had also confirmed a death by the H5N1 virus that was earlier
reported as a suspected case.
Last month [May 2005], health officials said a 46-year-old man from the
northern province of Hung Yen, 65 km southeast of Hanoi, was suspected of
having died of the H5N1 virus. A Health Ministry report said the virus had
killed 18 people since 16 Dec 2004, when the disease resurfaced, taking the
country's total to 38 since it appeared in late 2003. The disease also killed
12 Thais and 4 Cambodians.
The government anti-avian influenza committee was told on Wednesday that
poultry in the northern province of Nam Dinh and the southern province of Tien
Giang would be vaccinated later this month on a trial basis, state media said.
In August, vaccination of waterfowl [meaning domestic ducks & geese, we
suppose. - Mod.JW] and chickens would become mandatory in the regions facing a
high infection risk, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.
Avian influenza first emerged in the Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam in late
2003, then spread to the northern region, where the virus appears to develop
rapidly during the winter. Scientists fear that avian influenza, which is
infectious in birds but does not spread easily among humans, could mutate into
a form capable of generating a pandemic in which millions of people without
immunity could die.

[There is a discrepancy between the preceding WHO report and this report
regarding the date of infection of these patients. The WHO report stated
that: "The most recently detected case was reported on 26 Apr 2005," whereas
the Reuters report above quotes an official as saying that: "The 3 ... were
detected in Hanoi since the middle of May". Clarification of the date of
infection and the meaning of "detection" would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
