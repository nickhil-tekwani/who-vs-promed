[Both submissions below are in response to the posting entitled
Brucellosis, bovine - Cyprus (reference below), the final paragraph of
which stated: "Brucellosis causes abortion in cattle and livestock.
Infected animals must be slaughtered to contain the spread of the disease.
However, the meat and milk of the infected animals are not contaminated and
[are] safe for human consumption, according to local experts."]

Despite [the opinion] of "local experts," brucellosis is transmitted
through unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals. In Texas, the
overwhelming majority (in the 1990s, upwards of 90 per cent) of human
brucellosis cases (30 to 50 annually) resulted from the consumption of
unpasteurized goat-milk cheese made in Mexico [undoubtedly - Mod.LL] from
the milk of _Brucella melitensis_-infected goats. Mexico has thousands of
such cases annually.

As far as I know there is still a risk for humans to get sick with
_Brucella_, if meat and milk of the infected animals is raw or not well
heated. Only _B. ovis_ and _B. neotomae_ are [not felt to be - Mod.LL]
pathogenic for humans.

I am fairly sure that the milk is safe only after it has been heat treated
-- for example, boiled or pasteurised and that brucella can and does
survive in cheeses made from unpasteurised milk. And of course, humans can
be infected by handling recently aborted animals, fetuses, and afterbirths;
farmers and vets are at particular risk of this.
Out of interest, if 25 per cent of the national herd is seropositive, will
killing 4000 cattle make that much impact? Would a policy of reduce dose
adult vaccination with S19 or Rev1 not help to bring down the incidence and
stop spread?

[Indeed, brucella organisms can be found in high concentration in the milk,
urine, and products of conception of infected animals. As stated above,
milk products can, if not adequately pasteurized, transmit the infection to
man. In this regard, _B. melitensis_ may be spread more readily by the oral
route, as it is less effectively killed by low gastric pH (1).
Meat from infected animals is rarely the vehicle for infection to man, as
it is usually cooked and has only a low organism burden (2). A low risk,
however, is not no risk.
Brucellosis is an occupational disease of farmers, veterinarians,
slaughterhouse workers, and microbiology laboratory staff through direct or
indirect contact with the animals or their secretions via abrasions or cuts
in the skin or via the conjunctiva.
