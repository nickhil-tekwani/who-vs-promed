The recent report of Iraq's Ministry of Health indicates that 853
laboratory-confirmed cholera cases have been detected and registered
in Iraq, up to 13 Nov 2008. Most of the new confirmed cases were from
Muthana. 47 percent of the cases are found in children below 5 years
of age. There have been 11 deaths (7 males and 4 females). 36 percent
of the deaths have been in children below 5 years of age.

Epidemiological findings have indicated that contaminated water is
the most probable source of the outbreak. 852 cases have been

[2] Cholera - Philippines (Misamis Oriental)
Date: Mon 17 Nov 2008

Two people have died and more than 500 others have fallen ill due to
a suspected cholera outbreak in at least 8 barangays [districts] in
Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental. Tagoloan Mayor Paulino Emano identified
the affected barangays as Poblacion, Baluarte, Sugbongcogon, Bogoac,
Sta Cruz, Casinglot, Mohon, and Sihayon.

Provincial health chief Dr Ignacio Moreno said his office is still
investigating the health crisis. He, however, said the cause of the
illnesses might be cholera. Moreno said they have yet to confirm if
the water source may have been the cause of the outbreak.

Mayor Emano said Tagoloan has 2 sources of water, the Tagoloan Water
Works and the Mactan Rock in Natumolan. Emano pointed out that some
of the sick do not have a water line connection. Just the same, Emano
said he has tasked some of the town's personnel to check all the
water line connections of Tagoloan.

The suspected cholera outbreak was first reported last Saturday night
[15 Nov 2008] when 12 people exhibiting cholera symptoms were brought
to the Tagoloan Municipal Health Unit (MHU), Emano said. More people
were brought to the MHU Sunday [16 Nov 2008] and Monday [17 Mon 2008]
morning, he added. As of this posting Monday [17 Nov 2008], 23
suspected cholera victims have been confined in the Northern Mindanao
Medical Center (NMMC) and more than 30 others at the Tagoloan
Polymedic Hospital. The Tagoloan Polymedic Hospital has refused to
accept more patients due to the lack of available rooms and beds.

[3] Diarrhea, fatal - Indonesia (West Sulawesi)
Date: Sat 15 Nov 2008

<http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/11/15/diarrhea-kills-12-west-sulawesi.html>


A diarrhea outbreak has killed 12 people in Polewali Mandar regency,
West Sulawesi since October 2008, with nearly 200 residents seeking
treatment in hospitals and local Puskesmas (community health
centers). Polewali Mandar Health Agency head, Ahmad Azis, said
Tuesday that out of more than 1500 residents who sought treatment,
around 150 remain hospitalized due to the illness. He said the
outbreak was the worst in 4 years to hit Polewali Mandar, and had
spread to the districts of Pambusuang, Mapilli, Batu Panga,
Kanreapia, and Pekkabata.

"Therefore we have classified the 5 districts under the extraordinary
occurrence status, because the number of cases has doubled from last
month [October 2008], and the overall instance of diarrhea is far
greater than in 2007," Azis told The Jakarta Post over the phone.

The outbreak occurred after floods inundated the area, forcing
residents to rely on contaminated water for consumption and cleaning.
Reports from the area show that many residents in the flooded areas
were not boiling their water adequately, or were simply consuming it
directly from the contaminated sources.

[4] Cholera - Congo DR (North Kivu)

Cholera is spreading quickly in eastern Congo where rebels are
fighting government troops, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) warned
Tuesday [18 Nov 2008]. Veronique Taveau, a UNICEF spokeswoman, told
journalists that 127 fresh cases had just been discovered in the
village of Ishasha, north of Goma and near the Ugandan border.

She said aid agencies couldn't get to many areas because of the
fighting. "There are numerous places we can't reach, which definitely
makes us fear a sizable rise in the number of cases," she said. "It
is vital that humanitarian access is allowed."

The cases "seem to have spread very quickly due to a lack of hygiene
and water," she said.

The WHO (World health Organisation) warned last week [week of 10 Nov
2008] that cholera poses a "serious risk" in the region where around
1000 cases have been reported since October 2008. Fighting between
Congolese government troops and followers of renegade Tutsi general
Laurent Nkunda has killed at least 100 civilians and displaced more
than 250 000, the UN and humanitarian groups have said.

[5] Cholera - Uganda (Kanungu) ex Congo DR
Date: Mon 17 Nov 2008

At least one person has been reported dead of suspected cholera among
the Congolese refugees who entered Uganda. They are fleeing the
fighting in the DR Congo. Kanungu district director of health
services Dr Stephen Ssebude said cholera and dysentery have been
reported in Congo about 10 km (6.2 mi) from the Uganda-Congo border
where a 14-year-old child was reported dead.

An official with the Red Cross, Charles Cadet, said about 1200
people, who intended to cross to Uganda have been denied entry by the
army on the Congo side. They were reportedly living in unhygienic
conditions, which makes the disease spread quickly. However, they
entered Uganda after the soldiers who were preventing them from
entering the country fled to an unknown place on Wednesday [12 Nov 2008].

Cadet also said the army on the Congo side of the boarder, have on
several occasions tried to forcefully arrest people who have crossed to Uganda.

Some refugees disclosed that they had dodged the army and crossed to
Uganda through river Ishasha, which they said was a risk because the
volume of the water had increased due to the rains.

[6] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Matabeleland South)

A serious cholera outbreak has hit Beitbridge District in
Matabeleland South, killing 36 people, while 431 have been diagnosed
as having the disease, Chronicle learned yesterday [17 Nov 2008].

Confirming the outbreak, the acting district medical officer for
Beitbridge, Dr Takaitei Kanongora, said the epidemic was detected on
Friday night [14 Nov 2008] following the admission of a Chegutu woman
to Beitbridge District Hospital. The woman involved in cross-border
trade, intended to cross into South Africa when she succumbed to
cholera. It is suspected that the now deceased woman, who was selling
amazhanje, could have eaten them resulting in severe vomiting and diarrhoea.

"There is a serious outbreak of cholera in Beitbridge and we have
since taken biological (stool) samples to our laboratory, which
eventually confirmed that. Initially we had recorded 8 deaths but
however this morning (17 Nov 2008) the number of the casualties has
increased to 36 and we have admitted 431 people at Beitbridge
Hospital," said Dr Kanongora. He said due to inadequate health
personnel and resources they had been forced to close the only
district hospital to other cases except cholera-related ailments.

"We had to clear the hospital wards to create space for the cholera
patients and therefore we had to close the hospital to other cases
except cholera and we are referring them (other cases) to other
health centres largely because of lack of equipment and staff as we
are now prioritising cholera," he said.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), a non-governmental organization, and
the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) have deployed
their staff to assist in fighting the epidemic. The 2 organisations
also supplied the hospital with medical kits such as gloves, tablets,
and protective garments for the health staff.

Cases of cholera in Beitbridge District were last reported in 2003.
Travelers passing through the border post have also been put on high
alert following the outbreak. Beitbridge border post is reported to
be the busiest point of entry in sub-Saharan Africa with a huge
volume of both human and motor traffic passing through everyday.

[7] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland East)
Date: Tue 18 Nov 2008
Source: Medecins Sans Frontieres [edited]
<http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?objectid=AF34EADC-15C5-F00A-25187D9B792A9BA9&component=toolkit.article&method=full_html>


In Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is
responding to a cholera outbreak of cholera, which the local Ministry
of Health has declared "the biggest ever in Harare". MSF has set up
cholera treatment centres (CTC) in Budiriro Polyclinic and Harare
Infectious Diseases Hospital, where 500 patients have been treated to
date and, on average, 38 new patients are admitted every day. About
78 percent of the patients come from 2 densely populated suburbs in
the south west of Harare, Budiriro and Glen View, which have a
combined population of approximately 300 000 people.

The outbreak has also affected people from the neighboring suburbs of
Mbare, Kambuzuma, Kwanzana, and Glen Norah. Up to 1.4 million people
are endangered if the outbreak continues to spread.

"At Budiriro CTC, things are getting out of hand," said MSF Water and
Sanitation officer, Precious Matarutse. "There are so many patients
that the nurses are overwhelmed. In the observation area, a girl died
sitting on a bench. The staff is utilizing each and every available
room and still in the observation area patients are lying on the
floor. A man came to the clinic yesterday [17 Nov 2008] for
treatment. His wife had just died at home and that is what made his
relatives realize this is serious, and they brought the man to the
clinic. They wanted to know what to do with the wife's body. People
are concerned about catching cholera from others. Health education
must be intensified to inform the population."

"It is a constant challenge to keep up with increasing patient
numbers. We are running out of ward space and beds for the patients,"
said Vittorio Varisco, MSF logistician. "Today [18 Nov 2008] patients
at the Infectious Diseases Hospital are lying outside on the grass
and we are setting up tents with additional beds as an overflow for the wards."

"Patients need constant supervision to ensure adequate hydration,
without which they will die," said MSF doctor Bauma Ngoya. "As
patient numbers continue to increase we must continue to recruit and
train nursing staff."

Cholera is no new phenomenon in crisis-shaken Zimbabwe. In some of
the rural areas of the country cholera is endemic and occurs every
year. However, until recent years cholera was relatively rare in
urban areas of the country where treated piped water and flush
toilets exist in most homes. With the ongoing economic crisis and the
constantly deteriorating living conditions these urban areas are more
and more affected.

<http://www.afriquenligne.fr/news/africa-news/cholera-persists-in-zimbabwe,-death-toll-rises-2008111716167.html>


Health authorities in Zimbabwe admitted Monday [17 Nov 2008] they
have failed to bring a cholera outbreak in the capital, Harare, which
has claimed 37 lives, under control amid a rising death toll. The
disease broke out 3 weeks ago in Harare, and health authorities have
been battling to contain it. But city health director Stanley Mungofa
admitted Monday [17 Nov 2008] the cholera outbreak in the city was
getting worse and claiming more lives.

He said at least 37 people had died of the disease, but "there could
have been (more) communal deaths. We have recorded 25 deaths at
Beatrice Road Infectious Diseases Hospital. All the deaths have been
in the 1st 24 hours of admission of which 70 percent were in the 1st
4 hours of being brought to the hospital. A further 12 people have
died at Budiriro Polyclinic since the outbreak of the disease on 25
Oct 2008. There could have been communal deaths and the (Harare City)
Council is still compiling figures."

The outbreak is widely blamed on consumption of unclean water, and
has defied concerted efforts by health authorities in the last 2
weeks to contain it. A breakdown in the provision of clean water and
administration of health services in Harare, like elsewhere in
Zimbabwe because of an economic crisis, is making it difficult to
bring the cholera outbreak under control.
