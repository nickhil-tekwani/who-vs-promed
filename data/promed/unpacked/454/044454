The number of cattle affected by foot and mouth disease virus (FMD)
in the mukims [district of Pelagat and Bukit Puteri in Terengganu√≠s
Besut district increased from 196 early this month to 207, state
veterinary officer Dr Fhaisol Mohd Amin said yesterday.
He attributed the rise to the movement of cattle from the affected
areas to other places in search of pasture. "Now is the padi [rice
field-planting season when pasture land is ploughed and so the cows
and buffaloes have turned to other areas," he said.
He said the State Veterinary Services Department had advised farmers
to keep affected animals in restricted areas so they would not move
around and infect other animals.
He said the department had supplied 6000 doses of vaccine but the
cattle had yet to be vaccinated in several Besut mukims.
Dr Fhaisol said about 80 percent of the 17 000 cattle in the affected
areas had been vaccinated.
