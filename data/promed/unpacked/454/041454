Japanese encephalitis has made its way to Rajasthan with the death of a woman. This is the 1st case of Japanese encephalitis in the state.

The 30-year-old woman, from Bundi, died last month [October 2017]. Now, the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune in its report has confirmed that she was suffering from Japanese encephalitis.

The woman, a resident of Keshoraipatan region in Bundi district, was admitted to the New Government Medical College Hospital of Kota on 8 Oct [2017] with complaints of fever, but soon she went into a coma.

"I took my wife to a private hospital (Sudha Hospital) in Kota where neurosurgeon Dr Amit Dev treated her for 4 days, and later she was referred to the Government Maharao Bhim Singh Hospital for treatment, where her blood samples were sent to NIV through the laboratory at the hospital," said her husband (age 39).

She died at the Government Maharao Bhim Singh Hospital during treatment on 16 Oct [2017].

Now, the diagnostic report from NIV, Pune confirmed that it was Japanese encephalitis, said her husband, who works as a taxi driver.

When asked about the case, the chief medical and health officer, Bundi, Dr Suresh Kumar Jain, said that he has received the report from the Government Medical College Kota. "Anti-larval activity is on in the region to prevent seasonal diseases. The case has been forwarded to the health directorate from where a health department team is likely to arrive at Bundi on Monday [13 Nov 2017] for further action," he said.

Principal, Government Medical College Kota, Dr Girish Verma said that the viral encephalitis is [caused by] a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which primarily affects children. "Most [clinical] JE infections are characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and others," he said.

Japanese encephalitis is transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species (mainly _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_). The virus exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and water birds, said Dr Verma.

There is no specific treatment for JE, only supportive treatment, but there are effective JE vaccines available to prevent the disease, the doctor said.

[Rajasthan state in northwestern India is far away from the usual Japanese encephalitis (JE) endemic areas in the northeast of the country, making this case geographically unusual. However, this may not be the 1st case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Rajasthan. A child was referred to J K Lon hospital from the Bansur area, Alwar and died on 15 Oct 2012. It is suspected that the child was suffering from viral encephalitis. He, along with 6 other children, were admitted to J K Lon hospital and were clinically suspected cases of viral encephalitis. Reports of laboratory tests were not provided, so they remain suspected JE cases. The above fatality is the 1st confirmed JE case in Rajasthan that ProMED-mail has posted.
