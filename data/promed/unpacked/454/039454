Abstract
--------
Importance: Routine case surveillance data for SARS-CoV-2 are incomplete, biased, missing key variables of interest, and may be unreliable for both timely surge detection and understanding the burden of infection.

Objective: To determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the omicron BA.2/BA.2.12.1 surge in relation to official case counts, and to assess the epidemiology of infection and uptake of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.

Design: Cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of New York City (NYC) adult residents, conducted 7-8 May 2022.

Setting: NYC, 23 Apr-8 May 2022, during which the official SARS-CoV-2 case count was 49 253 and BA.2.12.2 comprised 20% of reported cases.

Participants: A representative sample of 1030 NYC adult residents >18 years.

Exposure(s): Vulnerability to severe COVID-19, including vaccination/booster status, prior COVID, age, and presence of comorbidities.

Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a 14-day period, weighted to represent the NYC adult population. Respondents self-reported on SARS-CoV-2 testing (including at-home rapid antigen tests), testing outcomes, COVID-like symptoms, and contact with confirmed/probable cases. Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 were asked about awareness/use of antiviral medications.

Results: An estimated 22.1% (95% CI 17.9%-26.2%) of respondents had SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period, corresponding to approx. 1.5 million adults (95% CI 1.3-1.8 million). Prevalence was estimated at 34.9% (95% CI 26.9%- 42.8%) among individuals with co-morbidities, 14.9% (95% CI 11.0%-18.8%) among those 65+ years, and 18.9% (95% CI 10.2%-27.5%) among unvaccinated persons. Hybrid protection against severe disease (i.e., from both vaccination and prior infection) was 66.2% (95% CI 55.7%-76.7%) among those with COVID and 46.3% (95% CI 40.2-52.2) among those without. Among individuals with COVID, 55.9% (95% CI 44.9%- 67.0%) were not aware of the antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (PaxlovidTM), and 15.1% (95% CI 7.1%-23.1%) reported receiving it.

Conclusions and relevance: The true magnitude of NYCs BA.2/BA.2.12.1 surge was vastly underestimated by routine SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Until there is more certainty that the impact of future pandemic surges on severe population health outcomes will be diminished, representative surveys are needed for timely surge detection, and to estimate the true burden of infection, hybrid protection, and uptake of time-sensitive treatments.

[This paper concludes that the "findings also demonstrate the utility of population-representative surveys as an important surveillance tool at this uncertain stage of the US pandemic and can be critical for adjusting estimates of vaccine effectiveness, and calibrating signals in wastewater surveillance."

Testing wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 RNA is a powerful tool for the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 virus shed into wastewater via fecal material of infected persons. Wastewater surveillance tracks unidentified "pooled samples" that reflect the overall disease activity for a community serviced by the wastewater treatment plant rather than tracking samples from individual people. It represents a population-based approach to surveillance. - Mod.LK]

JAMA. 2022; 327(20): 1951. doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.8061.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The risk of developing myocarditis and other inflammatory heart conditions after COVID-19 vaccination is substantially lower than it is after SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to an analysis of electronic health records from 40 US health systems. Although it's a rare complication, myocarditis has been associated with both SARS-CoV-2 infection and messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines against the virus. To directly compare the likelihood of developing it and other cardiac complications after vaccination vs infection, the investigators calculated incidence rates of myocarditis; myocarditis or pericarditis; and myocarditis, pericarditis, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) among 15.2 million people treated in health systems that participated in the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network from early January 2021 through January 2022. Among males aged 12-17 years, the incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after infection with SARS-CoV-2 was about twice as high as after vaccination with 2 doses of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. When MIS, a post-COVID-19 syndrome that often includes cardiac complications, was included in the comparison, the risk of cardiac problems was about 2-6 times higher after infection than after 2 doses of vaccine. Men aged 18-29 years had a 7-9 times greater risk of cardiac complications after infection than after 2 doses of vaccine.

In boys and girls aged 5-11 years, the incidence of myocarditis after vaccination was 0 or close to it, making a statistically significant comparison between infection- and vaccination-related cardiac complications impossible. For females aged 12 years or older, the risk of cardiac complications ranged from 6-63 times higher after infection than after 2 doses of an mRNA-based vaccine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
Accurate stratification of patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC, or long COVID) would allow precision clinical management strategies and could enable more focussed investigation of the molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of this disease. However, the natural history of long COVID is incompletely understood and characterized by an extremely wide range of manifestations that are difficult to analyze computationally. In addition, the generalizability of machine learning classification of COVID-19 clinical outcomes has rarely been tested. We present a method for computationally modeling long COVID phenotype data based on electronic healthcare records (EHRs) and for assessing pairwise phenotypic similarity between patients using semantic similarity. Using unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering), we found 6 distinct clusters of long COVID patients, each with distinct profiles of phenotypic abnormalities with enrichments in pulmonary, cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, and constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and fever. There was a highly significant association of cluster membership with a range of pre-existing conditions and with measures of severity during acute COVID-19. We show that the clusters we identified in one hospital system were generalizable across different hospital systems. Semantic phenotypic clustering can provide a foundation for assigning patients to stratified subgroups for natural history or therapy studies on long COVID.

Discussion
Evidence available prior to our study suggests that important clinical differences do exist that influence the susceptibility to subsequent complications of COVID-19. For instance, although males are more likely to be hospitalized or die with acute COVID-19, females are more likely to develop long COVID (39). It is possible that the pathophysiology of long COVID may be multifactorial in origin. Conceivably, the biological underpinnings of long COVID may vary among individuals as a function of baseline risk factors, resulting in different general phenotypes of long COVID, the treatment or prevention of which may need to be specifically tailored using precision medicine in order to achieve optimal outcomes. As a 1st step, we sought to use unsupervised learning to delineate potential subtypes of patients with long COVID with differing clinical characteristics. We identified 6 published studies that present clusters from either patient-reported data (in 4 studies) or manually recorded clinical data (2 studies) with cohorts of between 145 and 3762 patients. The studies report 2 or 3 clusters based on different types of input data, making study comparison challenging. None of the studies were based on EHR data, and no assessment of generalizability to other data partners was presented (18,29,40-43).

Here we have presented a novel method for semantic clustering of long COVID patients based on HPO [human phenotype ontology]-encoded EHR data. We further present a method for assessing generalizability of the identified subtypes or clusters across different data contributing sites. Ontology-based algorithms differ from machine learning and other algorithms in many ways. Coding numerical data with HPO implies that parameters are simplified into categories. Although this loss of numerical data reduces precision in data granularity, simplification allows powerful simultaneous analysis of all phenotypic observations using semantic similarity that can take the relatedness of concepts into account.
