Disease hits farmers hard
-------------------------
The biggest ergot outbreak in more than a generation has forced New Zealand's largest malting plant to reject some barley crops. Discovered early this year [2013] the ergot outbreak has caught some farmers by surprise with incomes likely to take a hit. It is the 1st time Malteurop has had to reject barley crops.

Contained to the lower North Island, the Rangitikei and Manawatu are hit the hardest while Hawkes Bay has also had cases reported. Federated Farmers said [it is] believed up to 25 percent of farmers in Rangitikei could be affected. Canterbury, the South Island's main barley growing region has come through unscathed.

Malteurop said warm conditions coupled with December rain created ideal conditions for the fungus. The company has a nil tolerance for ergot in crops and screens everything that comes in. "This is the 1st time we have seen a major outbreak of ergot in barley in New Zealand."

It is not just malting barley affected, but [barley] crops for stock feed, too. Ergot has not been detected in any other crops.

[The parasitic ergot fungus _Claviceps purpurea_ has a wide host range including about 60 genera of grasses (_Graminaea_). Rye and triticale are the most frequently affected crops, but wheat, barley and pasture grasses can also be affected. Sclerotia ("ergots") left behind in the field or pasture serve as sources of infection for the next season's crop.

Infection reduces grain yield and the fungus also produces mycotoxins contaminating the harvested grain. The ergots are highly poisonous and can cause serious effects in humans and animals (see links below). Ergot alkaloids are also used for pharmaceutical applications, and ergots are grown commercially for this purpose. The species has variable morphology and can be separated into 3 discrete groups based on host species and toxins produced.

Disease management may include the use of certified seed, cultural practices, phytosanitary measures (to reduce inoculum levels), crop rotation and fungicide treatments of seed and planted fields. Barley varieties with reduced levels of ergot sensitivity exist.

A related fungus, _C. africana_, causes ergot of sorghum.
