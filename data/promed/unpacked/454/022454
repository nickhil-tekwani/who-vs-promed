Rabies, human - UK ex Philippines 20010510.0907
Date 12 May 2001
From: David M. Sasaki, D.V.M., M.P.H. <dmsasaki@mail.health.state.hi.us>

This posting raises a lot of questions regarding the patient's exposure
and whether he received prophylaxis. When was he bitten, where was he
bitten, did he receive wound treatment, did he receive rabies post
exposure prophylaxis, if so - where and what kind of regimen, did he
complete prophylaxis, did he seek medical care/counseling, etc. I would
appreciate more complete description of the case.
The reason I'm asking these questions is that we receive frequent reports
of animal bites in the Philippines, but to date, no one here has been
diagnosed with rabies.
