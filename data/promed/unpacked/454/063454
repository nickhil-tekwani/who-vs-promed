The 1st case of death due to swine flu disease has come to light in Madhya Pradesh in the new year [2020]. Samples of 29 suspected patients have been taken from many hospitals since 1 Jan [2020]. Two of these patients have been found positive. In the latest case, a woman living in Mhow died of swine flu in her house on 24 Jan [2020]. [She] was admitted to a private hospital on 11 Jan [2020].

The family took [her] home against the doctor's [advice] by discharging [her]. The negligence of the health department has been revealed in this entire case. According to the directive of the government, the swine flu patient should be kept under special surveillance so that there is no risk of spreading the infection, but the health department got information about the woman's discharge after death.

As a precaution, department officials also investigated the family of the woman. Its report is negative. IDSP [Integrated Disease Surveillance Program] branch in charge of the health department, Dr Santosh Sisodia has said that on receiving information, samples were taken for examination of the female patient. On the 2nd day, the woman was confirmed from the Medical College Virology Lab to have swine flu. Samples were also sent to Bhopal. Swine flu was confirmed from there on the 3rd day. The woman was kept on ventilator only.

A person died from viral fever in Swamikartik Khapar rural municipality of Bajura district on Tuesday evening [4 Feb 2020]. The deceased was aged 55, of Joru, in the rural municipality. Five other members of this person's family are known to be sick, said in-charge of Sappata Health Post, Birja BK, adding that hundreds have fallen sick in the rural municipality.

Acting chief administrative officer of Swamikartik Khapar rural municipality, Kuber Shahi, said that over 215 people in ward-1 have fallen ill from the seasonal flu. He added that health workers are finding it difficult to administer treatment after the whole village started falling sick. Shahi quoted the health workers as saying that treatment of patients has become challenging due to lack of sufficient medicines and human resources at the health post. The number of people suffering from the condition increased over the past week.

Meanwhile, the coordinator of the health department at the rural municipality, Bhakta Bahadur Kaila, said health personnel along with available medicines would be mobilised to the viral-fever-affected areas. Health professionals have advised the locals to be alert and take precautionary measures to avoid the spreading of the viral condition.

Himali rural municipality has also reported some cases of the viral fever; a team of health professionals are visiting today to assess the situation.

Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (swine flu) cases have been recorded among students of the A Pushkin public school in Yerevan, principal Natalia Stepanyan told Armenpress. She said so far 10 parents have submitted sick leaves on their children having H1N1. The headmaster said 552 out of the total 1800 students did not show up to classes on 7 Feb [2020].

"We have 2 shifts: 1500 students study at 1st shift, and 452 of them are absent, while 100 are absent from the 300-student 2nd shift. We still don't know how many of those absent are sick with the flu since not all parents take their children to hospitals and not all bring sick leaves," Stepanyan said.

School doctors are carrying out regular monitoring among the children, and in the event of suspected cases, parents are asked to take their children to hospitals for checkups.

Earlier on 6 Feb 2020, the healthcare ministry said cases of respiratory infections are increasing in the country. Out of 740 sample tests during the season, 18.5% were confirmed to be influenza A virus subtype H1N1, 5.5% were subtype B, and 24.7% were other viruses (rhinovirus, adenovirus, etc).

https://delawarebusinessnow.com/2020/02/flu-death-toll-in-delaware-rises-to-4/


The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) confirmed 2 recent flu-related deaths, bringing the total number of deaths for the 2019-2020 season to 5. One of the most recent victims is a 29 year old New Castle County man diagnosed with influenza B who passed away earlier this month [February 2020]. Recently, a 65 year old New Castle County woman diagnosed with influenza A passed away due to complications from the flu.

Of the [5] individuals who have passed away this season, 2 persons were from Sussex County, and 2 were from New Castle County. There was no immediate information on the 5th death. None of the 1st 4 individuals who died had received the flu vaccine, and all had underlying medical conditions.

As of 1 Feb [2020], 2943 confirmed cases of influenza have been reported in Delaware. The rate of increase in flu cases has been rising. These numbers reflect only the number of lab-confirmed cases. The actual number of cases statewide is likely much higher.

"We can't express enough sympathy for the friends and loved ones of those we have lost to flu this season," said DPH director Dr Karyl Rattay. "The best protection against the flu is to get vaccinated every year. The vaccine is safe and effective for people 6 months and older. The vaccine makes you less likely to get the flu and will make your symptoms milder in the event that you do catch it. You should also visit your doctor if you're feeling ill and take any antiviral medicine he or she prescribes as directed."

In addition to getting a flu vaccine and taking antiviral medication, DPH recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses in the home and workplace:
- wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
- avoid close contact with people who are sick.
- stay home when you are sick.
- cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If no tissue is available, cough or sneeze into your inner elbow.
- Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Over-the-counter medicines can provide symptom relief, but if you suspect you have influenza, call your doctor, as he or she may decide to provide antiviral medications to help hasten recovery and prevent serious complications. This is particularly important for those who feel very sick, are pregnant, or have chronic medical conditions.

Flu symptoms come on suddenly and include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, headaches and body aches, chills, and fatigue. Some people get complications including pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinus and ear infections. People with pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes and asthma are more susceptible to catching the flu.

Flu vaccines are available at many pharmacies and grocery stores, and through primary care physicians and some specialists. To find participating stores, enter your zip code in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flu vaccine finder (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/freeresources/flu-finder-widget.html). For more information about the flu, visit https://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/flu.html or call DPH at 1-800-282-8672. Flu shots are still available at DPH clinics located within the State Service Centers.

As the flu rates are beginning to rise dramatically, more public schools are shutting down for widespread illness. JKL Bahweting Elementary School closed last week from Tues 21 Jan to Fri 24 Jan [2020]. Now, Rudyard Area Schools recently announced that they are closed for the rest of this week and will not return until Monday [3 Feb 2020]. Brimley Schools were also closed this past Tuesday and Wednesday [28-29 Jan 2020] due to excessive absences from flu and fever.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), "Flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Some people also may have vomiting and diarrhea. People may be infected with flu and have respiratory symptoms without a fever."

According to the Michigan Flu Focus, a weekly influenza surveillance report as released by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), Michigan's influenza activity is considered to be widespread. This is considered the worst severity of influenza activity on the 5-tier scale. Michigan's influenza-like-illness (ILI) rate as of December was 1.2%. ILI is defined as fever (temperature of 100 deg F [37.8 deg C] or greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat without a known cause other than influenza, according to MDHHS. However, as of 18 Jan [2020], Michigan's ILI activity has nearly doubled at 2.2%.

There have been approximately 54 pediatric deaths due to influenza just in the 2019-2020 flu season. According to the report, 2 pediatric influenza B deaths have been confirmed by MDHHS this season alone.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have once again begun to release preliminary burden estimates for the 2019-2020 influenza season," said DHHS in the report. "From 1 Oct 2019 through 18 Jan 2020, it is estimated that there have been 15-21 million flu illnesses, 7-10 million flu medical visits, 140 000-250 000 flu hospitalizations, and 8200-20 000 flu deaths (in the United States)."

CDC recommends citizens take 3 necessary courses of action when it comes to avoiding and limiting their exposure to influenza:

1st, "get the flu vaccine. It is considered the most important step in protecting against flu viruses. Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every year before flu activity begins in their community, before the end of October. Those most at risk for serious flu complications are young children, pregnant women, people with serious health conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart and lung disease), and people 65 years and older."

2nd, "take preventative actions to stop the spread of germs. Clean and disinfected surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs like the flu. If you are sick with flu symptoms, CDC recommends that you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities (your fever should be gone for 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medicine). Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth."

Finally, "take flu antiviral drugs appropriately if your doctor prescribes them. Antiviral drugs are different from antibiotics. They are prescription medicines (pills, liquid, or an inhaled powder) and are not available over the counter. Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting sick, but starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person has a high-risk factor or is very sick from flu. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking this drug."

However, the flu is not the only illness Americans have been concerned about. As of 21 Jan [2020], there was a confirmed case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Since then, there have been 4 additional positive cases as of 27 Jan [2020] [for a total of 5 cases in the US]: one in Arizona, 2 in California, one in Washington state, and one in Illinois. No known cases have been reported in Michigan.

This respiratory illness was 1st identified in Wuhan, China. The cause of origin was originally anticipated to be an animal-to-person spread due to China's large seafood and animal market. However, recent patients have not had exposure to animal markets, suggesting that this is a person-to-person spread. Symptoms can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath and may appear 2-14 days after exposure. Because this virus is new, it is still being closely monitored and investigated by CDC.

https://www.thelocal.fr/20200205/france-declares-flu-epidemic-as-26-people-die


Coronavirus might be hogging the headlines at present, but in France, normal seasonal flu is proving far more deadly. On Wednesday 5 Feb [2020], the region of Normandy officially declared itself in epidemic, leading to the whole of mainland France now being in a state of influenza epidemic. Across the whole country, 301 out of every 100 000 people have the flu, taking the illness into epidemic phase. Of the nearly 9000 people that went to the hospital emergency room with flu symptoms last week, 810 of were hospitalised.

Since the start of the outbreak in November [2019], 311 people have been admitted to intensive care with flu, and 26 of them have died. These include 3 children under 15 years of age, 12 cases aged 15-64, and 11 cases aged 65 years and older.

The average age of these serious cases is 52 years, and 73% of them had risk factors for complications (over 65 years of age, chronic illnesses, etc). Among the latter, 3/4 were not vaccinated against influenza (among those whose vaccination status was known).

This year [2020], children seem to be particularly affected. Nearly 1/3 of emergency room visits and hospitalisations for influenza were children under 5 years old, compared with 20% for people aged 75 and over. Every year seasonal flu affects between 2-6 million people in France, and last year [2019], 9500 people died from it.

Health officials advise people to practice normal good hygiene: washing hands regularly, using disposable tissues and throwing them away if you have a cough, and coughing into your elbow. Those who are sick are advised to wear a disposable face mask to help avoid spreading the illness.
