Avian flu scares off bird watchers
----------------------------------
Despite the shadow of the deadly avian flu virus, this year's [2005] Taipei
Bird Watching Fair kicked off yesterday [12 Nov 2005] at Guandu Nature
Park, as bird watching groups and conservationists from 10 countries
worldwide joined the 2 day event to promote the joys of bird watching and
assure the public of the safety of such activities.
The panic over the avian flu, however, has dissuaded many bird lovers from
taking part in the event this year [2005] and caused a 70 per cent slump in
the crowd from last year.
While disappointed by the number of participants this year [2005], Liu
Hsin-bai, director-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei (WBST),
remained passionate about the annual fair hosted by the organization, as he
greeted participants and patiently clarified some "unjustified fears" and
"misunderstandings" about bird watching to the media.
"Bird watchers keep dozens of meters away from wild birds, and so it is
almost impossible to be infected with the avian flu; it is actually safer
and healthier to participate in such outdoor activities than to stay home,"
he said.
Liu said that the Agriculture Council and several bird watching societies
in Taiwan have been working together since 1997 to monitor the activities
of migratory birds and take dropping samples. So far, they haven't found
any evidence of the avian flu virus in wild birds. [This yesterday's
statement deserves to be reviewed after today's (14 Nov 2005) finding, see
item 2. - Mod.AS]
"We are doing our job as front-line monitors, and I think it is the
government's responsibility to take preventive measures, provide correct
information, and not to discourage people from attending activities such as
these," he added.
Echoing Liu's comments, Siraprapa Boonlue, a representative from the Bird
Conservation Society of Thailand, said although there were 2 to 3 human
deaths from the avian flu last year [2004] in northern Thailand, bird
watching activities have continued unaffected in national parks and wetlands.
"We work with universities to monitor wild birds and hold seminars and
training to disseminate correct information," she said.
In Israel, which has a reputation as one of the best bird watching
destinations, with over 540 species migrating to the country every year,
the avian flu even helped boost bird watching activities.
"We [ecologists and ornithologists] spoke to the press and managed to make
things clear very early. We explained that there is absolutely no danger
involved in watching wild birds, and we even managed to promote [bird
watching events] through the media," Yoav Perlman, an ornithologist from
the Israel Ornithological Center, told the Taipei Times.
Willie Foo, secretary of the bird group at the Nature Society of Singapore,
said the Singaporean government has put a great deal of effort into
preventing an avian flu outbreak by applying strict rules to the poultry
industry and even buying back domestic birds from private poultry farms.
"But bird watching is different because it is very unlikely that bird
watchers will get infected with the flu, and we will continue to provide
the public with correct information," he said.
About one million migratory birds fly to Taiwan every year, and the Taipei
Bird Watching Fair had attracted more than 6000 visitors on average in
previous years. The 2005 Taipei Bird Watching Fair ends today [13 Nov
2005], but related events run until December 2005.

Taiwan says finds highly pathogenic bird flu strain
---------------------------------------------------
Taiwan found a highly pathogenic strain of avian flu, H7N3, in droppings
left by a migratory bird and is carrying out tests to see whether the virus
has spread to nearby poultry farms, the agriculture department said on
Monday [14 Nov 2005].
Like the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu, which has killed more than 60
people around Asia, the H7N3 strain can infect humans, said an official at
the Council of Agriculture.
"We are most concerned about the H5 and H7, as these 2 can infect people
and fowl," said Huang Kwo-ching, director of the animal health inspection
division at the Council of Agriculture. "We are now carrying out testing at
poultry farms within a 3 km (1.9 mile) radius of the area."
The single sample of H7N3 was found in marsh land in the southern city of
Tainan, the Council of Agriculture said in a statement, adding that no dead
birds were found in the area.
It was the 2nd time the strain has been detected in Taiwan. The 1st case of
H7N3 was discovered in the outskirts of Taipei in April 2005, said the
official.
H7N3, which can potentially be transmitted to humans, was 1st detected in
turkeys in Britain in 1963 and made one of its last known appearances in
poultry in Canada in April and May 2004, according to the World Health
Organization and World Organization for Animal Health. According to the
WHO, H5 and H7 viruses are the only avian influenza subtypes that are
implicated in outbreaks of highly pathogenic disease.
The WHO recommends aggressive control measures, including culling of
infected and exposed poultry, for these 2 subtypes even when the virus
initially shows low pathogenicity.
Taiwan has not experienced a major outbreak of H5N1. Last month [October
2005], the island found only its 2nd case of the deadly strain since 2003
in birds smuggled in a container ship from China. An outbreak of the [low
pathogenic] H5N2 strain of bird flu in Taiwan in 2004 led to the culling of
hundreds of thousands of fowl.

[The avian influenza surveillance activities in domestic and wild birds,
recently enhanced in many countries, will enable better understanding of
the viruses involved with consequently improved HPAI prevention and
control. Taiwan's alertness, including the sampling and testing of wild
birds' droppings in open areas, is exemplary. - Mod.AS]
