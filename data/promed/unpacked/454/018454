Human case of H9N2 avian influenza detected in Hong Kong (SAR)
--------------------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: A 9-month-old girl was infected with
H9N2 -� a less virulent strain of avian influenza
�- in Hong Kong and was being isolated at a
hospital, health officials said Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].

Before becoming sick on 4 Mar 2007, the baby
almost daily visited a food market that sold live
poultry, said Thomas Tsang Ho-fai of the Center
for Health Protection. Officials suspected she
was infected by birds at the market, he said.

H9N2 is a mild strain [of avian influenza A
virus], [the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A
virus] has caused the deaths of at least 169
people worldwide. [The H9N2 virus belongs to a
different serotype of avian influenza A virus and
should not be described as a strain of H5N1
virus. These 2 avian influenza A viruses should
be regarded as distinct viruses differing in
virulence, host range and transmissibility. -
Mod.CP]. "The baby's case is not that serious,
and there's no serious indication that there was
human-to-human infection," Tsang said.

Hong Kong reported 2 cases of the mild strain in
1999 and one in 2003, he said. The patients were
children who all recovered, he said. The recent
case returned home after spending 5 days in the
hospital, but the child was put into isolation
after her samples tested positive for H9N2, said
Tsang, adding that the case was confirmed Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].

Officials were taking more samples from the
market and family members, he said. Hong Kong
aggressively monitors bird flu because an
outbreak [caaused by a highly pathogenic strain
of different serotype - Mod CP.] in 1997 jumped
to humans and killed 6 people. That prompted the
government to slaughter the entire poultry
population of about 1.5 million birds.

[This case has precedents (e.g. see ProMED-mail
posting : Influenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human -
China (Hong Kong) 19990407.0566 and Influenza A
(H9N2), bird-to-human - China (Hong Kong)
19990805.1347). In 1999 an influenza A (H9N2)
virus was isolated from 2 patients (aged one and
4 years old) by the Virus Unit of the Hong Kong
Department of Health. Both girls recovered fully.
This was the 1st occasion that an H9N2 virus had
been isolated from humans in Hong Kong, although
influenza A (H9N2) viruses had been isolated from
ducks and chickens for several years previously.
In both instances the H9N2 virus was isolated
from mildly ill young children and there was no
further spread of infection. The circumstances
surrounding the exposure of these children to infection have not been reported.

Other avian influenza viruses have been isolated
from human patients, notably the H5N1 virus in
Hong Kong in 1997 and subsequently, and H9N2 (and
H5N1) in 2003, and the H7N7 virus in the more
extensive poultry outbreak in the Netherlands
earlier in 2003. On these occasions only the H5N1
viruses caused severe disease in humans. No
evidence of transmission of H9N2 virus among humans was observed. -Mod.CP]
