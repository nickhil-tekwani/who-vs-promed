5000 die annually -- Surge in rabies cases
------------------------------------------
The incidence of rabies is on the rise in Pakistan as at least 5000
deaths are being recorded annually, mostly caused by dog bite. Whereas
rabies cases being reported from India are much higher and one person
is falling prey to this zoonotic viral disease every 20 minutes. This
was stated by speakers at a national seminar on "The awareness and
current status of rabies" organised by the University of Veterinary
and Animal Sciences (UVAS), Epidemiology and the Public Health
Department in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO),
Novartis and Sadaat International at the university conference hall on
Thursday [28 Jul 2011].

Punjab Livestock and Dairy Development Department Secretary Hamid
Yaqoob Sheikh stressed that the health and livestock departments in
collaboration with universities should make efforts to effectively
fight rabies. He said these institutions should also play their role
in creating awareness and preventing the disease in the 1st place.
Referring to nation's joint efforts in times of emergencies and
natural calamities, Mr Sheikh asked why such collaborative efforts
could not be made in normal circumstances. He also urged the experts
to identify causes and reasons for the spread of rabies, its
prevention and cure. He lauded the university's efforts in holding the
national seminar to create awareness among the general public.

UVAS Vice-Chancellor Prof Dr Muhammad Nawaz said rabies was a fatal
disease and an alarming threat for human beings as well as animals. He
called for chalking out a strategy to create awareness among students,
livestock workers and the general public to control the disease. He
said the World Rabies Day would be observed on 28 Sep 2011.

Epidemiology and Public Health Department chairman Prof Dr Athar Khan
said that it was estimated that around 55 000 deaths [annually] were
being reported from across the globe due to zoonotic viral disease and
added that 56 percent of these deaths were occurring in Asia and 44
percent in Africa, particularly in rural areas. He said domestic
animals -- dogs, cats and horses -- were the most important vectors
for the spread and transmission of rabies. He called for immunization
of domestic animals and stressed that the post-exposure immunization
must be carried out in case of a bite from rabid animals.

At the technical session later, experts recommended that veterinarians
and MBBS doctors must be provided with SOPs [standard operating
procedures] to attend rabies cases. It was suggested that surveillance
was essential for detection of high risk areas, outbreaks and
monitoring of the use of vaccine. It was also recommended that
measures should be taken to control the stray dog population.

[Good intentions are admirable, but not enough. According to these
figures Pakistan accounts for 9 percent of the global total of rabies
deaths. A concrete action plan is long overdue. - Mod.CP
