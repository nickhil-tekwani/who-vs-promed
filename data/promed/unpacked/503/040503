[The 1st identification of BTV-1 in Spain (extreme south; see map at
the source URL) follows its 1st identifications in Algeria, Morocco,
and Sardinia during the fall months of 2006.
Updated (23 Nov 2006) information on the genotyping of the Algerian
and Moroccan BTV-1 strains is included in the database of the
Institute of Animal Health (IAH), Pirbright. The BTV-1 phylogenetic
tree, based upon the compared genome segment 2 nucleotide sequences
of BTV-1 isolates in IAH dsRNA virus collection, are divided into an
eastern and a western group. The strains in the eastern group are
from India, Greece, Malaysia, and Australia. The western group, to
which BTV-1 Algeria (ALG2006/01) and BTV-1 Morocco (MOR2006/06) were
added in November 2006, includes also strains from Cameroon
(CAR1982/01), Nigeria (NIG1982/01), Sudan (SUD1987/01), and 2 strains
from South Africa: the reference strain RSArrrr/01 and the vaccine
strain RSAvvvv/01. See
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/BTV1-segment2-tree.htm>.
In 2006, Morocco and Algeria experienced outbreaks of another
newly-introduced orbivirus, namely epizootic haemorrhagic disease
(EHD) in cattle (serotype 9). This virus deserves to be regarded as a
potential invader to southern Europe, similarly to BTV-1. - Mod.AS]
