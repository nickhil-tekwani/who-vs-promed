The Yilan County Public Health Bureau said Wednesday [12 Aug 2020] that several customers and employees in the mass food poisoning case at Hotel Royal Chiaohsi had tested positive for norovirus, though it has not been confirmed as the official cause.

Earlier this month [August 2020], news broke out that 164 people who dined at the Hotel Royal Chiaohsi's buffet restaurant had experienced symptoms of food poisoning, including a group of Chailease Finance Co. employees who were on a company retreat. Of all the afflicted individuals, 92 have sought medical assistance, according to the health bureau.

The bureau said that a few customers and hotel staff members, including 2 restaurant workers, have received a positive result for the norovirus test, but no traces of the virus have been found on any of the kitchenware so far. Since the investigation results will determine the hotel's responsibility and its follow-up settlement, the bureau said more clarification is needed on the true cause of the incident.

The bureau said the investigation report will come out as soon as October [2020], and the hotel will be penalized under the Act Governing Food Safety and Sanitation if norovirus is found to be linked to the mass food poisoning. Meanwhile, the bureau said it had requested the hotel to sanitize the entire building and enhance the health management of its employees, reported CNA [Central News Agency of Taiwan].

In a released statement, Hotel Royal Chiaohsi apologized for neglecting the safety of its customers and failing to provide a comfortable environment. It emphasized that it will take full responsibility of the incident regardless of the final investigation results, promising that all affected customers will be compensated, reported CTWANT [media agency].

[Worldwide, noroviruses are thought to be the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis (diarrhea and vomiting illness). Because there are many different types of noroviruses, exposure to one type may not protect you from other types.

People become infected with noroviruses when they eat or drink contaminated foods and beverages. Raw or undercooked oysters and raw fruits and vegetables have been implicated in some outbreaks. You can also get infected if you touch an object or surface that has been infected with the virus and then touch your nose, mouth, or eyes.

Noroviruses thrive in close quarters, such as restaurants, daycare centers, and nursing homes, because they are hardy and highly contagious. They can survive temperature extremes in water and on surfaces.

Once someone is infected from contaminated food, the virus can quickly pass from person to person through shared food or utensils, by shaking hands, or through other close contact.

When someone with the virus vomits, the virus can spread through the air and contaminate surfaces. The virus also spreads through feces, meaning that someone who doesn't thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom can pass it along. Dirty diapers can also harbor norovirus.

Young children, the elderly, and people who have a weakened immune system are particularly susceptible to catching noroviruses. The spread of the virus can be hard to control because it's contagious before symptoms appear. That is, you can spread the infection before you know you're sick.

In the outbreak reported in Taiwan, it may have been a customer or employee or contaminated food that initiated the outbreak. The hotel was not necessarily neglectful. Possibly the ongoing investigation will determine the origin of the outbreak.
