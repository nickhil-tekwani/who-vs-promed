A case of Q fever was registered at the end of February [2022] in Mavrinci in the area of Čavle Municipality, near the area of a goat pen. So far, 75.82% of adults have been vaccinated in PGC [Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]. At the end of the month, a new protein vaccine is expected to arrive.

Until yesterday [Fri 18 Mar 2022], 9 people were confirmed positive for Q fever by serological testing at the Public Health Teaching Institute of the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County. In total, about 20 people are suspected of being infected, but none of them have developed serious symptoms so far and all the positive ones are on home treatment.

"We have about 20 people who are suspected of being infected and it will be a dynamic process when it comes to proving the infection," says the chief county epidemiologist from the Teaching Institute for Public Health of PGC, Dr. Dobrica Roncevic.

In his opinion, the most important thing at the moment is that the Veterinary Inspection examines all suspected herds in the area of Grobinšćina, where the infection was detected, in order to prevent the risk of further transmission of the infection, which is not transmitted from person-to-person.

Until now, cases of Q fever have spread in our area at this time of year, but these were previously in more rural areas, such as Krk or Crikvenica, and the cases are currently closest to an urban environment. Q fever is caused by bacteria that have great similarities with a virus [?] and can be introduced into the body by ingestion, i.e. consumption of food products of infected animals, but the most risky way is to inhale bacteria and a small infectious dose is enough to infect, explains [Dr] Roncevic. The diagnosis of Q fever is successfully treated with antibiotics.

Q fever was registered at the end of February [2022] in Mavrinci in the Čavle Municipality, near the area of a goat and sheep pen, and the residents of this municipality have been told to take care of hygiene and avoid staying near places where flocks of sheep are found.

Sheep, cows, and goats are the most common reservoirs of this infection for humans, and this disease can be both acute and chronic. Acute disease most often leads to fever and respiratory infection, while chronically this disease manifests itself as endocarditis and hepatitis.

An unpleasant disease appeared at the end of February [2022] in the Čavjan [Cavle?] settlement, a place near Rijeka in Croatia, in an area with 3 goat and sheep pens.

Q fever has been detected in the settlement of Mavrinci in the municipality of Čavle. It is a disease characterized by extremely high fever, severe headache, cough and pneumonia.

Given that the symptoms are similar to COVID, influenza and seasonal viruses, and that this disease is not remembered in this area, general practitioners have been informed about it.

A letter from the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County Public Health Institute to the Čavle Municipality states that 7 cases have been discovered, the first patient falling ill at the end of February this year [2022].

"Patients have general and respiratory symptoms, have been treated by family doctors, and some have been diagnosed with atypical pneumonia," writes Novi list.

Testing of patients has been proposed, and Q fever has been found in those tested, with certainty in 7 people, and the number of patients is even higher at at least 20.

An epidemiological inspection was carried out consisting of an epidemiologist, a sanitary engineer and a field veterinarian, and 3 towers in the area were visited. It was determined that one pen was 100 meters (328 feet) away from the settlement, and the other 500 meters (1640 feet) away.

An important note is that the disease is transmitted by air, by inhalation of particles, and is not transmitted from person to person. Due to the above, the Municipality of Čavle calls on the locals to increase hygiene and avoid walking near the forest where there is a flock of sheep.

"If you recognize these symptoms, be sure to contact your family doctor for additional testing, because the disease is successfully treated with antibiotics," said the Municipality of Cavle.

What is Q fever
Q fever is an acute infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_, and is manifested by a sudden onset -- fever, headache and intense sweating. The disease may be accompanied by pneumonitis. Incubation lasts 2 to 3 three weeks.

_Coxiella burnetii_ is an intracellular parasite that can produce spores. It is a highly infectious bacterium and it is believed that just one inhaled microorganism can cause infection.

The source of infection is infected domestic animals, most often sheep and cows. _Coxiella burnetii_ reproduces in the placenta and fertile [uteri] of infected animals, and during lambing or calving, a large amount of the pathogen is released into the environment, creating an aerosol that everyone present can inhale.

The frequency is highest in the spring, but it is present throughout the year.

[The 2 news reports above disagree on the number (7 vs 9) of confirmed cases of Q fever, but they do agree on the number of suspected cases (20) and they answer a question I had with the first report of this Q fever outbreak in Croatia (ProMED post Q fever - Croatia: (PG) RFI 20220319.8702080) - what was the exposure to Q fever for the infected individuals? The news reports say those infected in Mavrinci in Čavle Municipality (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Čavle) were near several pens of goats and sheep, the suspected source of Q fever. We await confirmation of _Coxiella burnetii_ infection in the suspected herds.

Q fever is a zoonosis caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, a rickettsia-like bacterium. The most common animal reservoirs of this organism are cattle, sheep, and goats. Infected animals excrete the bacterium in milk, urine, feces, and birth by-products, especially the placenta. Q fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ that can be dispersed for a considerable distance to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (https://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to spore-like particles the organism forms in mammalian cells as part of a biphasic developmental cycle (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3949614/). These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.

Rarely, Q fever has been spread person-to-person through blood transfusion, from a pregnant woman to her fetus, through sex, infected breast milk, clustered familial cases, and nosocomial infection during delivery or autopsies (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/58/11/e146/2895430 and https://www.cdc.gov/qfever/transmission/index.html).

Although often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis/endarteritis) (http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short). The patients at highest risk for chronic Q fever are those with pre-existing valvular heart disease, a vascular graft, or an arterial aneurysm and pregnancy (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178). Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.

During pregnancy, Q fever may result in obstetric complications, such as placental infection, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, intrauterine fetal death, premature delivery, and maternal chronic Q fever (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/45/5/548/273863).

Croatia (pop., nearly 3.9 million residents) is a member of the European Union and borders Slovenia to the northwest, Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to the southeast, and shares a coastline along the Adriatic Sea. Croatia's capital and largest city is Zagreb, and agriculture accounts for 3.7% of the country's GDP. Primorje-Gorski Kotar (Primorsko-Goranska) County is in western Croatia on the Adriatic coastline. Mavrinci is a village with about 1020 residents (https://mapcarta.com/N2234995327).
