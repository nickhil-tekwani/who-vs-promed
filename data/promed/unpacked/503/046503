Cases of typhoid are still being reported in Harare's high-density suburbs every day since the outbreak of the disease in October 2011. Head of Harare's 2 infectious disease hospitals, Beatrice and Wilkins, Clemence Duri said most of the cases were emanating from Dzivarasekwa and Kuwadzana high-density suburbs, areas which always experience frequent water cuts.

"As of [1 Jan 2012], we were receiving 90 cases per day in Dzivarasekwa and Kuwadzana which were the highest number of cases but now we are getting less than 20," Duri said. "Admissions are now very few compared to January [2012]. We have since adopted a preventive strategy because of the risk that it can spread to other areas."

More than 4000 cases of typhoid have been recorded in Harare since October 2011 while nearly 1000 people have been treated for dysentery in the past 2 months.

With the sudden change in temperature, typhoid has reared its ugly head in the city. And hospitals have started getting 40-45 cases of typhoid accompanied with diarrhea daily, especially in children.

"We have been getting cases of typhoid and 10 to 12 children are being diagnosed with the disease every day. With the rise in temperature, the bacteria causing it are expected to only multiply," said Dr Sadbhavna Pandit, a paediatrician at Government Multispecialty Hospital, 16.

Typhoid can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread.

"Unhygienic food and cut fruits are one of the prime causes of typhoid. Also, sources where contaminated water supply exists must be checked from time to time," said Dr Vikas Goyal, a city-based physician.

The Ministry of health in Samoa is investigating the cause of a typhoid fever outbreak at the main Tafaigata prison after 10 confirmed cases among inmates.

The prisoners are being treated at the prison by doctors and cannot be admitted at the national hospital as part of measures to avoid the disease spreading.

A health consultant at the ministry, Leausa Tole'afoa Dr Take Naseri, has told local television that an investigation has found that fresh water supply for prisoners at the main prison is not safe. He said sanitation and hygiene are also being looked at.
