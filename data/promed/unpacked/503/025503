Outbreak sickens 10 in Yamhill County
-------------------------------------
Public health officials are investigating an outbreak of a dangerous
bacterial infection that struck several people who attended a Yamhill
County camp gathering last week. As many as 120 people may be at risk of
developing _E. coli_ O157, a strain of bacteria that can cause bloody
diarrhea, cramps and kidney problems, said Mel Kohn, state epidemiologist
in the Department of Human Services.
By early Fri, 27 May 2005, at least 10 cases of people infected with _E.
coli_ O157 had been confirmed. "I do expect that number to rise
considerably as we talk to more people," Kohn said.
None of the confirmed infections resulted in hospitalization for kidney
problems. Health officials said that anyone with symptoms should seek
immediate medical care and anyone who attended Camp Yamhill since 16 May
2005 should contact their local health department.
_E. coli_ O157 often is transmitted through eating undercooked meat,
swimming in contaminated water, touching infected animals or drinking
unpasteurized milk, juice or contaminated water. Infected people also can
transmit the illness to others. Children who develop the infection are
particularly at risk of kidney failure, which can result in death, Kohn said.
The bacteria apparently struck teenage and adult campgoers between 17-20
May 2005 at Camp Yamhill, a camp focused on promoting Christian
values. The camp is about 8 miles west of Yamhill. Staff members
voluntarily closed the grounds Fri, 27 May 2005, while authorities
investigated the cause of the outbreak, said Greg Williams, the camp
operations manager. He said the camp is expected to reopen Sun, 29 May 2005.
"None of the staff here or none of the groups that followed were sick,"
Williams said, noting that the outbreak appeared to affect people taking
part in the camp's Christian Outdoor School program. People who arrived at
the camp for another session on 20 May 2005 did not report becoming ill, he
said.
Health officials from the state and from Clackamas, Lane, Marion,
Multnomah, Polk and Yamhill counties are investigating the outbreak.
