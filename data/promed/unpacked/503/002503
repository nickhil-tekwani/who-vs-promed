[According to the report above, a total of 82 886 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 1 case in the 24 hours since yesterday's (6 May 2020) report. The newly reported case is a local case in Jilin. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were 4 newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. A total of 1680 imported cases have been identified.

There were 16 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, all local cases. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 854, and 71 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. While there had been locally transmitted cases in both Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, there has been 1 new reported case in Guangdong on 6 May 2020 and no reports of cases in Heilongjiang since 30 Apr 2020. In recent days the main concern are importations. That being said, the identification of a locally acquired case in Jilin is of concern as a signal there is transmission ongoing under the radarscope.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 12 cases and 0 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (6 to 7 May 2020) when there were 4 newly confirmed cases and 1 death. A total of 10 822 confirmed cases and 256 deaths were reported today (7 May 2020), up from 10 810 cases and 256 deaths yesterday (6 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 36 consecutive days and below 50 for 29 consecutive days. Once again, Gyeonggi region reported the only local case while the remaining 11 newly confirmed cases were imported cases, 3 in Daegu and the quarantine facility, 2 in Busan, and 1 each in Gyeonggi, Chungbuk, and Jeonbuk. With the occurrence of locally acquired COVID-19 in Gyeonggi 2 consecutive days, transmission has not as yet been interrupted, the move to social distancing helped impact local transmission. As they move to the next phase "distancing in daily life", all eyes will be on the country to see if they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be the main problem at this point in time.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 215 858 cases, including 29 958 deaths, up from 214 457 cases and 29 684 deaths reported on 6 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 6 and 7 May 2020 was 1401 newly confirmed cases, compared with 1444 newly confirmed cases between 5 and 6 May 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 78.4% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 51.4% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont are the only provinces reporting 100 or more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 10 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 6 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through, 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out. See section [7] from COVID-19-update (157): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local transm, Italy phase 2 20200505.7300349 for details on phase 2 opening.

[4] Iran: 103 135 total cases, 6476 deaths
Date: Thu 7 May 2020
Source: Al Monitor [edited]

Iran's total number of confirmed coronavirus cases have jumped 50% roughly 3 weeks after the country initiated a phased reopening.

According to Ministry of Health spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour, Iran registered 1485 new cases over the last 24 hours, bringing the total of confirmed cases to 103 135. Since yesterday [6 May 2020], 68 deaths have been reported, bringing the total number of deaths to 6476. These figures do not take into account individuals who stayed home and weren't tested, or those who have died of other diseases while also having the virus that causes COVID-19.

The spike in new cases is a worrying sign as the country prepares to take further steps to open up the economy. After a nearly nationwide shutdown that closed schools and mosques, prevented traffic across province, and closed or partially closed office spaces, Iran initiated a phased reopening in so-called white spots where infection rates were low on [11 Apr 2020]. On [14 Apr 2020], it seemed the country was moving in a positive direction with the lowest number of new cases being reported in over a month.

The measures taken in mid-April [2020] appeared to have been effective as far as slowing the spread of the coronavirus. During a 7-day period from [27 Apr 2020] to [3 May 2020], the country's daily infection rate was 1112 at its highest and 802 at its lowest, averaging 991 new cases a day. However, since [3 May 2020], the numbers have continued to climb. The new number of cases reported today, that is, 1485, is a 50% increase from this average.

The Iranian authorities, particularly the Health Ministry and the National Coronavirus Combat and Prevention Headquarters, have warned that despite the relaxing measures, the country is still not in the clear and health guidelines and preventive measures are needed.

On [8 May 2020], mosques in regions with low infection numbers will open for the 1st time since the nationwide shutdown. The decision to open up the mosques was made by the National Coronavirus Combat and Prevention Headquarters, which President Hassan Rouhani chairs. According to Tasnim News Agency, all but 10 of Iran's 31 provinces will have cities with mosques that are open for Friday sermons, though not necessarily every city in those provinces will be open. Mosques in provinces that are labeled red spots will be closed still, which include the political capital Tehran, the religious capital Qom, west Azerbaijan, Ilam, north Khorasan, Zanjan, Semnan, Ghazvin, Kashan, and Hamedan.

On [16 May 2020], schools will open so that teachers will have enough time to finish the curriculum and students to take their exams before the summer vacation.

Today [7 May 2020], Rouhani said that the Health Ministry would continue to screen citizens for COVID-19. Until now, much of the screening was done via phone and referring those with symptoms to local testing centers or hospitals.

[In the 24 hours from 6 to 7 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 101 650 to 103 135, an increase of 1485 compared with 1680 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (6 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6418 to 6476, an increase of 58 deaths in the 24-hour period (as of 7 May 2020). In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran now ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Italy, UK, Russia, France, Germany, Brazil, and Turkey. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening and unfortunately it appears as though the opening may have been too premature. A caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag time between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so relying on the daily number of deaths at this point may be premature as well. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 292 623, including 76 928 deaths, an increase from 263 092 cases and 74 799 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 337 421 (26.1%) cumulative case reports and 3930 (13.3%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 174 709 as of 1:30 PM on 7 May 2020, including 14 162 confirmed deaths and an additional 5378 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (2641 -- 8.9%), New Jersey (2047 -- 6.9%), California (1746 -- 5.9% of total), Massachusetts (1696 -- 5.7%), Virginia (1314 -- 4.5%), Texas (1220 -- 4.1%), Maryland (1211 -- 4.1%), and Pennsylvania (1104 -- 3.7%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Connecticut.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, UK, Russia, France, Germany, Brazil, New Jersey, and Turkey as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 China, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Illinois, 15 Canada, 16 California, 17 Peru, 18 India, 19 Pennsylvania, and 20 Belgium. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City would be between France and Germany (it would be number 7 - an improvement from 2 days ago when it was number 5).

The US military has confirmed 7702 cumulative cases, with 98 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 10 396 cumulative cases and 242 new cases today (7 May 2020). There have been 2890 cases reported from federal prisons (425 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 2654 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (95 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 2031 cases (63 new cases in the past 24 hours). Other states with increased activity include Minnesota with 786 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, and Iowa with 655 newly confirmed cases.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations and not antibody based to WHO, effective 25 Apr 2020. The antibody confirmed cases are now available in Table 4 which presents all cases including all tests performed. There were 754 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the 24 hour period from 5 to 6 May 2020, bringing the PCR [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 221 447 [256 855] as compared with 220 325 [253 682] confirmed cases on 5 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 40.15, a continual slow decrease over the past 28 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 40.15 today (7 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases.
