Several commercial farms have been put under 21 days of quarantine
after a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) alert. The alert came after 2
buffaloes were sighted in the Otjozondjupa region on 16 Aug 2011 in
the Ekwenye area of the Okakarara Constituency.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry announced this week
that precautionary measures were immediately implemented in several
regions after the African buffaloes were spotted. The African
buffaloes are "known carriers of the virus which causes FMD, a highly
contagious disease of livestock," the ministry stated.

Immediate steps were taken to identify whether the animals were
infected, as the ministry wants to prevent a ban of exports of animals
and animal products from Namibia. "Laboratory test samples were
collected and are being analysed," but by yesterday [29 Aug 2011],
results were not available.

A total of 33 commercial farms in the Okahandja district and a further
49 commercial farms in the Grootfontein district have been closed
temporarily, state veterinarians confirmed yesterday [29 Aug 2011].
The number of farms in the Gobabis and Otjiwarongo districts could not
be confirmed by the time of going to print. But reports state that
more than 100 farms in total have been affected.

The ministry has confirmed that immediately after the buffaloes were
sighted, officials were deployed to track them down, and they were
destroyed.

Affected areas which have been declared as restricted -- where cattle,
sheep, goats, pigs, game and any cloven-hoofed animals may not be
removed for a minimum of 21 days -- include farms and communal areas
in the Otjozondjupa and Omaheke regions. In addition, any farms which
have received animals from restricted areas have had a 21-day ban
imposed on them.

In addition, the ministry has instructed that animal gathering
activities such as auctions and shows in the restricted areas are to
be suspended for a minimum of 21 days. Roadblocks have been set up at
strategic points in order to ensure compliance with the measures.

[Namibia is one of 9 OIE member countries which are recognised as
having an FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised, according
to the provisions of Chapter 8.5. of the Terrestrial Code. The zone
was designated by the Delegate of Namibia in a document addressed to
the Director General in February 1997.

In April 2010, Namibia reported a single outbreak of FMD serotype SAT1
in its FMD-infected zone in the Caprivi, where there are free-roaming
wild African buffaloes. The outbreak was located in the infected zone
and had no effect on the status of the FMD-free zone where vaccination
is not practised. See the notification, with map, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9143.

The area described in the current event (map at
http://healthmap.org/r/1cbv) is within the FMD-free zone, explaining
the severe precautionary measures undertaken to avoid harm to the
country's FMD status, which enables exports, one of Namibia's main
sources of income. Further information, including maps of Namibia's
FMD zoning, can be found at
http://www.nammic.com.na/pdf/Foot_Mouthdisease.pdf.

It is to be hoped that the 2 African buffaloes (_Cyncerus caffer_,
picture at http://www.hlasek.com/syncerus_caffer_bb6804.html) will
be found not to have been infected. The swift move to implement
preventive measures is expected to exclude infection of domestic
animals. Results are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
