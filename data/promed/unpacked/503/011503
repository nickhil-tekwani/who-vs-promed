Fifty years of struggle to control cutaneous leishmaniasis in the highest endemic county in Iran: A longitudinal observation inferred with interrupted time series model
Aflatoonian M, Sharifii I, Behnaz Aflatoonian, B, et al. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2022 Apr 29;16(4):e0010271. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010271.

Negligible data are available following major social activities and environmental changes on leishmaniasis. Therefore, how interactions between these events influence cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) risk is not well-known. This longitudinal study was undertaken to explore the impact of interventions conducted between 1971 and 2020 in Bam county, which has had the highest disease burden in Iran.

Only confirmed CL cases during this period were taken into account. Data were analyzed by SPSS 22 using the X2 test to assess the significance of the difference between proportions. Moreover, we used interrupted time series (ITS) to assess the impact of 3 environmental events during this period.

Overall, 40 164 cases of CL occurred in the past 5 decades. Multiple complex factors were among the leading causes that synergistically induced the emergence/re-emergence of CL outbreaks in Bam. The main factors attributed negatively to CL control were cessation of malaria spraying activity, expansion of the city spaces, and a massive earthquake creating new breeding potentials for the vectors. The highest impact on CL incidence during these years was related to the earthquake [coefficient = 17.8 (95% CI: 11.3, 22.7); p-value <0.001].

Many factors can contribute to CL outbreaks in endemic foci. They also can cause new foci in new areas. Since humans are the single reservoir for CL in this area, early detection and effective management significantly contribute to controlling CL to reduce the disease burden. However, essential evidence gaps remain, and new tools are crucial before the disease can ultimately be controlled. Nevertheless, sustained funding and more trained task forces are essential to strengthen surveillance and case management and monitor the interventions' impact.

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by _Leishmania major_ is endemic and very common in many rural areas, especially in the plains of the northeast, near the Russian border, and in the north of the Esfahan province, in the centre of the country, but has recently spread to its southern parts and to Fars province, in southwest Iran. About 70% of CL in Iran is caused by _L.major_. The endemicity is so high that almost 80% of the rural population contracts the disease before the age of 10 and non-immune newcomers practically all become infected. This area may be the most important focus. However, a recent epidemiological survey in 3 villages in the Shiraz province, where underreporting was suspected, found a prevalence of scars of 16.2% and of infection (identified by PCR) of 23% (Jorge Alvar et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671). - Mod.EP
