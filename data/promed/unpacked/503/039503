[1] Case update
25 May 2018. Epidemiological situation
Democratic Republic of Congo, Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=79e84a129f

The epidemiological status of Ebola virus disease dated 24 May 2018:
- A total of 54 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 35 confirmed, 13 probable and 6 suspected.
- 4 new suspected cases, including 2 in Bikoro, 1 in Iboko, 1 in Wangata.
- 4 new confirmed cases in Iboko, 1 of which died a few hours after collection (admission or collection of biological sample).
- 2 negative tests: 1 Wangata, 1 Bikoro.

Remarks
-------
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News about the Ebola response
-----------------------------
The Minister of Health went to Mbandaka to carry out a vaccination campaign against Ebola.
- During his field trip to Mbandaka, the Minister of Health took the opportunity to be vaccinated against the Ebola virus, setting an example for the entire Mbandaka community.
- Nevertheless, the Minister of Health was keen to mention that the vaccine, which is given following all the protocols put in place by the health professionals on the spot, is only one of many methods, and that it does not completely prevent the recipient from becoming infected with the Ebola virus. The recommended effective preventive measures remain which are; to avoid any contact with a living or dead person with the virus; to respect hygiene measures; to handle cases rapidly and to trace the contacts.

Beginning the training of telephone advisers to respond to Ebola virus disease in Kinshasa.
- In order to inform the population about the Ebola virus disease, a green line (call center) has been set up and is accessible to the entire population.
- It will be composed of a team of 36 telephone advisors who have started a series of training sessions allowing them to ensure a fast and efficient service.
- To date, call center agents have been trained on the general features of the Ebola virus disease, the frequently asked questions and the presentations of the different communication media available to them.

Their mission will be:
- To inform the public by telephone about issues related to the Ebola virus disease (means of prevention, symptoms, incubation period, etc.).
- Provide guidance and advice to correspondents on government responses to the Ebola response (vaccine, preventive methods, etc.).
- Record information, complaints and recommendations from the public.
You can now call 472222 for information on Ebola virus disease (Only for Vodacom, Airtel and Orange networks).

A meeting organized by Monsignor Fridolin Ambongo to raise awareness for the population of Mbandaka.
- To include the government in the Ebola response, social elements in Equateur such as churches, traditional leaders, associations, etc. have been mobilized to relay the messages of awareness and prevention of the Ebola virus disease and to overcome resistance encountered on the ground.
- For example, Monsignor Fridolin Ambongo, Co-adjutor Archbishop of Kinshasa, held a meeting in Mbandaka to raise awareness and encourage the population to join the government and its partners in the response to the Ebola virus disease, which is a public health issue and a concern for all Congolese.

[2] Public fears, government responses
- 25 May 2018. Fear and suspicion hinder Congo medics in Ebola battle.
Reuters [edited]

With more than twice as many Ebola outbreaks as any other country since the virus was discovered in 1976, Congolese are familiar with its destructive power, yet fear and suspicion of medical authorities are still hindering efforts at containment.

Health officials say they are working hard to get out accurate information about the deadly hemorrhagic fever but face significant mistrust in a part of Africa where many place more faith in clerics in white collars than doctors in white coats.

A doctor and a nursing sister were threatened by locals after they were accused of bringing the disease to their communities, while people in one town prevented medics from testing the body of someone suspected to have died from Ebola, officials said.

"The information campaign is being put in place but is still insufficient," Medecins Sans Frontieres' (MSF) emergency medical coordinator Jean-Clement Cabrol told reporters in Geneva on [Thu 24 May 2018]. "Religious and traditional leaders in communities are not being used enough," he said.

Congo's government, the World Health Organization (WHO) and aid agencies are racing to contain what could be the most dangerous of Democratic Republic of Congo's 9 epidemics since it was discovered by northern Congo's eponymous river 4 decades ago.

Its appearance in the northwestern river port city of Mbandaka this time gives it a potential clear shot at the capital Kinshasa, a chaotic city of more than 10 million inhabitants that lies downstream. Since April [2018], the disease is thought to have killed at least 22 people and infected 30 more.

Most people Reuters reporters spoke to in Mbandaka this week said they were pleased by the authorities' energetic response. Even so, rumors about the outbreak's real origins abound. "Our grandparents lived a long time here in Mbandaka and they never experienced this," said a merchant named Yvonne. "This is sorcery."

In one of the more alarming developments in the outbreak to date, family members of 2 Ebola patients removed them from an isolation ward in Mbandaka on [Mon 21 May 2018] night, walking them out of the hospital before putting them on the back of motorcycles. One was taken to a nearby evangelical church, according to health officials and a source at the church, where she - by now vomiting and unable to walk - joined 19 other people for prayers in a cramped tin-roofed building.

She returned to hospital before succumbing to the illness the next night [Tue 22 May 2018]. The other patient was taken home, where he died hours later, leaving health officials scrambling to locate their contacts across the city of 1.5 million people.

A witness at the church, who declined to be named, said the woman came to testify that God had cured her of her illness. "We prayed for her," he said, shortly before she died. Health officials later turned up at the church to vaccinate several people who had been in contact with her.

When Ebola hit the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2013 and 2014, killing more than 11 000 people, suspicion of health workers in their spacesuit-like protective gear also prompted patients to flee, helping accelerate the disease's spread.

Health workers find themselves having to strike a delicate balance: restricting Ebola patients' movements but without antagonizing communities whose cooperation is vital.

[These incidents illustrate some of the cultural and social factors in the DRC that were highlighted in our 25 May posting [Ebola Update (16), part 2]. The MSF coordinator is quoted here as saying that community religious and traditional leaders are not being used enough to help prevent such incidents. To the central government's credit, per the report [1] above, it is organizing an information campaign that includes a central telephone hotline and awareness meetings by leaders such as Monsignor Ambongo, who is also the current Archbishop of Mbandaka-Bikoro. But it does take time to organize and coordinate public and private information campaigns, particularly in countries with weak civil society institutions. - Mod.LXL]

- 26 May 2018. Kinshasa strengthens surveillance measures on the Congo River
Radio Okapi [in French, machine trans., edited] https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/05/26/actualite/sante/ebola-kinshasa-renforce-des-mesures-de-surveillance-sur-le-fleuve-congo

The city of Kinshasa is stepping up surveillance measures against Ebola haemorrhagic fever, along the Congo River. According to the Minister of Transport and Communications, Jos√© Makila, who announced it [Fri 25 May 2018], it is mainly a matter of verifying that all people in the boats do not show any signs of the virus.

"No traffic at night. From 18 hours [6 pm], carriers must spend the night where they are. Bring the river boats back to the shores so that the Ministry of Health can carry out checks," said Makila.

The minister said a monitoring team of officials from his ministry has been deployed since [Thu 24 May 2018], on the river aboard a boat. The team's mission is to help Ministry of Health officials detect all suspected cases in boats along the river.

- 24 May 2018. Congo says confirmed Ebola cases have reached 31; 9 deaths
ABC News [edited]
https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/congo-ebola-cases-reached-30-warns-rumors-55402507 [Byline: Saleh Mwanamilongo]

Congo's fight to rein in a deadly Ebola outbreak has authorities crossing the border to buy up available thermometers, a World Health Organization official said as the health ministry on [Thu 24 May 2018] announced that confirmed cases had reached 31, including 9 deaths.

The spread of the often lethal hemorrhagic fever to a provincial capital of 1.2 million people has health officials scrambling to monitor for Ebola at busy ports in the capital, Kinshasa, which is downstream from the infected city of Mbandaka on the Congo River.

Mbandaka is one of 3 health zones with confirmed Ebola cases, complicating efforts to find and monitor hundreds of people who have been in contact with those infected. Two of the zones are rural and remote, with few roads or other infrastructure.

In Kinshasa, travelers streamed off boats at ports on the Congo River and ran a gauntlet of health officials watching for signs of infection.

"We want to ensure that ports and airports are effectively protected," WHO's Congo representative Allarangar Yakouide told The Associated Press. "I assure you, we have already taken all the thermometers that are in Kinshasa, practically all the thermometers, and there are even colleagues who are going on the other side to Brazzaville to buy thermometers."

The Republic of Congo's capital is across the river from Kinshasa, a city of 10 million.

[In addition to the "soft power" approach of information campaigns and persuasion, it is also incumbent on state and local governments to exercise their authority over people's movements during a public health crisis. This includes restricting patient movements and monitoring patient contacts, to relieve the burden faced by healthcare workers. Government authority also extends to setting up fever symptom checkpoints at major road, river, and border crossings, as illustrated by the above examples. But then the question arises: just what do transportation security personnel do with someone who is found to be febrile? Is he or she directed or escorted to a health care facility? And at what point would that person be considered a "case on alert"? ("Case on alert": for case definition, see the 25 May 2018 Ebola Update (16), part 4: Case terminology).

In addition, it is surprising that there hasn't been more coverage about quarantining patient contacts and families, since that is a proven strategy for containing an outbreak. As the Minister of Health himself pointed out in the Ministry's 25 May 2018 bulletin, the vaccine is not completely protective and should not be viewed as a panacea. For optimal containment, therefore, high-risk contacts (such as those churchgoers in Mbandaka who were exposed to vomiting patients only hours before their deaths) should not only be vaccinated, but also be quarantined - typically in their own homes - to be monitored daily for fever and other symptoms and signs of infection, for the entire potential incubation period of 21 days after exposure. Of course, such quarantine imposes a great burden on contacts and their families, unable to venture out of their homes to work or even shop for food. Household quarantine entails a whole other level of social supports, such as the home food deliveries that were provided by FAO and local agencies during the 2014-2015 West African outbreak. - Mod.LXL]
