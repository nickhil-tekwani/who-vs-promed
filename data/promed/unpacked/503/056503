Epidemic situation for acute respiratory infections and influenza
-----------------------------------------------------------------
During the week 26 Oct to 1 Nov 2009 the epidemic threshold was
exceeded in 25 cities and 11 administrative divisions:

- in all age groups in several regions, including Moscow, Pskov,
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Chelyabinsk, and Krasnoyarsk,

- in the 0-2 year age group in 18 cities and 2 administrative divisions,

- in age group 3-6 years in 16 cities and 3 administrative divisions.

- in the 7-14 year old age group in other regions, including Magadan,
Murmansk and Kaliningrad, in 28 cities and 7 administrative divisions,

- in the age group 15 years and older, in 25 cities and 3
administrative divisions.

According to Rospotrebnadzor [the public health service] schools and
other educational institutions are being closed as an anti-epidemic
measure across the country. As of 2 Nov 2009, 3122 cases of [pandemic]
A/H1N1 influenza have been confirmed. There were 19 fatalities, of
whom 14 were confirmed as influenza cases. There were 9 fatalities in
the period between 30 Oct and 2 Nov 2009. The greatest number of
deaths occurred in Moscow, Krasnoyarsk, Zabaykalye, Khabarovsk, the
Primorskiy Krai and Sakhalin Oblast. The surveillance of acute
respiratory viral infections and influenza (including [pandemic]
A/H1/N1) is being conducted on a daily basis.

The immunization coverage as of 9 Nov 2009 was 22 717 527 doses or 16
percent of the total population. 623 277 people had been inoculated
with Grippol vaccine (94.4 percent coverage of all eligible), and 13
190 751 people with Grippol Plus vaccine (64.4 percent coverage of all
eligible). All these vaccines were administered within the national
"Health" project. An additional 3 293 999 people had been inoculated
and paid for by other funding sources.

[The vaccine coverage is impressive. Grippol vaccine consists of
highly purified surface protective antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and
neuraminidase (NA) isolated from purified flu viruses type A (H1N1 and
H3N2) and type B [i.e., it is a seasonal influenza vaccine], bounded
with high molecular carrier --immunostimulant Polyoxidonium (PO). A
single immunizing dose is 0.5 ml with 5 plus or minus 1 mcg of HA of
each of the 3 epidemic flu strains, annually recommended by WHO, and
500 mcg of PO. Presence of immunostimulant PO is the main Grippol
peculiarity. Modification of HA with PO enhances stability and
immunogenicity, provides a high degree of safety, forming long-lasting
immune memory and high prophylactic efficacy. Macromolecular
polymer-subunit structure permits providing antigen presentation
similar to that of the virion. See:

100 "swine" flu cases have been confirmed in Belorus
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) has reported approximately 102 [pandemic]
influenza A (H1N1) [2009] cases in Belorus. The MOH report says that
the situation in some regions is tense. The 102 confirmed cases
represent 0.3 percent of the diagnostic tests performed. The Minister
of Health said during a TV interview that 1300 educational
institutions across the country have been closed to stop the spread of
infection.

A complex situation exists in Minsk [the capital of Belorus] but it is
manageable. The numbers of requested doctor visits is decreaseing, the
most recent numbers are between 4 to 25 percent of all visits. The
same tendency is true for Minsk as well. It is believed that extension
of school vacations has helped to avoid a larger epidemic.

The President of Belorus stated on 5 Nov 2009 that the concern about
the severity of the epidemic is unwarranted and exacerbated by the
attitude of the pharmaceutical industry. He said influenza, even
"swine" [i.e., pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection], is not [as
serious] as plague or cholera, it is curable. He also acknowledged the
efforts of health workers who have successfully managed not only the
epidemic situation but also the panic around it. The president
emphasized that last year 21 people had died from pneumonia in the
country, whereas only 19 pneumonia deaths have been registered this
year with only 6 suspected to be due to influenza.

The number of "swine" flu cases has increased 1.5-fold in 24 hours
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) of Moldova reported that the number of
influenza [pandemic] A (H1N1) [2009] cases has increased from 174 to
268 in 24 hours. All the cases received appropriate treatment and
their contacts are under observation, the Ministry said.

The autumn school vacation has been prolonged for a week from 8 Nov to
15 Nov 2009. The ministry also recommended against sending children to
kindergartens and to avoiding travel to high risk countries. There
have been 3 fatal influenza cases in the country. The 1st fatality
occurred on 24 Oct 2009 when a 50-year-old man died after returning
from Poland. The 2nd case was a 35-year-old man who had traveled to
Moscow. The 3rd was a 46-year-old man who died in an intensive care
unit on 7 Nov 2009 after returning from Moscow. The physicians say
that he applied for medical care too late.
