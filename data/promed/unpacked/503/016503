Issuance of fake yellow fever cards, otherwise known as International Certificates of Vaccination (ICV), to travellers is reported to be thriving in Kaduna State. The card is required for entering certain countries.

Daily Trust learned that some unauthorised persons or agents are issuing yellow fever cards to unsuspecting individuals in Kaduna.

The Minister of Health, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, last year [2013] urged travellers still using the old yellow fever cards to replace them with the new encoded ones. He also noted that foreign countries had been informed not to recognise the old card by 1 Oct 2013.

Alhaji Suleiman Abdulkadir, a resident of Kaduna, told Daily Trust that he was given a yellow fever card at the health office of the Kaduna North Local Government secretariat in October last year [2013], which he said was rejected at the embassy as it was said to be fake.

"I reported to the Federal Ministry of Health in Abuja, where it was also confirmed that the card was fake. The original one that the federal government advertised is being sold for N 1000 [USD 6.00], including the vaccine, but at the Kaduna North LG secretariat, I was charged N 2000 [USD 12.00] for each of the 4 cards I was issued, yet I was given a fake one; it is not even the amount that matters but the implications of holding a fake card, which is more than the N 2000 [USD 12.00]. Now, embassies are rejecting it," he said.

Deputy Director in the press office of the Federal Ministry of Health in Abuja, Clement Egbeama, said: "I think what they refer to as fake yellow fever cards are the old ones that are no longer acceptable anywhere." He noted that the new one has security feature just like the Nigerian currency and is a little bigger and stronger than the old one. The texts on the cover of the new card are printed in silver. "Unlike the old card, the new one cannot be printed anywhere because of the security feature, and the sensitive material used and the stamps on the card are in blue colour," he added.

On who has the mandate to issue the card, he said initially only the Federal Ministry of Health was issuing it to travellers at the cost of N 1000 [USD 6.00], but now it has been extended to all states except Kaduna and Plateau because they have not got offices for that purpose.

Our reporter who visited the Kaduna North Local Government secretariat to demand the card was told that it was not available in Kaduna except in Lagos and Abuja airports.

[The sale of fake yellow fever vaccination cards to individuals who did not receive the vaccine continues and presents a serious public health problem inside Nigeria and outside of it. Susceptible, unvaccinated individuals can contribute to a YF outbreak within the country. YF virus is endemic in Nigeria, and an unvaccinated, viremic individual with a fake card who becomes infected in Nigeria could carry YF virus to localities where vector mosquitoes are present and initiate an outbreak of this serious disease. One wonders, if the practice of issuance of fake YF cards continues, whether countries most at risk in Central and North America, South and Southeast Asia will deny visas to or admittance of individuals coming from Nigeria unless they can prove that their cards are legitimate.

This report also came in from Google Alerts.

The problem of fake cards from Nigeria has been going on for nearly 2 years now -- see ProMED archives for 2012 below. A NIgerian correspondent reports "This has been going on for a long time I believe! Even the so-called hospitals issue such certificates without any confirmation or anything. All you need to do is request for one and you are given!"

It is disconcerting to learn that in Kaduna and Plateau states there is nowhere to get a YF vaccination. This situation needs to be resolved as soon as possible.

*****
Everyone who has obtained a YF vaccination card without receiving the vaccine should get vaccinated for their own protection and the protection of everyone in countries they visit that have dengue, because the same mosquito also transmits yellow fever. - Mod.JW
