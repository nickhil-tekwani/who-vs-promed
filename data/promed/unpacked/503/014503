Meningitis in Democratic Republic of Congo:
WHO Press Release WHO/62: 1,210 cases of meningitis have been reported in
several districts - mostly in the east - of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo since the beginning of the year, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). Of these cases, at least 191 have resulted in death,
giving a case fatality rate of over 16%. Most of the cases occurred in June,
July and August.
According to preliminary tests so far conducted in the field and confirmed by
a WHO Collaborating Centre in Oslo, Norway, serogroup A meningococcus has
been identified as the cause of the outbreak.
Only one area - Kasenga, in the province of Katanga - has so far had a weekly
attack rate high enough - 67 cases reported since the beginning of July 1997 -
to have the recent incidence classified as an outbreak. Twenty-five deaths
have occurred in Kasenga since the beginning of July. The situation appears
to be under control, according to WHO, thanks to the intervention of its
partners using the vaccines, medicines and equipment which had been
prepositioned by WHO in the country.
Cases have been also been reported in the city of Lubumbashi (14 cases with
zero deaths) and in the provinces of North Kivu (504 cases with at least 32
deaths), South Kivu (282 cases with at least three deaths), Oriental (158
cases with 28 deaths), Maniema (21 cases with 10 deaths) and Bandundu. An
unspecified number of cases and deaths have also occurred in various military
camps.
North and South Kivu continue to register cases but the number has not yet
reached epidemic level, according to WHO. WHO has also supplied an extra
150,000 doses of vaccine and 10,000 vials of oily chloramphenicol to
Democratic Republic of the Congo to complement those supplies which have
already been sent to the affected areas, while Medecins sans Frontiere
.......[text missing being used in Katanga province. In the meantime, the
situation is being monitored on the ground by a WHO team in collaboration
with MSF.
WHO has a network of sub-offices located in many of the main subregions
affected by meningitis: Kisangani, Goma, Bukavu, Lubumbashi, Mbuji-mayi,
Bandundu and Kikwit. Nine senior WHO epidemiologists are helping to monitor
the development of cases and diagnose them in three laboratories. All
information is being centralised by the Office of the World Health
Organization Representative in Kinshasa.
The neighbouring countries of Burundi, Rwanda, the United Republic of
Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia have been informed by WHO of the situation.
Kasenga is near the Zambian border and 69 cases with 16 deaths have been
reported in Zambia since the beginning of the year.
WHO action is being coordinated by the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) in
close collaboration with the WHO Geneva-based Divisions of Emergency and
Humanitarian Action (EHA) and Emerging and other Communicable Diseases
Surveillance and Control (EMC).
