_Ditylenchus destructor_ (EU Annexes) occurs in Inner Mongolia, China. In July 2016, lesions were observed on potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_) collected from Hohhot. Laboratory studies (morphology, molecular and pathogenicity tests) confirmed the identity of the nematode. The infested field has been subjected to strict quarantine measures to prevent any further spread.

[Potato rot (or tuber) nematode (PRN), _Ditylenchus destructor_, has been reported to cause serious yield losses in potato crops in some temperate regions. It can also affect a range of other crops, including carrots, onion, beets, parsnips, tomato, peanut, hops and lucerne, as well as a number of ornamentals and weeds. On potato, above ground plant parts do not show symptoms, but damage only becomes obvious at harvest. Affected tubers show spotted, dry, cracked skin and often develop secondary soft rot. Infection occurs mostly in the field, but tubers will continue to decay in storage as nematodes move into healthy tissue.

Factors influencing development and spread of PRN are not yet fully understood. Distribution in the field is erratic and difficult to predict and outbreaks may occur suddenly. PRN can be spread with infected soil, water, contaminated equipment and plant material (including seed potatoes) and can also spread actively in storage. Disease management may include exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host species, control of potential pathogen reservoirs and soil treatments with nematicides (drenching or fumigation). Use of certified clean seed tubers is crucial. Eradication of soil nematodes is extremely difficult.

The related species _D. dipsaci_ (stem and bulb nematode) is also a serious pathogen of potato and some other vegetable crops. _D. angustus_, the rice stem nematode, causes serious disease of deep-water rice ("Ufra"), as well as irrigated and rain-fed lowland rice, mainly in Asia.
