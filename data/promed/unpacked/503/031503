New outbreaks of lumpy skin disease have been found in Dimitrovgrad [municipality, Haskovo region]. Today [16 Apr 2016], an additional 31 cows have been culled in the village of Radievo [Dimitrovgrad, Haskovo]. The contagious disease of ruminants is spreading despite earlier assurances by official institutions, reported "Topnovini".

Only 2 days ago, the head of the Bulgarian Agency for Food Safety in Haskovo, Georgi Stankov, stated during an emergency meeting that the situation is under control and that there is no room for panic, but the situation seems to be different.

The disease, most likely introduced from Greece, has severely affected the livelihood of the farmer from Radievo who kept 31 cows. Yesterday [15 Apr 2016], laboratory results showed that one of the animals was infected by lumpy skin disease, which led to the experts' decision to kill his entire stock. Losses for the family are nearly 60 000 lev (USD 34 720).

An outbreak has been discovered in the Dimitrovgrad neighborhood of "Mariyno". Tomorrow [17 Apr 2016] another 26 cows will be killed. There is little doubt that the infection has also spread to the village of Brod in Dimitrovgrad. Laboratory results have not yet been released.

As commented earlier, the odds of success in controlling the further spread of lumpy skin disease within a country bordering an lumpy skin disease-endemic area by stamping out without vaccination are rather meagre. - Mod.AS]
