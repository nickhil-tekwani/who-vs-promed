A case of the deadly Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] was registered last week in Bulgaria. This was announced by the Ministry of Health. The dangerous disease is caused by a tick bite.

Initially, a high temperature develops with chills and muscle aches. Patients also usually experience nausea and vomiting. Subsequently, some develop the typical Crimean fever bleeding from the gums, stomach, and intestines.

Crimean fever is contagious and is transmitted by blood. If medical attention is not sought, the outcome is fatal.

For the period 8-14 Jun [2020] in the country there was a serious increase in the number of people admitted to hospital after a tick bite. Some of them have complications: 4 have developed Lyme borreliosis, another 7 with Marseille fever. Nine new cases of Q fever have also been reported.

[The above report does not provide any clinical or epidemiological details of the cases. Among the various cases admitted with history of tick bite, one case was confirmed as CCHF, with Lyme disease, Marseille fever, and Q fever among the other illnesses.

In Bulgaria, CCHF was first described in 1952. A total of 32 CCHF cases were reported in the last 5 years (2007- 2011). The cases originated mainly from southeast Bulgaria. In 2008, a new focus in southwest Bulgaria was also reported.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (genus _Orthonairovirus_ family Nairoviridae) circulates in nature in an enzootic cycle between ticks and non-human vertebrates. It is transmitted to humans by bite of infected Ixodid ticks (mainly _Hyalomma_ spp.) or by contact with blood or tissues of viraemic patients or animals. Nosocomial infections are often reported.

Due to the high pathogenicity of the CCHFV, the absence of a specific drug treatment or vaccine and the risk of person-to-person transmission, rapid diagnosis is crucial to ensure that appropriate infection control measures (e.g., isolation of patient and barrier precautions) can be implemented in a timely manner. A detailed medical history of the patient, including travel history and possible risk factors, is important for the timely diagnosis of the disease.

In CCHF-endemic countries, healthcare workers in this region should be made aware of CCHF, including the provision of training to better help them address questions from patients about travel history (identify potential risk of exposure). Physicians should include CCHF in the differential diagnosis for patients with haemorrhagic syndromes, especially if patients report a tick bite, outdoor activities, or occupation in rural areas and recent travel to an endemic area. - Mod.UBA
