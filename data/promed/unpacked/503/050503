An unknown disease similar to pneumonic plague has killed 5 persons
among the 20 cases reported since January [2008] in a locality of the
Northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC], according to
the Ministry of Health. "There is the suspicion of pulmonary plague
since the beginning of the month of January [2008] in Bolelole,"
Orientale province, located approximately 500 km (311 mi) to the
northeast of Kisangani, declared Dr Vital Mondonge, director of the
Department of Epidemics in the Ministry of Health.

According to the source, patient care has been provided by the local
structure of the Ministry of Health, assisted by a team from Medecins
Sans Frontieres (MSF) [Doctors Without Borders], said Dr Mondonge.

"The situation seems to be under control because, we have not
reported new cases in the past 2 weeks" he said, saying that disease
surveillance and public awareness were strengthened.

Samples taken from the cases in order to detect the responsible
[bacteria] have been sent to a laboratory in Bunia, approximately 200
km (125 mi) to the east.

"We are awaiting the results of the [laboratory] analyses, which can
take several weeks" said Dr Mondonge. In October 2006, the World
Health Organization [WHO] had reported a probable "outbreak."
Considered by the WHO to be a re-emerging disease, plague can be
extremely contagious, when transmitted by the respiratory route
[through inhalation] or through contact with secretions.

[Primary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural plague
presentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in
infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are
secondary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.

Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days,
after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including
fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness, and chest
discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be
bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the
disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood)
and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is
invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24
hours of exposure.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of
infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.
CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines
identify contacts within 2 meters (6.5 ft) as being at greatest risk
and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air
ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic
plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or
tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive
antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for
prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol.
