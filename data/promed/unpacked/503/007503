[Rabies is still a pervasive global threat. Half of the world's population live in an endemic area, and more than 80 percent of deaths occur in rural areas, where access to health education campaigns and post-bite prophylaxis is limited or inexistent. Africa and Asia are the continents with the highest risk of human mortality, with more than 95 percent of the world's fatal cases. These regions are also those where canine rabies is controlled the least (http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/rabies-portal/about-rabies/).

For several years, in their OIE annual reports, Egypt has communicated that rabies is a disease which has been absent since 1990, and that in 2016 they vaccinated 3393 cats and 19 548 dogs. Such coverage seems very low given that the human population in the country is 91 million. If only 1 percent of the population owned dogs and cats, one would expect that close to one million dogs and cats would be vaccinated. In this same report, the only control measures applied are "precautions at the borders". No other type of surveillance or control is done. - Mod.CRD
