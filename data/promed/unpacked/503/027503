Public health officials in the USA and the UK are investigating a number of unusual cases of serious hepatitis in young children, the cause or causes of which are currently unknown. Evidence from the UK and from Alabama, where 9 cases have been recorded since last fall [2021], points to the possible involvement of an adenovirus. Adenoviruses generally attack the respiratory tract, causing cold-like illnesses. But they have been linked to bladder inflammation and infection, and occasionally to hepatitis, though rarely in children who are not immunocompromised.

In a statement issued late Thursday [14 Apr 2022], the CDC said it is working with Alabama on its investigation into the cases, and is working with other state health departments to see if there are other cases elsewhere. In an alert to doctors the Alabama public health department issued in early February [2022s, it mentioned being aware of a case in another state, but it did not give details.

"CDC is aware of and working with the Alabama Department of Public Health to investigate 9 cases of hepatitis in children -- ranging in age from 1 to 6 years old -- who also tested positive for adenovirus since October 2021," Kristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a statement. "CDC is working with state health departments to see if there are additional American cases, and what may be causing these cases. At this time adenovirus may be the cause for these, but investigators are still learning more -- including ruling out the more common causes of hepatitis," she said.

Karen Landers, district medical officer for the Alabama Department of Public Health, said the cases were found in various parts of the state, and investigations to date have not found links among the children. Investigators in the UK have also not found links among the cases there. "It is not common to see children with severe hepatitis," Landers, who has been a pediatrician for 45 years, told STAT in an interview. "Seeing children with severe [hepatitis] in the absence of severe underlying health problems is very rare. That's what really stood out to us in the state of Alabama."

There are a range of adenoviruses that can infect people. Genetic sequencing is underway to try to identify if one or multiple types of adenoviruses are implicated. To date, 5 of the children have tested positive for type 41, Landers said. As word of the condition spreads, it is possible additional cases will be found. The newspaper El Pa√≠s reported Wednesday [13 Apr 2022] that Spain had detected 3 cases, all in children between the ages of 2 and 7. One of the children required a liver transplant, the newspaper said.

As in the UK, the children in Alabama were quite sick, said Helena Gutierrez, medical director of the pediatric liver transplant program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. "We have seen a full spectrum of cases from severe hepatitis to acute liver failure," she told STAT in an email.

In the UK, where roughly 75 cases have been reported from England and Scotland, a small number of the children have had or may require liver transplants. A number of the affected children in the UK have tested positive for adenoviruses and for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But the former appears to be the leading suspect, according to a scientific article on the Scottish cases that was published Thursday [14 Apr 2022] in the online journal Eurosurveillance [see below - Mod.LL].

Still, even if the cause is adenovirus infection, there may be a link to the pandemic, the authors suggested, noting that young children -- many of the cases are under the age of 5 -- who haven't been exposed to the normal array of germs during the pandemic may have been rendered more vulnerable when masks came off and social distancing measures were lifted.

Hepatitis -- inflammation of the liver -- is a condition that can be caused by a number of factors, though often viral infections are the cause. A number of hepatitis viruses -- A, B, C, D and E -- are common causes of hepatitis, but they have been ruled out in these cases. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued an alert on Tuesday [12 Apr 2022] urging doctors to be on the lookout for, and to report, cases of acute hepatitis in children aged 16 and younger where testing rules out infection with hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D or E.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On 31 Mar 2022, the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC) Health Board alerted Public Health Scotland (PHS) to 5 children aged 3-5 years presenting to the Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow with severe hepatitis of unknown etiology within a 3-week period. The typical number of cases of hepatitis of unknown etiology across Scotland would be fewer than 4 per year (1). This paper describes the initial investigation into the 1st Scottish cases and aims to raise awareness of this severe illness of unknown etiology among young children.

Following the alert, PHS convened a multi-disciplinary team of experts from across Scotland to review clinical and epidemiological data from the first 5 children presenting to hospital with acute severe hepatitis of unknown origin. Clinical case review revealed vomiting in preceding weeks, jaundice, and exceptionally high levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) among children of a similar age. Most children presented with transaminases greater than 2000 international units per liter (IU/L) where the normal range is 10 to 40 IU/L (2). Initial screening for hepatitis viruses A, B, C, and E was negative, with one hepatitis E result pending. One child had insufficient sample material to test for hepatitis B. As an indicator of disease severity, 3 children were transferred to quaternary pediatric liver units in England to be evaluated for liver transplant, with one receiving a transplant.

In addition to the clinical case review, the number of children presenting acutely with abnormal liver function tests in March 2022 to the Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow were compared with those in March 2019 as well as March 2020 and 2021. These data confirmed higher-than-expected numbers in 2022 among children under 5 years of age, but not older children. As noted above, the number presenting in March 2022 at the Royal Hospital for Children also exceeded the total number expected for the whole of Scotland over one year (1). On the basis of these reviews, PHS established a National Incident Management Team (IMT) to manage the ongoing public health investigation and response in Scotland. The National IMT developed a working case definition and active case finding was initiated, including a retrospective review of admissions to Scottish referral hospitals since 1 Jan 2022.

Working case definition
-----------------------
A confirmed case includes anyone presenting since 1 Jan 2022 with aspartate transaminase (AST) or ALT greater than 500 IU/L of unknown cause who is either aged 10 years and under or who was a contact of any age of a possible or confirmed case. A possible case is defined as a person presenting since 1 Jan 2022 with jaundice without any known cause, either aged 10 years and under or who was a contact of any age of a possible or confirmed case.

Epidemiological investigations and outcomes
-------------------------------------------
As at 12 Apr 2022 (the submission date for this manuscript), 13 confirmed cases have been identified in Scotland, 12 of whom presented in March and April 2022 (Figure 1 [for figures and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). No cases currently meet the possible case definition.

Median age of cases was 3.9 years (IQR: 3.6 to 4.6 years) (Figure 2). Seven of the 13 children were female; all were of white Scottish ethnicity. Children were primarily resident in central Scotland but with no otherwise discernible geographic pattern (e.g., living near a lake or river).

For 9 of the 13 children, parents/guardians completed the enhanced questionnaire to generate hypotheses about the etiological source. For 2 children, close contact in a household or other setting with 2 other cases was reported. Symptoms reported include jaundice (8 of 9 cases), abdominal pain (7 of 9 cases) and nausea and malaise (6 of 9 cases) leading up to admission. On 8 Apr 2022, revisions to the enhanced questionnaire were made to ask about respiratory symptoms and pale stool. As a result, enquiries about these symptoms were made for 4 of the 9 children with a submitted questionnaire. Nearly all of them reported gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea or vomiting and lethargy, but not fever, in the weeks before admission.

As at publication, all cases had been admitted to hospital for a minimum of 6 days. Five still remain in hospital, including one in England who has successfully undergone a liver transplant but remains in hospital. Prior to their admission, cases were reported as generally healthy. None of them had any significant past medical history, such as an underlying immune deficiency, nor had they received immunosuppressive medication. One child had an underlying condition but was also previously reported to be in good health.

Laboratory investigations
-------------------------
All cases were tested for viruses commonly causing hepatitis among children (Table). Results available to date have been negative for hepatitis A, B, C and E viruses. Cases had bacteriology workups, but as the majority did not have a fever, this line of investigation was not pursued unless clinically indicated by deranged blood inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein or total white blood cell counts, or fever.

Patients admitted to hospital in Scotland are currently routinely tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (3). Five of the 13 cases had a recent positive test -- 2 that were 3 months before admission, 2 within 11 days of admission, and 1 point-of-care test was positive upon admission, which was not confirmed by PCR. Population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was highest in February and March 2022 at a time when the predominant variant in Scotland was the omicron variant (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (Pango) lineage designation: B.1.1.529) sublineage BA.2 (4). Modeled estimates of the percentage of the population testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those aged 2-4 years of age were around 7% in early February, peaking at around 13% in mid-March, and then declining to around 7% in early April (5).

Additional viral testing not routine in hepatitis, but completed for some patients, included tests for enterovirus, parechovirus, human herpesvirus 6 and 7, varicella zoster and adenovirus. Five of 13 children were adenovirus-positive by PCR (2 by throat swab, 2 by blood and 1 by stool). Adenovirus circulation in Scotland is seasonal, with peaks commonly seen between February and April (Figure 3). However, fewer cases were observed in 2020-21 because of physical distancing restrictions in place to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Case numbers in March 2022 have returned to pre-pandemic peaks.

Public health response
----------------------
On 1 Apr 2022, PHS issued an alert to NHS Health Boards for awareness and described the actions to be undertaken for those meeting the case definition. On 6 Apr 2022, PHS issued an alert to the public on the increased numbers of cases of hepatitis of unknown origin among children (6). England, Wales and Northern Ireland published a similar communication (7). As part of the wide public health response, PHS and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) have been coordinating with the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to alert other countries to this situation.

Consensus is being sought across the 4 nations in the UK on a standard set of laboratory tests to be undertaken should new cases present. In the interim, UKHSA has issued guidance on investigations that should be performed locally where available (7). Additionally, PHS has collaborated with the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) Clinical Characterization Protocol UK (CCP-UK) Study to recruit cases and identify and obtain residual and additional samples for further investigation of known and novel infections (8). Non-invasive clinical samples also are being collected for any siblings resident in the same household if clinically unwell and select close contacts. Metagenomic sequencing and toxicology analyses are ongoing; however, results are not yet available. Investigation of milder disease in children as well as among adults is ongoing, although preliminary findings have not identified similar signals of severe outcomes or geographical clustering.

As warranted by the serious nature of the incident, UKHSA has established a Four Nations IMT and is coordinating and managing the ongoing investigation. Until the cause is identified, PHS has issued advice to strengthen standard infection control practices, which emphasize the importance of robust hand hygiene.

Discussion
----------
We report here on a cluster of cases of severe hepatitis of unknown origin in Scotland, mainly affecting children between the ages of 3-5 years. Approximately 60 cases have now been reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since 1 Jan 2022 (7). PHS is also aware of a cluster of hepatitis and adenovirus cases among children being investigated by the US CDC (personal communication: Hannah L. Kirking, 12 Mar 2022).

In addition to the temporal clustering of these cases, the severity of disease upon presentation to hospital is unfortunately remarkable. At the time of publication, all 13 children had been hospitalized and 3 children required liver transplant evaluation in quaternary care centers in England, where specialist services are available. One child went on to receive a successful transplant. Five of the 13 cases are still being treated in hospital. To date, there have not been any fatalities.

Initial hypotheses about the etiological nature of the severe hepatitis included either an infectious pathogen or a toxic exposure to food, drinks or toys favored by younger children. Toxicology analyses are ongoing among cases from across the UK, although responses to the enhanced investigation questionnaire about food, drink and personal care habits have not yet identified any common exposures.

An infectious etiology is now considered more likely given the epidemiological and clinical features, and taking into account the additional cases from across the UK and the USA cluster. At the time of publication, the leading hypotheses centre around adenovirus -- either a new variant with a distinct clinical syndrome or a routinely circulating variant that is more severely impacting younger children who are immunologically na√Øve. The latter scenario may be the result of restricted social mixing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adenovirus infection as a cause of severe hepatitis is rare in immunocompetent children but has been reported in case reports and series (9-11). Other infectious causes still being explored include increased severity of disease following infection with omicron BA.2 (the dominant SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in Scotland) or infection by an as yet uncharacterized SARS-CoV-2 variant. Of note, none of the children were vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2. A novel or yet undetected virus also cannot be ruled out at this time.

Conclusion
----------
We describe a clear and 1st signal in Scotland of the number of young children presenting to hospital with severe hepatitis of unknown origin. Rapid epidemiological analysis and laboratory testing is underway to identify the source. Public health specialists, pediatricians and other clinicians should be aware of children presenting acutely with gastrointestinal symptoms and jaundice or elevated serum transaminases >500 UI/L (AST or ALT) and have a higher index of suspicion and a lower threshold for referral for specialist care. Cases should be reported to national and international public health bodies for appropriate follow-up investigation and management as well as the WHO for situational awareness. Until the cause of these cases of severe illness is found, standard public health guidance emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene should be provided in settings where unexplained hepatitis is detected.

Three cases of a type of acute hepatitis that affects children with unknown origins have been detected in Spain in Madrid, Arag√≥n and Castilla-La Mancha.

The Spanish boy from Valdepe√±as, Castilla-La Mancha, is 22 months old and was admitted to the Ciudad Real Hospital and has been transferred to the La Paz Hospital in Madrid. Initially he suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms but has since developed acute hepatitis although his condition is improving, as reported by sources from the Castilla-La Mancha regional government according to El Mundo.

"The Health Alerts and Emergencies Coordination Centre has not reported an unusual increase in cases of acute hepatitis in children at the national level comparable to that of the UK since January [2022]. It is expected that in the coming days and due to media coverage and the level of surveillance, isolated cases will be reported in different centers, which so far would be in line with the usual frequency," stated Cristina Molera Busoms, coordinator of the Hepatology Working Group of the Spanish Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SEGHNP).

The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) had previously issued a warning due to the increase in acute cases of hepatitis in children that has been occurring for some weeks in the UK and sounded the alarm for European specialists to be on the lookout for possible cases.

According to ECDC data, around 60 cases are currently being investigated in England, most of which have been detected in children aged between 2 and 5 years. Of these, some cases have led to liver failure and required hospitalization. Without stating the number of cases, the European body says that a small number of those affected have had to undergo liver transplantation. In Scotland, there have been 10 cases of hepatitis reported in children aged between 1 and 5 years old that have led to hospital admission, with most of these cases being detected since March [2022].

Physicians at major pediatric liver centers in the Netherlands and Denmark told ScienceInsider yesterday [14 Apr 2022] they are seeing similar trends. "There are children that are very sick and have been referred for transplantation, says Ruben de Kleine, a pediatric liver transplant surgeon at University Medical Center Groningen. "We have assessed a similar number of kids for transplantation within the first 4 months of 2022 [to what we] normally do in a whole year."

At Copenhagen University Hospital, too, "we have more cases with [acute liver failure] than we normally have," says pediatric hepatologist Marianne H√∏rby J√∏rgensen. No children there have needed transplants.

H√∏rby J√∏rgensen and de Kleine both stress that parents should not panic. To date, clinicians have identified small numbers of cases in their countries where, combined, more than 230 000 infants are born each year.

[After the initial report from areas in the UK, it seems that cases similar occurred in Alabama, USA starting in the fall of 2021, before the recognition of the UK cases, and additionally similar clinical cases have now been recognized in Spain, Denmark and the Netherlands. No information regarding adenoviruses, serotype 41 or otherwise, has yet been reported from Spain, Denmark or the Netherlands. ProMED would be interested in additional information regarding these and other similar cases.

Adenovirus tends to be a wintertime cause of respiratory infection of variable severity but can cause infections in other organ systems, including the liver, but is quite unusual especially with these numbers of cases in a relatively short time. More cases have been reported in immunosuppressed hosts. Two reports are shown below:

Schaberg KB, Kambham N, Sibley RK, Higgins JPT: Adenovirus hepatitis. Clinicopathologic analysis of 12 consecutive cases from a single institution. Am J Surg Pathol. 2017; 41: 810-9; https://bit.ly/3M9P0vy

Type 41 adenovirus is mentioned related to the Alabama cases. Types 40 and 41 are members of serogroup F of human adenoviruses and are referred to as the enteric adenoviruses known to cause diarrhea mostly in children (https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/151.3.437). As far as can be determined, it has not been a cause of hepatitis, and it is not yet clear if the adenovirus link here will be confirmed but has been found in some USA and Scotland cases. The serotype of the Scottish cases is not mentioned. It would be interesting to know if hepatic tissue from biopsy or from the time of liver transplantation was found to contain adenovirus. - Mod.LL
