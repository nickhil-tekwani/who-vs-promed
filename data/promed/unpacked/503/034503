The cholera outbreak in Haiti has spread across the border to the
Dominican Republic and that nation has issued a maximum health alert,
its health ministry said. The 1st confirmed case is a 32-year-old
Haitian construction worker who returned to the Dominican Republic
last Fri 12 Nov 2010, with symptoms of the intestinal illness, the
health ministry said Tuesday night, 16 Nov 2010. The man went back to
Haiti 31 Oct 2010 to take money home, according to the El Nacional
newspaper.

The patient returned on Friday [12 Nov 2010], with symptoms of
vomiting and diarrhea and was hospitalized in Higuey, near the eastern
resort town of Punta Cana. He was in stable condition and will
probably be released from the hospital, 17 Nov 2010, the newspaper
quoted Health Minister Bautista Rojas Gomez as saying. 2 other
suspected cases turned out to be negative, the health ministry said.

The cholera outbreak confirmed in September 2010 in northwest Haiti
has killed 1110 people, and 18 383 people have been hospitalized with
the disease, according to Haiti's health ministry.

As cases of cholera spread throughout Haiti, violent clashes erupted
in the northern part of the country as angry demonstrators accused
United Nations peacekeepers of starting the outbreak. Burning tires
and cars sent thick black smoke across Cap Haitien, where the
government appeared to have lost control.

The last cholera epidemic in the Western hemisphere began in Peru in
1991 and spread to some 16 other countries, from Argentina to Canada,
according to the Pan American Health Organization. From 1991 to 1997,
Peru alone saw more than 650 000 cases. A similar pattern in Haiti
could produce some 270 000 cases, which means public health officials
likely face long-term challenges in Haiti.

occur in the Dominican Republic. With a more developed sewage system
and less flooding from hurricane Tomas, the effects of cholera in DR
may be diminished. - Mod.LL]

[2] Haiti: possible southern peninsula spread

Two suspect cholera cases in Fond des Negres have been found. There is
a laboratory confirmed cholera case in Les Cayes with a negative
travel history from 8 Nov 2010. If the cases in Fond des Negres are
confirmed, it will imply a large area of concern in the southern
peninsula.
