Bloody diarrhea epidemic kills 23 in DR Congo
------------------------------------------------
The death toll in an epidemic of bloody diarrhea in the central region of
the Democratic Republic of Congo has risen to 23, a health official said.
Regional medical inspector Dr Andre Kasogo Mulamba said that 23 people have
died, up from 22 on 8 Aug 2005, while the number of cases of the mystery
illness has more than doubled to 997 people. The epidemic broke out on 29
Jul 2005 at Kabongola, about 240 km (144 miles) from Kindu, the main city
of the central Maniema province.
All those who died from the disease worked at a diamond mine near
Kabongola, which employs many of the town's 6000 inhabitants.
The bloody diarrhea is accompanied by fever, pains in the throat, vomiting,
and later difficulty in breathing, said Kasogo, who arrived in the region
on Thu, 11 Aug 2005.
"We have come to track the evolution of the epidemic and provide medicines
to the local medical authorities," Kasogo said.
Another medical team from the Belgian division of the international aid
organization Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) have sent a
team to the region.
"Together we are going to evaluate the situation and take samples to identify
the disease," he said.
On 4 Aug 2005, anti-diarrheal drugs and water purification products were
sent by the British aid organization Merlin from Kinshasa to Kabongola.

[Shigellosis and amoebiasis are the major epidemic causes of bloody
diarrhea in the developing world. Cholera, a secretory diarrhea, is not
associated with tissue invasion and does not cause bloody diarrhea. ProMED
awaits more information about this outbreak. -Mod.LL]
