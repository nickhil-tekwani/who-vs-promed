Forth Valley, Scotland: Typhoid imported from Florida
Forth Valley Health Board has reported a case of typhoid in a 41 year old
food handler who had recently returned from a holiday travelling around
Florida. The patient developed mild symptoms whilst abroad and blood
cultures taken from him on his return yielded Salmonella typhi. Five
contacts of the index case work in high-risk occupations (health care
workers / food handlers) and have been excluded from work pending
microbiological screening.
The majority of imported cases of enteric fever in Scotland are from the
Indian sub-continent so that a case apparently imported from the USA is very
unusual indeed.
