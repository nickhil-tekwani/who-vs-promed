Spain has confirmed its 2nd death from monkeypox as the number of cases worldwide continues to climb -- and just days after the WHO declared the outbreak a 'global health emergency'.

The country's Ministry of Health confirmed the fatality on Saturday [30 Jul 2022] as its number of infections grew to 4298, making it the world leader in terms of caseload outside of the US. The regions of Madrid and Catalunya count the most cases, with 1656 and 1406, respectively.

At least 120 monkeypox carriers have required hospitalisation in Spain, reported El Mundo, representing 3.2% of cases, as one expert warned more deaths can be expected.

It comes after a 'middle aged' man from Alicante, in the Valencia region, became the 1st death in Europe on Friday [29 Jul 2022].

He has not been identified but health authorities said he died from encephalitis associated with the disease, a serious condition which causes the brain to become swollen.

It followed the death of a 41-year-old male in Brazil. He had serious immune system complications and was hospitalised at the Eduardo de Menezes Hospital in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, at the time of his death Thursday [28 Jul 2022].

As as part of the outbreak, 8 deaths have now been reported with 5 occurring in African nations where the virus is endemic.

Experts in Spain said the strain of the virus currently plaguing the country is from Nigeria and is less fatal than those seen in other parts of the continent. But Alfredo Corell, professor of Immunology at the University of Valladolid warned: 'We are facing the possibility of seeing more deaths.'

While the average age of patients in Spain is 37, the age of those who have been infected range from 10 months old to 88.

Several countries have now begun launching vaccination drives aimed at men who have sex with men, who continue to be the most at risk group.

Huge queues for a walk-in jab service were pictured at Guy's Hospital in central London on Saturday [30 Jul 2022], with similar scenes witnessed last weekend. It comes after sexual health services, particularly in the capital, have been forced to cut back or even suspend walk-ins and other services as they struggle to cope with being on the frontlines of the outbreak.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state disaster emergency Friday night [29 Jul 2022] over the continued spread of monkeypox.

She said the emergency declaration would lead to swifter response and better vaccination distribution. It came a day [28 Jul 2022] after the New York State Commissioner of Health declared monkeypox an "imminent threat to public health." "I am declaring a State Disaster Emergency to strengthen our ongoing efforts to confront the monkeypox outbreak," Hochul tweeted Friday [29 Jul 2022].

Hochul indicated the state is an emerging center for the virus, which manifests in symptoms of rashes and lesions across the body, extremities and genitals.

New York has recorded the most cases of the virus nationwide -- 1345 -- followed by California with 799, according to Centers of Disease Control and Prevention data last updated Friday [29 Jul 2022]. "More than 1 in 4 monkeypox cases in this country are in New York State, and we need to utilize every tool in our arsenal as we respond," Hochul wrote.

The emergency, enacted through executive order, allows EMS personnel, pharmacists, midwives, physicians and certified nurse practitioners to administer vaccinations, the governor's office said in a statement.

The state was already in the process of securing more vaccines, expanding testing, and distributing information via a website and a text notification system, the governor's office said.

On Thursday [28 Jul 2022], Hochul said a new federal government allotment would mean 110 000 additional doses of the monkeypox vaccine for the state, for a total of 170 000 so far.

Liberia confirmed a case of monkeypox on [23 Jul 2022] through the National Public Health Reference Laboratory in the country. An outbreak has been declared.

The case is a 43-year-old male who resides and works in Ebokayville Une, La CÃ´te D'Ivoire but sought treatment at the Pleabo Health centre in Maryland County, Liberia where he was detected and isolated with 4 contacts being line-listed, according to the World Health Organization.

This is the 1st case of monkeypox in Liberia since 2018. Liberia's Health Minister Dr. Wilhelmina Jallah urged the public to "report all cases of individuals presenting with fever, headache, muscle pains, blistering, rash and swollen lymph.

Minister Jallah is also encouraging the public to immediately isolate anyone showing signs and symptoms of the disease and at the same time contact health authorities.

[4] Philippines: 1st case

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/philippines-reports-1st-monkeypox-case-51424/


The Philippines Department of Health (DOH) has detected the 1st confirmed case of Monkeypox in the country. The case is a 31-year-old Filipino national who arrived from abroad on [19 Jul 2022]. The case had prior travel to countries with documented Monkeypox cases. The case was tested and confirmed positive for Monkeypox via Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction or RT-PCR, done at the DOH Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) on [28 Jul 2022]. The case has been discharged well, and is undergoing strict isolation and monitoring at home.

DOH has completed its case investigation and identification of close contacts. There are 10 close contacts that were recorded, of which, 3 were from the same household. All have been advised to quarantine, and are being monitored by the Department. The DOH assures everyone that our public health surveillance systems are able to detect and confirm Monkeypox cases.

Investigation of recent Monkeypox cases in non-endemic countries indicates potential transmission through sexual contact. It spreads mostly by intimate sexual contact with those who have rashes or open lesions. It is not like COVID-19 that spreads mostly through the air. Monkeypox symptoms are mild, and the disease is rarely fatal.

While it is now a public health emergency of international concern, everyone can help prevent the spread of Monkeypox. Minimize close sexual contact with suspected cases, especially those with rashes or open wounds. Keep hands clean. Wear a face mask; cover coughs using the elbow, and choose areas with good airflow. The DOH wishes to emphasize that anyone may get Monkeypox. If you have a travel history to countries with Monkeypox, and then have symptoms like fever, lymphadenopathy or "kulani" [swelling of the lymph gland], and rashes, seek immediate medical attention. This will help hasten recovery.

"Our surveillance systems immediately detected Monkeypox. We immediately took care of and isolated the patient to keep the disease from spreading. Fast contact tracing has identified the close contacts, to halt transmission. Let us continue to be vigilant, to follow our health protocols, and to get the right information only from DOH and its partner agencies," said Dr. Maria Rosario Singh-Vergeire, DOH Officer-in-Charge.
