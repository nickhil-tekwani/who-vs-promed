Health officials have recorded the 4th case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse in south Georgia this year [2012]. The Georgia Department of Public Health confirmed the case in a horse in Lanier County. Public information officer Courtney Sheeley says the mosquitoborne disease is not transmitted from horse to horse or from horse to human. The health department reports that most people bitten by a mosquito carrying the disease will not become sick, but those who are infected will usually show symptoms in 3 to 10 days. They include a sudden fever, muscle pains, and headaches. The most severe cases can include seizures and a coma.

[There is a very effective vaccination for horses and should be used every 4-6 months to provide appropriate protection for horses.

The disease in horses is almost always fatal.
