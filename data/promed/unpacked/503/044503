In Bauchi state, 29 people have died so far following the outbreak of yellow fever, an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Dr Rilwanu Mohammed, chairman, Bauchi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (BSPHDA), gave the death toll on Thursday [7 Nov 2019].

"We discovered 224 suspected cases, and 29 were confirmed dead, with 24 in Alkaleri local government, 2 in Bauchi local government, one in Darazo council area, and 2 in Ningi local government," he said.

Mohammed explained that the virus was 1st detected in Alkaleri council area in September [2019], adding that efforts had since been stepped up to avoid further spread. He said that government was doing everything possible to ensure that the disease did not spread to the state capital.

"That is why the government has made efforts through the vaccination of people living in the prone areas. Already, 500 000 doses of vaccines had been administered in Alkaleri, and we are expecting 600 000 doses of vaccines to be administered in the Ningi community," he said.

According to the BSPHDA chairman, yellow fever is not a communicable disease; it can only be transmitted through mosquitoes. He urged communities to give early information to the authorities, especially when they notice unusual happenings around them. Mohammed also urged the residents of the state not to reject vaccines, saying that this was the only way they could be free from the dreaded disease.

The "yellow" in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients. Symptoms of yellow fever include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.
