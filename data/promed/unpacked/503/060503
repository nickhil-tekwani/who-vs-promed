The Douglas County [Omaha, Nebraska] Health Department is once again, urging sexually active people to get tested routinely.

In 2013, health officials saw a 275 percent increase of syphilis cases that were reported. Dr Adi Pour told FOX 42 News that in previous years there were 7-8, but last year [2013] there were 30. "What is interesting actually is that nationwide we have seen an increase about 2 years ago," Dr Pour continued. "We are just a little bit behind that trend."

Syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease that is passed from person to person through direct contact with a syphilis sore, occurs mainly on the external genitals, vagina, anus, or the rectum. It can also occur on the lips, mouth, eyes, palms of hands, and bottom of the feet. Symptoms include chancre sores, skin rashes, rough, reddish brown spots on the palms of hands and the bottoms of feet, fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, patchy hair loss, headaches, weight loss, muscle aches, and fatigue.

Dr Pour said of the 30 infected in 2013, 47 percent of them also tested positive for HIV; the majority of them were men who have sex with men (MSM), and all were aged 20 to 39. "You know, it's sad. It's a disease that we all thought we wouldn't have to talk about it anymore. Definitely I thought I wouldn't have to talk about it anymore."

The health department is working with local bars and clubs where people who are most at risk of getting syphilis to get the word out that they need to get tested and also protect themselves. "The risk is that you are infectious and then you infect others."

While a 275 percent increase is a large jump, Dr Pour wanted to remind the public that 30 is a low number for a population of more than 400 000 people.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, syphilis is easy to cure in its early stages by injecting penicillin, an antibiotic, into those who have been infected for a year or less. The STD can reoccur so it is important to follow up with a physician after one has been cured.

To avoid getting syphilis, the CDC says people should abstain from having sex, remain in long-term monogamous relationships with a partner who has negative STD test results, and/or use latex condoms and dental dams every time you have sex.

Washing your genitals, urinating, or douching after sex will not protect you from getting syphilis.

[Omaha, with a population of 408 958 in 2010, is the largest city in the state of Nebraska in the Midwestern United States, and is the county seat of Douglas County.

The incidence rate for primary and secondary syphilis in the US as a whole was 4.4 per 100 000 in 2008, which rose to 5.0 per 100 000 in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/27.htm). The incidence rates in Nebraska had been steadily falling from 0.8 (15 cases) in 2008 to 0.4 (8 cases) in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/27.htm), at which time Nebraska was ranked 48th lowest out of the 50 states, while the state of Georgia had the highest incidence rate of 9.5 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/26.htm).

The increased incidence of syphilis in the US is occurring mainly among young men, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) (http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/STD-Trends-508.pdf), as has been reported in many parts of the world (see previous ProMED-mail postings listed below). In the US in 2012, 75 percent of the reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases were among MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/). However, outbreaks among men who have sex with women only (MSW) and women continue to occur in certain jurisdictions (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/syphilis.htm and ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal disease - USA (02): (ND) increased incidence 20140227.2303196.)

Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm) and more recently use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. Grindr allows users to meet other men using the mobile device's global positioning system (GPS) location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr. The increases in syphilis have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue", -- that is, diminished motivation to practice safer sex.
