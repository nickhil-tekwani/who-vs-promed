Citing a serious threat to wildlife, a wastewater treatment agency is draining a Redwood Shores [San Mateo County, California] pond popular with bird watchers where an outbreak of avian cholera has killed about 185 ducks in one week.

The disease does not pose a threat to humans, a US Fish and Wildlife Service official said in an announcement sent out on Friday [10 Jan 2014] by the South Bayside System Authority.

Although officials aren't certain how the bacterium that causes the disease entered the pond located off Radio Road, they suspect birds that flew in from the East Bay transmitted it, said Daniel Child, the authority's general manager. He said there's been an avian cholera outbreak in a Hayward [Alameda County, California] regional park.

The water in Redwood Shores' man-made pond is usually kept fresh by a flow of recycled water from South Bayside's treatment plant just east of it. The authority started draining the pond on Friday [10 Jan 2014] to disinfect it.

The pond is expected to remain dry for a couple of months or longer, Child said. "Water and soil can keep the bacteria alive, so we need the soil to dry out," Child said. "If it rains, the rainwater starts the bacteria issue all over again."

A local birdwatcher 1st noticed some dead birds at the pond last month [December 2013] and contacted US Fish and Wildlife Service at the Don Edwards Preserve in Fremont [Alameda County, California], Child said. A subsequent inspection revealed dead ducks floating in the water and along the pond's land edges. Once birds contract the disease, "they only live for 6 to 12 hours from the time they get it," Child said. The pond was created in 1998 to eliminate dust from the dry dirt that regularly clogged up the facility's machinery.

Now it's a favorite spot for bird watchers because of the multitude of waterfowl and shorebirds that have made it their home.

Los Altos resident Gay Duval, who came out to the pond after hearing about the dying birds, said it's one of her favorite birding spots, along with the Baylands Nature Preserve in Palo Alto. "There's usually hundreds and hundreds of birds here," Duval said. "I hope it doesn't go further south. It's good that they're doing something proactive now."

The bird count now appears unusually low, Child said, although he didn't know whether that's because of the disease breakout.

Local Fish and Wildlife Service officials have asked the public to be on the lookout for dead birds and to report any such sightings to <cheryl_strong@fws.gov> or <rachel_tertes@fws.gov>, especially if the birds appear to be "fresh."

[Avian cholera is a disease caused by the bacterium _Pasteurella multocida_. Bacteria released into the environment by dead and dying birds, or by birds carrying the disease, can subsequently infect healthy birds. In addition, dense concentrations of waterfowl can enhance disease transmission to susceptible birds. As a result, avian cholera can spread quickly through a wetland, killing thousands of birds in a single outbreak. Pickup and disposal of carcasses has become the primary management strategy to reduce transmission to susceptible birds.

The relationship between avian cholera and environmental factors is not entirely clear-cut. Associations between outbreaks and drought are inconsistent. Some researchers found a positive correlation with precipitations. Others suggest that absence of rain leads to high concentration of waterfowl, leading to unusually high mortality.
