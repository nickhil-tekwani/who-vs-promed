The Portuguese Directorate-General for Food and Veterinary (DGAV) has officially announced the first detection of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum (CaLsol) in Portugal. The haplotype E of the bacterium was found in carrot fields in West Lisbon and Tagus [Tejo river] Valley [central Portugal].

DGAV has pointed out that producers of carrots and potatoes, stockists and packing plants should be on alert for the presence of symptoms and in case of suspicion they should contact the Regional Directorate of Agriculture and Fisheries immediately, in order to proceed with laboratory analyses and take the necessary measures to avoid the spread of this pathogen.

[Only a few members of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter have been characterised so far, including the pathogens causing citrus greening (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives), which is limited to these crops due to the host specificity of the psyllid vectors.

_Ca._ Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso) was found to be associated with zebra chip (ZC) of potato, as well as a yellowing disease of tomato and capsicum in New Zealand. Lso has since also been associated with yellowing diseases of other solanaceous crops and some crops in the family Apiaceae. Main vectors of Lso are the potato psyllid (_Bactericera cockerelli_) in solanaceous host and carrot psyllids (_Trioza apicalis_, _Bactericera trigonica_) in Apiaceae. These vectors have a much wider host range than the greening vectors and additional vector species are also being identified, further extending potential host range and economic impact of Lso.

The Lso species is divided into haplotypes: A and B affecting Solanaceae; C, D and E affecting Apiaceae. Both groups of haplotypes have been reported from the Americas and New Zealand. Carrot haplotypes have previously been reported from several European countries (ProMED-mail posts 20120713.1199961, 20151009.3702151, 20161130.4666613), northern Africa (ProMED-mail post 20141121.2978030) and the Middle East (ProMED-mail post 20170130.4803773).

Potato haplotypes A and B are still considered absent from the European/Mediterranean region. However, haplotype E was recently also detected in potatoes in Spain [ProMED-mail post 20170802.5222241], representing the 1st report of potatoes being affected by Lso in Europe, as well as the 1st report of a haplotype being able to affect both Apiaceae and Solanaceae. While it is unclear whether typical zebra chip symptoms were observed in potatoes infected with haplotype E, the finding suggests that a lot more research is needed on epidemiology, biology and distribution of Lso worldwide.
