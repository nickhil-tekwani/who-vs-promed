[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Ebola outbreak indicators show promising signs of decline, but it's too soon to tell if the pattern will persist, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [12 Sep 2019] in its weekly overview of developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

Meanwhile, 14 new confirmed cases were reported today [13 Sep 2019], lifting the outbreak's overall total to 3113, according to numbers reflected on the WHO's online Ebola dashboard.

The WHO said 40 newly confirmed cases were reported [in the past week] in the DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces, the lowest [weekly total] since March [2019]. Though the signs are promising, emerging hot spots still pose challenges in accessibility, insecurity, and violence. "Surveillance indicators highlight that public health risks of further spread remain very high," the WHO said.

Over the past 3 weeks, most cases have come from Kalunguta, Beni, Mambasa, and Mandima. Early signs of easing include a decrease in newly confirmed cases in Beni and Mandima, but it's too soon to know if the changes mark a decrease in transmission intensity.

Several outbreak dynamics are still in play that increase the likelihood of more transmission chains in affected communities, the WHO said. They include a high proportion of community deaths, a relatively low proportion of new cases coming from known contact lists, transmission chains linked to hospital spread, and delays in detecting and isolating sick patients.

Another promising sign is that Alimbongo, Oicha, and Pinga health zones have passed 21 days without any new confirmed cases.

Today's [13 Sep 2019] report of 14 new cases is the 1st double-digit increase since 6 Sep [2019]. Health officials are still investigating 445 suspected Ebola cases, according to the WHO's dashboard.

Also, 4 more people died from their infections, putting the outbreak's fatality count at 2077.

Meanwhile, the DRC's multisector Ebola response committee (CMRE) in its report today [13 Sep 2019] had a few more details about the 8 new cases reported yesterday. Three were in Kalunguta, 3 in Komanda, and 2 in Mandima.

Of 3 deaths reported yesterday [12 Sep 2019], one occurred in the community in Mandima and 2 occurred in Ebola treatment centers in Beni and Butembo. Community deaths raise the risk of further disease spread.

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard, officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) confirmed 8 new cases of the disease today [12 Sep 2019], raising the outbreak's overall total to 3099. Health officials are also investigating 409 suspected cases.

Also, 3 new deaths were recorded, which moves the fatality count to 2074, the WHO said.

In an update today [12 Sep 2019] from the DRC's multisector Ebola response committee (CMRE) on 7 cases identified yesterday, the CMRE said Beni and Mambasa had 2 cases each, while Kayna, Mabalako, and Mandima each recorded 1 case.

The CMRE also said [vaccination] efforts continue throughout the DRC, with a total of 217 921 people vaccinated with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV.

[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-september-2019-ebola-drc/en/

Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued to ease this past week, with 40 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces; this is the lowest weekly incidence since March 2019. While these signs are promising, it remains too soon to tell if this trend will persist. Emerging hotspots continue to pose challenges in terms of accessibility, insecurity, and violence. Surveillance indicators highlight that public health risks of further spread remain very high.

During the past 21 days (from 21 Aug through 10 Sep 2019), a total of 157 confirmed cases were reported form 15 health zones [see Table 1 and Figure 2 at source URL], with the majority coming from the health zones of Kalunguta (19%, n = 30), Beni (18%, n = 28), Mambasa (16%, n = 25), and Mandima (13%, n = 20). Alimbongo, Oicha, and Pinga health zones recently passed 21 days without a new confirmed case of EVD.

As of 10 Sep 2019, a total of 3091 EVD cases were reported, including 2980 confirmed and 111 probable cases, of which 2074 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1737) were female, 29% (886) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (157) were health workers.

Under Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 120-140 million for WHO. As of 12 Sep 2019, USD 54.9 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Currently available funds will close the financing gap up until the end of September 2019. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019, and WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found [at] https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019/funding.

[Byline: Amy Maxmen]

Behind the front lines of the Ebola wars: In an exclusive story, Nature joins WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and the teams of African health workers who are giving everything to stop Ebola in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Their moving stories of success and struggle illuminate the complex challenges of battling one of the most deadly pathogens known to humankind in a place tortured by war. "People are so afraid. They don't know if we might be terrorists who want to kill them," says medical anthropologist Julienne Anoko. "So we just show them that we are human -- mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers -- we explain why we want to help."

- Wed 11 Sep 2019. Working in the DRC
[Herald Scotland, abridged, edited]
https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17895337.scottish-medic-tells-ebola-scare-tackling-disease-congo/

A Scottish medic has told of her own Ebola scares while taking on one of the world's deadliest diseases in a Congo war zone. Aberdeen-born Dr. Catherine Houlihan believes a new vaccine, developed with support from the UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID), has helped dramatically curtail the spread of the virus, with over 200 000 people now vaccinated.

Dr. Houlihan -- a clinical lecturer in Infectious Diseases and Virology for both the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and University College London -- has personal knowledge of the dangers of the deadly disease, having just returned from a 4-week stint in Congo [in] June [2019].

"I had moments where I had exposure, a tear in my personal protective equipment, I had a glove that came off, a kid that put their hand under my visor," she recalled. "Lots of alarming things happened.

"Before the vaccine, there were times in Sierra Leone when each of us was worried about the risk of exposure to Ebola inside the treatment unit.

"In the Kerry Town Unit, we trained all of the staff before anyone was allowed in, particularly about what to do if something happened, immediately stopping what you are doing, telling the colleague you went in with that you are leaving, washing any exposed area in chlorine.

"We are quite well versed in how to react, but it does raise your heart rate a little at the time. For the 21 days after you get back your temperature is taken every day and you do not see any patients."

And Dr. Houlihan added: "I think that the vaccine has changed the path of this outbreak. We could have already had a death toll similar to West Africa had we not had it.

"The data [are] showing that it is 97% effective. Healthcare workers are one of the highest-risk groups for catching Ebola and this extra protection enables them to carry out their roles far more effectively."

Dr. Houlihan said: "The braver people than us are always the local staff who were there from the beginning and kept returning to work despite the dangers of this highly fatal infection or from community violence.

"International responders mostly work 6 weeks at one time and have the reassurance that if we get sick, we would be medevaced back to the UK, with all the high-level care that offers."

[4] Response
- Thu 12 Sep 2019. Ebola is winning
[CSIS (Center for Strategic and International Studies), abridged, edited]
https://www.csis.org/analysis/ebola-virus-winning-eastern-democratic-republic-congo

Hard barriers to access lie at the very heart of the agonizing struggle by international and Congolese responders to contain and ultimately arrest the Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Foremost among the barriers to access are insecurity and chaos, which gravely and consistently thwart access to the hot zone, in effect providing shelter for the virus. Four other forces contribute profoundly to creating an environment in which it has not been possible to confront and circumnavigate DRC's insecurity and chaos in order to carry out the public health actions essential to end the Ebola outbreak. These compounding factors include DRC's dysfunctional governance, the absence of high-level major power engagement, the overload created by DRC's high number of infectious disease outbreaks amid a roiling humanitarian crisis, and the flawed implementation and management of an underfinanced international response.

The current Ebola outbreak -- the 10th and most dangerous of the disease in the country since it was 1st discovered there in 1976 -- was 1st declared on 1 Aug 2018, though it is believed to have ignited months earlier in April 2018. As of late May 2019, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appointed David Gressly, a highly respected, senior US United Nations official, to oversee an integrated approach with greater accountability and greater focus on security and community trust. On 17 Jul 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global emergency. It remains uncontrolled, a steady "slow burn" that continues to expand its geographic footprint while hotspots flare and skip across a dangerous, complex terrain populated by over 8.5 million people, including a million displaced.

More than one year has now passed, and though the virus fortunately is not a runaway contagion, it is winning. The opportunity for early, swift, concerted action has come and gone. In the meantime, conditions on the battlefield have deteriorated. The international and Congolese response has evolved into a reactive, anxious effort to "reset" itself in hopes of regaining the initiative. While the game is far from over and hope has not been jettisoned, the outbreak is now recognized to pose an open-ended, long-term threat.

As the enterprise enlarges, it is becoming much pricier. The issuance of a new 6-month strategic response plan from the DRC Ministry of Public Health, in partnership with the WHO and other UN partners, has been seriously delayed and is expected to call for USD 600 million, more than double the cost of the previous 6-month plan. Finding those resources will not be easy. For the 1st time since the discovery of the virus, there is the real possibility that Ebola in eastern DRC may become endemic, circulating indefinitely within the population. That raises the specter of multiple, concurrent Ebola outbreaks in the future.

- Thu 12 Sep 2019. Nigeria: Hand washing
[All Africa, abridged, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201909120024.html
[Byline: Rebecca Ejifoma]

The Managing Director of Dr. Ameyo Stella Adadevoh (DRASA) Health Trust, Dr. Niniola Williams, has decried the unfortunate decline in the practice of hand washing and use of hand sanitiser since Nigeria became Ebola-free.

Indeed, 2014 was a year to remember in Nigeria after Patrick Sawyer brought the virulent Ebola virus in the country. With it came immediate hygienic discipline among Nigerians.

Truly, it was recorded greatly how many citizens bought in larger quantities [of] hand sanitiser, which became a very, if not the most, lucrative business at the time.

The sight of liquid hand wash buckets filled with clean water or chlorine solution, and hand sanitiser dispensers greeted us in offices, schools and many organisations.

Speaking with THISDAY, Williams, a hygiene expert, said, "During the 2nd half of 2014, it seemed you could not go anywhere without seeing people washing their hands or using hand sanitiser. Nigerians made hand hygiene a priority."

However, 5 years after Ebola made history by snatching several lives in the country, the MD bemoaned the lack of use of soap or sanitisers. She said, "[A] hand sanitiser dispenser anywhere today is often broken or empty. We have lost the hand washing and hygiene culture we held on to so tightly in 2014."

On the advantages of hand washing, the hygiene doctor reminded compatriots that hand washing goes beyond protecting from Ebola, but also from infectious diseases like Lassa fever, cholera, meningitis, yellow fever, measles, monkeypox, and others, which combined have killed more Nigerians than Ebola.

She said: "All these infectious diseases do not respect borders and do not discriminate or respect social class. Their goal is to spread quickly, infect people and lead to death."

On the solution, she revealed the simplest, cheapest and most effective way to stop the spread of germs and stay free from infections is to wash the hands with clean, running water and soap for at least 20 seconds.

She listed 5 steps to achieving this. "Wet your hands with clean, running water; apply soap; rub hands together to lather the soap, wash the front and back of your hands, in-between your fingers, your fingertips, and under your nails; rinse off the soap; dry with a clean disposable towel and, if you do not have one, let the air dry your hands."

Meanwhile, she suggested further: "If you do not have access to clean water and soap, alcohol hand rubs or hand sanitisers are also effective in killing most bacteria and viruses; however, clean, running water (not stagnant water) and soap is the best option."

Dr. Williams again: "DRASA (Dr. Ameyo Stella Adadevoh) Health Trust was established in memory of one such individual [an Ebola fighter from the earlier outbreak]; we are making sure people all over the country understand the importance of hand washing, hygiene and sanitation."

According to her, DRASA is training Nigerians in communities to ensure "we do not rest on our laurels and remain complacent. To date, we have trained more than 230 medical personnel and reached more than 23 800 youths and 900 teachers in 30 states around the country."

[Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/09/11/actualite/sante/sud-kivu-le-gouvernement-prend-des-mesures-pour-quebola-natteigne-pas-les

The governor of South Kivu, Theo Ngwabidje Kasi, has taken steps to prevent Ebola from reaching schools in his province.

"Ebola virus will never come to schools in South Kivu province," he said on Tue 10 Sep 2019, at the launch in Bukavu of the registration campaign for children aged 6 to 7 at school.

Theo Ngwabidje Kasi draws on the contribution of partners in the education sector, including UNICEF.

"We have taken measures for prevention so that Ebola does not touch our students. Thanks to UNICEF for its support. They brought us booklets in which Ebola measurements are repeated. We will distribute kits in more than 400 schools in the city of Bukavu. It is a question of setting up a system of functional and obligatory washing of the hands at the entrance of the establishments. We will also set up a temperature control point at the entrance of each school," said Theo Ngwabidje Kasi.

He calls the students' teachers to respect hygiene standards and to clean up the learning environment.
