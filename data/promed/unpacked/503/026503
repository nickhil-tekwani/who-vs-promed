A woman in the northern border state of Sonora became the first Mexican of
2004 to contract West Nile virus, but received treatment and is expected to
make a full recovery, the Health Department said Friday.
Dr. Francisco Javier Navarro, the Health Department's director of community
services, said in a statement that the woman fell ill 6 Jul 2004 in
Etchojoa, Sonora. She was tested for dengue fever, but officials later
determined she was suffering from West Nile fever, the
statement said. After 15 days of hospital treatment, the victim was
released and was expected to make a full recovery at home, it said.
According to an epidemiology Web site maintained by the Health Department
<http://www.salud-sonora.gob.mx/>, the Etchojoa case is the only confirmed
outbreak of West Nile in Mexico through late August [2004], the last time
nationwide statistics were updated.
West Nile had not been detected in this country since August 2003, the
Health Department statement said. A man who visited the United States and
contracted the virus there died in Mexico in August 2002 [see ref. below].
