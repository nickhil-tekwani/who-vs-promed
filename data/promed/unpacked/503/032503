Two people in Arkansas have been infected with the strain of influenza virus known as H1N1(v) after contact with pigs. The cases have been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) says the variant influenza virus [designated H1N1v], occurs when an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person. "Viruses of this type typically cause only mild illness in those affected and, in contrast to seasonal flu, are not easily transmitted from person to person," writes Dr Dirk Haselow, State Epidemiologist, in a news release.

ADH says it has carefully monitored the patient contacts for several days without evidence of any human to human spread. Both patients identified to date have recovered fully; it's unclear at this time where in Arkansas the cases were located. When humans are in close proximity to live swine, such as in barns and livestock exhibits at fairs, movement of these viruses can occur back and forth between humans and animals. ADH says influenza has not been shown to be transmitted by eating properly handled and prepared pork or other products derived from pigs.

Case investigations have indicated that the illnesses resulting from H1N1(v) infection have been similar to seasonal influenza. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, decreased energy, coughing, runny nose, and sore throat. Contact your health care provider if you are experiencing flu-like symptoms and inform the doctor if you have had contact with swine.

To prevent the spread of other infections you can get from animals, the following precautions are recommended:
- Wash your hands often with soap and running water. Particularly after contact with animals. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
- Never eat, drink or put things in your mouth in areas where animals are present, and don't take food or drink into areas where animals are housed.
- Never take toys, pacifiers, spill-proof cups, baby bottles, strollers or similar items into areas with animals.
- Avoid close contact with animals that look or act ill.
- Children younger than 5 years, people 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic medical conditions (like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune and nervous systems) are at higher risk for serious complications of infections. These people should consider avoiding exposure to pigs and other animals at petting zoos and barns during fair season.

[Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called "variant viruses." They also can be denoted by adding the letter "v" to the end of the virus subtype designation. Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v, and H1N2v viruses have been detected in the United States (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/).

Recently most cases of influenza contracted from pigs, usually at agricultural fairs in several states, have been the H3N2v variant of influenza A virus. Overall influenza activity in North America has remained at low levels throughout the region. In Canada and the USA, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels. The USA has reported 16 human infections with influenza A(H3N2)v virus in 2013 since the 1st case in June 2013. For more details, see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-cases.htm. - Mod.CP
