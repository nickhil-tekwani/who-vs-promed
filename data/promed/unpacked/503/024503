[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 3 newly confirmed cases in China, all imported. No new deaths were reported. Also, no new cases were reported in Hong Kong or in Macau. A total of 1786 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 5 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours, all were imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, and 8 Jun 2020 when 1 conversion was reported each time. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 50 cases and 2 new deaths, compared with 38 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (8 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 65 consecutive days. Today's (9 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 43 cases were locally transmitted, and 7 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Gyeonggi (20), Seoul (12), Incheon (8), Gyeongnam (2), and Gangwon (1). Imported cases were in Gyeonggi (1) and Quarantine (6). Note that 12 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The detailed discussions of the clusters following the opening up of venues clearly illustrates the increased risk of transmission in enclosed, indoor venues with high density, including houses of worship. The clusters keep growing and expanding in geographic location. One wonders if another heightened measures might be implemented to slow down the transmission.

The impression (hasn't changed): lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 235 561 cases, including 34 043 deaths, up by 283 cases and 79 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (8 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 280 cases and 65 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 192 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Piedmont, and Liguria (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4870_1_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4875_1_file.pdf). These 5 provinces combined today (9 Jun 2020) account for 92.6% of reported newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (192) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 17 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (6 provinces reported no new cases), with another 3 provinces reporting fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (192), followed by Lazio (23), Emilia-Romagna (18), Piedmont (21), and Liguria (8).

Italy is now 36 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 20 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 175 927 total cases, 8425 deaths
Date: Tue 9 Jun 2020

Nearly 1 in 5 Iranians may have been infected with the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] since the country's outbreak started in February [2020], a health official said Tuesday [9 Jun 2020]. "According to results (of studies) about 15 million Iranians may have experienced being infected with this virus since the outbreak began," said Ehsan Mostafavi, a member of the task force set up to combat COVID-19. This meant the virus was "much less lethal than we or the world had anticipated", the semi-official ISNA news agency quoted him as saying.

The figure represents 18.75 percent of the more than 80 million population of Iran, which on Tuesday [9 Jun 2020] announced another 74 deaths from the coronavirus. But Mostafavi said the 15-million figure "must be viewed with caution" and that the studies it resulted from are "somehow similar to others done in the rest of the world." Mostafavi said it was derived from serology tests to identify antibodies in patients who have recovered from the illness. These differ from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which detect the presence of an antigen. Iran says it has carried out more than one million PCR tests to "confirm" infections and report them so far.

Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said 74 new coronavirus fatalities in the past 12 [?24] hours had raised the overall death toll to 8425. Cases of infection increased by 2095 over the same period to total 175 927, she added.

Lari replaced Kianoush Jahanpour as the health ministry's spokesperson on Tuesday [9 Jun 2020], according to a ministry statement.

[As of 9 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 175 927, including 8425 deaths, an increase of 2095 new cases and 74 deaths since 8 Jun 2020. Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having surpassed the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions. The key concern will be whether people begin travelling again within the country and may transport the virus from one zone to another. So far, it appears as although the daily case counts are decreasing and may reflect the impact of tightened control measures in affected provinces.

The results of the serosurvey are interesting. Information on the sampling methodology and tests used aren't provided, but what is very interesting is that results are similar to those seen in a serosurvey in New York City, one of the epicenters of major transmission in the USA, where close to 20% of the sampled population was found to have antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 045 549, including 114 148 deaths, an increase from 2 026 493 cases and 113 055 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 204 576 as of 12:45 EDT (GMT-4) on 9 Jun 2020 (an increase of 323 newly confirmed cases since 8 Jun 2020, down from 434 on 7-8 Jun 2020) including 17 203 confirmed deaths (an increase of 34 deaths since 8 Jun 2020 and up from 23 deaths on 7-8 Jun 2020) and an additional 4715 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New York, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arizona, and Louisiana. Tennessee and Louisiana were not on this list in the past few days. A number of these states do not have many large urban centers, and the increase in case numbers is consistent with media reports that transmission is now occurring in smaller communities that had not had many cases during the past few months and many of these communities did not practice social distancing or use face masks to slow down transmission.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, Florida, Michigan, and Maryland, the same 10 states as yesterday (8 Jun 2020) and in the same order. A total of 38 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) when known.
