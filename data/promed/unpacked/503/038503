The Ministry of Health (Minsa) confirmed that 2 of the 4 reports of suspected cases of unspecified viral encephalitis presented this week have been confirmed. According to the Minsa the cases were confirmed through IgM ELISA tests for Eastern Equine Encephalitis.

A child, age 11, resident in the area of San Vicente-Meteti, Darien and a 6-month old baby from the Bacao-Tucuti area of the province were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Children's Hospital.

The cases under investigation involve an 8-year old girl from the Sambu area and a 36-year old adult from El Real Center.

Animal Health staff from the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA) notified the Minsa that they had received reports of sick and dead equine species with neurological signs, suspected of having encephalitis in the areas of Rio Iglesias, Meteti, Santa Fe, Seteganti, Garachine, all in the region of Darien. To date they have analyzed thirteen (13) samples of sick horses. Since detecting the 1st case, both the Minsa and MIDA have increased epidemiological surveillance in the area.

["Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a member of the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae. Other medically important alphaviruses found in the Americas include Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). EEEV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The virus particles are spherical and have a diameter of 60-65 nm. Of the 4 lineages of EEEV, Group I is endemic in North America and the Caribbean and causes most human disease cases; the other 3 groups (IIA, IIB, and III) cause primarily equine illness in Central and South America". http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/virus.html

"Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Human EEEV cases occur relatively infrequently, largely because the primary transmission cycle takes place in and around swampy areas where human populations tend to be limited. All residents of and visitors to areas where EEEV activity has been identified are at risk of infection. People who engage in outdoor work and recreational activities in endemic areas are at increased risk of infection. Persons over age 50 and under age 15 seem to be at greatest risk for developing severe disease when infected with EEEV. Overall, only about 4-5 percent of human EEEV infections result in EEE. EEEV infection is thought to confer life-long immunity against re-infection. It does not confer significant cross-immunity against other alphaviruses (e.g., western equine encephalitis virus), and it confers no cross-immunity against flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile virus) or bunyaviruses (e.g., La Crosse virus)." http://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/tech/epi.html

Since Jun 2015, 4 outbreaks of EEE have been reported in the province of Darien in equine population. See follow-up report No.2 dated 12 Jul 2016 http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=20462 and the event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=18614. - Mod.CRD
