The Egyptian health ministry announced on Monday [31 Dec 2007]
another death case of bird flu disease, the 44th since the outbreak
of the epidemic in Egypt in early 2006. In a statement, the ministry
said a 50-years-old woman of Dumiyadh governorate, north of Cairo,
died today as result of infection with the H5N1 virus. The woman was
transferred to the hospital after [coming into contact with] sick
birds.
Earlier today [31 Dec 2007], the ministry announced the death of a
36-year-old woman [the 43rd case - Mod.CP] as result of the bird flu
disease.
Egypt detected the 1st H5N1 virus in dead poultry in February 2006,
and the 1st human case in March of the same year.

On Monday [31 Dec 20007], 2 Egyptian women died of bird flu, bringing
to 4 the number of fatalities from the virus in the most populous
Arab country in less than a week. All 4 deaths involved women and
were believed to have resulted from exposure to sick or dead backyard
birds. [One of the victims,] from Menoufia province in the Nile Delta
region north of Cairo, was taken to hospital on Saturday [29 Dec
2007] and died early on Monday [31 Dec 2007], Egypt's Health Ministry
said in a statement. "She suffered from a high fever and difficulty
breathing and had a pulmonary infection after coming into contact
with birds suspected of being infected with avian flu," the statement
said. "She was placed on a respirator but died at dawn on Monday [31
Dec 2007]."
Later, John Jabbour, an Egypt-based World Health Organisation
official, told Reuters a 2nd woman [from Damietta, also in the Nile
Delta,] had died of bird flu in northern Egypt.
The deaths broke a 5-month pause in human cases in Egypt and brought
to 19 the number of Egyptians who have died of the H5N1 bird flu
virus since it emerged in Egypt in early 2006. It is also the 3rd
winter that the virus has struck after lying low during Egypt's hot
summers, when it is much less likely to spread from one carrier to
another.
On Sunday [30 Dec 2007], a 25-year-old Egyptian woman died of bird
flu in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura while another woman, died of
bird flu on Wednesday [26 Dec 2007] in Beni Suef province south of
Cairo, the 1st case of this winter season [and the 41st overall. -
Mod.CP]
Jabbour said the high fatality rate in the recent cases was likely
due to a delay in diagnosis after patients and their family members
denied exposure to infected birds. Patients are most likely to
survive if they start treatment with Tamiflu early after symptoms
occur.
Around 5 million households in Egypt depend on poultry as a main
source of food and income, and the government has said this makes it
unlikely the disease can be eradicated despite a large-scale poultry
vaccination programme. WHO officials have said the bird flu virus was
now considered endemic in Egypt.
Deaths from bird flu total more than 210 worldwide since 2003 and
have been reported in several African and Asian countries, as well as
in Turkey and Azerbaijan. Egypt, with 43 [now 44] confirmed human
cases, has been the hardest-hit country outside of Asia.

[The 4 cases reported in Egypt during past week, after a lapse of 5
months, comprise a woman in the Beni Suef governorate (the 41st case
and the 16th death), a woman in Mansoura city who died on 30 Dec 2007
(the 42nd case and the 17th death), a woman in Menoufia governorate
who died of 31 Dec 2007 (the 43rd case and the 18th death), and the
woman Dumiyadh governorate who also died on 31 Dec 2007 (the 44th
case and the 19th death). None of these 4 cases appear to be
connected in any way. Further information on the status of the case
in Damietta is awaited.
The 100 percent mortality rate for the 4 cases reported during the
past week, in contrast to the more favourable outcomes achieved by
the Egyptian Health Ministry previously is being attributed to
delayed diagnosis (in part due to reluctance of patients to come
forward for treatment) and consequent late initiation of Tamiflu
treatment, rather than to any increased virulence of the H5N1 virus.
