A 9th positive equine infectious anemia result was confirmed for a horse located on a farm in the rural municipality of Meadow Lake, SK.

On 25 Apr 2019, a positive equine infectious anemia (EIA) result was confirmed by the CFIA's national reference laboratory for a horse located on a premise in the rural municipality of Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan. Eight other cases have been reported since the start of the year [2019].

The horse had been sampled by an accredited veterinarian at the owner's request to comply with a show pre-entry requirement. No clinical signs of disease were noted at the time of sampling.

A Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) investigation is underway, and as per program policy, a quarantine has been placed on the infected horse and its on-premises contact animals. The quarantine will remain until all disease response activities have been completed, including follow-up testing and ordering the destruction of positive cases. Trace-out activities may require the CFIA to undertake actions at additional premises as outlined in the current policy.

Please see the CFIA website at https://horse-canada.com/horse-news/ninth-case-equine-infectious-anemia-reported-saskatchewan/ for a map of cases. More details may be found on the CAHSS website.

[Unfortunately, there is no vaccine for this disease. It is a very bad disease, and, in most states, regulated with strict quarantine issued for the life of the horse, or euthanasia. Perhaps we will have a vaccine someday, or dare we dream for no insects capable of transmitting this and other diseases?

"Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a non-contagious, infectious disease of horses and other Equidae. It is caused by an RNA virus classified in the _Lentivirus_ genus, family Retroviridae. EIA can present as an acute, subacute, or chronic infection. On occasion, the virus can be a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The most frequently encountered form of the disease is the unapparent, chronically infected carrier." This chronic carrier state is the reason for some of the regulations when equids go to a show or event or are shipped for any reason.

"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily bloodborne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and, to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host-defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.

No specific treatment or safe and effective vaccine is available. Because equids infected with EIA virus present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 m [219 yd]) from other equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of seropositive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to the virus after ingesting colostrum. In most cases, passive antibody against EIA virus wanes and is no longer detectable in the Coggins test by 6-8 months of age; detectable antibody may persist up to 12 months, however, if ELISA testing is used."
