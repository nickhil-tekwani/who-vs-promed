China has reported 6 cases of human bocavirus infection in children, the
first infections in the country linked with the newly identified virus, the
official Xinhua News Agency said on Tuesday [22 Aug 2006].
Of 72 phlegm samples taken from children in Chenzhou, a city in the central
province of Hunan, 6 have tested positive since October 2005, Xinhua said,
citing Duan Zhaojun, a researcher from China's Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Xinhua did not give any details on the cases, except that
the samples were taken from infants a year old or younger.
Human bocavirus has been found in respiratory secretions of children with
lower respiratory tract infections, according to findings presented at the
International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases in March. It was
first reported in Sweden in September 2005 and very little is known about
the infection and its [origins].
Human bocavirus has been found in nearly 5 percent of pneumonia patients in
rural Thailand, mostly young children, the researchers said. Cases have
also been identified in children with respiratory tract infections in
Australia and Japan. The conference included researchers from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and the World
Health Organization.
China is particularly sensitive about emerging diseases. It has been
accused of being slow and reluctant to release information on its 2002-03
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS].

[In 2005 Swedish virologists described a novel human parvovirus, now
designated _human bocavirus_, present in the lower respiratory tract of
infants and possibly implicated in lower respiratory tract disease.
Subsequent investigations indicated that human bocaviruses are ubiquitous
and the detection of these viruses in China is no surprise. For a fuller
description of these agents, see the preceding post in this thread. - Mod.CP]
