Toxins found in tainted milk brand product
------------------------------------------
A batch of milk produced by Mengniu Group has tested to have excessive
aflatoxin, a cancer-causing substance, over the weekend.

Cai Mengsha bought 2 boxes of milk produced by the Chinese dairy giant
Mengniu Group over the weekend. But she was having second thoughts
after learning excessive levels of a cancer-causing toxin were found
in a batch of milk manufactured by the company.

The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and
Quarantine on Saturday [24 Dec 2011] published the result of a random
check of 200 dairy products in 21 provinces, and 2 products, including
one manufactured by Mengniu, were found to contain excessive
aflatoxin.

Despite the company's declaration on Monday [26 Dec 2011] that the
entire tainted batch was destroyed in its branch plant in Meishan,
Sichuan province, before it could reach the market, Cai, a college
student in Zhejiang, said she was still confused as to whether the
milk she had bought was safe to consume.

While the national standard allows a maximum of 0.5 micrograms
carcinogenic content in a kg of milk, the official test found 1.2
micrograms of the toxic substance in the Mengniu sample. The sample
product was a 250ml pack of pure milk produced on 18 December 2011,
according to the test result published on the website of the general
administration.

Aflatoxin is virulent in terms of toxicity and is classified as a
1st-class carcinogen by the World Health Organization.

"Experiments on animals have demonstrated a strong carcinogenic effect
of the substance, and studies about epidemic diseases indicate that
the content of the substance in food is relevant to the incidence of
liver cancer," said Fan Zhihong, associate professor with China
Agricultural University's college of food science and nutrition
engineering.

She also says the carcinogen can accumulate in the human body, and is
resistant to heat. "It dissolves when the temperature reaches nearly
300 C, which means high temperature [of] disinfection or pasteurizing
(a common disinfection method used in the dairy industry) cannot kill
it at all."

Dairy experts said the source of the problem might be traced to cattle
feed being contaminated by aflatoxin. "Cattle feed, such as corn, rice
and soybean, will produce the poison after having been stored for a
long time," said Wang Dingmian, chairman of the Guangzhou Dairy
Association.

Cancer-causing toxin discovered in Chinese cooking oil
------------------------------------------------------
Chinese authorities have recalled cooking oil products made by 3
companies after finding they contained the same type of cancer-causing
toxin recently found in milk, state media said Thursday.

A product safety watchdog in the southern province of Guangdong
suspended operations at plants owned by the firms, which made oil
containing excessive levels of aflatoxin, caused by mold, the Xinhua
news agency said.

The incident comes after leading dairy firm Mengniu revealed at the
weekend that authorities found high levels of aflatoxin in a batch of
milk before it was sold, caused by cows eating moldy feed at a farm in
southwest China.

Aflatoxins, which affect grains and other agricultural products, can
increase the risk of cancer, including liver cancer, according to the
World Health Organisation.

The oil was made from peanuts, Xinhua said, naming the producers as
Fusheng Oil, Manyi Peanut Oiland Mabao Oil.

It was not known if any of the tainted oil had reached consumers, it
added.

Chinese state media and netizens, meanwhile, have blasted Mengniu as
consumers voice anger over yet another food safety scandal to hit the
country, despite repeated crackdowns on product safety violations.

In an editorial Thursday, the state-run China Daily newspaper called
on Mengniu to improve quality, saying the reputation of the entire
dairy industry was at stake.

"Consumers' tolerance of food safety issues is wearing ever more thin
and Mengniu's reputation is unlikely to survive another scandal," it
said.

Milk was at the centre of one of China's biggest food safety scandals
in 2008 when the industrial chemical melamine was found to have been
illegally added to dairy products to give the appearance of higher
protein content. At least 6 babies died and another 300,000 became
ill after drinking milk tainted with the chemical. Mengniu and several
other companies were implicated, and the government at the time vowed
to better regulate the dairy industry.

[In the United States, aflatoxin has a regulatory legal limit of 20
parts per billion (ppb) in food, except milk where the limit is 0.5
ppb. It appears that China has a similar regulation.

Aflatoxins are a group of related compounds produced as secondary
metabolites of various fungi, including _Aspergillus parasiticus_,_ A.
flavus_, _A. nomius_, and some _Penicillium_ spp. Aflatoxins are not
produced by all strains of these fungi. The most common aflatoxins in
grains are named, in part, for their fluorescent color: aflatoxins B1
and B2, fluoresce blue and aflatoxins G1 and G2, fluoresce green.
Aflatoxin B1 is the most common and most potent of the aflatoxins.

The mold may not be visible on the food stuff for animals. The mold
may have produced its toxin and the mold may have died. In other
words, mold does not have to be present for the toxic by-product to be
present. Likewise, the toxin is not always present even in the
presence of the mold.

When cattle are fed a feed that is high in aflatoxin, it will pass
into the milk. Many countries test the milk prior to market and levels
above the 0.5 ppb limit are usually forced to dump the milk. It
becomes an expensive situation for the producer so they are generally
careful about their feeds. When a feed higher than permitted results
in dumping of milk, then legal actions often follow.

The toxin is produced under certain environmental conditions. The
conditions can exist in a variety of grain based products; corn, and
peanuts are a few of them. There has to be a certain amount of
moisture and temperature and the organism has to be present to grow
the mold to produce the aflatoxin.

Aflatoxin can be produced under the right condition in the home.
Certain products, such as dog food, or cattle feed may not have the
toxin in them upon delivery but in warm conditions with the right
amount of moisture can grow in the feed after it is delivered or
purchased by the consumer. Favorable conditions include high moisture
content and high temperature. At least 13 different types of aflatoxin
are produced in nature, with aflatoxin B1 considered the most toxic.
While the presence of _A. flavus_ does not always indicate harmful
levels of aflatoxin, it does mean that the potential for aflatoxin
production is present (source:
http://archive.gipsa.usda.gov/newsroom/backgrounders/b-aflatox.pdf).

As with any substance, dose makes the toxin. In all probability we are
all exposed to a little bit of aflatoxin when we consume certain
products such as nuts. A very low level may not be harmful for a very
long time. However, certain levels are known to be responsible for
liver damage. In humans, it has been linked to liver cancer.

So while the milk may not have made it to market, it seems oil from
the grains (corn oil?) has made it to market. â€“ Mod.TG
