Epidemiological comments: On 31 May 2013, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7 was detected in mallards in samples collected in connection with the Danish surveillance programme for avian influenza. The stamping-out of the mallards at the infected holding will be initiated as soon as possible. The mallards and the pheasants are kept epidemiologically separated and LPAI H7 has only been detected in the mallards. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has established a restricted zone at 1 km around the holding and are implementing the necessary measures in accordance with Council Directive 2005/94/EC [see http://tinyurl.com/lq4w9kg].

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2012).

[The location of the reported LPAI event is available on the appended map at the source URL.

The Danish report is commendably detailed, specifying, under "affected population", the actual species involved (mallards, pheasants) and adding useful epidemiological information.

Since mid-March 2013, LPAI H7 has been reported from poultry in 2 other central/north European countries, namely Netherlanda (H7N7, in March) and Germany (H7N7, in April). Results of the final analysis of the Danish strain are anticipated.

A new case of LPAI in poultry, caused by virus strain H7N1, has been reported today (3 Jun 2013) in an immediate OIE notification from the Netherlands (Leusden, Utrecht province). The report included the following epidemiological comments: "On 1 June 2013, a 1 km protection zone has been established. In this one-km zone there are 11 other premises with poultry. Screening of these premises starts on 3 June 2013. All susceptible animals on the infected farm have been culled."

In the Dutch report, the "species" is given as "birds". Additional information on the actual species and, if possible, about the relevant maintenance/husbandry (caged/free range?) would be helpful.
