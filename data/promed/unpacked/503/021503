The lower Drave (Drau, Drava) valley in Carinthia has been stricken
by a mumps epidemic. Approximately 100 individuals are ill. Two
youths have been hospitalized with meningitis. More young men are
suffering testicular inflammation, which can lead to sterility. On
Tuesday [6 Jun 2006] vaccinations will begin.
The first case was recorded at Easter. The onset of the epidemic was
at an Easter festival in Feistritz on the Drave according to research
by physicians. Some students, who became ill in Graz, also took
part. The incubation time for mumps is as long as 3 weeks. During
this time, individuals can be infectious, even when the illness has
yet to show symptoms.
Mumps is not a harmless disease according to Barbara Eichwalder,
physician at the Pedicatrics and Adolescent Medicine Department at
the District Hospital of Villach. There can be complications,
including meningitis, and inflammation of the testicles, salivary
glands, and pancreas. Among those who have been immunized, there are
vaccine failures in 3-5 percent, which can lead to the risk of
contracting mumps despite immunization. For this reason,
pediatricians recommend a 2nd immunization in the 2nd year of life,
after a specific interval, to lower the chance of infection.
Dr. Wolfgang Schantl (Socialist Party of Austria), the District
Health Administrator, explained to Austrian radio over the weekend
that vaccinations for as many people as possible in the affected
region will begin on Tue 6 Jun 2006. These will be administered by
the public health physicians and ancillary personnel from the Health
Department of Villach.

[There has been a resurgence of mumps in young adults in several
parts of the world in recent months, attributable predominantly to
single immunisations (rather than the optimal 2) or no immunisations
at all. In some previous reports this was attributed to deficiencies
in the availability of the mumps component of the triple MMR vaccine.
