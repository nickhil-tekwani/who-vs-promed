Nigeria: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update
-----------------------------------------------
The government of Nigeria has announced today [Sat 3 Feb 2007], the
presence of A/H5N1 avian influenza virus in a 22-year-old deceased
female from Lagos. The initial positive test findings from a
laboratory in Nigeria were confirmed by the WHO Collaborating Centre
for Reference and Research on Influenza in London [see: Avian
influenza, human (29): Nigeria, conf. 20070203.0439]. Further
investigations are under way to identify the source of her infection.
All samples from contacts of the deceased have tested negative by the
WHO Collaborating Centre.
H5N1 virus has been identified in poultry outbreaks in Nigeria and
similar to other affected countries, sporadic cases of human
infection with avian influenza are not unexpected. WHO is working
with the government of Nigeria to carry out intensive surveillance
and reports of additional suspected cases may occur as people with
influenza-like symptoms seek medical advice.
The H5N1 avian influenza virus is not transmitted to humans through
properly prepared and cooked food. Cases of human infection with H5N1
have frequently been linked to the home slaughter and subsequent
handling of diseased or dead birds prior to cooking. These practices
represent the highest risk to human infection and are the most
important to avoid. When handling raw poultry or live or dead birds,
it is imperative to disinfect hands and surfaces with soap and water.
Consumers also need to be sure that during the cooking process,
poultry reaches temperatures of at least 70 deg C in all parts and
that eggs are fully cooked throughout. Detailed recommendations
concerning food safety are available at:
