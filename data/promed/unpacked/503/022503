The outbreak of pox disease among pigeons has raised concern among pigeon lovers and rearers in Tiruchi district.

The polyclinics run by the Department of Animal Husbandry in Tiruchi district particularly at Palakarai on Madurai road are reported to have received many pigeons affected with pox during the last few days. Increased incidence of pigeon pox is noticed in and around Adavathur, where pigeons are reared in large numbers.

"Many pigeons have been affected with pox. We are really worried as the disease has occurred in flocks," says A. Sundaramurthy, pigeon rearer in Adavathur, who brought a bird for treatment at the polyclinic in Palakarai on Wednesday [Wed 15 Nov 2017].

Dr. Ganesh Kumar, veterinarian, told The Hindu that changes in weather condition could have caused the disease among pigeons. "If a bird was affected with the disease, the virus would quickly spread to other birds in flocks. Mortality rate would be high if the pox was noticed in the mouth. If the pox was noticed on the outer body, the birds could be saved if proper treatment was given. The virus does not affect humans," he said.

[Avian pox is a slowly developing disease of birds caused by several different strains of avipoxvirus. A variety of birds worldwide, including upland gamebirds, marine birds, Passeriformes and Psittaciformes can become infected.

Avian pox occurs in 2 forms, the cutaneous being the most common. The cutaneous form of pox causes warty growths on unfeathered skin, sometimes in large clusters. The size and number of growths depend on the stage and severity of infection. Birds are often emaciated due to inability to feed (see picture of the lesions at https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DIgKkmo_Ovc/hqdefault.jpg). In the diphtheritic form, there are raised, yellow plaques on the mucus membranes of the mouth and throat.

Transmission occurs via direct contact with infected birds, ingestion of food and water contaminated by sick birds or carcasses, or contact with contaminated surfaces such as bird feeders and perches. The virus enters through abraded skin. Insects, especially mosquitoes, may act as mechanical vectors. - Mod.PMB
