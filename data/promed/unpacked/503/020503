The number of Cairns residents struck down with dengue fever has
skyrocketed, less than a fortnight after Queensland Health declared
an outbreak.

Figures released last night [12 Dec 2008] show there have now been 30
cases of the disease, after 2 confirmed cases at Manoora and Portsmith.

The dengue alert was first raised on 2 Dec [2008]. 2 people have been
taken to hospital with the disease and Queensland Heath's Tropical
Population Health Services medical entomologist Scott Ritchie said
the outbreak was starting to show worrying signs.

In 2006, 29 people were infected in the last dengue outbreak in Cairns.

"People first started getting sick in early November [2008], but of
all confirmed cases, almost 75 percent of them, have become ill in
just the last 3 weeks," he said. "That is a sharp increase in the
number of cases, especially considering there were 22 cases in the
Port Douglas outbreak earlier this year [2008], over a longer time period.

"Combine that with the fact that the outbreak has now stretched to
both sides of Sheridan St in Cairns North, and possibly to other
suburbs, including Whitfield and Clifton Beach, then this is quickly
becoming a notable outbreak." Dr Ritchie said it was vital that
Cairns residents took immediate steps to prevent themselves from
being bitten by mosquitoes and from the outbreak escalating.

Cairns City Council environmental assessment manager Laurie Pipps
said council crews were patrolling infection zones. He said where it
was appropriate, fogging was being undertaken but the mosquitoes
responsible for transmitting the disease only bred in fresh water and
that tended to be on homes and private property. "Officers are doing
house to house inspections and are advising people as to what they
should do to protect themselves," he said.

Common dengue mozzie [mosquito] breeding sites include tyres,
buckets, toys, and pot plant bases and residents should also ensure
that roof gutters are not blocked and breeding mosquitoes.

[The concern that Queensland health authorities expressed on 1 Dec
2008 for potential increase in dengue cases (see ProMED-mail archive
no. 20081207.3840) has come to pass, as indicated in this current report.

This same report was sent in by ProMED-mail rapporteur A-Lan Banks.

The cases of dengue fever in the Tanjung Pinang City, Kepulauan Riau
province, have become an outbreak because during November 2008 as
many as 67 [dengue] illness sufferers have been recorded. The head of
the Health Section of Tanjung Pinang City, Eka Hanasarianto, said
this is the 1st time that dengue cases in Tanjung Pinang City have
reached the outbreak category.

"In the previous month there were only 27 cases, now the increase is
twice that," he said. He said a 3-year-old child died as a result of
being attacked by dengue virus.'' This year [2008] there have been 5
dengue fever sufferers who died," he said. Eka suggested during
January-November 2008 as many as 170 dengue cases have been recorded
in Tanjung Pinang City.

In the past week [week of 16-22 Nov 2008] 2 children died and several
people underwent medical treatment.

The number [of dengue cases] was not yet increased by several
residents who claimed to have had [dengue] fever, because malaria has
not yet been ruled out in these cases.

It was reported that in the case of dengue fever, the official of the
city of Tanjung Pinang, Suryatati A Manan, considered that the
control and eradication [of dengue virus vector mosquitoes] is not easy.

Concern was expressed that continuing the fogging activity could
cause a new problem, that is by causing [insecticide] resistance of
the mosquitoes. At this time the appropriate method to deal with
dengue outbreaks is the application of "3M plus": that is draining
the places of water collection in an orderly fashion at least weekly,
treatment of water catchments with abate powder [a larvicide. -
Mod.TY], covering places of water storage, and burying discarded
things that could collect rain water.

Dengue cases up by 35 percent in HCMC [Ho Chi Minh City]
--------------------------------------------------------
Ho Chi Minh City has so far this year [2008] recorded nearly 14 000
cases of dengue fever or a 35 percent year-on-year increase, a senior
city health official has said.

Dr Nguyen Dac Tho, deputy director of the city's Preventive Health
Center was addressing a meeting on preventing and fighting epidemics
held Wednesday [10 Dec 2008].

He said while the city has managed to control somewhat the spread of
the mosquito-borne fever, the situation remained complicated.

Districts 6, 8, 10, 11, Tan Binh, and Tan Phu are still the worst hit areas.

Tho also cautioned district health agencies against ignoring malaria
as a threat, noting a patient had recently died because it was
discovered too late.

[The number of dengue fever cases reported from Ho Chi Minh City is
still increasing with total cases of 14 000 reported during 2008 --
representing an increase from 10 000 cases and 5 deaths reported on
25 Oct 2008 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (16): Ho
Chi Minh City 20081025.3368). As of 25 Nov 2008, a total of 78 512
cases and 79 deaths of dengue fever had been recorded nationwide,
while the 20 southern cities and provinces have reported 58 635 cases
and 69 deaths in 2008 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam
(20) 20081126.3720).

More dengue cases are confirmed
-------------------------------
So far this year [2008], the municipalities most affected by [dengue]
virus are Zapopan, Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara, and Tlaquepaque.

It's a fact. The dengue outbreak in [Jalisco] state has not ended,
even with the lower temperatures, which are not the best environment
for the mosquito that transmits the virus.

The Secretariat of Health of Jalisco confirmed an additional 20
dengue cases in the state, and this time the most affected place is
the El Pitillal area in Puerto Vallarta.

These cases occurred in epidemiological week 49 [1-5 Dec 2008]. With
these latest findings, [the dengue cases] total 629 people who have
been infected by the virus, distributed in 32 municipalities.

A week ago, the Jalisco Director of Public Health, Elizabeth Ulloa
Robles, announced that the [dengue] prevention activities are
continuing and will go on throughout 2009, as a new protection
strategy for the population. It is possible that next year [2009] the
outbreak will be DHF.

[The cities of Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta are major tourist
destinations, especially during the high season, which has just
started. Dengue outbreaks are likely to keep tourists away, with
unfortunate economic impacts locally.

Magnitude of the epidemic
-------------------------
During [epidemiological] week 49 [1-7 Dec 2008] of 2008, we estimated
that 145 people have consulted a general practitioner for a clinical
syndrome suggestive of dengue [virus infection]. The number of
laboratory confirmed [dengue] cases is also above the maximum levels
expected for many weeks, without a decreasing trend. The rate of
positive serological tests remains stable at around 40 percent.

Severity of the epidemic
------------------------
Since early December [2008], 2 laboratory confirmed cases were
hospitalized, 1 adult for DHF, and 1 child for a classical dengue
fever. Since the epidemic began, 16 people have been hospitalized: 10
adults including 3 severe forms and a dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]
[case], and 4 children (with classical dengue fever). No deaths from
dengue have been recorded since the beginning of the epidemic.

[Dengue virus] serotypes circulating
------------------------------------
DEN-1 virus (60 percent [of cases]) with DEN-2 virus co-circulating
since the epidemic began. DEN-4 virus was identified for the 1st time
during the month of October [2008]. On the Dutch part of the island,
these 3 viruses are circulating also.
