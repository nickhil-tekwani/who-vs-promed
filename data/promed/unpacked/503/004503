The New England Journal of Medicine (27 November, vol. 337) has published a
letter to the Editor from Jurgen F.J. Kun, Ph.D., Peter G. Kremsner, M.D.,
University of Tubingen, and Harald Kretschmer, M.D.,
Paul-Lechler-Krankenhaus. In it they describe an unusual case of malaria.
Apparently, a 45-year-old German hospital-laboratory technician spent her
holiday in Tanzania in March 1994 under malaria prophylaxis with
chloroquine and proguanil (chloroguanide). In October 1994 she had fever
and headache. A thick blood smear revealed _Plasmodium falciparum_. She
was treated immediately with halofantrine, which led to the relief of
symptoms and clearance of the parasites. In January 1995 falciparum malaria
developed again, and the patient was treated with mefloquine. She had her
next bout of falciparum malaria in March 1995 and received oral quinine and
doxycycline therapy. In August 1995, during the fourth attack, she
received quinine and doxycycline intravenously under supervision. A fifth
episode, in September 1995, was treated with oral artesunate. In October
1995 artesunate was combined with sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine when she
had her sixth attack. For attack number seven, in November 1995, quinine
therapy was combined with clindamycin. In December 1995 artesunate was
combined with chloroquine for her eighth episode of falciparum malaria.
Her physicians, who by then were suspicious, undertook studies of the
parasite. _P. falciparum_ parasites from attacks number 9 (February 1996,
treated with chloroquine and proguanil), number 10 (April 1996, treated
with chloroquine and clindamycin), number 11 (June 1996, treated with
atovaquone and proguanil), number 12 (August 1996, treated with quinine),
and number 13 (December 1996, treated with chloroquine) were investigated
for in vitro sensitivity to chloroquine, quinine, and mefloquine (1) and
for the genotypic pattern of their merozoite surface antigen 1 (MSA-1)
polymorphisms. (2,3)
Parasites from attacks 10 and 12 showed a high susceptibility to quinine
and mefloquine and resistance to chloroquine. Furthermore, the different
lengths of polymerase-chain-reaction fragments from the MSA-1 gene clearly
showed different parasite genotypes in attacks 9 through 13 (Figure 1).
In this case, no other underlying disease was found, antimalarial
treatments that are usually effective were not radically curative, the
parasites were highly sensitive to quinine and mefloquine (both had been
administered in earlier attacks), and clear-cut differences in parasite
genotypes from one attack to the other were demonstrated. These
circumstances led the responsible physicians to interrogate the patient. A
rather prompt confession uncovered the mystery of the case. The patient,
having had access to infected blood from other patients, was infecting
herself by repeated intravenous inoculations of amounts of as much as 1 ml
of fresh parasitized blood from various donors. The patient is now
receiving psychiatric treatment.
