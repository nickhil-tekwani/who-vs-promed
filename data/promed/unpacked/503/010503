First report of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) in Italy
----------------------------------------
GP Accotto <g.accotto@ivv.cnr.it> (Istituto di Virologia Vegetale, CNR,Strada
delle Cacce 73, 10135 Torino, Italy.); M Bragaloni (Seminis Vegetables Seeds
Italia, Via Canneto di Rodi, 04010 Borgo Sabotino (LT), Italy; D Luison (as
for Bragaloni); S Davino (Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Fitosanitarie,
Università degli Studi di Catania, Via S. Sofia 100, 95100 Catania, Italy; &

Since the late 1980's, crops of tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ L.) in
Sicily and Sardinia have been severely affected by yellow leaf curl disease.
The causal virus was identified as a new geminivirus species, now named
Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV, formerly TYLCV-Sar, Fauquet
et al., 2000). Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV, formerly TYLCV-Is),
originally described in Israel, causes the same disease in many countries
worldwide (Moriones & Navas-Castillo, 2000).
The full genomic sequences of TYLCSV isolates from Sicily (Acc. No. Z28390)
and Sardinia (Acc. No. X61153) were determined and used to develop molecular
tools specifically for detection of the virus (Accotto et al., 2000). A 570
bp DNA fragment amplified from the capsid protein gene was digested with Ava
II restriction enzyme and separated by gel electrophoresis.
Over the past 5 years, surveys have been conducted in the main tomato
production area of Sicily (Ragusa province) to determine whether viral
species other than TYLCSV were present. A PCR/RFLP procedure described in
Accotto et al. (2000) was used to identify TYLCSV and TYLCV. Only TYLCSV was
identified in 2001.
In 2002, symptomatic leaf samples were collected in April, September &
November from 8 greenhouse grown tomato crops, in different areas of Ragusa
province, and DNA was extracted and analysed as above. Of 49 samples analysed
from individual plants, 16 produced a pattern typical of TYLCSV, 7 that of
TYLCV and 26 produced a combination of the 2 patterns, indicating a mixed
infection of both viruses.
Sequence analysis of DNA amplified from 2 samples infected with TYLCV showed
that, in this genomic region, the virus isolated in Sicily is more than 95
percent homologous to TYLCV isolates characterized in many different
countries. These include Israel, Portugal, Spain, USA, Japan, Cuba, Dominican
Republic, Iran and many others.
This is the first report of TYLCV in Italy. Our data indicates that TYLCV has
spread very quickly in an area where the other viral species causing yellow
leaf curl disease, TYLCSV, was the only geminivirus detected in previous
years (Sánchez-Campos et al., 1999). The data also indicates that mixed
infections are very frequent under field conditions, thus complicating
development of breeding strategies to obtain genetic resistance.

[TYLC is one of the most devastating viral diseases of cultivated tomato in
tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, and losses of up to 100 percent
are frequent. It is often the main limiting factor in tomato production. The
progressive displacement of TYLCSV by TYLCV in Italy is reminiscent of the
same phenomenon earlier in southern Spain, where TYLCV spread very quickly
and displaced TYLCSV from that region. Possible reasons that might explain
the shift in Spain could be that local biotypes of _Bemisia tabaci_
[whitefly] are more efficient vectors of TYLCV and that common bean
(_Phaseolus vulgaris_) is a reservoir host for TYLCV but not for TYLCSV.
