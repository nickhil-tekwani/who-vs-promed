The Chilean government is working to reduce the 1st outbreak of anthrax
this year [2007], which was detected 9 days ago [15 Feb 2007], interim
agriculture minister Cecilia Leiva reported. Insisting there was no risk of
contagion to human beings, she said the Agriculture and Cattle Service
(SAG) is taking measures to prevent and control spread of the illness. The
interim ministerial team administered antibiotics to people and vaccinated
100 ovine and bovine animals to prevent new outbreaks.
This 1st case was found in southern Punta Capitana, a small fishing village
of 15 families. Leiva reported that SAG took samples of the dead animal for
laboratory analysis, which confirmed the presence of the _Bacillus
anthracis_, known as Carbunco bacteridiano or "Picada" [in Spanish].

Chile's acting agriculture minister, Cecilia Leiva, said on Friday [23 Feb
2007], that health authorities are working "to minimize the risks" of an
outbreak of anthrax in a small village of farmers and fishermen in the
extreme south of the country. So far "human contagion" has been discarded.
An inter-ministerial task force is in the village and has given antibiotics
to the 15 families [as well as] vaccinated 100 head of cattle and sheep to
prevent further outbreaks. Leiva said that 10 days have elapsed since the
death of the cow with the bacterial anthrax and "none of the people which
were in contact with the animal have shown any symptoms".
Samples from the dead animal taken to a Health Ministry lab in Osorno
confirmed that presence of _Bacillus anthracis_, but Leiva pointed out that
only 3 outbreaks have been reported in the past 25 years in the area.
Francisco Bahamonde, head of Chile's Agriculture and Livestock Sanitation
Office, called on all farmers not to forget to vaccinate cattle and sheep,
particularly at the end of the summer and beginning of autumn when the
anthrax spores represent a risk.

[The Chilean advice to vaccinate livestock at the end of the summer is
unusual as anthrax/carbunclo is primarily a hot weather disease in the rest
of the globe. I will check with my Chilean veterinary contacts as to what
they commonly recommend and their usual experiences with this disease. One
of the problems may be that they might have in the past seen outbreaks when
animals were being trailed down from the altiplano pastures to the low
altitude winter pastures, rather as we see in Central Asia. - Mod.MHJ]

After a case of bovine anthrax was detected, a contingency plan was
implemented, in order to prevent transmission of the disease to humans.
The case detection was possible thanks to monitoring by the Municipal
Health Area, the Local development Program (PRODESAL, according to its
Spanish initials), and the Agricultural and Farming Service (SAG, according
to its Spanish initials). While monitoring activities were performed, they
found that a family had buried a cow suspected of dying because of "la
pica", which is the name used in Chilean rural areas for anthrax. In the
Punta Capitana area, Fresia community, they detected that the death of a
cow was caused because of carbuncle, also named anthrax.
SAG got interested in this issue and decided to send one ear of the dead
animal to a laboratory in Osorno, in order to confirm the presumptive
diagnosis.
Mr Jorge Schythe, head of the SAG office in Puerto Yaras, commented that
the samples were sent last Thursday [15 Feb 2007], and yesterday [21 Feb
2007] they were reported as positive. "We contacted immediately with Fresia
Municipality and with sanitary authorities, since it is a public health
problem", he commented.
The Fresia municipality, as well as Health Services and SAG, took
coordinated actions for organizing a technical inspection, which comprises
aspects related to epidemiological surveillance, preventive measures for
cases in humans, and specific preventive actions related to animal
sanitation. Mr Schythe explained that in 7 years he had 2 additional
reports of suspected anthrax, but only this time the results were reported
as positive.

[There are 3 Fresias in Chile -- Punta Capitana comes up on none of my
searches -- and if it is in Biobio go to:
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CI/6/Fresia.html>, which is very near the
coast and close to Tome and Rafael, see below.
There are 2 near Osorno in Los Lagos:
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CI/9/Fresia2.html>
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CI/9/Fresia.html>.
According to OIE, in 2005 there were 5 outbreaks in Chile, with 4 in March
(Araucania (1), Biobio (1), and Los Lagos (2)) and all affecting cattle;
and one Los Lagos outbreak in September 2005, also in cattle. In prior
years there were 3 cattle outbreaks in 2000, 2001 (2), 2002 (4), 2003 (3),
2004 (5); in sheep 2000 (2) and 2004 (1); pigs 2000 (1); and in humans 2000
(9), 2001 (4), 2002 (5), 2003 (4), and 2004 (11). - Mod.MHJ]
