News
Two response teams assaulted in Beni
------------------------------------
- Two response teams were attacked this Mon 24 Jun 2019 in Beni [North Kivu]. One is a vaccination team that was attacked in the Tamende health area and the other, a psychosocial support team in the Madrandelle health area, while they were both in full activity. These teams were attacked by young people, including bikers following the death of their friend, a young boy who died on Mon 24 Jun 2019 at an ETC. This young person has a twin brother, who is also a confirmed Ebola case and is currently in treatment at the ETC. It should be noted that these 2 health areas have reported several cases of Ebola in recent weeks. From these attacks, there is a report of 2 wounded policemen who were transferred to the Beni General Referral Hospital and a burned vehicle.

- The coordinator of Beni's response, Dr Gaston Tshapenda, said that an intermediary between the coordination and this community has already been delegated to meet the people of these 2 countries, especially the young people with a view to finding a compromise to bring back the situation calm. "Right now, it is hard to work. All the teams are waiting and working in slow motion, while there are alerts here and there," he pleaded, adding that the security situation is calm and that the teams are acting with caution.

Figures of the response
-----------------------
- 141 754 vaccinated;
- 839 people vaccinated on 23 Jun 2019;
- persons vaccinated by health zone: 34 466 in Katwa, 27 730 in Beni, 18 696 in Butembo, 13 220 in Mabalako [total number of people vaccinated can be seen at the source URL above];
- of those vaccinated, 39 2017 are high-risk contacts (HRC), 72 031 are contacts of contacts (CC), and 30 516 are frontline providers (FLP).
- 68 710 847 controlled people;
- monitoring activities at the Mukulya strategic checkpoint in Beni were halted following the destruction of the material by strangers during the night of Sun 23 Jun-Mon 24 Jun 2019.
- 80 entry points (PoE) and health checkpoints (PoC) operational.
- 122 contaminated health workers;

DRC Ebola deaths top 1500; more cases in Ituri province capital
---------------------------------------------------------------
The number of new Ebola cases reported daily by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continued its steady rise over the past 3 days, with 35 new cases reported, 2 of them in Bunia, the capital of Ituri province, which is home to about 366 000 people.

Bunia cases draw health minister visit
--------------------------------------
The resurgence of cases in Bunia [Ituri] -- the 2nd-largest city in the eastern DRC -- follows the detection of an imported case. Over the weekend [22-23 Jun 2019], DRC health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, visited the city to meet with provincial officials to assess the status of the response in the area, according the DRC health ministry's update yesterday [23 Jun 2019].

Last week [week of 17 Jun 2019], the health ministry reported a case in Bunia, involving a contact of an earlier case in Rwampara health zone who had refused follow-up and vaccination. In March [2019], the city reported an infection in a 6-month-old baby. The recent cases bring the total in the city to 4.

The city has been preparing for the arrival of more cases for several months and put mechanisms in place quickly, the health ministry said. Kalenga said, "Putting public health measures in place is one thing, but it is mainly the community that has to take ownership, accept protective measures, and also vaccination, a way to break the chain of transmission."

Bunia has only one Ebola transit center, where people with suspected Ebola infections stay to await their test results. Efforts are under way to turn Bunia's transit center into an Ebola treatment center, and health officials are drawing up plans to strengthen Ituri province's health system.

More health workers infected
----------------------------
The 35 new cases are from 9 different areas, including Beni (9), Lubero (8), Mabalako (7), and Mandima (5), and Bunia (2). The following locations each reported 1 new case: Mangurujipa, Rwampara, Kalunguta, and Katwa.

The latest infections lift the outbreak total to 2239 cases, and today's [24 Jun 2019] World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard suggests that the ministry will report 8 more cases today, which would boost the overall number to 2247.

In its daily update yesterday [23 Jun 2019], the health ministry reported 3 more Ebola infections in health workers, all from Lubero. 2 had been vaccinated, but the report didn't say how long ago. The illnesses bring the number of healthcare workers infected in the outbreak to 122, of which 39 were fatal.

As of yesterday [23 Jun 2019], health officials were still investigating 276 suspected cases.

Regarding deaths, 27 more people in the DRC died from Ebola, lifting the fatality count past 1500 to 1506. Of the latest deaths, 12 occurred in the community -- which raises the risk of transmission -- and 15 occurred in Ebola treatment centers.

[It is concerning that 3 more Ebola infections were noted in health workers, and 2 had been vaccinated at an "unknown time". Whether this is waning of immunity is not at all clear. It would be helpful to know exactly when they were vaccinated, but it has to have been within the year since vaccinations began in the DRC, less than 1 year ago. - Mod.LK]

- Thu 20 Jun 2019. WHO: Disease Outbreak News
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/20-june-2019-ebola-drc/en/

This week saw a continued, gradual decrease in the number of new Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases from the hotspots of Katwa and Butembo compared to the previous weeks. However, these encouraging signs are offset by a marked increase in case incidence in Mabalako health zone, and especially in Aloya health area (Figure 1). While the spread of EVD to new geographic areas remains low, in the health zones of Bunia, Lubero, Komanda and Rwampara, recent reintroduction events illustrate the high risks in previously affected areas. Along with the rise in cases in Mabalako, there was also an accompanying increase in healthcare worker (HCW) and nosocomial infections. These findings highlight the ongoing need to comprehensively strengthen the infection prevention and control measures in the various healthcare facilities operating in these areas. The occurrence of EVD infections in these health areas also place a strain on the already limited security resources needed to facilitate access for effective response activities to continue.

In addition to operational challenges encountered on the ground by healthcare workers during the past 10 months, the overall EVD outbreak response effort is confronting substantial difficulty in maintaining scale in the context of a USD 54 million funding shortage. Without adequate funding to fill this gap, response activities will be compromised, negatively impacting the entire response, resulting in a drastic reduction in vital health services available and a cessation of operations during a critical time of the outbreak. Member States and other donors are strongly encouraged to help meet this funding gap in order to ensure that hard won progress in containing this EVD outbreak will not suffer a potentially devastating setback due to financial limitations.

In the 21 days, between 29 May-18 Jun 2019, 62 health areas within 15 health zones reported new cases, representing 9% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 245 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (37%, n=91), Mandima (12%, n=30), Katwa (11%, n=28), Beni (11%, n=27) , Butembo (9%, n=23) , Kalunguta (5%, n=13), and Musienene (5%, n=12). As of 18 Jun 2019, a total of 2190 EVD cases, including 2096 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1470 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1376 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2190 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1242) were female, and 29% (639) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 122 (6% of total cases).

No new EVD cases or deaths have been reported in the Republic of Uganda since the previous EVD Disease Outbreak News publication on 13 Jun 2019.

Ebola updates for DRC and Uganda, 'Ebola is fake' challenge
-----------------------------------------------------------
Uganda
------
The Uganda Ministry of Health reported Fri [21 Jun] that Uganda has not registered any new confirmed Ebola case in Kasese district or any other part of Uganda.

There are no suspect cases under admission.

456 individuals have been vaccinated against Ebola virus disease in 13 areas of Kasese district. The vaccinated individuals are contacts to the confirmed Ebola cases and nonvaccinated frontline health and other workers.

On [Fri 21 Jun 2019], a 19-year-old male passed away after presenting with symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever. However, testing performed by the Uganda Virus Research Institute was not only negative for Ebola, but also Marburg, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever.

Ebola is "fake" dilemma
-----------------------
In addition to the hurdles health workers face in the DRC when battling this outbreak-violence from armed groups and community members-another issue must be overcome...some don't believe Ebola is real!

In a recent Thomson Reuters opinion piece, British Red Cross director of programmes and partnerships, Alex Carle writes that some question the existence, stating some examples:
"The Ebola virus doesn't exist; it's a virus that was made to eliminate the Congolese."
"Ebola came as a gateway for several organizations that come to loot our minerals."
"To increase or expand the list of deaths at Ebola Treatment Centres, innocent people are accused of being sick."

The most common is that Ebola is a tool being used to exploit communities for influence or money, but we we've also heard a rumour that patients at the centres were given a pill to make them die.

They have to battle the false rumor mill with innovative techniques like using transparent body bags, as one example.

The 2nd largest EVD outbreak ever faces many stumbling blocks and a big thank you is warranted to the Ebola workers on the front line facing these myriad of issues.

[An interview with Robert Herriman (Ebola: Pathology, treating patients and the current outbreak) can be heard at the URL above. The Ebola workers absolutely need to be thanked and praised for their innovative approaches to counteract the false news and rumors. Certainly a lot of the distrust from the community has grown out of actual abuses to which they have been subject, so it is an extremely difficult situation for all involved in battling this outbreak.

Suspect cases in Uganda continue to be tested for confirmation of Ebola. There are a number of other diseases that have similar early presentation with which it can be mistaken. In the fatal case who died with symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever described above, the patient was not only negative for Ebola, but also Marburg, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever. It is not stated whether the cause of death was ever determined.

However, there were confirmed Ebola cases who died in Uganda following attending a burial of a family member, a pastor, in the DRC, as discussed in ProMED-mail Ebola update (55): Congo DR (NK,IT) Uganda (KS) ex DRC, case updates, summaries 20190614.6519943, and commented on by Helen Branswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell):
"Still no new #Ebola cases in Uganda, where today is Day 11 after the last case died [Note there were 4 deaths, all connected: grandfather, grandmother, 3-year old, 5-year old -- see figure in tweet]. 108 contacts are being monitored. 846 people have been vaccinated. Another 10 days in this incubation period..." - Mod.LK]

Most recently, there is a report of a fatal case of a resident of Kicuzi sub county in Ibanda district for which diagnostic assays are underway in Entebbe Virus Research Inst, Uganda. Earlier this month [June 2019], 2 additional individuals from the area died similarly, but no diagnosis was reported (https://croozefm.com/strange-disease-claims-three-in-ibanda-district/). - Communicated by: Mary Marshall

Even further afield, threat of spread of Ebola was tweeted by Helen Branswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell) from @WHO AFRO:
"WHO's weekly outbreak bulletin contains an interesting piece of news. A person who is a contact of a confirmed #Ebola case is now in Dubai. The contact is being monitored there, I think."
WHO/AFRO: "... Searches for lost contacts continue, with remote monitoring of a contact from Katwa who has since moved to Dubai. Collaboration between health authorities in the DRC and Uganda continues around monitoring displaced contacts, particularly since the outbreak has spread to Uganda." - Mod.LK]

[3] Vaccine: target expansion
Date: Fri 21 Jun 2019

https://7sur7.cd/2019/06/22/rdc-ebola-le-vaccin-sera-elargi-aux-femmes-enceintes-et-personnes-souffrant-des-maladies


The Ebola virus vaccine will be expanded to include a broad target, primarily women pregnant more than 3 months, small children under 6 months of age, people with other illnesses, and close relatives of confirmed cases.

The information was confirmed Fri 21 Jun 2019 by Dr Justice N'Sio coordinator of the Ebola response in Butembo.

"The 1st targets are the people who have been in contact with the deceased Ebola; the 2nd targets are the contacts of contacts; and the 3rd targets that have been added are the women pregnant longer than 3 months and toddlers up to 6 months old; another ring was added around the household of deceased Ebola patients, so at this stage the vaccine will not be given to everyone from everywhere, we must have the priorities," hammered Justice N'Sio.

He added that people suffering from chronic diseases will also be the priority vaccination, but under certain conditions.

"If the person has diabetes but is in the middle of a crisis, we cannot vaccinate them, or if they have HIV and they are in crisis, we cannot vaccinate them either. If they are not in bad shape, we vaccinate them," he explained.

The objective of broadening the target of the vaccine against the epidemic is explained in comparison with the scientific data produced in Guinea and DRC (note: so far in DRC more than 130 000 people have already been vaccinated in North Kivu and in Ituri, while in Guinea only about 15 000 people had been vaccinated).

The compilation of these data has proven that the response is much faster when the vaccine is given to the most vulnerable targets and/or those close to the deceased of this hemorrhagic fever.

Note that for about 2 weeks the Butembo the response team has been organizing a so-called "ring vaccination" around confirmed cases of Ebola.
