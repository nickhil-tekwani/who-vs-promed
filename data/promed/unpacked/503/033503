A human case of anthrax has been reported in the western Mongolian province of Uvs, local authorities said on Wednesday [22 Jun 2022].

"The result of a polymerase chain reaction test has revealed that a 37 year old nomadic herder from Undurkhangai soum of the province has contracted anthrax," said a statement of the provincial department for zoonotic diseases.

Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, a spore-forming bacterium, which occurs naturally in soil and mainly affects livestock and wild animals. People can get sick with anthrax if they have contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.

[As a nomadic herder was affected we can presume he got infected from butchering one of his animals. These would usually be cattle as they are the major livestock in that province, but it might have been sheep. The province of Uvs features rarely in our records (see reports from 2005 below). Bovine anthrax is the commonest reported but all other livestock species have been reported. There is a high level of rural poverty so the butchering of anthrax cases is a constant risk.

For information on this Mongolian Province and its various livestock, see Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvs_Province.
