The Ministry of Health and Population announced that a 34-year-old man in Minya [Al Minya governorate, Egypt] has been inflected with the A(H5N1) virus known as bird flu.

It added the patient was currently on a ventilator at hospital and his condition was unstable.

The ministry said in a statement on Wednesday evening [25 Jun 2014] that it has taken preventive measures once the case was suspected and isolated the patient in Minya Fever Hospital. A sample for the patient was sent to Cairo labs for analysis, and his infection with bird flu was confirmed, according to results.

A team from the Preventive Medicine Sector was dispatched to the patient's residence in Minya, the statement said. His wife and children were inspected, and they are in good health and have no bird flu symptoms, according to the statement. They will be reinspected after 10 days, it added.

The patient was transferred to a Cairo hospital in Abbasiya and placed on a ventilator, said the statement.

Egypt has not witnessed bird flu cases since April 2013 [there were 2 cases of human avian influenza A(H5N1) reported by Egypt in March 2014; see below for more details - Mods.AB/MPP], according to the Health Ministry.

[After over 2 months without any occurrence of avian influenza H5N1 in Egypt, this post should be considered as a new alert pointing fingers to the possible comeback of the disease in humans in the country. In March 2014, there were 2 cases of human influenza A(H5N1) infection reported by Egypt -- one in a 56-year-old female resident of Behaira governerate, the other a 4-year-old male in Damitta governerate -- both had a history of exposure to dead and sick poultry (see prior ProMED-mail posts Avian influenza, human (91): Egypt, H5N1 20140406.2385849 and Avian influenza, human (88): Egypt, H5N1, RFI 20140324.2353435 and http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_24March14.pdf?ua=1 for more details). As every human case can only originate from epizootics taking place in birds, one should review the situation of bird flu in the country between April 2014 and now. At the onset of the 1st influenza H5N1 epizootics in domestic birds in February 2006, Minya governorate was considered as one of the most heavily affected governorates in Egypt, according to a mission conducted by Mod.AB for WHO. Given the type of husbandry of chicken and ducks in and around this region and the high density of animals as well as their proximity to households, residual foci of the infection may have persisted in the area, making the bird population from Minya a continuous source of infection to other birds and to humans.

Including this newly reported case, since 2006 when the 1st cases were reported, there have been a total of 176 cases of human infection with influenza A(H1N5) virus including 63 deaths in Egypt (see http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20131210CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf).
