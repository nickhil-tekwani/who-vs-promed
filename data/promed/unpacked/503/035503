Bird flu fatality rate dropping
-------------------------------
The bird flu [human] fatality rate in Indonesia this year [2008] has
dropped from its level last year [2007], according to the executive
chairman of the National Commission of Bird Flu Control and Alertness
(FBPI), Bayu Krisnamurthi.

"The [case] fatality rate [CFR] in 2007 was 88.1 percent, and in the
1st semester of 2008 it was recorded at 84.2 percent," Krisnamurthi
said [in Jakarta] on Monday [11 Aug 2008]. "The decrease has not made
us relax but at least it is a positive sign," he said.

Over the past 3 years, the bird flu [case] fatality rate had decreased, he
said.

In 2006, 43 people were confirmed to have been infected with the
virus, and 34 of them died. [The figures given by WHO are 55 cases and
45 deaths -- see comment below].

In 2007, 27 people were infected, and 23 died. [The figures given by
WHO are 42 cases and 37 deaths].

During the 1st semester this year [2008], FBPI had recorded 19 bird
flu cases and in 16 of them the sufferers died. [The figures given by
WHO are 18 cases and 15 deaths].

Around 42 percent of the patients had direct contact with infected poultry.

[According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Cumulative Table of
Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) the case fatality
rates up to 19 Jun 2008 (the most recent update) are the following:

2005 - 13/20 = 65.0 percent;
2006 - 45/55 = 81.8 percent;
2007 - 37/42 = 88.1 percent;
2008 - 15/18 = 83.3 percent;
overall - 110/135 = 83.3 percent.

The Indonesia statement and interpretation are encouraging but
perhaps somewhat optimistic in the light of the overall figures.
