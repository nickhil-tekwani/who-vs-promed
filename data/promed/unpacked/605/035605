An outbreak of cholera in Kibosho, Moshi Rural district yesterday [17
Apr 2008] claimed 1 life while an unspecified number of people were
being treated in hospitals and health centers. Reports from the area,
some 15 kilometers [9.3 miles] from Moshi on the slopes of Mt.
Kilimanjaro, say the situation was getting out of hand. The
critically hit area is Kibosho division, with scores of residents in
the area said to be in a critical condition.

Vincent Msacky, an assistant medical officer at a hospital there,
said the situation was critical and appealed for support from
district and regional authorities to contain it. Mr. Msacky also said
health facilities available cannot cope with the epidemic which been
occurring over the past 2 weeks.

Unconfirmed reports say the number of people suffering from the
disease could be higher than has been reported. The cholera outbreak
has created a scare in neighbouring villages in Uru, including Kirima
Mashariki, Maua, Singa and Uru Mawella.

400 patients in the hospital," he said. "We had 42 cases on 13 Apr
2008, which was the highest for 1 day."

A cholera outbreak in Kenya has killed 67 people so far in 2008,
United Nations agencies said on Friday [18 Apr 2008]. Nearly 1300
cases of cholera, a water-borne disease, have been reported in the
east African country since January 2008, the WHO said.

More than half are in western Nyanza province along Lake Victoria
which has also had the most deaths, while an outbreak in the east
near the border with Somalia has abated, it said. "The number of new
cases each week is dropping, which is rather reassuring," WHO's
global cholera coordinator Claire-Lise Chaignat told Reuters.

2 cholera cases have been confirmed in Soweto, the Gauteng department
of health said on Wednesday [16 Apr 2008]. Spokesperson Zanele
Mngadi said the 2 cases were confirmed last week at the Chicken Farm
informal settlement in Kliptown, Soweto.

"The source of infection has not been established, but an urgent
investigation is underway to establish the source, identify and treat
possible cases and ensure no further spread of this illness. Water
samples have been taken and the result returned negative," she said.

"Cholera is preventable and treatable," said Mngadi. "If tap water is
not available, fresh water should be collected every day, treated and
stored in clean containers with covers," she added.

As many as 70 new acute diarrhea patients from 10 Vietnamese cities
and provinces were hospitalized on Thursday [17 Apr 2008], of whom 3
tested for cholera, local newspaper Youth on Friday [18 Apr 2008]
quoted the Vietnamese Health Ministry as reporting. The new cases
have raised the total number of acute diarrhea patients in the
country's 19 cities and provinces to over 1800, including 326 cholera
sufferers, since 5 Mar 2008. Most of acute diarrhea sufferers were
from Hanoi, Hai Phong city and the 2 provinces of Ha Tay and Thanh
Hoa in the northern region.

Viet nam has experienced 3 acute diarrhea outbreaks which affected
about 4000 people, of whom some 700 have been positive for cholera

Acute diarrhea is booming in Thach That district in Hanoi's
neighboring province of Ha Tay with 127 patients recorded, including
30 positive for _Vibrio cholerae_. Health Minister Nguyen Quoc Trieu
on 15 Apr 2008 made a field trip to this location.

According to local health experts, the disease is rampant in Huu Bang
commune, Thach That district because on 11-12 Apr 2008 there was a
festival in the district and some families ate dog meat with raw
vegetables and shrimp paste.

From 7 Mar 2008 to 15 Apr 2008, Ha Tay province had 385 diarrhea
patients, including 79 positive for _Vibrio cholerae_.

[9] Diarrhea - Iraq

Acute watery diarrhea (AWD) and laboratory-confirmed cholera, 24-30 Apr 2008
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- For the 1st time since the beginning of 2008 Basra failed to submit
a weekly communicable disease report. During weeks 12 and 13 the
security situation and the damage inflicted upon the cholera
laboratory prevented the hard working and dedicated Basra staff from
producing and sending their weekly report. Reports were also not
received from Diwaniya, Anbar and Diala.

- Further efforts are needed from CDC Baghdad to create channels of
communication with Anbar and ensure that AWD is properly monitored in
all districts. Only Falluja hospital is submitting data on AWD but no
data about water quality monitoring.

- Ninewa, the 2nd most populated province in the country and one of
DOHs that is reporting regularly and in timely fashion, succeeded in
submitting week 13 reports on time and have been included in this
update.

- Kerbala, a very important sentinel province for AWD surveillance,
is now reporting regularly and in timely fashion. Because thousands
of visitors from all over Iraq and neighboring countries visit
Kerbala on daily basis to visit the holy shrines in this locale,
Kerbala surveillance staff must make sure that AWD surveillance
remains timely, complete and accurate.

- This week, out of the 769 reporting sites, 681 sites (89 percent)
reported data on AWD and water quality. All sites in Basra, Diwaniya,
Diala and Anbar failed to report this week.

- In total, 8313 acute watery diarrhea cases were reported, but none
of the 3763 stool samples cultured (45 percent) were positive for the
cholera organism.

Specific Site reports:
----------------------
- Kerbala: 334 cases of acute watery diarrhea were reported. None of
the 334 samples cultured were positive for cholera.

- Kirkuk: 399 cases of acute watery diarrhea were reported. None of
the 263 stool samples cultured were positive for cholera. For the
14th week in a row no cholera cases have been reported in Kirkuk.

- Missan: 390 cases of AWD were reported. None of the 376 stool
samples cultured were positive for cholera.

- Thiqar, Muthana, Tikrit and Babylon: 1188 cases of acute watery
diarrhea were reported. None of the 724 stool samples cultured were
positive for cholera. There is an improvement in the reporting of AWD
from Tikrit in the last 4 weeks. Tikrit surveillance officers should
maintain this progress during the coming weeks.

Total new confirmed cholera cases: 0
