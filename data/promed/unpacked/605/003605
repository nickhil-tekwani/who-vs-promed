The bird flu [avian influenza] epidemic, which emerged in a chicken farm in Japan last week and gradually increased its effect, spread to another province of the country. An outbreak of bird flu has been confirmed at a poultry production facility in Himeji city in Hyogo province. It was reported that a large-scale disinfection work was started in the region due to the epidemic that emerged as a result of genetic tests after the death of an abnormal number of chickens suspiciously on the farm. The state administration set up a crisis desk to decide on the measures to be taken.

The 1st bird flu outbreak of the year [2021] in Japan was confirmed at a chicken farm in Akita province last week [week of 8 Nov 2021], and 143 000 chickens were killed as a precaution. Then, a total of 49 500 animals perished due to the epidemic that spread to 2 different chicken farms in Kagoshima province.

The detection of the highly contagious subtype H5N8 in Kagoshima Prefecture last year [2020], causing the country's largest outbreak of avian flu since the 2005-2006 season, raised concerns. With the latest development, the number of provinces with confirmed avian flu outbreaks in Japan this year has increased to three.

The bird flu epidemic in Japan spread to many provinces across the country last year [2020], and it was announced that the number of killed poultry exceeded 6 million, breaking a record. Due to the spread of the epidemic throughout the country, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) also supported the culling efforts. It was recorded that the previous record belonged to the 2005-2006 season when a total of 5 078 000 chickens were killed due to a less contagious type of the virus.
