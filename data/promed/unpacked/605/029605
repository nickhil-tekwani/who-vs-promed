This afternoon [1 Mar 2012], I spoke with Jim Watson, the Mississippi State Veterinarian, who briefed me on the background of this recent outbreak.

The area where the animals -- 4 cows and 3 calves -- were grazing was a 4-5 acre hay field inside the river levee, i.e. between the levee and the river. It had partly flooded during the abnormally high river flooding of the previous summer but is normally not flooded when the river rises each spring. The 1st death was noted by the owner, but he only took action when the 2nd cow died. Spleen samples were sent to the diagnostic laboratory in Jackson, and anthrax was confirmed.

The surviving animals were removed from this levee pasture and vaccinated. The 2 carcasses were burnt on site. All livestock owners within 5 miles were advised to get their stock vaccinated as soon as possible. There have been no other cases.

The area had been badly hit by the severe anthrax outbreaks of 1991, with the many affected stock being burnt or buried. Many farmers in the area, with personal memories of their own and neighbours' dead stock, still vaccinate their animals each spring.

This outbreak has acted as a wake up call. How this outbreak was initiated is hard to determine. There had been no digging activities. There were no dead deer, which would have indicated a missed case nearby. One can hypothesise that the extraordinary 2011 summer flooding would have floated spores in an old anthrax grave within levee field up towards the surface. However because possible weakening of the soil structure would endanger the levee if carcasses had been buried there in 1991, it would have been unlikely that any were buried there within the levee but they were burnt instead. And in some way, it is not unlikely that this warm winter [2012] has played an unknown part.
