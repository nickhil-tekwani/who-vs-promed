[In the 1st half of 2018, the rate of reported cases of cholera had slowed to less than 1000 per month (about 30 per day) but a dramatic upswing has once again occurred with about 21 000 cases reported in the 1st 2 weeks of September 2018 (about 1500 per day) and more than 15 000 in the 3rd week of September (about 2200 cases/day). The low case fatality rate might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera.

A list of cases and deaths from May 2017 through the current report in this horrific epidemic fed by war and famine is shown below:
