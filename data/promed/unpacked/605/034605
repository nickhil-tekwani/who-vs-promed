Chronic Wasting Disease Confirmed Near Gillette [Wyoming]
---------------------------------------------------------
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department confirmed chronic wasting disease [CWD] in Deer Hunt Area 17 northwest of Gillette.

According to Game and Fish, the buck mule deer was reported by a landowner who had concerns that the animal did not seem healthy. This is the 1st time chronic wasting disease has been found in Deer Hunt Area 17, which is bordered on the east and west by deer hunt areas where CWD has been found as early as 2007.

This is the 9th new deer hunt area found with CWD this year [2016]. In April, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission approved an updated management plan for the disease that includes increased monitoring. Game and Fish personnel have collected and analyzed more than 2900 CWD samples statewide so far this year.

[Since this the 1st time it has been reported in Deer Hunt Area 17 it is an expansion of the disease. However, it is near another known area, so it is not necessarily a big surprise. It may be unfortunate, but not entirely unexpected. - Mod.TG
