A total of 55 people ingested radioactive water in the Kaiga Nuclear
Power Plant in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka state, the
Press Trust of India reported on 29 Nov 2009. According to agency
sources, on 24 Nov 2009 the workers drank water contaminated with
tritium [the heaviest isotope of hydrogen] from a cooler within the
plant. The routine daily urine checks showed they all had increased
levels of tritium and were immediately hospitalized.

The source of contamination of the water remains unknown even after
the immediate investigation. According to The Hindu newspaper, top
officials of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd have put
forward the theory that the water was poisoned intentionally

Deliberate contamination at Kaiga
---------------------------------
Indian authorities have been shocked by the apparently deliberate
radioactive contamination of drinking water by a disgruntled nuclear
worker.

An investigation was sparked after routine urine samples from a number
of staff at Kaiga nuclear power plant were found to have elevated
levels of radiation. It was found that a small amount of heavy water
had been added to a water cooler.

Heavy water itself is not radioactive, and is physically and
chemically similar to regular water where it is present in tiny
amounts. However, a body of heavy water often contains trace amounts
of the hydrogen isotope tritium left over from manufacture and so can
be mildly radioactive.

"Prima-facie, it looks like an employee did it just to grab media
attention and register a protest against the management," said Indian
minister for science and technology Prithviraj Singh Chavan.

The incident is being taken very seriously, said Chavan. Potential
outside influences on staff are being considered and plant owner
Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd has launched its own internal
enquiry. Police are not currently involved.

Disgruntled scientists behind Kaiga incident, claims BJP [Indian
People's Party]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Claiming that the contamination of drinking water at Kaiga nuclear
plant was a matter of "serious concern" as it involved some
"disgruntled scientists" and not any outside enemy, BJP today [1 Dec
2009] urged the government to redress grievances of such scientists.

"There is need for more seriousness on this issue as it involved some
disgruntled scientist. It is a matter of serious concern as he is in
there, unlike a terrorist who would come from outside," deputy leader
of BJP in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said.

She appealed to the government to take measures to deal with the
reasons for the "dissatisfaction among scientists" to prevent such
incidents.

The drinking water in a cooler at Kaiga nuclear power plant in
Karnataka was contaminated with tritium on Saturday [28 Nov 2009],
affecting the health of some employees. Investigators and Kaiga power
plant authorities suspect the involvement of some insider in the case.

State police file FIR [first information report] in Kaiga tritium
contamination case
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Karnataka police today[2 Dec 2009] filed an FIR in the case
relating to alleged mixing of highly radioactive tritium in drinking
water cooler at the nuclear power plant at the Kaiga Atomic Power
Station (KAPS).

With the filing of the FIR the state police joined the sleuths of
Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Nuclear Power Corporation India Limited
(NCPIL) to identify the culprits behind the incident.

Uttara Kannada district police chief, Mr Raman Gupta, informed
newspersons that the FIR was filed following a formal complaint from
the authorities of KAPS about the mixing of tritium on 23 and 24 Nov
2009. He said the district police have also taken up investigation to
nab the culprits.

He said the FIR had not mentioned any names. However, the
investigating team headed by deputy superintendent of police, would
look into all angles including the possibility of the theft of tritium.

[Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen, most often associated with
research. As a form of hydrogen, tritium is found naturally in air and
water. Most hydrogen is made up of one proton, and an orbital
electron, but tritium has 2 extra neutrons in the nucleus. As with
anything, the dose makes the poison, and therefore the dose of tritium
is dependent upon how much was initially ingested and the length of
time in the body.

Tritium is produced naturally in the upper atmosphere when cosmic rays
strike nitrogen molecules in the air. Tritium is also produced during
nuclear weapons explosions, as a byproduct in reactors producing
electricity, and in special production reactors, where the isotope
lithium-6 is bombarded to produce tritium.

Tritium is used in some light sources, watches, exit signs, and a
number of other products. Tritium is a low energy beta emitter and the
body chemically handles it like water. While we do not know about the
dose, nor about the effect it is having on these people, it is likely
of low risk.

As with all ionizing radiation, exposure to tritium increases the risk
of developing cancer. However, because it emits very low energy
radiation and leaves the body relatively quickly, for a given amount
of activity ingested, tritium is one of the least dangerous
radionuclides. Since tritium is almost always found as water, it goes
directly into soft tissues and organs. The associated dose to these
tissues is generally uniform and dependent on the tissues' water
content.

A water cooler being contaminated certainly looks intentional. Surely
the investigation will reveal if this was intentional or if there was
some mishap that resulted in all bottled water being contaminated.

As tritium is generally handled as water, it is hopeful the affected
individuals did not receive a toxic dose and will be fine.

according to [4] on 23 and 24 Nov (and according to The Hindu, on 25
Nov), according to [3] on 28 Nov.
