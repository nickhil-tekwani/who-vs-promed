2000 Cereal Rust Bulletin Final 8 Aug 2000 [edited

Summary
--------
. Stem rust was common throughout the northern Great Plains on wheat,
barley and oat, but developed too late for major damage.
. Wheat leaf rust was less severe than in recent years except in the
northern Great Plains where it has been higher than average for the last
two years.
. Due to a mild winter and cool spring, stripe rust spread throughout the
Great Plains, Southeast and Midwest to an extent not seen in 40 years.
. Oat crown rust was lighter than normal especially in the upper Midwest.
This is the last issue of the Cereal Rust Bulletin for the 1999-2000
growing season. I [David L. Long would like to thank all of those who
helped with the bulletin this year, especially Mark E. Hughes who
coordinates its distribution through the CDL website
<http://www.cdl.umn.edu>, email (markh@cdl.umn.edu) and the post. Any
reports of rust that you found in your area were appreciated and this
information was added on our web page and Cereal Rust Bulletins.
