UNICEF exonerated by central government; state government unconvinced
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The government in the north eastern Indian state of Assam says that the
United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, should still be investigated in
connection with the deaths of children given vitamin supplements in an
anti-blindness campaign earlier this month. At least 20 children were
reported to have died, and hundreds of others were admitted to hospital
after receiving vitamin A doses in the campaign, [for which UNICEF
supplied the vitamin A syrup. UNICEF says the programme was subject to
comprehensive quality control and [that there may be no connection between
the campaign and the deaths. India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
is conducting an inquiry in to the incident.
The health minister of Assam, Bhumidhar Barman, told the BBC on Wednesday
that: "The state government wants the CBI inquiry to include all those
involved in the entire campaign. That, he said, should include UNICEF, the
manufacturers of vitamin A, the training aspect of the campaign, the
administration and the supervision, besides any other matter which the CBI
feels fit to investigate to finally find the cause of death of these poor
children."
In Delhi, the central health minister, C P Thakur, told parliament last
week that in most cases death was due to causes unrelated to vitamin A
administration. He said that: "The deaths have taken place due to diseases
like cardiac failure, foreign body aspiration, or severe anaemia. In many
cases the parents have reported that the deceased child had not been given
any dose of vitamin A. It seems the panic created due to the side effects
resulted in all the deaths being attributed to vitamin A."
