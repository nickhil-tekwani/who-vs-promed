Five more cases of rabbit fever reported in Weld County
-------------------------------------------------------
Weld County says that 5 more men have contracted tularemia, otherwise known as rabbit fever, putting Colorado within striking distance of a state record for cases of what normally is a relatively rare bacterial disease. The county health department reported Tuesday, 28 Jul 2015, that the men who got sick were between the ages of 56 and 80. 2 were hospitalized and 3 recovered at home.

Colorado currently has 16 human cases of rabbit fever, also called tularemia. In an average year there are less than 4 cases. The record was 1983, when 20 cases were reported.

Humans can become infected with tularemia through insect bites, by touching an infected animal or inhaling the bacteria. The bacteria can remain alive in soil, including in animal droppings.

A [South Dakota] state health official says tularemia is on the rise, with 7 cases reported in the Black Hills area since June 2015. "Tularemia is a fairly uncommon but potentially severe disease that can be fatal," said Dr. Lon Kightlinger, state epidemiologist for the Department of Health. "People can be exposed when they come in contact with infected insects and animals, particularly rabbits, rodents and cats."

6 of South Dakota's cases were adults over the age of 50 and 1 was a child under 5. 5 of the 7 were hospitalized. Kightlinger noted that 1 of the cases had direct contact with a pet cat that tested positive for tularemia.

Sometimes called rabbit fever, tularemia most commonly results in a sore developing where the bacteria enter the body, accompanied by swelling of the lymph nodes. In severe cases, it can cause fever and a pneumonia-like illness, which can be fatal.

To reduce the risk of tularemia, Kightlinger encouraged people to use insect repellants when outside with animals and to take precautions such as wearing gloves and double-bagging when handling and disposing of dead animals. Animal owners, particularly cat owners, should watch their animals for signs of illness and contact their veterinarian as soon as possible if unusual signs develop. Using tick and insect repellants on pets and livestock also helps prevent transmission of tularemia and other vector-borne diseases. Cat owners should consult their veterinarians about appropriate repellants as some labeled for use on dogs may be toxic for cats.

"Especially during this season of camping and outdoor recreation, people, including Rally-goers, should avoid or take special precautions with rabbits, prairie dogs, gophers and voles," said Kightlinger.

Other states in the region, including North Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado are also reporting increased cases.

[Although not apparently related to bioterrorism in this case, tularemia is a category A bioterrorism agent, and the pneumonic form is likely to be the one associated with intentional spread.

Tularemia is caused by _Francisella tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.

_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.

Humans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3-5 days, with a range of 1-14 days. - Mod.LL
