[Re: ProMED-mail Norovirus - USA: (OR, WA) reusable bag link 20120510.1128990]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This report wrongly paints the reusing of shopping bags as a factor in this disease transmission. It wasn't the fact that the bag was reusable it was the fact that it was stored in the bathroom that led to subsequent exposure. Thus, the title of the report and quoted comments from the researchers such as "Incidentally, this also illustrates one of the less obvious hazards of reusable grocery bags" are inflammatory and baseless given the information shared in the report. Unless the researchers determine that the virus could not have lived on a disposable grocery bag then the comment is harmful. There are many proven advantages to the environment and public health to employing reusable grocery bags and this report baselessly creates doubts towards this practice. I ask respectfully that it be corrected.

[ProMED-mail thanks Mark Payne for this comment. We agree with his contention that the risk of transmission of norovirus infection in this incident was increased as a consequence of the fact that the team's lunches were stored in a container in a hotel toilet, and the reusable nature of the container was not necessarily the relevant factor. We believe that this was explicitly stated in the original publication, although the subsequent report, which formed the basis of the ProMED-mail post did focus on the unsealed and reusable nature of the container. - Mod.CP]
