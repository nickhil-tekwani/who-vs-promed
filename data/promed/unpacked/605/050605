Current Situation of Jungle Yellow Fever (JYF) in the Americas
---------------------------------------------------
Up to Wed 23 Jun 2004, the Ministries of Health of Colombia, Peru, Brazil
and Bolivia reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) the
occurrence of 86 confirmed cases of Jungle Yellow Fever (JYF), with 41
deaths. In all the countries, cases occurred predominantly among males over
the age of 15 who work in the countryside. The case distribution by
Epidemiological Week (EW) and by country is shown in a figure available at
the following web site:
<http://www.paho.org/English/AD/DPC/CD/eid-eer-24-jun-2004.htm#jyf>).
Peru
----
Peru has reported 52 cases, with a case-fatality rate of 52 percent. These
cases were identified in the districts of Echerate (1 case), in the
Department of Cuzco; Cholon (1), Daniel Alomia Robles (1), Huanuco (1) and
Jose Crespo y Castillo (5) in the Department of Huanuco; Junin, (1), Perene
(4) and Pichanaqui (17), in the Department of Junin; Ramon Castilla (1) in
the Department of Loreto; Huepetuhe (5), Laberinto (1) and Manu (1) in the
Department of Madre de Dios; Campanilla (7), La Banda de Shiclayo (1),
Moyobamba (3), and Nueva Cajamarca (2), in the Department of San Martin.
Another 31 suspected cases are undergoing epidemiological and laboratory
investigation.
Bolivia
-------
The 9 cases reported by Bolivia occurred in the municipalities of Palo Alto
(2 cases) in the Department of La Paz; and in San Ignacio de Velasco (6)
and Yapacani (1), in the Department of Santa Cruz. The fatality rate is 40
percent. Another 3 suspected cases coming from the Departments of La Paz
and Cochabamba are pending laboratory confirmation.
Brazil
------
The probable sites of infection of the 3 cases reported by Brazil are the
municipalities of Parauapebas (2 cases) in Para state and Iranduba (1) in
Amazonas state. The cases from Brazil correspond to Epidemiological Weeks
(EW) 11 and 12, which ended respectively on 20 and 27 Mar 2004.
Colombia
--------
Columbia has reported 22 cases, with a case-fatality rate of 36 percent.
These cases are a continuation of the extensive outbreak that began in 2003
in the Department of Norte de Santander, which later extended north to the
Departments of Cesar, la Guajira, Magdalena, and then south to the
Department of Meta. The last confirmed case showed initial symptoms
appearing during EW 8, which ended on 28 Feb 2004.
Recommendations
---------------
Considering the extensive infestation by _Aedes aegypti_ in all the
countries of the Region, with the exception of the continental part of
Chile, the occurrence of outbreaks increases the risk of the
re-urbanization of yellow fever. The PAHO Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on
Vaccinations has systematically recommended that the countries vaccinate
all persons residing in enzootic areas in the Americas for yellow fever, as
well as all travelers to those areas, and introduce routine vaccination for
children against the disease. Also highly recommended is putting into place
control measures against _A. aegypti_ in accordance with PAHO
recommendations for the control of this vector.
Evidence of the spread of yellow fever, through the confirmation of at
least one human case and of epizootics (dead monkeys), is sufficient
grounds for initiating outbreak-control measures in the affected
municipality and immediate vicinity. These measures include vaccinating all
residents who lack proof of previous inoculation against yellow fever,
vaccinating all those traveling to the area, actively searching for
suspected cases, putting into place surveillance of both febrile icteric
syndrome and epizootics, in addition to declaring epidemiological alerts.
If new cases are identified in other municipalities of the Region, the
vaccination ring should be expanded along with other control measures.
