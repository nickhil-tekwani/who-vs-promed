Boston Public Health officials are warning local residents after abnormal levels of toxic blue-green algae were found in the city's Charles River on Thursday [13 Aug 2015].

The blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, turn the water murky, give off a foul odor, and are harmful to humans and animals. In some rare cases, exposure to the toxins can cause death. The algae blooms were found in the Lower Charles River Basin, the Weld Boathouse in Cambridge, and the Charles River Dam. Tests on the river indicated bacteria levels were nearly twice the recommended limit, forcing officials to advise caution. 51 000 cells/mL of water is considered safe.

Warning signs have been posted along the river. Water ingestion can cause illness. Swimming in the water is not recommended. Posted advisory notices warn: "Do not swallow the water. Rinse off after contact."

Jamaica Pond in Jamaica Plain was recently closed down for nearly a month after an identical outbreak.

[This is an odd article in the sense that warnings are posted, tests are being performed, and a statement says that the level of the algae is twice the normal limit but still safe. So why the warning? Should there be just an advisory that conditions are correct for problematic levels of blue-green algae to form?

Blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, can be deadly to a number of animals and have been responsible for the death of livestock in other parts of the world. Cyanobacteria can be found in water, soil, on rocks, and even in symbiotic relationships with some lichens. They can be found as single cells, colonies, filaments, sheets, and sometimes as balls with a hollow center.

Cyanobacteria have several types of classification, but some produce cyanotoxins. Some of the toxins are known as anatoxin-a, anatoxin-as, aplysiatoxin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, microcystin LR, nodularin R (from _Nodularia_), and saxitoxin. These toxins are neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, cytotoxic, and endotoxic and are detrimental to a wide variety of animals and can also be dangerous to humans.

Additional information about cyanobacteria, especially at they relate to human health, can be found on the Health Canada website at http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/water-eau/cyanobacter-eng.php. - Mod.TG
