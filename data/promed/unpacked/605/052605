The death of a Ramsey County man prompted a public health warning in Minnesota aimed at men who have sex with men. State health officials are urging men who have sex with men (often shortened to MSM) to be vaccinated as soon as possible for meningococcal meningitis, after the Ramsey County resident became infected with and died from the disease.

In a news release, Minnesota Department of Health [MDH] officials say they are concerned about possible connections between the victim and an ongoing outbreak of disease, though no direct connection has yet been found.

The release says the man in his 40s, who is known to have had sex with men, died in the past week from the disease, which [is] caused by bacteria [_Neisseria meningitidis_] that progresses rapidly and can be fatal in about 10-15 percent of cases.

His condition was exacerbated by the fact that he was also HIV-positive, which placed him at greater risk of developing serious illness from meningococcal meningitis, according to the department.

"We believe that the MSM community in Minnesota may be at increased risk for meningococcal disease," Kristen Ehresmann, director of the infectious disease division at the MDH, said. "We want to try to head off the possibility of an outbreak occurring here, so we strongly encourage all MSM, especially those who are HIV-positive, to go get vaccinated."

Because the outbreak in Chicago [Illinois] has seen 7 people infected in the MSM community, of whom 1 has died, the MDH says those who are most at risk of infection are HIV-infected men who have sex with men. Also at high risk are men who regularly have close or intimate sexual contact with men met through websites, apps, or at bars or parties.

They are being advised to see their doctor or go to a vaccination clinic to get a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination, which covers the bacteria (serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_) currently causing the outbreak.

The disease is transmitted through close personal contact in small droplets of saliva or nasal secretions, with those who have it contracting it through kissing, drinking directly from the same container, sharing smoking materials or through other contact with nose or throat secretions.

According to WebMD, it is a "rare but serious infection" that causes the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed. It affects around 1000 people in the US every year and can be fatal or cause serious complications without quick treatment, with the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] saying around 15 percent of those who survive can be left with disabilities including deafness or brain damage.

The most common symptoms of the disease are sudden high fever, a severe and persistent headache, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting, a discomfort with bright light, drowsiness, joint pain, and confusion. WebMD said that a "reddish or purple" skin rash that doesn't turn white when a glass is pressed against it is another important sign to watch for, as the disease can cause blood poisoning.

[Minnesota, with a population of almost 5.5 million people, is a state in the Midwestern United States. Ramsey County, where the man who died of meningococcal meningitis resided, is located directly to the east of the city of Minneapolis. The seat of Ramsey County is the city of St. Paul, which is also Minnesota's state capital. Nearly 60 percent of state's residents live in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the "Twin Cities"); the rest of the state consists of farming country and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota). Minneapolis-Saint Paul is about 400 miles (650 km) to the northwest of Chicago by interstate highways.

The news report refers to an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis serogroup C outbreak in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Chicago, Illinois, area, which ProMED-mail reported last week (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (IL) fatal, MSM, vaccine, RFI 20150711.3502722) and which has now apparently extended to the nearby US state of Minnesota, although we are not told directly if serogroup C was responsible for the Ramsey County resident's death.

The following was extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - France: (Paris) serogroup C, MSM, vaccination 20150124.3116307:

Outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) have occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium and France caused by a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with a certain genotype (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf). Similar outbreaks among MSM caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C have occurred in Canada and the US (see prior ProMED-mail posts).

Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/).

However, less virulent strains have been reported to cause IMD in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis. 2011; 15(2): 178-80; available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).

Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing bacterial meningitis (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285).

Mass vaccination campaigns have been used to control outbreaks of IMD in MSM ("See Also" below). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccines to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep. 1997; 46(RR-5): 13-21; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). - Mod.ML
