----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is still no consensus on the true origin of fatal yellowing [FY], one of the most important diseases affecting oil palms (_Elaeis guineensis_). This study involved 2-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2D-UPLC-MSE) analyses to identify changes in protein profiles of oil palms affected by FY disease.

Oil palm roots were sampled from 2 growing areas. Differential accumulation of proteins was assessed by comparing plants with and without symptoms and between plants at different stages of FY development. Most of the proteins identified with differential accumulation were those related to stress response and energy metabolism. The latter include enzymes related to alcohol fermentation, which were identified in plants with and without symptoms. Others were identified as potential marker proteins to guide selection of FY-tolerant genotypes or to understand the source of this anomaly.

When comparing different stages of FY, we observed high accumulation of abiotic stress related-proteins at all disease stages. On the other hand, biological stress-related proteins were more accumulated at later stages of the disease. These results suggest that changes in abiotic factors can trigger FY development, creating conditions for the establishment of opportunistic pathogens.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Oil palm fatal yellowing (FY) disease has been studied for many years, but its causal agent has never been determined. In Colombia and nearby countries, it was reported that the causal agent of FY (pudricion del cogollo [in Spanish]) is the oomycete _Phytophthora palmivora_, however, several authors claim that [they] are different diseases.

The major aims of this work were to test Brazilian oil palm trees for the co-occurrence of the oomycete _Phytophthora_ and FY symptoms, and to characterize the fungal diversity in FY diseased and healthy leaves by next generation sequencing. Investigation with specific primers for the genus _Phytophthora_ showed amplification in only one of the samples. Analysis of the fungal ITS region demonstrated that, at the genus level, different groups predominated in all symptomatic samples, while _Pyrenochaetopsis_ and unclassified fungi predominated in all asymptomatic samples.

Our results show that fungal communities were not the same between samples at the same stage of the disease or among all the symptomatic samples. This study describes the microbial community in the course of [FY] and evaluates the fungal community associated with leaves of oil palm trees with and without symptoms of FY.

[Fatal yellowing (also called spear rot) of oil palm is a type of bud rot disease. Bud rots are amongst the most serious diseases of palms. All palm species are considered susceptible to at least one of the bud rot diseases which include, for example, heart rot of coconut palm and black scorch of date palm (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). For coconut palm, several species of fungus-like organisms in the genus _Phytophthora_, as well as some fungi and bacteria are thought to be involved. Different pathogens may be prevalent in different areas. Secondary insect infestations and possibly also environmental factors may also contribute in some areas.

In South and Central America, tens of thousands of hectares of commercial oil palms are affected by bud rot types of disease for which the causes and modes of spread have not been clearly identified. Both a lethal form (or phase) and a milder version with high recovery rate have been reported, but it is not clear whether they are due to different causes. Resistance breeding with the commercially used African oil palm _E. guineensis_ and _E. oleifera_ native to South America has resulted in hybrids which seem to show some resistance to spear rot in the region.

Generally, to identify a biotic or abiotic cause for a disease or disorder of unknown aetiology, a defined process must be followed: description of specific symptoms in individual plants; patterns of their distribution in space and time; evidence for or against transmission of symptoms and spread of the condition; Koch's rules (that is, to re-isolate an infectious pathogen after culture and transmission, or equivalent process for non-culturable pathogens) to test for causation by a biotic agent; and molecular studies to identify a known or characterise a novel potential infectious agent. Especially in slow growing hosts, such as trees, this process may take many years and it would be complicated considerably if a previously unknown pathogen were to be involved.
