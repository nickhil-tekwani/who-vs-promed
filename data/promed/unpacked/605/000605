The following report has been assembled from various sources. While this
disease seemed to be disappearing, its death has certainly been exaggerated.
Obviously, the clinical recognition of cases is variable and submission of
the appropriate feline tissues to the Pathology Department, CVL, MAFF, for a
confirmatory diagnosis is another quasi-random factor. If the externalities
affecting the recognition and diagnosis of this condition are not
overwhelming, the annual incidence would appear to be decreasing. A
suggestion as to why the condition may have been prolonged may be regarded
as controversial by some.

>>I was just last Monday told by Dr.Zeidler from the WHO (while talking with
him at the Blood safety and screening conference in McLean VA.) that the
number of cats in the UK with FSE has stayed at a constant level yearly and
that this is a bit of a puzzle as to why that is. My suggestion was that
even though the cat food has been "cleaned up" and no longer contains
ruminant meat in the UK they probably are still being given "table scraps."
What cat lover does not share tasty morsels from their plate with their cats
at dinner-time? . I'm sure the cat fanciers in the UK dote on their cats no
less than I do. This in turn could be an ominous sign of what is still on
people's dinner plates in the UK.<<
a. UK-FSE has NOT stayed at a constant level, but has declined:
b. The decline is very slow, which is troubling. Also the ramp-up does not
follow the shape of the BSE epidemic. The number of BSE cases has dropped by
10x, but the FSE cases have only gone down by 2x.
c. Cats eat a considerable quantity of meat in their feed. It is doubtful
that this is very significantly augmented by "table scraps". In addition, if
it were, this would have been a clear epidemiological factor that would have
been identified easily in the cases found.
[If the USA is anything to go by, the present quality of wet and dry
commercial cat food is such as to not necessitate feeding them table scraps.
Part of their present much improved longevity these days - twenty years is
not unusual - is thanks to this food quality. In response to a query by
myself to Bob that the early literature had this condition disappearing if
not disappeared, he replied:
This is MAFF wishful thinking. In the Nov. 1996 report, p. 21, they state:
"Six cases of FSE have so far been recorded in 1996, one of which has
occurred in a cat born after the extension of the SBO ban in September 1990.
The cat was found as a stray aged approximately 6 months and consequently
details of the cat's early feeding history are not available."
This would create the impression that no further cases in cats would occur,
and this one was a fluke with poor provenance.
In the June 1997 MAFF report, p. 27, they state:
"The number of cases of feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) confirmed
each year in domestic cats continues to fall; there have been only two since
the last Progress Report."
This would imply a dramatic drop was occurring, but in the end there were 6
cases also in 1997, the same as in 1997. No more mention of the case
histories of the cats and their birth dates. I would interpret this as
negative information, since MAFF would have used it if it was positive.
I find it interesting that ANY cases are occurring.

[A suggestion as to the prolonged tail on this feline epidemic. - Mod.MHJ

Well, cats live for a couple of decades so one might have expected a long
tail, particularly if the infectivity is very dose dependent.
However I was under the impression (from the odd reports, particularly the
Dalgetty/Spillers debacle in Belgium) that those cat food manufacturers who
continued to use MBM after the initial FSE cases sourced their MBM from
exclusively EU produced (i.e. NOT UK) sources. The added cost is minute and
exactly the thing that a pet food manufacturer would do to protect his
market. As an owner of two fine cats I found this reassuring.
Now, however, I am not sure I would want to eat very much EU (i.e. not UK
produced) beef. Combined with the rather convincing evidence of considerable
EU BSE concealment it looks uncomfortably like more evidence, however
circumstantial and downright speculative.

[However the cooking procedures for processing MBM in Europe appear to be
more rigorous. And if their MBM were "infectious" for cats, a parallel
epidemiological situation would be expected in the European cattle fed this
MBM as calves. Given a choice in a situation of extreme ignorance, the
suggestion that the 'tail' is from prolonged incubation periods would seem
to have merit. - Mod.MHJ

The following slightly out-of-date account of FSE was taken from the
MAFF/UK website.
<http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse/index.html>
Feline Spongiform Encephalopathy
Feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) was first identified in Britain in
1990. Since then there have been 81 cases in Great Britain, one in Northern
Ireland, one in Norway and one in Liechtenstein. FSE is not an easy disease
to study. Although Britain has a large cat population they would not
normally have been subjected to close neurological examination in the past.
Nevertheless, sufficient numbers have been seen and investigated to permit
an association with BSE to be made. Obtaining lifetime feeding history for
cats is not easy, so although all have eaten foods that would be expected to
contain specified bovine offals, no particular type of food can be implicated.
Because of this the epidemic in cats is often thought to be a useful model
for past human exposure to BSE. It is currently in decline, and only one cat
has been confirmed that was born after September 1990 when the use of
specified bovine offals in pet food was prohibited.
Although MAFF has not historically had responsibility for investigating
disease in domestic animals, other than rabies, most of the information
gathered about FSE in domestic cats and zoo animals has been provided
through the good will of owners and veterinary practitioners. Laboratory
diagnosis of a spongiform encephalopathy in any species has however been
notifiable since November 1994, thus ensuring that cases were not missed.
Interestingly, brain tissue from some of the early cats identified with FSE
was inoculated into mice. The pattern of incubation periods and lesion
profiles in the mice was indistinguishable from BSE.
In exotic cats there have now been six cases in cheetahs (three were
diagnosed abroad but originated in Britain, three in pumas, one in a tiger
and one in an ocelot.
