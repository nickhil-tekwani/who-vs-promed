Five new cases of measles have been reported in Wales. The National
Public Health Service [NPHS] for Wales said there is one new case in
Carmarthenshire, one in Pembrokeshire, one in Neath Port Talbot, one
in Wrexham and one in Merthyr Tydfil. The new cases in Merthyr and
Wrexham are the 1st to be reported in these counties. 16 counties in
Wales are now affected.

The total number of cases of measles in Wales is now 286, 215 cases
of which are in Mid and West Wales, 57 in North Wales and 14 in South
East Wales. The worst affected county is Carmarthenshire, with 76
cases, while Swansea has 45, Neath Port Talbot 33, and Pembrokeshire
31. One further patient has been hospitalized in Wales. The total
number of patients hospitalized is now 34.

Dr Marion Lyons, head of the health protection teams for the NPHS,
said: "With the numbers of cases of measles in Wales continuing to
rise on a daily basis and the outbreak now having spread to 2 more
counties, we remain concerned for anyone who has not received 2 doses
of the MMR vaccine. The vaccine is safe, effective and the only
protection against measles. The vaccine also provides protection
against mumps, which is currently also on the increase in Wales.
Although most children will make a full recovery from measles or
mumps, both diseases have potentially serious consequences. Children
can be left permanently brain damaged or can even die of measles.
Complications of mumps include meningitis and deafness. People most
at risk of catching measles are children of school age who have not
had 2 doses of MMR or children between the ages of one and 3 who
missed their 1st MMR dose at 13 months. We estimate that there are
around 45 000 school age children at risk of measles in Wa!
les at present due to their MMR status, as checked at the beginning
of primary and secondary school and on leaving secondary school."
