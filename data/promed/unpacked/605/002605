Birds that were suspected of having contracted avian flu in Ethiopia have
tested negative for the virus, an agriculture official said on Tuesday [20
Dec 2005].
"The results from the bird flu tests we have carried out are negative,"
said Mulugeta Debalkew, spokesman for the agriculture ministry in Addis
Ababa. "However, we are still remaining vigilant because of the potential
threat, and the ban on imports of poultry will remain in place for the time
being," he said.
Scientists had flown in from Egypt to carry out the tests on more than a
dozen samples because Ethiopia does not have the proper equipment to check
for avian flu. The tests revealed that the birds had died from Newcastle
disease, which according to the United States Department of Agriculture is
one of the most infectious poultry diseases in the world.
Newcastle disease is so virulent that many birds die without showing any
clinical signs. A death rate of almost 100 percent can occur in
unvaccinated poultry flocks, and the disease is very common in Africa. It
does not pose an immediate danger to humans.
Tests were carried out on dead birds from different areas in the country,
including the capital, Afar in the Rift Valley, and Somali Region, where
several hundred dead birds were found in late November 2005. Fresh tests
were also carried out on sick birds for the virulent H5N1 strain of bird
flu, which has devastated Asia's poultry flocks and killed at least 62
people since 2003.
The dead birds -- all nonmigratory local pigeons -- were discovered around
drinking wells in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and at 2 separate
locations in Addis Ababa. Authorities in the Somali Region estimated that
around 500 dead birds were found at wells and water points in the Deger Bur
area. Some 10 to 15 birds were discovered at each site.
Experts believe that the Rift Valley countries of Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania are at high risk for avian flu outbreaks because millions of
migratory birds fly south to warmer climes during the European winter. A
government-led taskforce in Ethiopia estimated that some USD 53 million
would be needed to fight a possible pandemic of the H5N1 virus of avian flu
that affects humans.
Ethiopia's state news media announced on 1 Dec 2005 that the country was
extending a ban imposed in October 2005 on the import of all poultry
products. A bird flu national task force with technical committees was also
established. The UN has also set up its own crisis management team for
avian flu in Ethiopia and is in the process of completing a contingency
plan to deal with a potential outbreak.

[Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is easily confused with Velogenic
Newcastle disease, which is the most severe form of Newcastle disease,
because the disease signs and postmortem lesions are similar. Newcastle
disease is endemic in Ethiopia (for map, see
<http://www.alertnet.org/map/index.htm?ct=2&code=ET&pcode=>).
One of the consequences of the recent world scare of HPAI seems to be an
increased rate of reported NCD outbreaks. During 2005, notifications on NCD
outbreaks have been sent to the OIE from Botswana, Bulgaria, Cyprus,
Denmark, Finland, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, France, Greece,
Israel, Japan, Romania, Slovakia, Turkey and UK. Similarly to HPAI, NCD can
be spread by wild, free-roaming birds.
