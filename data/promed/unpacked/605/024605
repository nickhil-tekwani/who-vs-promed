The Minnesota Departments of Health and Agriculture are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration on a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis linked to eating caramel apples.

Four people in Minnesota have become ill as part of this outbreak. All were adults, ages 59 to 90 years. They became ill in late October and November [2014]. All were hospitalized and 2 died.

Health officials are warning consumers who may have purchased any pre-packaged, commercially-produced caramel apples, including caramel apples with other toppings such as nuts, chocolate, and sprinkles, to not eat them until more information from the investigation becomes available.

Minnesota cases purchased caramel apples from Cub Foods, Kwik Trip, and Mike's Discount Foods, which carried Carnival brand and Kitchen Cravings brand caramel apples. These 2 brands are no longer available for purchase at retail locations; however, health officials are concerned that persons who purchased them may still have them in their homes. The investigation is evolving, and other caramel apple brands and locations may also be impacted. Minnesota officials are working with national partners to determine the scope of products impacted. Consumers should not eat any brands of commercially-produced pre-packaged caramel apples until additional information is available. At this time, no illnesses related to this outbreak have been linked to apples that are not caramel-coated and not pre-packaged.

Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. The disease affects primarily older adults, pregnant women, newborns, and persons with weakened immune systems. On average, 7 cases of listeriosis are reported in Minnesota each year. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. Infected pregnant women may experience only a mild, flu-like illness; however, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, premature delivery, or infection of the newborn. Symptoms begin from 3 to 70 days after consuming the bacteria.

Anyone who believes they may have become ill with listeriosis should contact their health care provider.

Five people have died and 21 others have been hospitalized in a [listeriosis] outbreak linked to caramel apples, federal health officials said today [19 Dec 2014].

A total of 28 people infected with _Listeria_ have been reported from 10 states, according to a statement from the US Centers for Disease Control. 11 of the cases are in the Midwest: 5 in Missouri, 4 in Minnesota and 2 in Wisconsin.

[A map of the USA showing states with cases of listeriosis linked to caramel apples is available at the source URL.]

The CDC warned consumers not to eat any pre-packaged, commercially-produced caramel apples, including those with other toppings such as nuts, chocolate or sprinkles, until more information is available. A recall, however, has not been issued as of Friday afternoon [19 Dec 2014].

Of the 28 victims, 26 were hospitalized and 5 of those people died, the CDC said, adding that listeriosis contributed to at least 4 of the deaths. 9 of the cases involved a pregnant woman or her newborn infant and 3 were among otherwise healthy children aged 5 to 15 years, the CDC said. According to the studies, 83 percent of the ill people interviewed reported eating commercially produced prepackaged caramel apples.

Those affected became ill between [17 Oct and 27 Nov 2014], the CDC said, adding that cases after [3 Dec 2014] might not yet be reported.

Listeriosis is an infection that primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune symptoms. Symptoms, which begin anywhere from 3 to 70 days after consuming the bacteria, include fever, muscle aches, headache, confusion and convulsions.

No illnesses related to the outbreak have been linked to apples that are not caramel-coated and are not prepackaged, or to caramel candy, the CDC said.

The states include Missouri and New Mexico, which each had 5 cases; Minnesota, Texas and Arizona, with 4 cases each; Wisconsin, with 2 cases; and Washington, California, Utah and North Carolina, with 1 case each.

In Minnesota, those who fell ill bought caramel apples from Supervalu Inc's Cub Foods, Kwik Trip and Mike's Discount Foods, which carried Carnival brand and Kitchen Cravings brand apples, state health officials said. These 2 brands are no longer being sold there, but health officials are concerned that people who bought them may still have them in their homes.

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections (listeriosis) linked to commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples. _Listeria_ can cause a serious, life-threatening illness.

The information CDC has at this time indicates that commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples may be contaminated with _Listeria_ and may be causing this outbreak.

Out of an abundance of caution, CDC recommends that US consumers do not eat any commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples, including plain caramel apples as well as those containing nuts, sprinkles, chocolate, or other toppings, until more specific guidance can be provided. Although caramel apples are often a fall seasonal product, contaminated commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples may still be for sale at grocery stores and other retailers nationwide or may be in consumers' homes.

As of [18 Dec 2014], a total of 28 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 10 states. 26 ill people have been hospitalized. Among the 26 people hospitalized, 5 deaths have been reported. Listeriosis contributed to at least 4 of these deaths. 9 illnesses were pregnancy-related (occurred in a pregnant woman or her newborn infant). 3 invasive illnesses (meningitis) were among otherwise healthy children aged 5-15 years.

[No miscarriages or fetal losses have been reported. Among people whose illnesses were not associated with a pregnancy, ages ranged from 7 to 92 years, with a median age of 64 years, and 32 percent were female.]

To date, 15 (83 percent) of the 18 ill people interviewed reported eating commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples before becoming ill. At this time, no illnesses related to this outbreak have been linked to apples that are not caramel-coated and not prepackaged or to caramel candy. Investigators are working quickly to determine specific brands or types of commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples that may be linked to illnesses and to identify the source of contamination.

This investigation is rapidly evolving, and new information will be provided as it becomes available.

DNA "fingerprinting" is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill persons using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. Two outbreak clusters were identified by the PFGE technique, and _Listeria_ isolates within each cluster were found to be highly related by the WGS technique but distinct between the 2 clusters. CDC is investigating the 2 clusters together because one person was infected with both _Listeria_ strains simultaneously and also because illnesses in the 2 clusters have occurred during a similar time period and in similar regions of the country.

[An Epi Curve (a chart showing the number of persons who were diagnosed each week) of the multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples is available at http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/caramel-apples-12-14/epi.html.]

[The US CDC has reported that to date a total of 28 people have developed listeriosis linked to eating commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples, including those with other toppings such as nuts, chocolate or sprinkles (15 [83 percent] of the 18 ill people interviewed reported eating caramel apples before becoming ill). Genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (EFGE) of clinical isolates identified 2 outbreak clusters, and _Listeria_ isolates within each cluster were found to be highly related by the whole genome sequencing technique. CDC considers the 2 clusters epidemiologically related because one person was infected with both _Listeria_ strains simultaneously and because illnesses in the 2 clusters have occurred during same time period and in similar regions of the country.

The outbreak so far has been reported from 10 states. 5 deaths have been reported and 9 illnesses were pregnancy-related. 3 invasive illnesses (meningitis) were among otherwise healthy children aged 5-15 years.

Minnesota cases purchased 2 brands of caramel apples (Carnival brand and Kitchen Cravings brand), which are no longer available for purchase; however, health officials are concerned that persons who purchased them may still have them in their homes -- they could have a shelf life of more than one month, or perhaps other brands are involved. CDC advises that US consumers not eat any commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples, including plain caramel apples as well as those containing nuts, sprinkles, chocolate, or other toppings, until more information becomes available.
