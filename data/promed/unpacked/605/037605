[1] Fungus responsible for Africa's deadly maize identified

It's now clear that a poisonous strain of the fungus _Aspergillus
flavus_, known as the "S" strain, is to blame for causing 125
food-related deaths in Kenya in 2004, according to research by an
Agricultural Research Service (ARS) plant pathologist and his
colleagues. The fungus, which produces invisible toxins that are
known to be carcinogenic, had contaminated portions of the country's
maize crop. This is the 3rd time since 1981 that the so-called
"Kenyan death fungus" has tainted the African nation's primary food
staple with deadly levels of poisons.
Peter Cotty, an ARS scientist based in the Department of Plant
Sciences at the University of Arizona in Tucson, and Claudia Probst,
of the University of Arizona, worked with Henry Njapau of the Food
and Drug Administration in College Park, MD, to investigate which
Aspergillus strain was the culprit. Cotty is administratively part of
the ARS Southern Regional Research Center in New Orleans, LA.
The scientists' findings, reported in the current issue of _Applied
and Environmental Microbiology_, will be critical to researchers who
are trying to devise methods for preventing future cases of fungal
poisoning, or aflatoxicosis, in African maize. Aflatoxins are natural
poisons produced by certain fungi that belong to the genus
Aspergillus. Health consequences related to consuming
aflatoxin-contaminated foods include impaired growth, cancer and death.
These toxins can contaminate an array of crops including corn,
cottonseed, peanuts and tree nuts. To ensure public safety, many
countries, including the United States, have established maximum
allowable levels for aflatoxin in farm products. Unfortunately, these
standards do little to reduce the ingestion of locally grown,
fungus-infested crops in small rural communities in Africa.
Through a special permit, the researchers were able to obtain samples
of contaminated maize from affected Kenyan villages. After grinding
the corn, they isolated the fungi and grew them in culture.
Surprisingly, they found the "S" strain of _A. flavus_, a potent
aflatoxin producer not previously known in Africa, to be the most
prevalent source of toxins in the maize.

[2] Biological control of aflatoxin contamination in maize in Africa
Date: October 2005

Research for Development, Stuttgart-Hohenheim Oct 2005

Aflatoxin contamination of maize, the major cereal in African diets,
is a major risk for health and well being of African people,
primarily children. Aflatoxin-producing fungi _Aspergillus flavus_
and _A. parasiticus_ can infect grains from pre-harvest stages in the
field through to post-harvest stages in the stores. Based on past
work by IITA [International Institute of Tropical Agriculture] and
our collaborators, several pre- and post-harvest strategies are being
tested to reduce risk of aflatoxin contamination. One of the
management strategies being developed is biological control using the
competitive exclusion mechanism, which has been successfully
implemented on cottonseed in Arizona. Natural population of _A.
flavus_ consists of toxigenic strains that produce copious amount of
aflatoxin and atoxigenic strains that lack the capacity to produce
aflatoxin. In the competitive exclusion mechanism, introduced
atoxigenic strains out compete and exclude toxigenic strains from
colonizing grains thereby reducing aflatoxin production in
contaminated grains. We have collected more than 4200 isolates of _A.
flavus_ from different agroecozones in Nigeria to identify atoxigenic
strains. Until now, we have identified about 50 candidate atoxigenic
strains out of 1500 strains screened so far. Tests under field
conditions have been conducted on 24 of these atoxigenic isolates in
Ibadan, Nigeria, to identify a few effective strains that can exclude
toxigenic strains. These atoxigenic strains are being evaluated for a
set of selection criteria to further narrow down the numbers to a few
for further use in biocontrol field experiments.
One of the important selection criteria will ensure that the
candidate atoxigenic strains belong to unique vegetative
compatibility groups (for which testers have been developed) that are
unable to produce toxigenic progenies in the natural environment.
Propensity to multiply, colonize and survive are other selection
criteria to make sure that few reapplications will be required once
the atoxigenic strains are introduced in the environment.
Environmental safety of most promising atoxigenics would be also
evaluated. Research to develop atoxigenic strains is resource
intensive and will further require downstream development activities.
Nevertheless, biological control holds promise of offering a
long-term solution for reducing aflatoxin contamination in maize.

[The major aflatoxins of concern are designated B1, B2, G1, and G2.
These toxins are usually found together in various foods and feeds in
various proportions; however, aflatoxin B1 is usually predominant and
is the most toxic. Aflatoxin M is a major metabolic product of
aflatoxin B1 in animals and is usually excreted in the milk and urine
of dairy cattle and other mammalian species that have consumed
aflatoxin-contaminated food or feed.
The toxicity can be influenced by environmental factors, exposure
level, and duration of exposure, age, health, and nutritional status
of diet. Aflatoxin B1 is a very potent carcinogen in many species,
including nonhuman primates, birds, fish, and rodents. In each
species, the liver is the primary target organ of acute injury.
Metabolism plays a major role in determining the toxicity of aflatoxin B1.
Animal species respond differently in their susceptibility to the
chronic and acute toxicity of aflatoxins. Trout are often regarded as
the most sensitive. Clinical signs in animals, other than aquatic
animals, range from lethargy, anorexia, jaundice, and death. Removal
of the affected foodstuffs usually results in a return to normal as
aflatoxin is excreted fairly rapidly from the body. Of course, the
length of time to normalcy depends upon the severity of the affect,
the dose ingested and the length of time the ingestion continued.
Although aflatoxin has been designated as a carcinogenic compound,
cancer from aflatoxin is not seen in domestic animals because the
life span is too short.

[Thank you also to Prof A. Dodds who alerted us to the same finding.
_Aspergillus_ spp. are cosmopolitan, ubiquitous pathogens of plants,
animals and humans of great economic importance. _A. flavus_ is
mainly a saprophyte degrading dead tissue of any origin, and it is
therefore important in nutrient recycling. However, it can also be
pathogenic on some plant species affecting for example injured seeds
of maize. Spores can be dispersed in soil, by air or carried by insects.
