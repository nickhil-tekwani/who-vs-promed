Reported cholera cases within the Greater Accra Region have hit a whopping 7800 cases, up from 6179 within a week.

The director of Ghana Health Services (GHS), Greater Accra Region, Dr Linda Van-Otoo, disclosed this yesterday, 30 Aug 2014, in Accra at the launch of a nationwide free waste bin distribution project by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, Ministry of Health, the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA), and Nawabin, a waste management company. The 1st phase of the project would witness the distribution of one million bins within the Greater Accra Region and would be extended to other parts of the country.

According to her, the cases continue to increase exponentially with more than 51 deaths recorded so far. She stated that most of the cases were emanating from Accra and the submetros. "Our hospitals are choked with patients and in some instances some patients are being thrown out, Dr Van-Otoo indicated. "Some of them die before reaching the hospitals due to delay at home," she added, without stating categorically to what extent that the death toll, which stood at 51 as of last Fri 29 Aug 2014, had increased.

The current epidemic is similar to the one that struck the country in 2011 were over 9000 cases were recorded with 72 deaths.

A cholera outbreak has hit Cape Coast and its environs with 14 out of the 24 cases recorded between Tuesday and Friday, 26-29 Aug 2014, at the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital (CCTH), testing positive. However, one person was brought in dead and had been released to the family for burial.

When the Ghana News Agency (GNA) visited the facility at about 17:00 hours on Fri 29 Aug 2014, other cases were awaiting confirmation. Isolated tents had been mounted with medical personnel wearing protected gear to manage the disease, which broke out in Accra and other parts of the country about 4 months ago and had reached an alarming rate.

Mrs Philomena Afful Mensah, the disease control officer at CCTH, told GNA that the majority of patients who came to the facility were males, with the oldest being 68 and the youngest 7 years. She said many of the cases including the dead person were brought in from Kotokuraba, the business centre of the metropolis, and other suburbs of Cape Coast.

She indicated that patients from surrounding towns such as Ankaful, Moree, Ekon, and Elmina, were also being rushed there, since according to them, the other hospitals had told them they did not have adequate accommodation to handle their condition. She said 10 patients had so far been treated and discharged while samples of other patients had been taken to the laboratory to be tested.
