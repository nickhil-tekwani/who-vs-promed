An outbreak of salmonella infections apparently linked to eating pork has expanded in Washington State, with at least 90 people in 9 counties reported to have been ill. More than half the cases, 55, were reported in King County. Six people have been hospitalized.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) late Friday [31 Jul 2015] issued a public-health alert because of concerns that the Washington salmonella infections might be tied to whole pigs used in pig roasts.

The sharp uptick in cases in less than a week and the lack of a clear source has led state health officials to ask the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to send in a special team to help with the investigation. The so-called Epi-Aid group is expected to be in Washington next week, a state Department of Health spokesman said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is also involved in the probe.

Investigators say many of the cases appear to be linked to eating pork, or to exposure to raw pork, particularly roasted pigs cooked and served at private events.

The cases appear to have been caused by the same rare strain of salmonella bacteria, health officials said. The outbreak is linked to Salmonella I, 4, 5, 12:i:-, a germ that has been emerging nationally but has never before been seen in Washington state.

The USDA said illnesses connected with the outbreak have been reported with onset dates between 25 Apr and 21 Jul 2015.

"Roasting a pig is a complex undertaking with numerous potential food handling issues," FSIS officials said in a statement. Health officials urged consumers to follow proper handling, cooking and storage practices. They said consumers should make sure to wash hands in hot, soapy water and to prevent cross-contamination from utensils and cutting boards used to prepare raw meat. Pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 F [63 C].

In addition, people should take precautions when handling live pigs or other livestock, which can also result in salmonella infections. To avoid illness, be sure to wash hands thoroughly after any animal contact.

Salmonella infections cause symptoms that include fever, diarrhea, chills, vomiting and abdominal cramps. Although most people recover quickly, the infections can be dangerous or even deadly for children, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems.

In addition to King County, the outbreak includes cases in Snohomish, Kitsap, Mason, Thurston, Pierce, Grays Harbor, Yakima and Clark counties.

[The number of reported cases has increased substantially.

As reported by the Seattle Times (http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/salmonella-tied-to-pork-sickens-56-in-eight-counties/), the outbreak strain is Salmonella I, 4, 5, 12:i: -, a designation discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric Bacteriology Section at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control) http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf.

_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the Group B antigens). Paccagnella pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i: 1,2, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to another; as an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. - Mod.LL
