A game ranch about 30 kilometres from Swan River is under quarantine
by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, after elk in a Saskatchewan
ranch tested positive for chronic wasting disease.

"There's been no confirmed case (in Manitoba)," said Wayne Lees,
chief veterinary officer for the province, on Wednesday [10 Jan 2007].

Lees could not comment on the exact location of the Manitoban game
ranch under quarantine.

The neurological disease is transmissible among deer and elk, and can
cause small lesions in brains of infected animals. For infected
creatures, the disease can lead to loss of bodily functions, abnormal
behavior and death.

"As part of any of these normal investigations, (inspectors) follow
animals that travel in and out of the (elk) herd, and that's where
the Manitoba connection comes in," said Lees. "The investigation
might take a number of weeks."

Lees said if any animals are found to have moved from the
Saskatchewan ranch where animals tested positive for CWD, officials
must conduct a 'trace-out' to ascertain the health of animals which
may have come in contact with them.

Chronic wasting disease can be slow to develop, said Lees, and can
take years for animals to show signs of illness.

"Animals that have been bought or sold from [the Saskatchewan]
farm...(inspectors) determine the identity of those animals, and
what's happened since," said Lees. "These investigations have to go
back a number of years...and that's the reason these tracebacks can
take some time. Several years of animal movements have to be checked out."
