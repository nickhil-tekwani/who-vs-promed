DENGUE, VECTOR SPECIES: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

I would again like to raise the issue of WHICH species of mosquito(es) are
people talking about when they refer to "the mosquito(es)...." With dengue
reports it is presumed that they mean _Aedes aegypti_. Given the
widespread, and increasing presence of _Aedes albopictus_ and its potential
to transmit dengue it would be most informative if contributors would
include a brief statement regarding vector presence. No one is going to
suggest that _Ae. albopictus_ is superior to _Ae. aegypti_ as a dengue
virus vector; however, areas with many dengue cases and both species
present would serve as sites to continue evaluation of [of the involvement
of] _Ae. albopictus_. Given its numerical increase [of _Ae. albopictus_]
in many areas of southeastern US, even being named THE primary pest
mosquito, is reason enough to be concerned about each _albopictus_
population's vector competence for dengue viruses. Even if its rate of
oral transmission were half that of _Ae. aegypti_ (it rarely is in
laboratory trials) by sheer numbers _Ae. albopictus_ might be more
important in certain circumstances.

[Thanks to Paul for emphasizing the need for specifics with regard to
species involved in arbovirus transmission, in this example _Aedes aegypti_
vs. _Ae. albopictus_. The same can be said for any report mentioning an
arthropod or vertebrate species. We trust readers will make a greater
effort to provide such information in the future, for obvious and necessary
reasons. - Mod.CHC]
