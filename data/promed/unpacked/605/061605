In a recent commentary in ProMED on the current situation regarding
West Nile virus [WNV] in Greece (ENCEPHALITIS - GREECE (10): (CENTRAL
MACEDONIA) WEST NILE VIRUS, COMMENT [ProMED-mail archive no.
20100824.2972], where some aspects of wild bird mortality in European
WNV outbreaks are discussed, the moderator wonders whether there are
differences in virulence between European and American strains of
WNV, and about the susceptibility of local birds to West Nile virus
disease. We have been investigating these issues recently, and the
results obtained could be of interest for this discussion.

As a 1st approach, we used a mouse model to compare the virulence of
4 WNV strains, 2 of them corresponding to recent Western
Mediterranean isolates (Morocco'03 and Spain'07), one from North
America (NY'99) and the type virus (Uganda'37). In this model, NY'99
and Morocco'03 showed similarly high virulence, while a significantly
lower virulence was obtained for Spain'07, and even lower for Uganda'37 (1).

Later, we used a wild bird model to study whether the differences
observed in virulence in the mouse model for the Mediterranean
strains were also extensible to birds. We inoculated red-legged
partridges (_Alectoris rufa_, a wild bird species abundant in
Southern Europe) with Morocco'03 and Spain'07 strains, and observed
that 1) both strains were pathogenic in this European wild bird
species; 2) Morocco'03 was more virulent than Spain'07, a finding
consistent with what we previously observed in mice; 3) viremia
observed upon inoculation with any of these 2 strains was high enough
to transmit the infection to a feeding mosquito, or in other words,
red-legged partridges could represent an amplifying host for this virus (2).

These studies are currently being extended to other European wild
bird species, and also to other WNV strains, but to date, what we can
conclude with the above results is 1) at least some European wild
bird species are susceptible to WNV disease in experimental
conditions; 2) despite the close similarity of the Western
Mediterranean WNV strains used, significant differences in virulence
are found between them; and 3) some Western Mediterranean strains
appear to be as virulent as the highly virulent American strain,
while others are not.

In the context of the striking differences observed between Europe
and North America with regard to bird mortality due to WNV, many
hypotheses have been raised. In the ProMED comment above cited, host
resistance in areas of long term circulation of the virus is
presented as a likely explanation for this observation. But it does
not fit with the above results: in an area such as the Western
Mediterranean, where WNV has been found since the 1960s and has been
circulating continuously for at least 14 years (1), at least one wild
bird species, abundant and autochthonous to this area, is not
resistant. Moreover, wild bird mortality has been found in a number
of outbreaks in Europe, not only in Hungary and Austria (cited in the
comment), but also in Spain (3), France (4) and Israel (5). So wild
bird mortality in Europe and the Mediterranean should not be
considered an "exception" but rather, its apparent absence seems to
be a consequence of the difficulties to detect birds dying from WNV.

Although host resistance could possibly play a role in some
susceptible species, it should not be considered as the sole
explanation to the observed differences of WNV virulence between the
Old and New World. In a disease with such a complex, essentially
multifactorial, eco-epidemiology, it is more wise to think of a
number of different factors as contributing to the appearance of
clinical cases in a given area. Not only host resistance, but
virulence of the strains circulating in each area, co-circulation of
variants with different virulence (as it appears to be the case in
Europe), and local host heterogeneity or vector competence can also
contribute in different instances to different extents to the outcome
of disease outbreaks. The study of virus-host interactions using
local viral variants as well as autochthonous wild bird species and
vectors would contribute much to the understanding of this eco-epidemiology.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Jimenez for providing a summary of his
experimental data and his interpretation and discussion of his
results. Indeed, as Dr. Jimenez points out, WNV circulation and
maintenance in a given geographic area is complex and
multi-factorial. To sustain virus transmission, the hosts must
develop a viremia of long enough duration and high enough magnitude
to infect competent vectors. Populations of susceptible hosts and
vector mosquitoes must be abundant enough for on-going transmission
to occur. Field studies that implicate which vertebrate hosts and
mosquito species are associated with an outbreak must be followed by
laboratory experiments that establish host capacity and vector
competence, accompanied by determination of viral virulence and
genetic composition and variability. The approach requires
integration of sound field ecology, laboratory experimentation and
molecular virology.
