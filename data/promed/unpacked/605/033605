Alberta: First Human Case (Imported) of West Nile Virus Infection
------------------------------------------------
Alberta Health and Wellness announced that a recent case of
encephalitis in Southern Alberta is the first human case of West Nile
virus in the province. It is likely that the individual became
infected while traveling this summer in Louisiana and Texas, two
areas that have experienced a high incidence of the disease. The
individual, a resident of Regional Health Authority #5, northeast of
Calgary, was admitted to hospital in August 2002 with symptoms
associated with viral meningitis, and has since been released.
Health officials emphasize that Albertans remain at low risk even
with this case of the disease in the province. "This is an isolated
case involving an individual who traveled in areas where the disease
is firmly established, and in all likelihood the disease was
contracted there," said Dr. Karen Grimsrud, Alberta's Deputy
Provincial Health Officer. "It is important to keep this disease in
perspective, even in areas where the virus is present, less than one
percent of mosquitoes will carry the disease, and less than one
percent of people bitten by an infected mosquito will develop serious
illness. It will be important to keep this in mind next year when
mosquitoes are active again."
Dr. Grimsrud encourages Albertans to be aware of West Nile Virus when
traveling or working in warm regions where the disease and mosquitoes
are still prevalent. Individuals should take some simple steps to
avoid mosquito bites, such as avoiding outdoor activities at dawn and
dusk when mosquitoes are most active, wearing long sleeves and pants
when outside, and using a mosquito repellent containing DEET.
Other than this imported case, there has been no evidence of the
disease in Alberta to date. Ontario and Quebec have both reported
human cases of West Nile Virus this summer. Manitoba, Nova Scotia,
and Saskatchewan have also confirmed evidence of disease but have
reported no human cases.
