Please find herewith [the latest report (still not official) received on
15 Jan 1999 from Bankey district (site of the epidemic):
"Reported cases: until today (15 Jan 1999) we had 391 reported cases in
Bankey district (not hospitalized, but found by the SHP and VDC).
Apparently there are also cases in Bardia district, [but those are not
included. The cases in Bardia District are all related to keseri daal
(_Lathyrus sativa_) [beans. The cases in Bankey did not always eat this.
Rather than paralysis, patients suffer from a weakness in the legs
(paraparesia). This [is consistent with the information received by Email
from other people. Some days ago a neurologist from the teaching hospital
visited the sites and she thought that the presented cases suffered from
lack of Vitamin B1. I really do not know on what basis she said that. It
seems strange as the Tharus [the affected tribe regularly [have a big
variety in their food (fish, meat, eggs, all types of vegetables). All
cases are older than 15 years. This probably contributed to her diagnosis.
I asked why the cases in Bankey came first to the [attention of the press.
This is due to the fact that the populations of Nepalgunj and Kohalpur have
more access to all types of communication. But still it is interesting
because when you talk to the Tharus they know the disease already for a
long time, but they never brought it [into the open. There are also old
cases, who [have suffered from it [for years.
Plan International is willing to support research in this field but do not
know how to find people and how to go about it. Of course some blood
testing should be included.

[So Dr Yap was right in his diagnosis of lathyrism (see thread (04)
referenced above). We continue to be grateful to Dr Luna, Annette & Erik
for keeping us up to date on this strange outbreak (or outbreaks) - Mod.JW
