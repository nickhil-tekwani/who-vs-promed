_Salmonella pullorum_ infection in the Vancouver Island chicken industry
has been eradicated, beating a deadline for implementing an export ban.
Almost 3,400 flocks accounting with more than 79,000 chickens were tested
on Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, with 28 flocks totalling 2,900
birds testing positive. The chickens were destroyed and the owners
compensated.
The industry had until today to rid free-range flocks of _Salmonella
pullorum_ bacteria or face a voluntary three-year ban.
"We got everything done before our time ran out," said Don Olson of the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency. "There's no impact on trade at all."
Olson couldn't say yet what the cost and compensation was for the
eradication project. The Island's poultry export industry is pegged at $11
million annually. _S. pullorum_ was reported a year ago in the
Duncan-Cowichan Valley area.
The disease is not harmful to humans but potentially fatal to young chicks.
The disease is usually transmitted to chicks and poults through the egg of
an infected hen and is spread in contaminated litter, feed or water. Chicks
hatched from infected eggs are often found dead or dying in the incubator.
