[In a 27 Apr 2006 posting -- BSE update 2006 (01) -- we included the
following information: "Media news about suspected first BSE cases in
Croatia and Estonia have been published by the media in February and April
2006, respectively. So far, these cases remain suspected, not confirmed."
In response, the following message has been received from the information
department of the OIE (Office International des Epizooties), for which we
are grateful. - Mod.AS]

Glad to inform you that for Croatia and Estonia, the diagnosis by
histopathology has not confirmed the disease.
We have official reports coming from the above-mentioned countries on this.
