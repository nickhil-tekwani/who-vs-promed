Following an increase in the number of reported human infections with _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Stanley in some European countries, ECDC issued a rapid risk assessment.

Up to 26 Jul 2012, 60 _Salmonella_ Stanley cases (32 from Hungary, 20 from Belgium, 8 from Germany) were reported from EU/EEA countries.

Although most _S._ Stanley cases are related to travel to Southeast Asia, the increase of infections reported in 3 EU countries in 2012 is not related to international travel. The occurrence of a single PFGE pattern of strains isolated from different countries suggests in fact a common source, which has not yet been identified; potential vehicles might be food, feed, or contact. Investigations are ongoing, and it is likely that more cases will be identified. However, the impact on public health across the EU is considered to be limited.

Member States are encouraged to perform PFGE testing on all recent isolates of _S._ Stanley to increase the possibility of identifying potential vehicles of infection. ECDC will continue to closely monitor this event and will update the risk assessment as soon as new relevant information becomes available.
