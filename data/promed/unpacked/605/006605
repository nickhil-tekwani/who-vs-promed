[According to the media on 16 May 2017: "The European Union will extend financial support for 2 pilot projects intended to eradicate African swine fever (ASF) in Ukraine and Moldova... The spread of the disease in Ukraine and Moldova poses a serious threat to the southern part of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. Also, the presence of the disease in the Russian Federation and Belarus represents a continuous source of infection for the already infected EU member countries. The EU said that countries from Finland to Romania need to give political priority to the threat posed by the disease."
