The nation's 1st known cases of antibiotic-resistant meningococcal
disease surfaced in northwest Minnesota and eastern North Dakota over
the past year [2007], according to the Minnesota Department of Health.
Health authorities on Friday [8 Feb 2008] asked doctors in the Fargo
[North Dakota]/Moorhead [Minnesota] area to stop using ciprofloxacin
for preventive treatment of people in close contact with
meningococcal patients and to use antibiotics outside the quinolone family.

The drug-resistant strains are the latest evidence of antibiotic
overuse, particularly in patients whose colds are viral and not
bacterial. "Even though there are other drugs that can be used to
prevent meningococcal disease, having one less weapon in our arsenal
reminds us of the importance of appropriate antibiotic use," said
Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist.

The 2 Minnesota cases turned up last month [January 2008], one
involving a 53-year-old from Marshall County [Minnesota] who died and
a 2nd involving a 22-year-old student at Minnesota State
University-Moorhead. The North Dakota case in January 2007 involved a
child at a Fargo daycare facility. The bacterial strains in all 3
cases are similar, but the patients had no known connections. Health
officials believe these strains are simply circulating in the region.
As many as 15 percent of people can have a meningococcal bacteria in
their throats or noses at any given time, but only a few suffer
severe infections.

Federal officials have been anticipating such a case. An official
from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
traveled to the region Thursday [7 Feb 2008] and was taking random
throat swabs in an attempt to find someone carrying the
drug-resistant bacteria.

Close friends of the patients have been treated as a precaution, so
the CDC official will go to college campuses, bars and other
high-traffic locations. The infected student took music lessons, so
other music students might be tested, said Richard Danila, assistant
state epidemiologist. Danila stressed that these 1st cases are
significant but shouldn't worry the general public or cause people to
demand preventive treatment.

That the strain in the 53-year-old who died was drug-resistant didn't
factor into the fatality, Danila said, as patients with the infection
aren't treated with ciprofloxacin. All 3 patients developed
meningitis, a swelling of the brain and spinal cord, and required
hospital care. Minnesota is one of a dozen or so states that test
meningococcal strains for antibiotic resistance. That partly explains
why the 1st case was discovered here.

[Vaccination for meningococcal meningitis is] recommended for the
11-18 age group and for college freshmen [age 18-20. - Mod.JW]. While
a vaccine protects against two-thirds of these bacterial infections,
it wouldn't have worked against this particular strain. The vaccine is
recommended for children ages 11 to 18 and college freshmen.
Meningitis cases are somewhat rare, with an average of 24 per year
since 2000 in Minnesota. A total of 22 deaths have been linked to the
bacterial infection from 2000 through 2006 in the state, 10 of them
involving people 23 or younger.

****The antibiotic-resistant cases reported Friday [8 Feb 2008] were
the 1st on
record in the USA.*****

[Invasive meningococcal disease (bacteremia and meningitis) is a
contagious bacterial infection caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_.
_N. meningitidis_ colonizes the nasopharynx, and is spread by
respiratory droplets. Household members and other close contacts who
may be exposed to the index case's respiratory excretions have the
highest documented risk of secondary disease during the 1st 7 days of
a case being detected. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for those in
close contact with a person with a meningococcal infection to prevent
secondary cases by eradicating _N. meningitidis_ from the
nasopharynx. Chemoprophylaxis is also used to cover the delay between
vaccination and the development of protective antibodies.

Chemprophylactic agents include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and
ceftriaxone. Emergence of rifampin-resistance has been reported
following chemoprophylactic use of rifampin (Fraser A, et al.
Antibiotics for preventing meningococcal infections. Cochrane
Database Syst Rev. 2006 Oct 18;(4):CD004785). These authors raised
concerns about the clonal spread of these resistant isolates;
however, rifampin-resistant isolates are rarely reported (Taha M-K,
et al. Rifampin-resistant Neisseria meningitidis. (LETTERS). Emerging
Infectious Diseases 2006; 12:859-60).

Fluoroquinolone-resistance is usually due to accumulation of point
mutations in the genes (e.g., gyrA and parC genes) encoding DNA
gyrase and topoisomerase IV, the targets for these antimicrobial
agents. There are 5 previous reports of sporadic instances of
decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin due to point mutations in
the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene:
1) Serogroup B isolate with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin
in the nasopharynx of a Parisian STD clinic patient in 1999 and 2) in
the CSF of a child in Spain in 2002 (Alcala B, et al. _Neisseria
meningitidis_ showing decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin: 1st
report in Spain. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2004;53:409); 3) Serogroup C
isolate in blood and CSF of a nursing student in Australia in 1998
(Shultz TR et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2000; 44:1116); 4)
Serogroup Y and B from 2 patients in Argentina in 2002 (Corso A, et
al. Emergence of _Neisseria meningitidis_ with decreased
susceptibility to ciprofloxacin in Argentina. J Antimicrob Chemother
2005;55:596-7); and 5) Serogroup A in 12 of 14 strains from a 2005
outbreak in Delhi, India
(<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/10/1614.htm>).

The above news release states that infection due to the strain
involved in the 3 U.S.A. cases could not be prevented by vaccination.
Because vaccines are available for serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135, we
can assume that the strain involved in these 3 cases was serogroup B
for which there is no an effective vaccine. The news release also
states that the 3 strains were "similar;" but does not say if this
was on the basis of DNA fingerprinting, which would be helpful to
identify an expansion of a single clone in the community.

The news release intimates that the strains were susceptible to drugs
used to treat meningococcal meningitis, which include the 3rd
generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime), penicillin,
and chloramphenicol. Relative resistance to penicillin has been
infrequently reported due to decreased affinity of target
penicillin-binding proteins for penicillin and less commonly to
beta-lactamase production. Rare isolates that are
chloramphenicol-resistance have been reported (N Engl J Med 1998;
339:368-74 & 917-8).

Horizontal exchange of genes that encode resistance for penicillin,
rifampin and the fluoroquionolones from other _Neisseria_ species
that share a common ecological niche with _N. meningitidis_ in the
nasopharynx has been proposed as one possible mechanism acquisition
of meningococcal antibiotic resistance
(<http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/49/3/545>).
