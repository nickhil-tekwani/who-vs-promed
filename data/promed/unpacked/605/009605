Bonamia ostrae outbreak in Menai Strait
---------------------------------------
The Fish Health Inspectorate at Cefas, acting on behalf of Welsh
Government, has issued a confirmed designation controlling the
movement of shellfish to, from, and within the Menai Strait.

The designation has been issued following the confirmation of the
notifiable disease _Bonamia ostreae_ in European flat/native oysters
(_Ostrea edulis_).

There are no implications for human health.

Samples of native oysters (_Ostrea edulis_) were collected by the Fish
Health Inspectorate as part of an ongoing routine screening programme
for the disease.

The samples were confirmed as positive for the presence of _Bonamia
ostreae_ through accredited diagnostic tests following EU prescribed
standards.
