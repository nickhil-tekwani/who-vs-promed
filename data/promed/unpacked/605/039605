Due to a statewide outbreak of hepatitis A, Pueblo County [Colorado] has seen more confirmed cases of the viral liver disease through the 1st 7 months of 2017 than it had in the previous 4 years combined. According to a 5 Jul 2017 report by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, [CDPHE] the state had already seen 43 confirmed cases thus far in 2017 -- a sharp increase from baseline rates that has now grown to 49 cases statewide. "There is an outbreak going on in the state of Colorado," said Kathy Nelson, Pueblo City-County Health Department program manager. "So far this year in 2017, we've had 7 confirmed cases of hepatitis A in Pueblo and normally we don't have that amount."

The 7 cases currently confirmed in Pueblo County marks the 3rd highest number of any county in the state trailing only El Paso County with 10 and Adams County with 9. The number marks a drastic increase in Pueblo County; the health department recorded only 1 case in 2013 and 2 cases in 2016, with no reported cases in either 2014 or 2015.

Hepatitis A is contracted when a person consumes infected fecal matter, often by ingesting food or drinks contaminated with stool from an infected person. When the hands of a person infected with hepatitis A are not properly washed after using the restroom, the disease can be transmitted to surfaces, food or drink, therefore, the consumption of food or drink that has come into contact with infected persons is a common way the disease is contracted.

Sexual contact is also a common source of infection, particularly among men who have sex with men. The CDPHE report detailed that at least 15 of the 43 cases reported as of 5 Jul 2017 were in the men who have sex with men [MSM] group -- a group for whom routine hepatitis A vaccinations are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. "There's certain groups that are more likely to get hepatitis A or are at a higher risk, and that is usually the men who have sex with men," Nelson said. "They are a higher risk group, but anybody can be susceptible because it can also be a food-borne disease so anybody could be at risk."

Other groups considered to be high-risk are people who have sexual contact with an infected person, people who use intravenous drugs and people with chronic liver disease.

[About 1/3 of the state's cases are in MSM, a clearly demonstrated high risk group, but the epidemiology of the other 2/3 of cases is not stated. It would be interesting to know if homeless individuals are a large part of the cohort as seems to be occurring in outbreaks of HAV in southern California and eastern Michigan. - Mod.LL
