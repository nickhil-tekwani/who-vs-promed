Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca urged citizens not to panic amid an increasing number of food poisoning cases due to spinach consumption.

The number of patients poisoned from spinach mixed with toxic herbs has risen to 196, Minister Fahrettin Koca said on [Tue 5 Nov 2019], adding there was no need for panic as none of the cases was life threatening.

Koca said all patients were located in Turkey's northwestern provinces, namely Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdag, and Kocaeli. The minister said only 21 patients remained hospitalized and that all instances were considered food poisoning cases.

"What we actually see is the patients come in with (complaints of) food poisoning but what they all have in common is they have all consumed spinach. The patients were admitted with symptoms of dry mouth, flushed skin, nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision -- common side effects of atropine overdose. The problem seems to be weeds growing around the same area mixing with the produce," Koca said. The minister urged citizens to carefully inspect any produce they buy and thoroughly wash them.

Murak Kapikiran, an official from the Istanbul Chamber of Agriculture Engineers, said a wild plant very similar in appearance to spinach might be the likely culprit. While officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on [Mon 4 Nov 2019] said weeds from the Solanaceae plant family were suspected to be the cause for the poisoning, Kapikiran said it was a wild plant called _Atropa belladonna_, also known as deadly nightshade, [which, with other members of the Solanaceae or nightshades family contains] the naturally occurring chemical atropine.

Kapikiran said both spinach and deadly nightshade grew around the same times and were visually similar, which could have easily fooled farmers, causing them to be mixed up.

"The other option is adulteration. Since they look very similar, nightshade might have been intentionally mixed to increase the harvest. And the amount needed to be consumed to show poisoning symptoms is somewhat substantial. We hope this is not the case," he said. Kapikiran urged more inspections for produce, adding that a potential mix-up could happen in the future again with other leafy greens.

A food technology expert urged citizens to wash their spinach with baking soda instead of vinegar, which is a common habit in Turkish kitchens. "Vinegar can make some pesticides and herbicides more potent. Therefore, it is important to use baking soda instead of vinegar. The consumer should first let spinach sit in water with baking soda and then rinse it," Sibel Bolek said.

_Atropa belladonna_ is a plant in the nightshade (Solanaceae) family which has the same clinical signs as those from _Datura_ spp or other members of the family. _A. belladonna_ has been called deadly nightshade in some regions of the world.

"Anticholinergic toxic syndrome (ATS) may not only occur due to a wide variety of drugs including tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, atropine, and scopolamine but may also occur due to the consumption of certain herbs as prepared by infusion or to the ingestion of their fruits (1). The fruits and the leaves of the plant contain high levels of alkaloids, namely atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine (2). If the plant is accidentally ingested or consumed for its hallucinogenic effects, the alkaloids in its structure competitively block the postganglionic parasympathetic muscarinic receptors and the muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system and cause ATS (3,4). Differential diagnosis is of importance especially in cases associated with fatigue and loss of consciousness in addition to psychotic findings. Therefore a thorough history should be obtained and a detailed physical examination should be performed."

"Poisoning with _A. belladonna_ may not only result from use for the hallucinogenic effects but may also occur through accidental ingestion (3). It is a common belief in some countries that using its leaves for tea is beneficial for stomach and bowel problems because of its antispasmodic properties. Moreover, people with asthma and bronchitis might smoke leaves from _A. belladonna_ for treatment purposes. (The practice of making a tea of the leaves of the _A. belladonna_ appears to be a common practice in Turkey.) Uncontrolled consumption of the leaves and fruits of this plant may cause anticholinergic syndrome (5,6). Clinical manifestations on the central and peripheral nervous systems are due to the effects of the alkaloids it contains (L-atropine, DL-hyoscyamine, and hyoscine) (7). Its central effects are dose-dependent and present as hallucination, loss of short-term memory, agitation, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular collapse, whereas the peripheral effects present as mydriasis, mucosal dryness, high fever, tachycardia, dry skin, ileus, and urinary retention. Consistent with the literature, delirium, and agitation stated by the patient's relatives, mydriasis, redness of the face and neck, dry oral mucosa, and urinary retention in the physical examination of the patient, supported both the central and peripheral symptoms of ATS."

Although I referenced _Datura_ spp in the previous post (20191107.6765583), which may not be as easily confused with spinach leaves, the clinical signs are the same. - Mod.TG
