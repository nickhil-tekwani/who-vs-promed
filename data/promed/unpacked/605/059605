[1] Israel (HaZafon): jackal, transboundary, spread
Date: Mon 5 Dec 2022

The Ministry of Health was notified of a rabies-infected jackal found at the beginning of this month [December 2022] in Kibbutz Reshafim in the Emek Ma'a'in regional council. The jackal bit an animal, but no people are known to have been directly exposed to it.

The Ministry asks anyone who was in contact or whose animals came in contact with the infected jackal or a stray animal in the area of the incident to urgently contact the health office of the Jezreel-Afula subdistrict or the health office closest to their place of residence in order to provide them with preventive care.

[According to a circular communicated by the State Veterinary Services on 5 Dec 2022, the above rabid jackal has become the 28th animal case since the start of 2022. The earlier cases included 17 jackals, 6 (unvaccinated) dogs, 3 cattle, and one cat.

Since September 2022, 9 new cases of lab-confirmed rabid jackals have been reported, doubling the number accumulated during 2022, becoming 18. Most of the new cases are clustered in the "Valley of Springs," adjacent to the border with north-west Jordan. The other cluster borders southern Lebanon. For the 2 clusters, see Israel's dynamic rabies map for 2022 at https://tinyurl.com/43ekktfj (jackals are indicated by aqua circles).

An explosive outbreak of rabies in jackals started in the Valley of Springs in August 2017, spreading westward and terminating in April 2018. Its spread, likely by infecting local jackals, was attributed to a decreased number of vaccine baits dispersed during a period preceding the event. Israel's wildlife rabies vaccination project via baits started around the century turn. The project's bait dispersal intensity has been updated since 2018.

During the past 15 years, jackals have gradually replaced foxes as the main sylvatic reservoir of the virus. Since the start of the current century, the number of rabid foxes, formerly being the main vector of rabies, gradually decreased; 2016 became the last year during which rabid foxes were lab confirmed (7 foxes, 4 jackals). Since 2017 not a single case of rabies in a fox has been reported. The decline in the fox population, observed in central and north Israel, might be due to competitive exclusion of foxes by jackals. This has been speculated (2006) by zoologists, based upon recorded behavioral interactions between foxes and jackals (doi: 10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.05.022; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222668326_Behavioural_responses_of_red_foxes_to_an_increase_in_the_presence_of_golden_jackals_A_field_experiment).

The 2 events in the Valley of Springs, the continuous incidence of rabies on the Lebanese and Syrian borders, and the spread of rabies westward in 2017/2018 illustrate the difficulties in maintaining full control of rabies by oral wildlife vaccination in a country that borders regions where such policy is not practiced. Increased surveillance, enhanced reporting, and cooperation on a regional basis are essential for all parties. - Mod.AS

A 5-year-old boy suffering from dog bite died after the doctors failed to administer rabies vaccination on time in Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka, police said on Wednesday [16 Nov 2022].

[SB], son of [F and F], belonged to Korataladinne village.

As the news spread, the public, including the boy's parents, staged a protest against the negligence of the doctors at Hosuru government hospital. They questioned why the boy was not administered the rabies vaccine while undergoing treatment for the dog bite.

On 30 Oct 2022, the boy was bitten by a dog while playing in the neighbourhood of his house. His parents rushed him to the nearby Hosur Government hospital where the doctor administered him an injection and sent them back.

But, as the boy did not recover, they took him to a private hospital in Gowribidanur town. As his condition was critical, he was referred to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Bengaluru.

The boy succumbed at Indira Gandhi Hospital. The blood tests had shown that his brain was affected by the poison [sic] due to dog bite.

When the parents came to Hosur Government Hospital for the death certificate of their child, they learned that the doctor had not mentioned about administering rabies vaccination to their kid while he treated him.

On being questioned, the doctor and staff gave vague answers.

The parents, relatives, and public had staged a protest in this connection and demanded action against the doctor.

[3] India (Maharashtra): data deficiency, obligatory reporting, control
Date: Wed 30 Nov 2022
Source: Times Now [abridged, edited]
https://www.timesnownews.com/health/rabies-now-a-notifiable-disease-in-maharashtra-hospitals-must-report-even-suspected-cases-to-health-department-article-95893350


Maharashtra state government has taken an important step in the direction of aiming for eradication of rabies by making it a notifiable disease from Tue 19 Nov 2022. From now, doctors and hospitals will have to notify the health department when a patient with suspected rabies is admitted.

"Prevention, control, and elimination of rabies from a geographical area can only be achieved through strong surveillance and disease reporting system," highlights the state notification.

Data shows India recorded over 1.5 crore [15 million] animal bite cases since 2019. The highest number of cases were recorded in Uttar Pradesh (2 752 218) followed by Tamil Nadu (2 070 921), Maharashtra (1 575 606), and West Bengal (1 209 232). On the other hand, Lakshadweep reported zero dog bite cases in the same period.

India also reports over 100 rabies cases and deaths every year. There is a lot of ambiguity about these figures due to likely underreporting. A report in The Times of India states that Rabies kills over 20 000 in India every year, with up to 60% of cases occurring in children under the age of 15. As per WHO estimates, around 200 rabies-related deaths happen in Maharashtra alone. WHO also states that only 1/10 of these cases is notified to health authorities.

In Mumbai, the number of dog bites have dropped from 85 438 in 2018 to 61 332 in 2021, and there have been no rabies deaths in the last 5 years.

For a human, rabies is almost always fatal if post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is not administered immediately after exposure.

Sadly, children sometimes fail to report a dog bite to adults in the house due to fear of reprisal or injections, or sometimes there is a delay in getting the child or any victim of a dog bite vaccinated. That is indeed sad as, otherwise, rabies is a vaccine-preventable disease in both humans and animals.

To achieve zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030, National Action Plan based on One Health approach has been launched in 2021 in the country.

WHO advisory states that dogs are the main source of human rabies deaths, contributing up to 99% of all rabies transmissions to humans.

Interrupting transmission is feasible through the vaccination of dogs and the prevention of dog bites.

The infection causes tens of thousands of deaths every year, mainly in Asia and Africa.

Immediate, thorough wound washing with soap and water after contact with a suspect rabid animal is crucial and can save lives.

[According to the above media report, likely based upon information provided by the Maharashtra authorities, the number of dog bites in Mumbai dropped nearly 30% between 2018 and 2021, and there have been no rabies deaths in the last 5 years. The rate of drop in number of dog bites is not necessarily identical to the rate of drop in the number of infections, while Maharashtra is not necessarily a representative state concerning rabies. However, the encouraging recorded decrease in the number of bites and the absence of reported cases are expected to indicate comparable dynamics in other parts of India.

A recent paper, presented and discussed in ProMED post 20221109.8706623, presented India's age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of human rabies during 2019 to be estimated as 5206.34 cases (95% CI = 2096.03-6826.33) annually. The posting's mod commentary included data from a previous, 2015 paper (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003709), according to which the estimated annual number of rabies cases (fatalities) in India during 2013 had been 20 847 [95% CI].

[4] Comment addressing Rabies (49): global, annual deaths, 1990-2019
Date: Thu 10 Nov 2022
From: Merritt Clifton <Animals24.7@frontier.com> [abridged, edited]


It is encouraging to see that the [paper addressed in the above post] has markedly lowered the often-claimed annual human death toll from rabies in India, used to project a global human rabies death toll of from 55 000 to 59 000, to 5206 as of 2019.

However, this remains a projection presuming that rabies deaths in India are underreported by magnitudes of order, absent any support in the form of an actual body count showing that any noteworthy number of human deaths from rabies are occurred but going unreported.

Since post-exposure rabies treatment is provided free of charge at government hospitals, which are reimbursed for their expenses by the central government, there is some evident financial incentive for possible over-reporting of rabies treatments and outcomes, but no evident financial incentive for under-reporting.

The actual annual rabies death totals reported by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence hospital surveys since 2005 throughout 2021 were, respectively, as follows: 274, 361, 221, 244, 260, 162, 233, 212, 132, 125, 113, 86, 97, 116, 105, 92, 55. Total: 2888 during the 17 years (https://www.cbhidghs.nic.in/index.php).

Since the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence data on every other health indicator that it tracks is usually taken at face value and cited as such, it is incumbent upon those who believe human rabies deaths are underreported by orders of magnitude to demonstrate this with actual body counts, not just recitations of what others previously claimed based on previous projections, many and perhaps all of which appear to derive from the 1911 hospital survey done by David Semple and William Harvey.

This appears to be the only actual body count produced by anyone prior to the Sudarshan study of 2003.

[Another comment, kindly received from Patricia Burke, DVM, included the following passage: "When I graduated from veterinary college in 1975, the estimated incidence was 35 000 - 50 000. Maybe once I read 75 000. Regardless, 35 000 - 75 000 while the world population, increased since from 4 billion to almost 8 billion. In China and India, high rabies-risk countries, the population went from 900 and 600 thousand to 1.4 billion each. I don't see how any figures presented now, even very well documented, can be compared to what was, obviously, numbers pulled out of thin air."

Without going further into the debated past figures, clearly India must base its current rabies control activities, undertaken within its National Action Plan launched in 2021, upon reliable, updated quantitative information of rabies incidence in humans and animals. Surveillance data -- underpinned by effective country reporting and surveillance systems -- is critical to evaluate progress of national rabies control and elimination campaigns to achieve the goal of the Global Strategic Plan: ending human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. Participating countries are required to present minimum indicators for human rabies and minimum indicators for animal rabies. - Mod.AS
