The Burkina Faso Ministry of Health released a public statement
reporting that the meningitis epidemic is currently spreading in the
country. The statement said that between 1 Jan-18 Apr 2010, national
health agencies have reported 5118 suspected cases of meningitis,
including 718 deaths.

According to the Ministry of Health statistics, during the same
period in 2009, there were 4000 suspected cases of meningitis,
including 600 deaths.

In February 2010 the government of Burkina Faso adopted a plan to
combat meningitis. The program aims to increase public awareness,
educate the population, carry out vaccination campaigns, and reduce
the mortality rate of meningitis.

Burkina Faso, Mali, Nigeria, Chad, and Ghana have been greatly
affected by meningitis. Several major outbreaks of meningitis have
occurred in Burkina Faso since 1996.

The main symptoms of meningitis are fever, severe headache, and stiff
neck; if not promptly treated, patients may lose consciousness or even die.

A new strain of meningitis, strain NMX, also known simply as strain
X, has broken out in Burkina Faso, where it caused just over half the
new cases reported in the past week [week ending 18 Apr 2010]. Of
Burkina Faso's 13 regions 6 are at epidemic level. Since the
beginning of 2010, 5118 cases of meningitis have been reported, and
718 people have died according to the health ministry. Health
Minister Seydou Bouda told reporters at a press conference on 22 Apr
[2010] that strain X was not "well-known in Burkina." Meningitis --
transmitted by nose and throat secretions -- usually spreads across
sub-Saharan West Africa in the dry months from December to June.

Ten cases of the strain have been reported in Niger according to Dr
Mamadou Djingarey, a World Health Organization (WHO) official in the
capital, Ouagadougou. Niger experienced an epidemic of strain X in
2006. Strain X is "no more worrying than other meningitis strains,"
the official told IRIN; strain A is the most lethal of the 12
meningitis strains, according to WHO.

Strain X has been reported in 14 of Burkina Faso's 65 districts.
Bouda said the symptoms of the new strain were the same as other
strains -- sudden fever, headache, and vomiting -- while children
less than one year old might experience swelling in their head
[bulging of the anterior frontanelle].

Across West Africa, some 14 700 meningitis cases and 1650 deaths were
reported between 1 Jan and 11 Apr 2010, according to the most recent
WHO statistics available. This is not as critical as the same period
in 2009, when 49 209 people were infected in an outbreak that killed
2767. Affected countries this year [2010] include Benin, Burkina
Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana,
Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Togo, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

[The emergence of a new strain (serogroup X) of meningococcal
meningitis in Burkina Faso this year [2010] has led to huge outbreaks
in the country, with 46 percent (6/13) of the regions in the country
being at epidemic level. The associated case fatality since the year
started is equally high, that is, 14 percent (781/5118), yet it
shouldn't exceed 10 percent for a well-managed epidemic. Serogroup X
is reported to have caused outbreaks in Niger in 2006 and has now
moved to Burkina Faso as indicated in the current report. Serogroup X
is one of those for which no vaccine exists, hence outbreak control
relies solely on enhanced surveillance for early case detection and
referral, appropriate case management using single dose oily
chloramphenicol, and social mobilization and health education. - Mod.JFW]

[The number of suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis in Burkina
Faso has quadrupled, as has the number of deaths since the last
report in Feb 2010 (see ProMED-mail post, Meningitis, meningococcal -
Africa: WHO meningitis region 20100225.0627).

To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the
appropriate meningococcal vaccine, depending on availability, in
every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity
(whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the
population have been vaccinated (see
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>).

There are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_ based on
the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease
is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135. All these
serogroup polysaccharides but B are immunogenic in humans.

There are several different types of meningococcal vaccines that use
meningococcal polysaccharides as the immunogen: the vaccines may
contain one or more of the polysaccharide serogroups alone or
conjugated to protein. Meningococcal vaccines will only protect
against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups
that the vaccine contains.

Polysaccharide vaccines, which have been available for more than 30
years, exist for serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 in various
combinations (such as, a bivalent AC, trivalent ACW-135, and a
tetravalent ACYW-135 polysaccharide vaccine). There is a monovalent
protein conjugate vaccine against serogroup C and a tetravalent
against serogroups A, C, Y, and, W-135. There is no vaccine for serogroup X.

Although children as young as 3 months of age may have an immunologic
response to the serogroup A antigen contained in the meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccines, response to the other serogroup antigens is
poor in children younger than 2 years of age. These vaccines also
only provide protection for up to 3 years. In contrast, the
meningococcal conjugate vaccines induce a T-cell-dependent response,
resulting in an improved immune response in infants, provide
long-lasting immunity, and prevent nasopharyngeal carriage of _N.
meningitidis_, thus reducing transmission of this microorganism
person-to-person (see
<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf>).

A preventive strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a
significantly larger and more enduring impact on attempts to control
the yearly recurrences of this disease that causes considerable
morbidity and mortality, especially among children (see
<http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/19745499/102>).

All these vaccines have been proven safe and effective with
infrequent and mild side effects. For both the meningococcal
conjugate and the polysaccharide vaccines, approximately 7-10 days
are required following vaccination for development of protective
levels of anti-meningococcal antibodies.

A prior ProMED-mail post this year (2010) said that health
authorities believe that meningococcus serogroup A, which has been
responsible for almost all outbreaks in the Burkina Faso in the past,
is also responsible for the current outbreak, but that people who
were vaccinated in 2009, presumably with meningococcal serogroup A
vaccine, still contracted the disease, that was presumed to be due to
serogroup A meningococci. They discounted loss of vaccine potency at
the time. However, both the polysaccharide and the conjugate vaccines
require proper refrigeration; improper storage or handling of
vaccines may result in loss of vaccine potency and reduced immune
response in vaccinees. Also, the vaccines will not prevent
meningococcal infection caused by meningococcal serogroups not
represented in the vaccines, such as serogroup X, and will not
prevent bacterial meningitis caused by other pathogens, such as
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_, a pathogen also known to cause outbreaks
in the African "meningitis" region (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis,
pneumococcal - Africa: WHO meningitis region 20100213.0507). The
development of meningococcal meningitis in some patients who were
previously vaccinated can now be apparently explained by these
patients being infected with a non-vaccine meningococcal serogroup,
specifically serogroup X.
