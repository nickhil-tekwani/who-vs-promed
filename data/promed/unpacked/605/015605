[Tularemia is largely confined to the northern hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the southern hemisphere. There is evidence which suggests local emergence or re-emergence of this disease in Europe. In wild animals, _Francisella tularensis_ thrives in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) and wild rodents. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread through contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. Tularemia cases in hares are also more common in the same counties where increased numbers of human cases are reported. A geographical correlation between cases of tularemia in hares and cases in humans has been observed. - Mod.PMB
