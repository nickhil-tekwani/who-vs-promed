The spread of the epidemic looks quite rapid in children.
Today's news reported that O157 may cause HUS [hemolytic-uremic syndrome in
children. Of the 232 schoolchildren who had an episode of HUS, O157 was
isolated from ca. 60% of the serum. This implies that O157 could have been
endemic in a large portion of our country.
The [health authority stated that HUS occurred in "only a few percent" of
the infected children.

With an initial outbreak striking over 150 cases, and considering that O157
has been isolated in several other prefectures of Japan's main island
(Honshu), reaching the north-eastern part, the number of lethal cases may
well increase.
