[3] Changes in Behavior of Aedes aegypti
Date: Fri 27 Oct 2017
Source: Times of India [edited]
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dengue-mosquitoes-now-active-also-at-night-experts/articleshow/61253261.cms


The Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the dengue virus has changed its characteristics and is now active even after sundown, biting unsuspecting Kolkatans who often let down their guard in the evenings taking the time to be safe, a section of exp-erts in the city has warned.

Prevalence of ambient light and a higher night-time temperature have altered their biting habits, keeping the mosquitoes active for a longer period and turning the dengue outbreak in the city more severe, they say.

There is enough evidence that indicate that the Aedes mosquito is not calling it a day with sundown, considered a basic characteristic of the vector till recently, said Irfaan Akhtar, head of microbiology and infection control, Fortis Hospital. "The pattern of the disease spread suggests the mosquitoes are biting throughout the day this time. Patients, too, have confirmed this in many cases. In areas where the outbreak has been severe, people seem to have got infected in the evening or night. Earlier, it would be taken for granted that the evenings were safe. But it's no longer the case," said Akhtar.

The primary reasons behind this change in the biting pattern could be because ambient light and temperature hardly change with sundown in Kolkata. "In most city homes, there is enough light till late evening to keep it active. Temperature, too, drops little, providing the mosquitoes an extension of the conditions that keep them active. So, there is no reason to believe that we are immune to bites in the evening. But since this is what we have been given to believe, precautions have been lax," said Debashish Saha, senior consultant, AMRI Hospitals.

It is the female of the species that bite humans, while the males feed on fruits and juices from tree barks. Aedes remains most active for 2 hours after sunrise and approximately 2 hours before sunset. It could, however, remain active in well-lit areas even in the evening, warn WHO guidelines. The Indian Medical Association (IMA), too, has changed its guidelines to mention that Aedes could bite after sundown, according to KK Aggarwal, president, IMA.

"Our anti-dengue campaign now says that Aedes mosquitoes could be active at any time during the day or night. This is true for cities which are well-lit in the evenings and give mosquitoes the impression of an extended day. It is dangerous to let your guard drop after evening," said Aggarwal. He added that the IMA was going to issue a fresh set of instructions for West Bengal mentioning the changed biting habit of Aedes.

The outbreak could have been controlled better had it not been assumed that evenings were safe, said Shyamasish Bandopadhyay, senior consultant, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital. "It is difficult to ascertain the exact biting time but if mosquitoes are already inside a well-lit room, there is no reason why they should turn inactive with sundown," he added.

A rise in temperature, too, is responsible for the altered nature of the mosquitoes, feels Akhtar. "Till a decade ago, the mercury would drop significantly after sunset. But with a general rise in temperature and rampant construction creating heat islands, indoor temperatures refuse to slide enough to drive away the mosquitoes," he said.

The Aedes mosquito thrives in hot and humid conditions and turn inactive with a temperature drop. "Previously, temperature dropped appreciably in Kolkata in November, curbing the dengue outbreak. In recent years, the mercury has refused to slide in November keeping the dengue spread unchecked," said a private hospital doctor treating dengue patients.

[4] Research on DENV-5
Date: Sun 15 Oct 2017 6:50 PM

https://audioboom.com/posts/6396647-doctors-seek-to-identify-dengue-virus-strain


With the Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, discovering the 5th serotype of Dengue virus (DENV5), the Doctors for Safe Environment (DoseE) in Chennai have called upon the government to take up a molecular study to identify which strain is causing the epidemic claiming scores of lives in Tamil Nadu besides afflicting several thousand.

Identifying the virus strain will throw light on deciding the course of treatment and also the precautions to be taken to safeguard one from this dreaded fever. "Also, we need to find out if Aedes Aegypti or Aedes Albopictus is causing the viral infection. This distinction is very crucial because if its due to Aedes Albopictus, which lays eggs deep in the water, no amount of fogging will serve the purpose," claims Dr V. Pugazhenthi of Dose. He said the treatment options would change depending upon the kind of mosquito that bites.

It is said there are only 4 strains, but the 5th variant, DENV-5, was identified by AFMC, Pune, and they clearly highlighted that because of the new virus, a vaccine would not work in the Indian scenario.
