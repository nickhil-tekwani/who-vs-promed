Rift Valley Fever Update: Death toll in Saudi Arabia and Yemen rises to 146
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RIYADH: Saudi Arabian [officials have said that 76 people had died within
its borders so far in the outbreak of Rift Valley Fever, taking the
[combined death toll in the kingdom and neighbouring Yemen to 146. A Saudi
Health Ministry statement published by the official Saudi press agency said
that, as of Mon 16 Oct 2000, a total of 408 people in Saudi Arabia had
contracted the viral disease since it broke out last month and 156 people
[have recovered.
Yemen's Health Minister Abdullah Abdul Wali Nasher said earlier the fever
had killed a total of 70 people by Saturday morning in his country. He said
500 people there had contracted the disease.
Rift Valley Fever, which is transmitted from infected livestock to humans
through contact or by mosquitoes, broke out on both sides of the
Saudi-Yemeni border last month. Yemen and Saudi Arabia have cooperated in
using planes to spray mosquito-infected areas along their common border.
