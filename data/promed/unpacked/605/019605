Kakapo plan on emergency footing
-------------------------------------
The Kakapo Recovery Program has been put on an emergency footing, after 3
out of 86 rescued birds on Chalky Island in Fiordland died from an
infectious disease.
Conservation Minister Chris Carter says autopsies have confirmed that they
were killed by a bacterial infection causing fatal blood poisoning. The 3
young females were found dead on Te Kakahu island after a recent transfer
there of 19 2-year-old birds from a species stronghold, Whenua Hou. DOC
believes the bacterial disease originated there.
Mr. Carter says the main concern is that the disease may pose a significant
risk to all young Kakapo on Codfish Island, just off Stewart Island, and on
Chalky Island. Mr. Carter says everything that can be done is being done to
save the critically endangered bird.
Antibiotics, medical supplies, and additional DOC staff have been flown to
the kakapo colonies to set up an intensive-care facility, and daily health
checks are being carried out on all remaining kakapo.

Mystery infection kills 3 kakapo
-----------------------------------
Conservation staff, working to save the kakapo, apparently spread an
infectious disease that is killing the endangered birds.
Last week [1st week of July 2004], 19 young kakapo were moved between 2
islands off the lower South Island, even though 2 other birds on the 1st
island had been found seriously ill over the past 3 months.
In the past 3 days, 3 of the transferred birds have died, at least 2
because of blood poisoning from a bacterial infection. The 4 kg
ground-dwelling birds are the world's largest parrot, and, until the
deaths, only 86 were left.
Department of Conservation (DOC) officials yesterday [Mon 12 Jul 2004]
placed at-risk kakapo into hospital-style intensive care, flying in
antibiotics, medical supplies, and additional staff.
Conservation Minister Chris Carter said last night [Mon 12 Jul 2004] that
DOC did not know what the disease was.
"Our concern is that the disease may pose a significant risk to all young
kakapo," he said. "We do know that it appears to have originated from
Whenua Hou (Codfish Island, near Stewart Island)."
A young male was found sick on Codfish Island about 3 months ago, with the
same symptoms as the birds that died recently. Even though officials had
not identified the illness, they went ahead with the transfer of 19 birds
from Codfish Island to Te Kakahu (Chalky Island), off Fiordland.
While rounding up the birds to be moved, a female was found with the same
symptoms as the sick male. She was treated with antibiotics, but the
officials went ahead with transferring a further 19 birds. The transfer was
intended to provide a new environment and space to increase the birds'
breeding success.
Before the transfer, DOC checked birds for disease symptoms, and took
random blood tests. "No illness was detected at that time," Mr. Carter said.
Autopsies at Massey University in Palmerston North have confirmed that a
bacterial infection caused fatal blood poisoning in 2 of the 3 dead birds.
