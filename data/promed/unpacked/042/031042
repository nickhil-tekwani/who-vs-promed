Anthrax scare: Kerala lifts ban on milk from Tamil Nadu
-------------------------------------------------------
Kerala has lifted the ban on milk and milk products from Tamil Nadu,
imposed in the backdrop of an anthrax outbreak in the neighboring state,
but the restriction on movement of cattle and sheep will continue. The ban
was lifted after it had been confirmed that the incidence of the disease
had been contained in the affected districts of Tamil Nadu, secretary to
the state Animal Husbandry Department, Subrato Biswas and Director Ashok, said.
The outbreak of the disease was reported from Theni, Madurai, Virudunagar,
Dindigul, Coimbatore and Tirunelveli districts, all bordering Kerala. The
department had mounted an awareness campaign and stopped movement of
animals for slaughter through the border check posts. Tamil Nadu
authorities had confirmed anthrax as the cause of death of 15 cattle and 4
sheep since the outbreak was reported in the last week of June 2005. The
Tamil Nadu Animal Husbandry Director had stated that the outbreak had been
totally contained by 13 Jul 2005 in the affected areas. After it was
confirmed, the ban on milk and milk products was lifted on 14 Jul 2005, the
officials said.

No prevalence of anthrax in Tamil Nadu, says government
-------------------------------------------------------
There is no prevalence of anthrax in livestock in Tamil Nadu (TN), and the
Animal Husbandry Department has taken all steps to tackle the situation
following the recent ban by the Kerala Government on cattle movement, milk
and milk products from the state, according to the director of veterinary
services, Tamil Nadu.
The secretaries of the Tamil Nadu and Kerala governments and the directors
of animal husbandry will conduct joint meetings every 3 months. The 1st
meeting will be held in Chennai in the 1st week of August 2005, an official
press release said. The functions of the Central Referral Laboratory,
Chennai, will be modified to conduct constant surveillance of livestock to
prevent them from getting affected by specific diseases, the release added.
Surveillance in Dindigul, Coimbatore, Virudhunagar, and Madurai by the
[Tamil Nadu] Animal Husbandry Department ruled out spread of the
anthrax-causing _Bacillus anthracis_ bacteria, top animal husbandry
officials told The Hindu. Following reports that the disease claimed the
lives of 13 head of cattle in the Theni villages, the Kerala government
imposed the ban on 9 Jul 2005.
Ban on cattle movement:
Though the movement of milk and milk products was allowed from Friday, the
ban on cattle movement remains. The last cattle death in Tamil Nadu was
reported in Koduvilarpatti near Theni on 3 Jul 2005.
The earlier deaths were from this village and neighboring
Sivalinganaickenpatti. Kerala procured daily 50 000-70 000 liters of milk
from Theni villages before the outbreak. "We have vaccinated 13 000 animals
in 21 villages bordering Kerala's Idukki district. Surveillance has ruled
out more cases, which has been corroborated by an official team from Kerala
that visited the villages on Thursday. We are in touch with officials in
Kerala to stress on the necessity to lift the ban on cattle movement, as
cattle from many States pass through Tamil Nadu, and we cannot be held
responsible for all of them," officials said. Sufficient medical supplies
were available, they said.

[This time, the Indian newspaper reports confirm that this outbreak in late
June 2005 was in Tamil Nadu. It was near enough to the state of Kerala to
initiate movement controls by the latter state. I am pleased to see that
the 2 states are initiating what appears to be a joint surveillance
program. The Kerala embargo on TN milk and animal movements should engender
an awareness by the latter for the need for an active control program
involving regular livestock vaccination and surveillance for unexpected
deaths. - Mod.MHJ]
