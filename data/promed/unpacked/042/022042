They have big ears and striped bodies, but deer mice have the potential to pack fatal punch. Humans who come into contact with contaminated airborne particles from the urine, saliva, and droppings of deer mice can contract a severe and fatal lung disease known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).

On Tuesday morning [24 Jun 2014], the provincial health ministry confirmed an adult in southern Saskatchewan died after contracting [a] hantavirus [infection]. It is the 1st fatality involving [a] hantavirus the province has recorded in 2014.

At a press conference later in the afternoon, Denise Werker, the deputy chief medical health officer, did not tell reporters the age, sex, or health region the deceased contracted the illness. According to Dr Mark Vooght, chief medical officer for the Five Hills Health Region (FHHR), the hantavirus victim did not come from the FHHR.

"Unfortunately, these cases do occur and one needs to take precautions from preventing this sort of thing from happening," said Vooght. He added that when people enter buildings where they smell, or see dead mice, they need to make sure they are not potentially exposed to the airborne virus. Some of the precautions people should take include wearing gloves, an N-95 or N-100 protective mask, and double bag the dead mice they are cleaning up. And only remove your mask after you have thoroughly washed your hands, says Vooght. However, before cleaning the rodent-infested areas, it is recommended that the building's doors and windows be opened to provide ventilation for at least 30 minutes.

Symptoms of hantavirus [infections] include muscle aches, coughing, fever, headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Shortness of breath is another symptom, which can develop into HPS, which, according to Dr Vooght, "is fatal in about 30 per cent of cases." Over the last 20 years, there have been 27 cases of HPS in Saskatchewan, 9 of which have been fatal.

[The report above does not indicate the specific dates and place where the infection was acquired. Sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in humans have occurred in Canada's Prairie Provinces, including Saskatchewan, and British Columbia for several years. This report does not indicate which hantavirus is involved in this case, but it is likely to be Sin Nombre virus. The circumstances under which the infection occurred are also not given.

A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) site with extensive information about hantaviruses, including those in North America, with clinical signs, treatment, epidemiology, and an image of the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/.

The deer mouse is one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in North America and occurs in Saskatchewan. A map showing its distribution can be accessed at http://www.discoverlife.org/nh/tx/Vertebrata/Mammalia/Muridae/Peromyscus/maniculatus/images/Peromyscus_maniculatus_map.mx.jpg.
