A research team from Pennsylvania State University at Harrisburg has found
_Helicobacter pylori_ in river, creek and lake water in Central
Pennsylvania. This represents the first report of live _H. pylori_ in
surface water in the United States, demonstrating a major reservoir for
this organism outside the human body. John Hegarty of Penn State in
Harrisburg said that although _H. pylori_ infects half the world's
population, surface water as a primary source of infection has been unknown
prior to the research project.
