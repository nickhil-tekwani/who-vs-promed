A fresh outbreak of the water-borne disease cholera has hit Mocuba, the 2nd largest city in Mozambique's Central Province of Zambezia, with 137 suspected cases, according to the provincial heath director, Idayat Cassimo. Cassimo told a meeting of the provincial government on Thu 5 Nov 2015 that samples collected from 10 patients suffering from severe diarrhea had confirmed the presence of the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_, which causes cholera.

According to Cassimo, the treatment center adjacent to the Mocuba Rural Hospital has hospitalized 49 cases and so far 1 person has died in connection with the outbreak. About 30 people afflicted with the disease have been reporting to the facility for treatment on a daily basis.

Cassimo also said that the neighbourhoods of Central, CFM and Toma-de-Agua, all located on the banks of the Licungo River, are the worst affected areas.

Meanwhile, health authorities in Mozambique have assured people in cholera-hit areas that they have enough stockpiles of medicines to treat 1000 cases. They said efforts to control the situation, include publicizing hygiene measures, including the purification of drinking water, necessary to prevent further transmission of cholera and other diarrheal diseases.

[2] Cholera - Mozambique (Nampula Province)

With the arrival of hot and rainy season, the country of Mozambique is on the verge of a cholera outbreak, according to an O Pais report.

Since September 2015, the southern African nation has reported 479 cholera cases, including 3 fatalities. Health officials say most cases were diagnosed in Nampula province, particularly in the provincial capital (Nampula) and Malema district.

"We are on high alert status, because we already have cases of cholera in some provinces. Nampula, for example, has declared itself in a cholera epidemic. We are convinced that we must work more with sanitation issues of the environment and prevent it, because increasingly, people are diagnosed with this type of disease," said Benign Matsinhe, Deputy National Director of Public Health.

The bacterium is acquired through ingestion of contaminated water or food through a number of mechanisms. Water is usually contaminated by the feces of infected individuals. Drinking water can be contaminated at the source, during transporting, or during storage at home. Food can get contaminated by soiled hands, during preparation, or while eating.

Beverages and ice prepared with contaminated water and fruits and vegetables washed with this water are other examples. Some outbreaks are linked to raw or undercooked seafood.

[3] Cholera - Tanzania (Mwanza Region)

Religious leaders have been urged to educate their followers on health issues, as cholera has hit Mwanza Region, killing 18 people since early September 2015.

Acting Mwanza Regional Medical Officer, Dr James Kengia, said here yesterday, 3 Nov 2015, that beliefs in witchcraft among fishing communities have led to increased deaths reported in Ukerewe Island. "We have launched an education campaign in the region and asked religious leaders to provide spiritual guidance on the problem, as health officers ensure the affected communities are served accordingly," he said.

According to updated statistics revealed yesterday, 3 Nov 2015, apart from 18 deaths, cumulative cases have reached 317, while 274 patients have been attended and discharged.

Dr Kengia said a meeting was convened at the Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS) office on Mon 2 Nov 2015 to chart strategies of containing the communicable disease. He said more cholera cases have been reported in Ukerewe Island, particularly in Nansio and Murutungulu, while the prevalence in Irugwa Island has tremendously decreased. Another District hit by the disease is Sengerema, where many cases were reported at Kanyala village bordering Nkome Island. Other districts are still safe. "People should exercise extra care and observe health directives as much as possible.

This includes staying in hygienic environments and drinking boiled water, among other preventive measures," Dr Kengia said. In Mwanza city, 2 cholera camps have been set up at Pasiansi in Ilemela municipality and another at Butimba in Nyamagana.

The cholera outbreak has spread to Handeni District in Tanga Region, killing 6 people. Residents of the district are warned to take immediate precautionary steps to prevent the bacterial disease from spreading further. According to experts, the cause of the outbreak is mainly due to people drinking un-boiled water and using improper pit latrines.

Head of the health department at the Handeni District Hospital Credianus Mgimba said the infected persons died between Fri 30 Oct 2015 and Sat 31 Oct 2015 and were from Segera, Kwamnele, Kwengoma, Kwamatuku and Ndolwa. Mgimba explained that they have set up a special camp for the infected at Ndolwa, Kwamkono, Segera, Kwamatuku and Kwamnele wards as well as another camp at Kivesa in Handeni.

Mgimba said education on preventive measures is provided to wananchi, who were also educated about giving prompt information if they saw anyone suffering from the disease around their areas.

[5] Cholera - Tanzania, USA travel advisory
Date: Fri 30 Oct 2015

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today, 30 Oct 2015, issued an advisory for travelers to Tanzania in response to the large cholera outbreak in the East African country. The cholera outbreak has more than quadrupled in the past 2 months as the latest data reveal that as of 15 Oct 2015, Tanzania has reported 4407 cholera cases and 68 deaths.

The regions affected include Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Pwani, Kigoma, Kilimanjaro, Iringa, Dodoma, Geita, Mara, Singida, Shinyaga, Mwanza and Zanzibar. The city most affected is Dar es Salaam.

The federal health agency advises travelers to protect themselves by following the food and water precautions below. The risk of cholera is very low for people visiting areas with cholera. When simple precautions are observed, contracting the disease is unlikely. Drink only bottled, boiled, or chemically treated water and bottled or canned carbonated beverages. When using bottled drinks, make sure that the seal has not been broken. To disinfect your own water, boil for 1 minute or filter the water and add 2 drops of household bleach or half an iodine tablet per liter of water. Avoid tap water, fountain drinks, and ice cubes.

Wash your hands often with soap and clean water. If no water and soap are available, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner (with at least 60 percent alcohol). Clean your hands, especially before you eat or prepare food and after using the bathroom.

Use bottled, boiled, or chemically treated water to wash dishes, brush your teeth, wash and prepare food, or make ice. Eat foods that are packaged or that are freshly cooked and served hot. Do not eat raw and undercooked meats and seafood or unpeeled fruits and vegetables.

Dispose of feces in a sanitary manner to prevent contamination of water and food sources.

Often people have mild illness or no symptoms. However, about 1 in 20 (5 percent) infected people will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours.

[The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
