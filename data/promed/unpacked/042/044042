More Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) Confirmed in Texas & New Mexico
Horses on a total of 3 sites in Texas and 4 premises in New Mexico are
known to be infected with Vesicular Stomatitis (VS), a painful blistering
disease of livestock such as horses, sheep, swine and deer. The viral
disease appears spontaneously and sporadically in the southwestern U.S. and
is thought to be transmitted by sand flies and black flies. The VS cases
this spring [2004] are the first to be confirmed since l998.
"The most recent confirmed cases in Texas involve 3 horses on a ranch near
Denver City, in Gaines County, about 80 miles southwest of Lubbock, and one
horse near Del Rio, in Val Verde County about 150 miles west of San
Antonio," said Dr. Bob Hillman, Texas state veterinarian and head of the
Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock and poultry
health regulatory agency. The country's 1st VS cases in 2004 were
confirmed 19 May, in 3 horses, which are confined to their ranch in Reeves
County, in far west Texas.
To prevent animal-to-animal disease transmission, the TAHC requires that
the VS-infected animals and the other livestock on the premise remain
quarantined until 30 days after all VS blisters or lesions heal, a process
that usually takes 2 or 3 weeks. Prior to quarantine release, the animals
will be re-examined by a state or federal regulatory veterinarian, to
prevent the spread of disease to other premises.
Dr. Steve England, state veterinarian for New Mexico, said a handful of
horses on 4 small premises near Carlsbad, New Mexico were found to be
infected since 4 Jun 2004. The animals remain quarantined on their premises.
"During an active year for VS, it is not unusual for this unpredictable
disease to be found scattered across several counties and states," said
Dr.Hillman. "We urge owners and private veterinary practitioners to report
clinical signs of the disease to their state veterinarians offices. A
disease investigation will be conducted, with laboratory tests run at the
National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. There is no charge
for these services."
Signs of VS -- which include blisters, open sores or erosions in an
animal's mouth, on the muzzle, teats or hooves -- mimic those of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), an extremely dangerous and highly contagious
foreign animal disease that can affect cattle, sheep, swine and deer, but
not horses. Laboratory testing is needed to differentiate between VS and
FMD, or to determine whether the animals had contact with a toxic plant or
poison.
During a VS outbreak, animal health officials across the country may place
additional testing requirements or restrictions on livestock originating
from states with infection. The TAHC has directed private veterinary
practitioners to carefully inspect animals for VS, and document the exam on
certificates of veterinary inspection (health papers) issued for livestock
leaving Texas. A similar statement also is required on paperwork for
livestock entering Texas from other states with VS infection. Dr. Hillman
recommended that producers or veterinarians check with each state of
destination prior to shipping livestock.
"To help prevent VS, control biting flies." said Dr. England, "Keep horses
and other equine animals under a roof at night and keep stalls clean to
reduce exposure to flies. If you borrow equipment or tools from another
rancher, disinfect them before using them. At shows, on trail rides or
other events, make sure your animals are fed and watered from their own
buckets or troughs. If your horses, cattle, sheep, deer or other livestock
develop blisters or open sores indicative of VS, call your practitioner and
state veterinarian's office."
The TAHC hotline is operational 24 hours a day at 1-800-550-8242, with a
TAHC or U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian always on call to take
reports and work with veterinary practitioners. In New Mexico, producers
should make reports to the New Mexico Livestock Board at 505-841-6161.
