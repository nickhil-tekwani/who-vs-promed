[The report on the absence in Libya, of new outbreaks of the FMDV SAT2 since the initial, single outbreak of 12 Feb 2012 is rather striking, particularly when compared to the massive spread of the FMDV SAT2 epizootic in neighbouring Egypt. According to the initial Libyan notification (http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=11741), the outbreak of 12 Feb 2012 involved 46 susceptible cattle in a feedlot in the Benghazi province; the animals were said to have came from many sources from local markets. There were 11 reported cases, including 5 animals which suddenly died after 3 days of infection, showing acute respiratory signs. The affected animals were "new stock". No stamping out policy was applied, meaning that 41 animals survived, including 6 which had clinical signs, and the outbreak was declared as "resolved" on 21 Feb 2012.

In contrast to the non-spreading nature of the said SAT-2 outbreak, serotypes O and A (re A, see further down) were reported as continuing their spread: the outbreak started on the north western coastal area on 18 Dec 2011, confirmed 30 Dec 2011. So far, 29 outbreaks have been reported. The most recent follow-up report was submitted to the OIE on 21 Apr 2012, addressing 6 outbreaks in sheep, all caused by FMDV serotype O, with an exceptionally high (77.24 per cent) "apparent case fatality rate". It may be assumed, but needs confirmation, that such high mortality involved mainly young animals. The latest of these 6 outbreaks started 25 Feb 2012. See, with interactive map, at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11566.

In samples submitted from Libya to the WRLFMD during 2012, FMDV serotypes O and SAT2 were identified and genotyped; there was no confirmation of serotype A in Libya since 2009. See the Libya page at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/lib.htm. - Mod.AS
