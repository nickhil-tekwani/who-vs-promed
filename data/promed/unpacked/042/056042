[The said information was included in a circular distributed by Singapore's Food Safety Agency to local meat and egg traders addressing import restrictions. Additional information on the outbreak in Mimasaka (in the western Japan prefecture of Okayama), is available at
https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20201211/p2a/00m/0na/018000c. This event led to the culling of some 640 000 chickens kept at the farm. The prefectural government has issued movement restrictions forbidding poultry farms within a 3-km radius of the infection site from transporting chickens or eggs outside their facilities and is also restricting poultry farms within a 10-km radius from taking their chickens and eggs outside that sphere.

Since submitting to the OIE on 6 Nov 2020 its immediate notification on the H5 avian influenza event that reportedly had started in the Kagawa prefecture on 4 Nov 2020 (20201109.7928569), Japan has submitted 3 follow-up reports, the most recent one on 18 Nov 2020. All came from the same prefecture. The causative agent was reported to be HPAI H5N8. Links to all said reports, addressing the 1st 5 outbreaks, and an interactive map presenting their locations as of 18 Nov 2020, are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=36435.

The event's summary as of 18 Nov 2020 is as follows:
Total outbreaks = 5 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 478 000 / 2068 / 2068 / 475 932 / 0

It is likely that the 2 additional outbreaks in Kagawa reported on 20 Nov 2020 (20201122.7962047) as well as later events from additional prefectures in Japan addressed in the above circular from Singapore have been caused by the same HPAI H5N8 virus strain, but this is subject to confirmation. In case confirmed, they were/are expected to be officially notified.

The virus is suspected to have been introduced into Japan from the continent by migrating birds, signaling the migration season. - Mod.AS]

South Korea confirmed another case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) at a duck farm in a southern county on Saturday [5 Dec 2020], putting quarantine authorities on high alert.

The latest case was reported at a duck meat farm in South Jeolla Province's Yeongam County, 308 km south of Seoul, according to the provincial government. It marks the 3rd highly pathogenic AI case reported at a poultry house this year [2020] and the 1st such case confirmed in South Jeolla Province in 3 years.

Having blocked access to the affected farm and culled its ducks, local authorities plan to cull nearly 500 000 ducks and chickens in 10 nearby farms within a 3-km radius as a precautionary measure, the regional government said.

The municipality also designated the areas within a 10-km radius of the infected farm, which house 44 duck and chicken farms, as a special zone subject to heightened quarantine.

Movement of poultry to and from poultry farms in South Jeolla province has also been prohibited for 30 days.

Local quarantine authorities launched an epidemiological investigation into the affected area to trace the source of the latest AI case.

"The initial infection source (of the latest case) has yet to be found, as no report of suspected infection or symptoms has been filed by other farms in nearby areas," an official at the regional government said. "We elevated the quarantine level to the highest to curb the spread."

Since South Korea recorded the 1st outbreak of highly pathogenic AI in 32 months in late October 2020 in Cheonan, 92 km south of Seoul, more than 10 cases have been additionally confirmed, putting quarantine authorities on high alert against potential mass outbreaks.
