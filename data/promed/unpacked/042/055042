A 2-week quarantine for foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has been declared in
the Chuyka and Talasskie regions of Kyrgyzstan. In particular, cases of FMD
have been registered in the territory of Sokulukskogo, Alamudunskogo and
Chuyka regions as well as the city of Tokmok.
In connection, the sale of cattle in the Chuyka and Talasskie regions has
been stopped. The main state veterinary inspector and chief for the
northern regional administration for state veterinary science has adopted
the appropriate resolution.

[Kyrgyzstan (officially, Kyrgyz Republic; 2005 est. pop. 5 146 000; c. 76
600 sq mi or 198 400 sq km), borders China in the southeast, Kazakhstan in
the north, Uzbekistan in the west, and Tajikistan in the southwest. The
2005 numbers of FMD-susceptible species, according to FAO statistics, are
the following: cattle 1 034 890, sheep 2 965 220, goats 808 397, pigs 82
659. Map available at

FMD outbreaks were last reported from Kyrgyzstan by ProMED-mail in January
2004. However, according to Kyrgyzstan's official reports to the OIE (their
last available report covered 2004), no outbreaks were officially recorded
after Feb 2001, when 2 outbreaks were reported in Naryn and one in
Issyk-Koul. They were reportedly caused by FMD virus serotype O. See
<http://www.oie.int/hs2/zi_pays_mald.asp?c_pays=100&annee=2001&c_mald=2>.
Confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the current disease news, and
information on the virus type involved, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
