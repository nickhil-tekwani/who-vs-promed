Source: Circular of Israel's Director Field Veterinary Services No 01/2012/LSD [in Hebrew, trans. & summ. Mod.AS, edited]

Lumpy skin disease (LSD) has been reported in the northern part of the Golan Heights, in 4 locations with grazing herds of beef cattle and in one fattening unit. The typical nodules observed were of different ages/stages of development. The total number of clinical cases is 74.

Following the performance of risk assessment, and taking into consideration the terrain structure and the distribution of the cattle population in the region, an "infected zone" has been defined and declared, its boundaries established and published (map appended to the circular).

It has been decided to immediately vaccinate the cattle in the outbreaks (excluding clinically affected cattle) and throughout the "infected zone", using a live-attenuated sheep-pox vaccine. This covers dairy cattle, beef cattle, breeding herds, breeding bulls and fattening units. As of today (3 Aug 2012), 16 500 cattle have been vaccinated. During the coming days, about 10 000 additional head will be vaccinated.

Various animal movement restrictions have been announced and are being applied (details included in the circular). Slaughter of animals from the Zone is currently allowed only in the slaughterhouse of Majdal-Shams, situated within the Zone.

[The circular mentioned the culling of a single, clinically affected fattening calf; additional information on the disease eradication measures applied would be helpful. Similarly, information on any vector-control measures applied would be appreciated.

LSD is an unwelcome addition to several other vector-borne cattle diseases which have been earlier shown to circulate in Israel (reflecting the situation in the region), during the months July-December (the vector season): Bluetongue (at least 7 serotypes), Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease (EHD) and bovine ephemeral fever (BEF). In addition, West Nile fever and Equine Encephalosis have been reported in equines. Other Middle Eastern countries, namely Egypt, Saudi-Arabia and Yemen, reported another important vectorborne disease in earlier years, namely the zoonosis Rift Valley Fever. All deserve the attention and alertness in adjacent regions, including south-east Europe. - Mod.AS.
