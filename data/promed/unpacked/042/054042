A teenage boy has died of Ebola in Liberia, a health official said on Tue [24 Nov 2015], the 1st fatality since July [2015] in one of the 3 West African countries hit hardest by the worst ever outbreak of the disease.

The 15-year-old boy died Mon [23 Nov 2015] night, said Dr. Francis Kateh, chief medical officer and acting head of Liberia's Ebola Case Management System. The boy, who lived in Liberia's eastern Paynesville district, was the 1st Ebola patient in the country since it was declared Ebola-free for a 2nd time in September [2015].

The boy's father and brother also have tested positive for Ebola and have been taken to an Ebola treatment center along with his mother and 2 other siblings. Health officials have identified nearly 160 people who might be at risk of being infected with the disease, including 8 health-care workers "who are at high risk because they came in direct contact with the boy," said Sorbor George, a spokesman for the country's health ministry.

Liberia on Mon [23 Nov 2015] said it had sought help from 2 experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the cause of the latest cases.

More than 11 300 deaths have been recorded for the entire outbreak, which was 1st confirmed in March 2014 and has been concentrated in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to the World Health Organization. Liberia has recorded more than 4800 deaths and more than 10 600 cases.

Liberia was 1st declared Ebola-free on 9 May [2015], but new cases emerged in June [2015] resulting in 2 deaths, including one in mid-July [2015]. WHO declared the country Ebola-free again on 3 Sep [2015].

The new cases in Liberia were announced just days after Guinea, the country where the epidemic started, said it had no more Ebola patients and was beginning a 42-day countdown toward being declared free of Ebola transmission. Guinea had been the last country with any cases, as Sierra Leone was declared Ebola-free on 7 Nov [2015].

[2] Liberia: Ebola recurrence
Date: Tue 24 Nov 2015

http://www.trust.org/item/20151124120842-lvfdw/


The index patient, a 15-year-old, succumbed to Ebola virus disease (EVD) late on Mon 23 Nov 2015. He is the 1st to die from EVD for months in Liberia. It is not known how patient NG was infected, but investigations are underway.

According to a health expert who spoke on Tue 24 Nov 2015, there was a failure to transfer a suspected patient with EVD directly to a specialist treatment unit. The fresh outbreak of EVD in Liberia may reflect fatigue and complacency among health-care workers.

According to Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) representative Carissa Guild, the 15-year-old index patient, "...went to several health-care centers before being referred to an Ebola treatment unit. Several health workers who cared for him may have not worn protective equipment. MSF's Guild said "Normally with a surveillance system, if someone has signs and symptoms (of Ebola) they would not be hospitalized but would be immediately sent to an Ebola treatment center to be tested. There were no cases for a while, and Liberia was nearing the end of a 90-day period of heightened surveillance... it is quite possible that people were tired and got complacent."

It is unlikely cross-border contamination occurred; Guinea has no EVD cases, and Sierra Leone was declared EVD-free on 2 Nov 2015 after 42 days without a case.

The recurrence of EVD in Liberia, after twice previously declared EVD-free only to have new EVD cases appear is a reminder for the EVD-affected countries to remain vigilant for recurrence. According to UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) representative Sheldon Yett, "Everyone celebrates when the last case is treated, but we can't let our guard down. There will be other fires; we need to be ready for them too."

[3] Liberia: origin of 1st case

According to Dr. Frances Kateh, chief medical officer and acting head of Liberia's Ebola Case Management System, 2 experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are set to travel to Liberia where they will attempt to determine the cause of new Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases confirmed last week, more than 2 months after the country was declared free of EVD transmission for a 2nd time.

The 1st of the latest patients is a boy from the capital, Monrovia, who officials initially said was 10 but now report as 15 years of age. The boy's father and brother also have tested positive for Ebola and have been taken to the same treatment center along with his mother and 2 siblings. Officials have reported there are 153 contacts who are under surveillance. These contacts include approximately 12 health-care workers "who are at high risk and under precautionary observation," the health ministry said in a statement.

[According to the Los Angeles Times (http://www.pressreader.com/usa/los-angeles-times/20151124/281535109899902/TextView), the CDC has noted "a failure to monitor people for the full 21-day incubation period after they come in contact with the disease." Whether that shortcoming contributed to this latest set of Ebola cases in Liberia is not known but certainly needs to be corrected.

According to All Africa (http://allafrica.com/stories/201511240810.html), several measures put into place by the Liberian Government during the outbreak, including "Ebola buckets" and limitation of vehicles to 3 passengers in the backseat, including commercial vehicles, are now being ignored. Commercial drivers now take 4 passengers in the backseats and sometimes 2 in the front seats. According to comments by many commercial drivers to Front Page Africa, the Government, once Liberia was declared Ebola free, has not specified the number of passengers allowed in vehicles.

In addition, some official buildings no longer have "Ebola buckets" available at their front doors or, if they are available, no one is there to monitor that the buckets are used for hand washing.

It appears clear that public health measures need to be stringently followed to achieve an "Ebola-free" population. - Mod.LK]

[4] WHO Ebola Situation Report - 25 Nov 2015
Date: Wed 25 Nov 2015

A cluster of 3 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported from Liberia in the week to 22 Nov [2015]. The 1st-reported case was a 15-year-old boy who tested positive for EVD after admission to a health facility in the Greater Monrovia area on 19 Nov [2015]. He was then transferred to an Ebola treatment centre along with the 5 other members of his family. Two other members of the family -- the boy's 8-year old brother and his 40-year-old father -- subsequently tested positive whilst in isolation. In addition to the family, 149 contacts have been identified so far, including 10 health workers who had close contact with the 15-year-old prior to isolation. Investigations to establish the origin of infection are at an early stage. Liberia was previously declared free of Ebola transmission on 3 Sep 2015.

On 7 Nov [2015], WHO declared that Sierra Leone had achieved objective 1 of the phase 3 framework, and the country has now entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance scheduled to conclude on 5 Feb 2016. As of 22 Nov [2015], it had been 6 days since the last EVD patient in Guinea received a 2nd consecutive EVD-negative blood test. The last case in Guinea was reported on 29 Oct 2015.

The recent cases in Liberia underscore the importance of robust surveillance measures to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in currently unaffected areas. In order to achieve objective 2 of the phase 3 response framework -- to manage and respond to the consequences of residual Ebola risks -- Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have each put surveillance systems in place to enable health workers and members of the public to report any case of illness or death that they suspect may be related to EVD to the relevant authorities. In the week to 22 Nov [2015], 29 176 such alerts were reported in Guinea, with alerts reported from all of the country's 34 prefectures. Equivalent data are not currently available for Liberia. In Sierra Leone, 1420 alerts were reported from 14 of 14 districts in the week ending 15 Nov [2015] (the most recent week for which data are available).

As part of each country's EVD surveillance strategy, blood samples or oral swabs should be collected from any live or deceased individuals who have or had clinical symptoms compatible with EVD. In the week to 22 Nov [2015], 9 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 670 new and repeat samples from 16 of the country's 34 prefectures. 85 percent of all samples tested in Guinea were swabs collected from dead bodies. By contrast, 82 percent of the 930 new and repeat samples tested in Liberia over the same period were blood samples collected from live patients. In addition, all 15 counties in Liberia submitted samples for testing by the country's 4 operational laboratories. 1240 new samples were collected from all 14 districts in Sierra Leone and tested by 8 operational laboratories. 92 percent of samples in Sierra Leone were swabs collected from dead bodies.

793 deaths in the community were reported from Guinea in the week to 22 Nov [2015] through the country's alerts system. This represents approximately 35 percent of the 2248 community deaths expected based on estimates of the population and a crude mortality rate of 11 deaths per 1000 people per year. Equivalent data are not yet available for Liberia. In Sierra Leone, 1282 reports of community deaths were received through the alert system during the week ending 15 Nov [2015] (the most recent week for which data are available), representing approximately 62 percent of the 2075 deaths expected each week based on estimates of the population and a crude mortality rate of 17 deaths per 1000 people per year.

Background
---------
An epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been ongoing in West Africa since December 2013, mainly affecting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. On 8 Aug 2014, WHO declared the Ebola epidemic in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As of 18 Nov 2015, WHO has reported 28 598 cases of Ebola virus disease related to the outbreak in West Africa, including 11 299 deaths [1]. The number of cases in the most affected countries peaked in autumn 2014 and has been slowly decreasing since then. Liberia was declared Ebola-free by WHO on 3 Sep 2015 and Sierra Leone on 7 Nov [2015]. Guinea has not reported new cases since 29 Oct 2015.

Current situation in Liberia
---------------
On 20 Nov 2015, the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare reported 3 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease [2]. On 19 Nov 2015, a reference laboratory in Liberia reported an Ebola positive result in a sample from a patient who presented symptoms such as fever, weakness and bleeding at a hospital in Monrovia on 17 Nov 2015. The patient was placed in isolation. The Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare stated in a press release that 4 patients and high risk contacts are being cared for at an Ebola Treatment Unit in Monrovia. The hospital where the patient was detected is undergoing decontamination, and all health care workers who were in contact with the patient are being monitored.

According to media, the 1st case is a boy with onset of symptoms on 14 Nov 2015 [3,4], who attended school on Mon 16 Nov 2015, was admitted to a hospital on 17 Nov 2015 and confirmed positive on 2 samples on 19 Nov 2015. Two additional cases have been identified among family members. As of 20 Nov 2015, 4 patients (corresponding to at least 3 confirmed cases) and high risk contacts are hospitalised in an Ebola Treatment Unit in Monrovia. According to media, 153 contacts presenting with high, medium and low-risk exposure are followed-up [5]. Further response activities and contact tracing are ongoing.

Assessment
---------
Liberia was declared free of Ebola virus transmission in the human population on 3 Sep 2015, following which, Liberia entered a 90-day period of EVD heightened surveillance [6]. The confirmation of new EVD cases during heightened surveillance periods after the tail end of outbreaks is not unexpected as stated in the most recent ECDC risk assessments [7,8].

The identification of new cases in Liberia highlights the importance of maintaining enhanced surveillance and immediate response capacity for control in the aftermath of the Ebola epidemic in the affected countries.

23 Nov 2015: 1st systematic review of Ebola risks underway
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151123102100.htm
[The study found caring for people with late-stage Ebola virus disease (EVD) at home and preparing deceased Ebola victims for burial, puts people at greatest risk of contracting the disease. A new paper on risk factors for transmitting EVD recommends better provision of health care facilities to ensure that people with the disease don't have to be cared for at home.

24 Nov 2015: Liberia resurgence: The changing meaning of 'Ebola-free'
http://www.eboladeeply.org/articles/2015/11/8515/liberia-resurgence-changing-meaning-ebola-free/
[Website Ebola Deeply examines what "Ebola-free," in reality, means, and what might be better definitions.
Bruce Aylward, the WHO's Special Representative for the Ebola Response, said in Geneva last week: "As they confirm that they've stopped transmission, these countries are downgrading from a state of emergency to a state of alert. It's so important to them to get back on their feet, economically and psychologically as well. ...
Aylward added that in the current context, Ebola-free ceremonies should mark the end of original chains of transmission instead of suggesting the eradication of the virus. Subsequent flare-ups should be treated as rare but inevitable, he said.]

[Air Partner has worked continuously with governments, NGOs and aid agencies since the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak began to provide the affected countries with vital supplies. Between 26 Oct 2014 and 11 Nov 2015, the freight team operated a total of 128 flights between the UK and Freetown, Sierra Leone. The Private Jets division is still operating a helicopter on a wet lease. At the peak of the crisis, the group was operating flights every 48 hours carrying cargo of medical equipment and supplies, vehicles, construction materials, and protective clothing.]
