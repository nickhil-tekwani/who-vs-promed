Doctors say cases and dozens of deaths from the disease have occurred since the August [2020] floods, with cases of malaria and cholera also on the rise.

An outbreak of Rift Valley fever has killed dozens of people and infected more than 1000 in Sudan's Northern state, according to local doctors.

Doctors told the Guardian the disease has spread across the towns of Merowe, Al Dabbah, and Karima, mainly among cattle herders.

However, the Sudanese government has so far denied there is an outbreak of the disease. On [10 Oct 2020], Mohamed Hamdan Hemedti, head of paramilitary unit the Rapid Support Forces and vice-president of the sovereign council, said the country was free of the fever. "We don't have the Rift Valley fever disease in Sudan, we don't have it at all," he said at an event in Khartoum.

Dr Abdulhadi Gendeel, a former lab technician from a village near Merowe, said his uncle, 50, and brother-in-law, 27, had died of the disease, which can affect humans and animals. Both died within 2 days of developing symptoms, he said.

"My brother-in-law got sick first, and they thought it was malaria but it wasn't," Gendeel said. "After testing him 3 times, his situation got worse. He had kidney failure and needed a blood transfusion, so he was sent to Khartoum. But many hospitals refused to receive him and at the end, only one hospital agreed to treat him."

He added: "My uncle travelled all the way to see him in Khartoum, but 2 days later we found out that he had developed the same symptoms and died."

He said his relatives had developed symptoms similar to jaundice, including low blood pressure and kidney and liver failure.

Last year [2019], 11 people in Sudan died of Rift Valley fever and hundreds more were infected after the disease spread across the Red Sea and Nile states, according to Acaps, an NGO based in Geneva that provides independent humanitarian analysis.

This year [2020], the 1st cases of the disease among humans appeared in late August, following unprecedented heavy rains and flooding of the Nile. About 10 million people in Sudan are now at risk of contracting waterborne diseases such as cholera due to the flooding, and millions more are at risk of malaria, Acaps said.

Earlier this year, Sudan's former health minister, Akram al-Toum, declared an outbreak of Rift Valley fever among animals.

Mona El-Arbab, a public health specialist at Al-Daman private hospital in Merowe, said the hospital had allocated an entire wing for patients with Rift Valley fever. "We receive about 80 cases a day. Some people come to the hospital bleeding and those [patients] normally die," she said.

In response, the government has announced a public health emergency in Merowe but has not confirmed that the outbreak is Rift Valley fever.

The governor of Merowe, Amal Izzeldien, said 63 people had died and 1512 had been infected by different diseases without specifying what these were. The acting minister of health, Usama Abdul-Rahim, said malaria was spreading and about 70 000 cases were being registered weekly.

In August [2020], Saudi Arabia returned thousands of Sudanese livestock to the country after saying the animals had not been vaccinated against Rift Valley fever. About 3000 of the animals later died of hunger and thirst at Port Sudan.

Doctors said Northern state did not have a single CBC testing machine to monitor blood counts, which was making their job difficult.

Dr Manal Hassan, a GP at Merowe's public hospital, said it was overwhelmed by severe cases of the fever. "Among 80 cases we receive in a day about 50 of them have been infected by this fever, and I personally saw 3 [people] die of it," she said.

"Some of the patients were lying under trees in the hospital yard because the fans inside the wards had stopped working," she added. "Now they are in the same place as patients suffering from other illnesses, which is very dangerous because they might get infected by the Rift Valley fever as well."

The disease is caused [transmitted] by the _Aedes_ mosquito and can be transmitted from animals to humans. "It's the 1st time since I started working at hospitals that I have seen such a disease. Most of the cases are among people who have animals," said Hassan. "The danger of this mosquito is that its eggs [with virus] could live for a long time in the soil."

West Darfur state is facing an outbreak of another fever: the chikungunya virus, which has led to several deaths, with thousands of people reported to be infected. A pharmacist and public health practitioner based in the state capital El-Geneina, who did not want to give their name, said some people had died of the disease, and "almost every household has someone infected by the fever."

The chikungunya virus is also transmitted by the _Aedes_ mosquito and causes similar symptoms. In 2018, thousands of people were infected by the virus in the eastern state of Kassala and 7 died, according to the government.

In El-Geneina, charity volunteer Nasma Abdallah said her 14-year-old nephew had been infected and was unable to walk for 5 days. "He's been getting some treatment at home," she said.

[Rift Valley fever was suspected in the Northern state in September 2020 when there were 120 human cases with 45 deaths (see PRO/MENA Undiagnosed illness - Sudan (02): (Northern) fatal, Rift Valley fever susp 20200925.7811914). A 15 Oct 2020 report stated that the United Resistance Coordination of Merowe in the Northern State announced that the number of deaths from Rift Valley fever has risen to 79, while the number of recorded cases has reached 1962, including 3 cases of nervous system complications. A total of 4578 miscarriages and deaths have been recorded among livestock (see Rift Valley fever - Sudan: (NO) 20201018.7868637). The report goes on to state that the Northern state Coordination called on the Sudanese Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Animal Resources to declare an epidemic of Rift Valley fever and to open the door for international and voluntary organizations to intervene and assist. It is not clear why these 2 ministries have not done so or provided laboratory results that implicate another etiology. ProMED would be interested in knowing if these ministries will confirm or eliminate this outbreak as Rift Valley fever.

As noted in the previous post, in a 14 Nov 2019 report, the WHO stated that RVF [Rift Valley fever] is endemic in Sudan. There have been 3 outbreaks affecting humans previously documented in 1973, 1976, and 2008. During the outbreak in 2008, a total of 747 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, including 230 deaths. The report indicated that following heavy rains on 13 Aug 2019, flooding caused flash floods in 17 of the 18 states, including Abyei area in West Kordofan State. These floods favored vector abundance, distribution, and longevity. The 2019 RVF outbreak started on 19 Sep 2019 and affected states impacted by the floods (see Rift Valley fever - Sudan (07): (RS,RN) human, livestock, WHO 20191120.6787770). Now RVF transmission is active currently (2020) in the Northern State with both humans and livestock affected.

Surveillance and responses to RVF outbreaks require a One Health approach since both humans and animals are affected and environmental change, in this situation extensive flooding, has promoted vector abundance. Effective vector control over extensive geographical areas is difficult to achieve and is expensive. Maintenance of herd immunity through vaccination of animals can be a successful preventive measure prior to the occurrence of cases. - Mod.TY
