First Report of Koi herpesvirus in Texas. G. M. Southard and L.T. Fries
Koi herpesvirus (KHV) was detected in a common carp, _Cyprinus
carpio_, collected from a fish kill during May 2006 at Twin Buttes
Reservoir near San Angelo, Texas. Also known as carp nephritis and
gill necrosis virus (CNGV), KHV is highly contagious, infects both
common carp and ornamental koi carp, and can result in high mortality rates.
Biologists from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD)
investigated the kill and estimated 500 dead common carp along a 1-km
segment of shoreline, which converts to thousands of dead fish in the
reservoir. Surface water temperature was 22C and dissolved oxygen
measured 9.2 mg/L. One moribund fish was collected and shipped to
the Southeastern Cooperative Fish Disease Project at Auburn
University where KHV DNA was detected using the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). A concomitant _Flavobacterium columnare_ infection
was also observed, and it is unclear what role the virus played in
the fish kill. This is the 1st known report of KHV in the state, and
the virus has the potential to affect wild populations as well as
TPWD hatcheries, which use koi carp as a forage for some species of
captive brood stock.

[OIE has only one report of Koi herpesvirus in the last 18 months:
from Singapore in September 2005. For those who are interested in
this disease, I am including the comprehensive comments of Mod.AS
from a previous posting below - Mod PC.
Though KHV is not included in the list of notifiable diseases,
Singapore justifiably reported it to the OIE, since it is regarded an
important emerging disease with potential of international spread.
Such a notification occurred once before (Indonesia, 2002).
Since 1998, the newly recognized Koi herpesvirus (KHV) has caused
mass mortality among common carp and koi in the USA, Israel, Germany,
England, Italy, Netherlands, Indonesia and Japan. It seems that the
disease was present but not recognised in previous years (KHV DNA was
detected in tissue samples taken in 1996, during an unexplained mass
mortality of koi and common carp in the UK).
Intensive fish culture, koi shows, and both domestic and
international trading in the absence of health certifications or
inspections have contributed to the rapid global spread of KHV.
Recent investigations into mortalities on coarse fisheries have
provided evidence for the spread of KHV into wild populations of
common carp. This has become the most severe hazard of this emerging
disease. Since KHV is not a notifiable disease, there is no
requirement for exporting countries to provide any health
certification to show freedom from it.
However, in a number of countries, ornamental fish trade
organisations have introduced a number of initiatives in an attempt
to control the spread of the disease. This has included the
establishment of trade networks under which wholesalers and importers
are notified when the disease is diagnosed in batches of koi. Other
initiatives include the establishment of disease-free broodstock and
the provision of quarantine facilities for importers.
For a concise review of the KHV situation in the UK during 2004,
refer to page 30 in Trout News No. 40 (July 2005), published by Cefas
(UK's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science).
<http://www.cefas.co.uk/publications/troutnews/tnews40.pdf>.
According to FAO statistics, the world cyprinid (mainly carp) annual
production is approximately 17 million tons, of which more than 12
million tons is produced in China. The KHV situation in this huge
subcontinent is not known; we repeat previous requests for any
available information on relevant KHV monitoring activities there.
A useful overview by Kathleen Hartman et al can be seen in the
University of Florida IFAS Extension web-page:
