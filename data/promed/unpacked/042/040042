Esca, one of the biggest threats to global grape production, is a complex disease involving various fungi. There is no questioning the unstoppable pace at which it progresses. Esca sensu stricto was the name given to white rot in the trunk of mature plants; the accompanying symptoms in leaves are the result of extensive colonisation of the trunk by [other] pathogenic fungi.

According to recent studies, 3 primary fungi are involved with esca: _Phaeoacremonium aleophilum_ [and] _Phaeomoniella chlamydospora_ [which are] considered pioneers of esca, and _Fomitiporia mediterranea_, responsible for white rot in vines affected by esca.

In every case, the wood of the vines is infected after pruning. The fungi clog [the] vascular system [and] the parts of the vine without sap flow begin to die. The symptoms of esca only appear 5 to 8 years after the 1st contamination -- but when esca is present in its [severe] form, the vine can die in a matter of days.

The environmental factors favouring esca are still not well understood. However, the different pathogens can react differently to these parameters. [In] sensitivity to esca and other wood diseases, not all grape varieties are equal, although more than 50 percent of varieties are usually attacked by esca at rates of 5 percent or more. Since the ban of sodium arsenite, no efficient treatment for esca has entered the market

[Esca is a complex disease syndrome involving several fungal species. It is considered a series of pathological events starting in the nursery and finishing when the plant is mature. Esca is an important problem for grape production worldwide and historic evidence suggests that it may have been around since the start of viticulture. However, with climate warming and similar to other fungal diseases, it is extending its global range.

Esca presents 2 different types of symptoms: one characterised by leaf alterations, including interveinal yellowing and necrosis, and brown spots on fruit ("measles"), the other by wood degradation and sudden death of the plant. In addition to the fungi listed above, species reported to be associated with the different symptoms in different areas, include _Eutypa lata_, _Stereum hirsutum_, _Phellinus igniarius_, and _Sphaeropsis malorum_. It is suggested that the different pathogens play different roles in the process which starts with leaf discolourations and eventually leads to wood degradation.

Where chemical control with sodium arsenite is not permitted, eliminating infected plants and pruning affected plant parts have been suggested to control the disease. Removal of infected material from the vineyard is essential since masses of spores are produced by the fungi even at low temperatures. Spores can be airborne, but can also be spread with plant material, water, contaminated equipment and by mechanical means.
