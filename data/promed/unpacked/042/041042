I just visited the Associated Press at this URL and they have a report on
the United Nations sending medicine, antibiotics to Afghanistan via
helicopter.
I thought you could place this in ProMED-mail.
I am not a doctor, I just subscribe to ProMED-mail because I am interested
in viral [diseases and the tracking of global pathogens.
I live in the City of Melbourne, Australia.
The report for the Associated Press states that they know the disease not
to be plague or typhoid, but it has the same symptoms as the flu, it has
also killed over 200 people to date. I hope that you can post this URL so
other people with interest can visit it.
