Finland: Over 300 fall victim to food poisoning in Tampere
----------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in the Tampere region of Finland reported on Wed [2 Aug
2006] that at least 300 people have fallen victim to the food poisoning
epidemic that struck the region late last week [see: Food poisoning, salad
- Finland (W Finland) 20060731.2116]. The culprit appears most likely to be
a norovirus, present in all patient samples.
The food poisoning was contracted from a salad eaten at 9 different
workplace canteens in Tampere and 3 in Valkeakoski. Although the canteens
belong to more than one chain, the salad ingredients originated from the
same source.

[The number of people in the Tampere region of Finland affected by food
poisoning has doubled since the initial report of the outbreak on Mon 31
Jul 2006. The number may yet increase, since the cause of the outbreak has
been attributed now to norovirus contamination of a salad distributed to
several canteens from a common source. Noroviruses are highly infectious
ubiquitous enteric viruses which can be transmitted either from
environmentally contaminated food and water or directly from an infected
individual. Therefore, there may be some secondary spread of infection from
those suffering the effects of food poisoning. It remains to be determined
whether the infection was associated with a particular ingredient of the
salad or whether the infection originated from an infected food handler
preparing the salad prior to its distribution. Further information is awaited.
