A rural Grant man has become the state's fourth person to test
positive for the potentially deadly hantavirus [_Sin Nombre virus_].
[A 37-year-old male], went to Perkins County Hospital on 31 Aug 2002
with what he thought were flu symptoms. "It felt like I had the flu,
but I didn't have an upset stomach, just some indigestion with it and
I couldn't seem to get comfortable," Searcey told The North Platte
Telegraph. [He] was taken by ambulance to Scottsbluff, where he was
admitted to the intensive care unit. He had a short stay there,
improving enough to go home 4 Sep 2002; a day before tests came back
positive for hantavirus.
Hantavirus is contracted through breathing dust or [by contact with
materials] contaminated with the dried urine, feces, or saliva of
rodents. [He] had been trapping live mice before he became ill, he
said. [He] credits a strong immune system, general good health, and
quick-thinking physicians for his rapid recovery. He said he will no
longer use traps for mice.
[A 30-year-old male] of Lyman became the first person in to die from
the disease on 13 Jun 2002. [His] family believes he contracted the
disease at the Scottsbluff rail yard where he worked, and state
health officials have said that is a strong possibility. Hantavirus
was virtually unheard of until an outbreak of an unexplained
pulmonary illness occurred in May 1993 in the Four Corners area,
where New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah meet. Other Nebraska
cases include those of [a 41-year-old male], of Champion, who was
hospitalized in Kearney from 24 Jun 2002 to 14 Jul 2002 and [another
male, age not specified] of Benkleman, who was diagnosed with the
first known case of hantavirus in Nebraska in 1998. Both recovered.
