[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 1 431 691 with 81 802 (5.7%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 1 349 889 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 213 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 85 063 cases when compared with the data on 6 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 33 408 (39.3%), France for 11 059 (13.0%), Spain for 5267 (6.2%), Germany for 4288 (5.0%), Turkey 3892 (4.6%), the UK 3634 (4.3%), and Italy for 3039 (3.6%), of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 94.3% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 28.0% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France, have overtaken China in total numbers of cases. A global total of 82 078 deaths have been reported, 78 745 (95.9%) outside mainland China.

Italy, Spain, and Germany are showing trends for decreasing daily newly confirmed cases, as are Belgium, Switzerland... it is early and bears watching further. Musing out loud, one can't help but wonder if in addition to the impact of social distancing and lockdowns, perhaps there is a seasonality beginning to show. Time will tell.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily, new case counts hovering around 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Spain is number 2 and Italy is number 3. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Turkey has been accelerating. Turkey illustrates how rapidly things can increase: the 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 27 days the country has confirmed 34 109 cases; it now ranks number 9 out of 213 countries/territories in terms of absolute numbers of confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Cruise ship - Antarctic
Date: Wed 8 Apr 2020 2:14:34 PM
Source: CNN Philippines [abridged, edited]
https://www.cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/4/8/Antarctic-cruise-ship-coronavirus-evacuation.html


Australian and New Zealand passengers will be evacuated from a stricken Antarctic cruise ship Thursday [9 Apr 2020], after almost 60% of those on board tested positive for the coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2]. The Greg Mortimer, a cruise liner operated by Australia's Aurora Expeditions, departed [15 Mar 2020] on a voyage to Antarctica and South Georgia. Since the beginning of April [2020], however, the ship has been stuck off the coast of Uruguay, after authorities refused to allow passengers to disembark due to the risk of coronavirus [COVID-19]. Of the 217 people on board, 128 passengers and crew have now tested positive for the virus.

Six passengers requiring specialized care have been transferred to medical facilities in Montevideo -- a video posted online by the Uruguayan navy showed them being transferred from ship to ship wearing full protective gear. Passengers from European and American who have tested positive for coronavirus, however, will have to remain on board until they have a negative test result, after which they may be able to depart via Brazil, Aurora said. All passengers will be retested every 2 or 3 days, according to the company's website.

In a statement earlier this month [April 2020], Aurora said that the ship's doctor had developed a fever, and "we are organizing a back-up volunteer medic." The cruise operator added it had "formally escalated our request" to the Uruguayan authorities to allow the ship to dock and passengers to disembark, but it had so far been denied. Late Tuesday [7 Apr 2020], the Uruguayan government said it had authorized a medical flight evacuation of New Zealand and Australian passengers aboard the Greg Mortimer for later this week. The passengers will fly to Melbourne on Thursday [9 Apr 2020] on a plane chartered by Aurora, where they will undergo a mandated 14-day quarantine before proceeding to their final destinations. "We have been working on charters and flights for all onboard with the aim of disembarking our passengers as soon as possible," Aurora said in a statement.

"While our preferred plan had been to disembark all passengers simultaneously, the nature of the situation and the difficultly in securing flights has meant it is likely that the Australian and New Zealand passengers will leave the vessel before our European (UK included) and North American passengers." Aurora said the chartered Airbus A340 will be specially fitted with medical and quarantine facilities in order to "ensure the health and safety of all on board." The company estimated the cost per passenger of at least AUD 9300 [about USD 5700], and said it was in discussions with the Australian government "for support with this cost as we know that it is not viable for many people."

Ian Duddy, the UK's ambassador to Uruguay, said on Twitter that "we remain in close contact with the Uruguayan government, the cruise operator, (and) UK passengers on board the Greg Mortimer." "Several passengers have tested positive for COVID-19. We continue to explore ways for passengers to disembark while respecting all health protocols," he added. The Uruguayan government did not comment on when or whether passengers would be able to disembark this week.

Cruise ships stuck
------------------
More than a dozen cruise ships have been effectively trapped at sea due to the coronavirus pandemic, as countries refused to allow those carrying infected passengers to dock. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said this month [April 2020] it was in direct contact with 10 cruise ships with around 600 Australian passengers on board. "In most cases, disembarkation cannot occur unless passengers have onward flight arrangements and are able to travel directly to the airport via a so-called sanitary corridor, put in place by host countries," DFAT [Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade] said in a statement. The situation on board the ships rapidly transformed from holiday to misery for passengers, many of whom booked and paid for the journeys long before the virus began spreading late last year [2019].

Last month [March 2020], the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), an industry group whose members make up more than 95% of global cruise capacity, suspended operations from US ports for 30 days. In a statement, CLIA said about 14% of its fleet, some 30 or so ships, were still at sea. "Our members are focused on bringing these ships safely back to port as soon as they can," it added. Ships that do dock are often required to remain in place for extended quarantines before passengers can disembark. The effectiveness of such measures in the close confines of a ship not designed for medical screening have been questioned, however, particularly in the case of the Diamond Princess, a cruise liner which was quarantined at the Japanese port of Yokohama in February [2020].

[The cruise ship sagas continue. The fact that 59% of the crew and passengers on board have tested positive for the SARS-COV-2 is supportive of the observations that a cruise ship serves as an ideal incubator for the virus, with ease in transmission in the environment. There are continued media reports giving updates on numbers of cases associated with the Ruby Princess -- 15 fatalities and more than 600 cases (https://www.9news.com.au/national/suspicious-ruby-princess-death-toll-continues-to-climb-in-coronavirus-pandemic/bf5b82b7-330c-4b9c-af9f-3a6231d25fb7). - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- One new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours: São Tomé and Príncipe.

- Today, [7 Apr 2020], marks World Health Day and this year [2020] WHO pays tribute to the incredible contribution of all health workers, especially nurses and midwives. Nurses are the largest component of the health workforce and play a fundamental role in combatting COVID-19 and achieving Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals. WHO has published the first-ever report on the state of the world's nursing workforce, available at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/nursing-report-2020. It renews calls on governments to invest in nurses.

- WHO, Lady Gaga, and Global Citizen have announced a concert to air on Saturday, [18 Apr 2020], titled 'One World: Together at home'. This globally televised and streamed special will highlight unity among all people affected by COVID-19, celebrate the brave healthcare workers doing life-saving work, and raise funds for the response. More information is available at https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/06-04-2020-who-and-global-citizen-announce-one-world-together-at-home-global-special-to-support-healthcare-workers-in-the-fight-against-the-covid-19-pandemic.

- WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in a press conference held yesterday [6 Apr 2020], reiterated concerns regarding the shortage of medical masks and other PPE [personal protective equipment] and reminded people that masks should be used as part of a comprehensive package of interventions. WHO has released guidance on the use of masks in communities, during home care, and in healthcare settings that can be found at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak; further advice for the public can be found at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks.

- WHO is improving supply networks and logistics in clinical environments, and sending equipment and testing kits worldwide. See 'subject in focus' below.

Subject in focus: supporting countries with COVID-19 supplies and logistical needs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Improving supply networks
-------------------------
Significant efforts are underway to improve access to items essential for the COVID-19 emergency response. Through the continued efforts of WHO and the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN), the personal protective equipment (PPE) manufacturing market is beginning to open, however demand continues to outstrip available supply.

The Operations Support and Logistics (OSL) unit at WHO is working to convene meetings with key stakeholders including oxygen, ventilator and concentrator manufacturers, and producers of associated ancillary equipment. In addition to securing the appropriate equipment for those countries at most risk or most vulnerable, WHO and the PSCN is working with the World Bank and other UN agencies to ensure that the infrastructure, technical guidance and other operational guidance is available.

Through collaboration with the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), OSL's COVID-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool has been finalized. Output from the model is being shared with partners and is assisting both procurement agencies and suppliers in understanding national requirements of key supplies.

Sending personal protective equipment and testing kits
------------------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the outbreak, OSL has shipped more than 900 000 surgical masks, 62 000 N95 masks, 1 million gloves, 115 000 gowns, 17 000 goggles, and 34 000 face shields to 133 countries. OSL has also shipped COVID-19 testing kits to 126 countries.

Strengthening health logistics in clinical environments
-------------------------------------------------------
OSL has also launched and supported the COVID-19 Health Logistics Project, establishing direct technical support to hospitals to re-design their facilities into infectious disease treatment units. This support has included improving patient and healthcare worker flow, promoting rational use of PPE, and minimizing nosocomial transmission.

To achieve these aims, OSL has established the Health Logistics Technical Network (HLTN). The network is composed of recognized universities, humanitarian institutions and international NGOs focused on technical interventions. A WHO-based helpdesk serves as a centralized resource to answer technical questions, verify and provide inputs on COVID-19 facility layouts, troubleshoot problems, and facilitate solutions to problems while supporting experts in the field. Helpdesk support has been successfully provided in Australia for the Canberra Hospital Campus SARI [severe acute respiratory infections] layout, and additional support has been requested from Italy and France.

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [10:00 AM 7 Apr 2020], available at the source URL above. I am presenting the regional case totals without the addition of China for consistency in following trends in the regions. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 209. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 53 countries (including 18 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 31 650 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 83.7% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada (6.0%) and Brazil (2.7%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 36.9% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 16.5%, Peru at 10.4%, and Chile at 6.6%.

The European region seems to be slowing down, having confirmed 30 999 (45.1% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 3330 (66.3%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, down from 33 932 new cases and 3063 new deaths from yesterday's update [6 Apr 2020]. Spain reported 13.8% of newly confirmed cases, the UK 12.3%, France 12.5%, Germany 12.4%, Italy 11.6%, and Turkey 10.2%. These 6 countries (representing 10% of the European countries) account for 72.7% of newly confirmed cases in Europe.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 2274 new cases representing 53.9%% of the regional newly reported cases. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Qatar, represent 13.9%, 6.9%, 6.6%, and 5.4% respectively. Removing Iran from the denominator, Pakistan represents 30.2% of newly confirmed cases, followed by Saudi Arabia at 14.9%, UAE at 14.2%, and Qatar at 11.7%.

In the African region, Algeria reported 36.1% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cote d'Ivoire at 16.4%, Burkina Faso at 9.0%, and Niger at 8.4%. Note that 25 (53.2% of reporting countries in the African region) countries/territories reported no new cases in today's [7 Apr 2020] update suggesting incomplete data due to the incomplete reporting.

In the Western Pacific region, the Philippines reported 39.3% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), Japan 23.9%, Malaysia 12.4%, and Australia at 9.5%.

In South East Asia, only 3 of the 10 countries reported new cases in the previous 24 hours: Indonesia, Thailand, and Bangladesh.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [7 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve seems to show Europe plateauing and even decreasing, but the Americas are adding to the overall height of the curve on a daily basis. The 24-hour newly reported case total for the European region was 30 999 today (7 Apr 2020), compared with 31 650 for the Americas region, the 2nd consecutive day the Americas have reported more cases than Europe.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 3 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
