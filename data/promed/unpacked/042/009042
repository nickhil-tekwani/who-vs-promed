Progress in genome sequencing of Chinese isolates of SARS virus
---------------------------------------------------------------
China's top genomics institute discovered that the SARS virus was mutating
rapidly when the institute independently sequenced SARS' genetic blueprint,
raising new fears about developing a vaccine to combat it. "A few
nucleotide differences among individual genomes were detected, as the virus
is expected to mutate very fast and easily," said the Beijing Genomics
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in a statement on the
internet. The institute says the mutations will need to be studied further
to find an accurate diagnostic test and effective treatment for the
fast-spreading and sometimes lethal viral infection.
Chinese health and propaganda authorities, who have tightly controlled all
information about SARS, initially refused to allow the institute to make a
public announcement of its findings when it completed the sequencing on 16
Apr 2003. The institute, one of China's most respected research bodies,
circumvented the restriction by posting its findings without fanfare on an
academic website. Similar institutes in Canada and the US that have also
sequenced samples of the SARS virus in the last 2 weeks had won praise from
their governments. But the tide turned against the health and political
establishment in China with the dismissal of senior officials on Sunday
over their handling of the crisis, and in favour of experts such as the
scientists at the institute.
The institute has now received official backing from Hu Jintao, China's
president, who visited researchers over the weekend to compliment them on
their work. The institute collaborated with the Institute of Microbiology
and Epidemiology of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing to
decipher the code of 2 viruses collected from samples in China. One was
isolated from a lung autopsy in Guangzhou, southern China, near to where
the virus is believed to have originated. The second was from a mixture of
autopsy tissues from the liver and lymph nodes of a SARS victim in Beijing,
according to the web posting.
The sequencing allowed the development of a much-needed diagnostic test
which can detect the presence of the SARS virus within one hour, the
Chinese media reported on Mon 21 Apr 2003. The test detects the presence of
an antibody produced by the body in response to infection with the virus.
The Beijing Genomics Institute is best known for recently sequencing the
DNA of the rice genome and is also involved in the international human
genome project. Web postings about the SARS virus can be found at
(English) and (Chinese).

[Coronaviruses -- like all other RNA viruses -- are highly mutable as a
consequence of their molecular nature. The replication of genomic RNA is
error-prone and lacks the corrective mechanisms of viruses with DNA
genomes. In RNA viruses the average mis-incorporation rate during
replication is approximately one error per 10 000 incorporations.
Therefore, every coronavirus genome (possessing about 30 000 nucleotides)
will contain at least one error (mutation). Consequently the observation
that the nucleotides sequences reported by different groups differ by a few
nucleotides is not unexpected, particularly since nucleotide sequencing
reactions are performed on molecular clones rather than on populations of
genomes. These differences reveal nothing significant about the SARS virus
genome or the biological properties of the SARS virus. On present evidence
there are no data that indicate that the SARS virus is highly mutable;
rather the reverse. Coronaviruses have the potential to vary more than
other RNA viruses, mainly because the genome of the virus is considerably
larger and high-frequency recombination is a feature of RNA virus biology.
Recombination is probably limited to closely related viruses. Detailed
phylogenetic analysis will be required to determine whether the SARS virus
genome has acquired any genetic information by interaction with known
animal coronaviruses. - Mod.CP]

Shared mutations in the genomes of SARS coronaviruses
-----------------------------------------------------
Dr Henry Niman has analysed 10 SARS coronavirus sequences and has sent the
following list of shared mutations. The 10 coronaviruses in his analysis
are the following:
Tor2 (Toronto)
CUHK-W1 (Hong Kong)
Urbani (Hanoi/Bangkok)
KYK (Singapore)
HKU-39849 (Hong Kong)
GZ01 (Guangzhou)
BJ01 (Beijing)
BJ02 (Beijing)
BJ03 (Beijing)
BJ04 (Beijing)
The following shared mutations were found:
(1)
D to E [Asp to Glu] at position 5768 in open reading frame 1ab [the
putative polymerase gene]:
GZ01
CUHK-W1
BJ01
BJ02
BJ03
BJ04
(2)
I to T [Ile to Thr] at position 244 in open reading frame E2 [putative
glycoprotein gene]:
CUHK-W1
BJ01
BJ02
BJ03
BJ04
(3)
V to A [Val to Ala] at position 3072 in open reding frame 1ab [the putative
polymerase gene]:
CUHK-W1
BJ01
BJ02
BJ03
BJ04 ?(sequence not complete)
(4)
A to V [Ala to Val] at position 3196 in open reading frame (1ab) [the
putative polymerase gene]:
BJ01
BJ02
BJ03
Dr Niman concludes that the above data link various cases in Guangzhou,
Hong Kong, and Beijing. He suggests that the common source of infection at
the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong involved multiple variants of SARS
coronavirus.

[Mutation is presumed here to mean variation from a consensus (coding)
sequence. It should be remembered that non-coding changes also have been
correlated with biological effects in other viruses. It is not surprising
that the majority of the coding changes are located in the putative
polymerase gene, which comprises about 2/3 of the genetic content of the
virus - Mod.CP]
