Seasonal flu vaccine may help in fight against H5N1
---------------------------------------------------
Animals that have previously been vaccinated against seasonal flu appear to
respond far quicker to experimental H5N1 bird flu vaccines, a study has
found. Many doctors believe that seasonal flu vaccines offer little or no
protection against the H5N1 virus, which experts say may unleash a pandemic
that could kill millions of people. But a study by biotechnology firm
MedImmune Inc, which produces influenza vaccine, found that ferrets that
had been vaccinated against seasonal flu appeared to be more responsive
when they were later administered the H5N1 vaccine.
"If you have previously received normal seasonal flu vaccine, you may have
better response to the H5N1 vaccine," MedImmune's scientist Hong Jin told a
bird flu conference in Bangkok. [Bangkok International Avian Flu Conference

Researchers at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome
published a study in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases in December
showing that ordinary seasonal flu vaccines may provide a small amount of
protection against bird flu. Their study was among the 1st to support the
idea that getting an annual flu shot may help people's bodies fight off the
H5N1 virus. In the laboratory, they added H5N1 virus to the blood and found
that in some of the volunteers immune system proteins called antibodies
acted against the bird flu virus.
In the MedImmune study, a group of ferrets was given seasonal flu vaccine,
while a control group of ferrets were given nothing. [After 40 days had
elapsed], both groups were given H5N1 vaccines designed using seed virus
taken from outbreaks of the disease in Hong Kong in 2003 and Viet Nam in
2004. They were then monitored for the production of H5N1 antibodies.
"We found much more response in ferrets that received (seasonal flu)
vaccine, before, whereas in control ferrets, you don't see the response,"
Hong told Reuters. Huge volumes of antibody producing cells were seen in
the ferrets that had both vaccines on day 45, but there was no antibody
response in the control group, MedImmune said. "Maybe the (seasonal flu)
vaccine can induce immune response that can speed up response to H5
vaccine," Hong explained. Both types of vaccines were administered using
nasal spray. MedImmune first introduced its nasal spray influenza vaccine
in 2003.

Engineered antibodies
---------------------
A researcher from Crucell, a Dutch biotechnology company, reported at the
Bangkok International Avian Flu Conference that engineered human monoclonal
antibodies to the H5N1 virus protected mice from several strains of the
virus, according to a Reuters report. Crucell created the human antibodies
by mixing antibody fragments taken from 9 blood donors with antigens from 2
H5N1 strains found in Viet Nam and Indonesia.
Mark Throsby, project director for antibody discovery at Crucell, told the
conference that in vitro studies showed that one line [clone?] of the
engineered antibodies neutralized several strains of the H5N1 virus,
including strains isolated in Hong Kong in 1997, Indonesia in 2005, and
Viet Nam in 2003.
In the animal studies, he said, researchers injected the engineered
antibodies into mice that had been given normally lethal doses of H5N1
virus 3 days earlier. "We were able to protect all the animals," Throsby
was quoted as saying. "It reduced their disease and they became well again."

[These reports record interesting new developments in research towards
development of responses to the threat of a human pandemic of H5N1
influenza. The development of an engineered (humanised?) monoclonal
antibody with cross-neutralising activity against a range of strains of
avian influenza virus is an encouraging result. Transition from animal
studies to humans has yet to be undertaken, but the prospects look good for
development of an effective therapeutic agent.
Confirmation of an enhancing role of prior vaccination with seasonal
influenza vaccine has been supported by animal experimentation. It is
difficult at present to evaluate the potential extent of this protection.
Previous influenza pandemics have involved populations with natural immune
responses to seasonal epidemic influenza virus strains. Nonetheless,
vaccination with seasonal influenza virus vaccine is unlikely to be
detrimental and should be encouraged for other reasons. - Mod.CP]
