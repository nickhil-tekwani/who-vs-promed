[It is now 15 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's [Sat 18 Apr 2020] report, there are 7 new reports of locally transmitted infection, 6 in Heilongjiang and one in Guangdong. It has now been 25 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 14 days or so.

According to the report above, a total of 82 735 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4632 deaths, representing an increase of 16 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (17 Apr 2020) report, and there were no newly reported deaths. Two new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to be reported daily but are decreasing. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases and 3 new cases reported from Taiwan.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 44 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 3 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 999, 186 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concern are the imported cases returning to China.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 175 925 cases, including 22 745 deaths, up from 168 941 cases and 22 170 deaths reported on 16 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 16 and 17 Apr 2020 was 3491 newly confirmed cases, compared with 3786 newly confirmed cases between 15 Apr 2020 and 16 Apr 2020, an apparent increase that may be related to decreased reporting over Easter [10-13 Apr 2020]. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy (65 381), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (22 184), Veneto (15 692), and Piedmont (20 461). These 4 provinces combined account for 70.3% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Emilia-Romagna with 18.9% of the newly confirmed cases reported is seeing more than Piedmont (10.0%), and Veneto (9.1%). Lombardy is still the main contributor representing 35.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details).

New York state, with 241 041 (32.6%) cumulative case reports and 7090 (24.6%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing.

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (2953 newly confirmed cases 10.3%), Massachusetts (1970 newly confirmed cases 6.8%), and Pennsylvania (1810 newly confirmed cases 6.3%), Illinois (1585 newly confirmed cases 5.5%), California (1543 newly confirmed cases 5.4%), Ohio (1115 newly confirmed cases 3.8%), Texas (919 newly confirmed cases 3.2%) and Michigan (768 newly confirmed cases 2.6%).

[Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Unfortunately, the apparent major decline in daily reported cases is not holding up, with 5252 newly confirmed cases reported today (17 Apr 2020) and 4978 cases reported yesterday (15 Apr 2020), returning to the plateau levels of 4000-5000 cases newly confirmed each day.

As of today [17 Apr 2020], totals of 188 068 cases and 19 130 deaths have been reported, up from 177 633 cases and 19 478 18 579 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (16 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 149.61, slowly decreasing over the past 9 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 149.61 today [16 Apr 2020]. Spain has the highest case count in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 188 068 cases, approximately 61 377 (32.6%) have been hospitalized and 5152 (2.74%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data. Table 3 at the source URL shows the weekly evolution of daily increases in newly confirmed cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths from mid-March (2020) to this current week (week of 13 Apr 2020).

La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country, the most affected communities by population-based rates, are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain, and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.UBA]
