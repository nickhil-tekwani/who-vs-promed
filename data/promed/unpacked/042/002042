The Bureau of Land Management [BLM] says 25 wild burros [wild donkeys] that died in an off-range corral in Axtell appear to have contracted a rare virus. The deaths occurred after 236 wild burros were gathered last April and May [2016] from the Sinbad Herd Management Area, which is about 30 miles west of Green River, and brought to Axtell. "Soon after being captured and held in captivity, an increased mortality began to occur from unknown causes," a BLM report says. "By the end of June [2016], a total of about 25 animals had died from a variety of causes."

After exhaustive work, the Utah State Animal Diagnostic Lab and Utah State veterinarian determined that the deaths were related to a chronic viral pneumonia characterized by pulmonary fibrosis (a lung disease that can result in lung scarring, interfering with an animal's ability to breathe), the BLM report says. The BLM suspected a viral cause of mortality in the animals, the report says, but tests for the common equine herpes virus Types 1 and 4 were negative, as was testing for equine influenza.

However, the BLM report said, an uncommon asinine herpes virus has been tentatively identified. Additional tests are being done to try to identify the specific asinine herpes virus involved. "We are still waiting on some DNA testing results," Gus Warr, BLM-Utah's wild horse and burro program manager, said.

No deaths have occurred in the Sinbad burros since early July 2016, and all appear to be healthy. According to Warr, in coordination with the Utah State veterinarian, the Axtell facility has been cleared for adoption and shipping of healthy burros.

[Sanpete county is right in the middle of Utah; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/utah_90.jpg, between the "T" and the "A". For Axtell, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/UT/Axtell.html.

There are few reports of asinine herpes virus infections. See the following index report by SB Kleiboeker and colleagues: Association of two newly recognized herpesviruses with interstitial pneumonia in donkeys (_Equus asinus_). Journal of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation 2002; 14(4): 273-280. doi: 10.1177/104063870201400401 http://vdi.sagepub.com/content/14/4/273.

Abstract
--------
"Over a period of 6 years, antemortem and postmortem examinations were performed on a number of donkeys suffering from respiratory disease. For many cases, initial diagnostic efforts failed to identify an etiology consistent with the pathologic findings. However, retrospective examination of these cases using consensus primer polymerase chain reaction, designed to recognize herpesviruses from all 3 subfamilies of the Herpesviridae, amplified a fragment of the highly conserved herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene from a number of these animals. Two novel herpesviruses, herein designated asinine herpesvirus 4 (AHV4) and asinine herpesvirus 5 (AHV5), were consistently detected in lung tissue from donkeys in which the histopathology was characterized by interstitial pneumonia and marked syncytial cell formation but not in lung tissue from donkeys with evidence of bacterial or verminous pneumonia. Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis place these new viruses within the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily and indicate that they are most closely related to the recently identified zebra herpesvirus and wildass herpesvirus as well as equine herpesviruses 2 and 5."

We look forward to hearing what our Utah colleagues discover. - Mod.MHJ
