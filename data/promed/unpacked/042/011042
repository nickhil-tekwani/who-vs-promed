The weekly number of cases of cholera continues to increase bringing the
total to 1664 cases and 62 deaths (case fatality rate 3.7%) reported since
the second week of August up to 7 November. These cases were reported from
Maputo City as well as in other areas of Maputo Province. Forty-seven
suspect cases (10 confirmed) were also registered in Gaza Province during
the week 7 to 13 November where a team from the Ministry of Health and WHO
visited on 13 November. All cases were in the capital of the province,
Xai-Xai City, and 57% were from one quarter relying on drinking water from
the Limpopo river. A cholera ward has been established at the provincial
hospital and a special tent has been set up in the most affected area to
ensure early ORT of patients.
The Ministry of Health, WHO and Médecins Sans Frontières have discussed the
situation and strategies to meet the continuing increase which is occurring
in spite of control activities such as health education and improvement of
sanitation and water supply. The poor condition of sanitation and water
supply in other cities is increasing the risk of spread to other provinces
of the country. The circulating strain of _Vibrio cholerae_ is resistant
to common antibiotics available in the country and therapy therefore
centres on initial administration of intravenous fluids initially followed
by ORT.
The Ministry of Health is appealing to MSF for staff and equipment to
support medical assistance for cholera patients in Maputo City and Province
and is requesting WHO support for material and funds for therapy and health
education during the coming six months.

The Health Minister of Mozambique has been reported as saying that the
cholera in the current outbreak is more dangerous than the strain in the
1992 epidemic: dehydration is developing in 6 hours rather than the 24
hours of the previous outbreak.
Sub-standard food markets in Maputo are being closed in a crack-down that
began yesterday (18 Nov). According to one report, the health minister has
urged media representatives and others to move upland, out of the city
until the outbreak is over.
