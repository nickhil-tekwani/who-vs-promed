African horse sickness is a devastating disease of horses and mules,
with donkeys and zebras being relatively resistant. Clinically, both
respiratory and circulatory systems can be affected with the striking
finding of edema in many places, noticeably in the fascial planes and
ligamentum nuchae upon necropsy. Sometimes a marked swelling of the
supraorbital fossa occurs. Affected animals literally drown in the
accumulated fluid in the respiratory tract while in other forms there
is cardiac failure.

Most of the times, disease is seen and Southern Africa but there have
been occurrences back to the 1970s as indicated by Wole Tomori in an
earlier Nigerian incident (see ProMED-mail African horse sickness -
Nigeria: serotype 2 (02) 20070308.0815). In Ethiopia, over 2000
horses were lost to this disease (see the postings listed below. - Mod.PC]
