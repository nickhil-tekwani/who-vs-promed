RHODOCOCCUS EQUI, FOWL - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

During May and June 1997 a new disease appeared in fowl with fatal
consequences in two birds. The clinical signs were: high fever, pneumonia,
arthritis. & the post-mortem examination revealed necrotic areas in lungs.
Laboratory identification showed that the strains isolated from lung
material of dead fowl in two different farms of this country corresponded
to _Rhodococcus equi_.
Treatment with rifampicin and erythromycin for a long period permits the
recovery of affected equines.
