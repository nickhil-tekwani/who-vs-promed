Ministry of Agriculture officials began the cull in the Putford area of
Devon in the first of a series of trials to see whether removing badgers
can reduce the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle. It is envisaged that up
to 20,000 badgers will be killed in the next four years to compare the
effect on the incidence of bovine TB with the situation in areas where
there is no culling. A report by John Krebs, Royal Society Research
Professor in the Zoology Department of Oxford University, found
circumstantial evidence of a link between badgers and the spread of bovine
TB.
The ministry said that it had no plans to suspend the cull despite the
request from the Standing Committee of the Berne Convention. The committee
also urged the Government to explain why the cull would not be in breach of
the treaty, to refrain from using traps and to look at other means of
controlling cattle TB.

they regard as being a result of their badgers being infected. - Mod.MHJ
