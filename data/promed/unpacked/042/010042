The Christian and Missionary Alliance Lei Tung Nursery School has
been advised by the Department of Health's Centre for Health
Protection (CHP) to suspend classes from tomorrow (24 May 2011) for 2
weeks until 6 Jun 2011, following an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD) affecting 5 pupils. Four boys and one girl, aged 3 to
4, developed symptoms of HFMD since 13 May 2011. All of them sought
medical treatment. No hospitalisation was required. They are now in
stable condition.

The stool samples of 2 affected students tested positive for
enterovirus 71 (EV71). The school management has stepped up infection
control measures according to the CHP's advice following their visit
on 19 May 2011.

As 2 more pupils were today (Mon 23 May 2011) reported to be affected
with HFMD, the school was advised to suspend classes for thorough
disinfection and to interrupt virus transmission.

There have been 19 EV71 cases so far this year [2011]. There were 101
EV71 cases in 2010 and 31 EV71 cases in 2009.

A CHP spokesman reminded the public to maintain strict personal and
environmental hygiene during HFMD outbreaks and to adopt the following
preventive measures:

- Maintain good indoor air circulation;
- Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet, handling
diapers or other stool-soiled materials;
- Keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially;
- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing;
- Clean and disinfect contaminated areas or items such as toys
promptly and thoroughly with diluted household bleach (by adding one
part of household bleach containing 5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite
to 49 parts of water);
- Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their
fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and
crusted; and
- Avoid going to overcrowded places.

[Individual cases and outbreaks of HFMD occur worldwide. In temperate
climates, cases occur more often in summer and early autumn. HFMD
caused by coxsackievirus A16 infection is generally a mild disease,
with nearly all patients recovering in 7 to 10 days without medical
treatment.

Since 1997, however, outbreaks of HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 have
been reported in Asia and Australia. HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 has
shown a higher incidence of neurologic involvement, and fatal cases of
encephalitis have occurred during outbreaks. However, such serious
outcomes are still very rare.

HFMD infection is spread from person to person by direct contact.
Infectious virus is found in the nose and throat secretions, saliva,
blister fluid and stool of infected persons. The virus is most often
spread by persons with unwashed, virus-contaminated hands and by
contact with virus-contaminated surfaces. Infected persons are most
contagious during the 1st week of the illness, but may remain a source
of infection for others after symptoms have resolved. Complications
from virus infections that cause HFMD are uncommon; "aseptic"
meningitis can occur rarely with HFMD, causing fever, headache, stiff
neck, or back pain. Some patients may require hospitalization for a
short time. Other more serious conditions, such as encephalitis, are
very rare although encephalitis can be fatal.
