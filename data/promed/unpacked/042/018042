Measles cases in England and Wales: update to end-April 2012
-------------------------------------
The number of laboratory confirmed cases of measles with onset dates to the end of April 2012 has reached 447, exceeding the 367 cases for the same period in 2011. Half of all cases in England and Wales with onset in April were part of the North West region outbreak which began in February [2012] and has predominately affected children under 5 years of age. An outbreak in North Wales, that also began in February, is continuing although spread into the local community is more limited with only 12 new cases confirmed in April. The South East was the only region to report more cases in April than March; 44 cases were linked to the on-going outbreak that began last September. Measles is beginning to re-emerge in regions where there were no cases previously or very small numbers with clusters reported from the East of England, the West Midlands and London.

Across Europe, 2012 data on measles from the 29 EU and EEA countries is available to the end of March; 2283 cases were reported for this period of which 56 percent were identified in Romania. In addition, a large outbreak is on-going in the Ukraine where between [1 Jan 2012 and 10 May 2012] 9173 cases have been reported. There have been vaccine shortages in the Ukraine since 2010 and more than one million children are unvaccinated therefore the epidemic is expected to accelerate and spread geographically during the measles peak transmission season from February to June.

The European Football Championship will be jointly hosted by Ukraine and Poland in June 2012 and visitors to the event are encouraged to ensure they are fully vaccinated.

MMR jab advice following Merseyside measles outbreak
---------------------------------
Health experts across Lancashire are urging parents of children and young people under 16 years of age: "don't hesitate: vaccinate" in a bid to avoid a measles outbreak in the county. There is currently a large outbreak of measles in the Merseyside region with 260 confirmed cases. Health experts in Lancashire are concerned for the safety and long term health of children who have not been protected if they have not received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. Experts say it's not too late to get protected.

Dr Ken Lamden, on behalf of the Lancashire Measles Outbreak Prevention Group, said: "Measles is highly infectious so we must all do everything possible to prevent the spread of it, particularly with an outbreak on our doorstep. The risk of an increase in cases in Lancashire is high, and the MMR vaccination is the only way to prevent measles. If parents haven't arranged for their children to be vaccinated - it's not too late to have the jab. Parents don't realise that measles is not just a case of a few spots - it can be a very serious illness. Symptoms include fever, cough, soreness of the eyes and a rash which spreads rapidly over the body. Serious complications affect one in 15 children. These include chest infections, fits, encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and brain damage. In very serious cases, measles can kill.

"The best protection against measles is the MMR vaccination. With the help of Lancashire County Council, we have written to schools in the county, as well as to every GP to ask them to help us encourage parents with children under 16 years of age to check if they have had the MMR injection or not, and if in any doubt at all to contact their GP practice to arrange an appointment to have the jab. There is a high risk of a measles outbreak on our doorstep because of the outbreak in Merseyside. It is very important that parents in Lancashire don't hesitate -- and take steps to make sure their children are vaccinated with the MMR vaccine. When children have received the MMR vaccine, it not only protects them from measles, mumps and rubella, but because they are vaccinated, it protects others too. The more children who have the MMR vaccine - the better for everyone."

The 1st dose of MMR vaccination is usually given at the age of 12 months and the second dose given before school entry around 3 years 4 months of age (sometimes known as the pre-school booster). For children and young people who have not had the recommended doses, parents should contact their GP practice to arrange an appointment for their child to receive any outstanding doses of MMR vaccine as quickly as possible.

The Ministry of Health this weekend [week ending 27 May 2012] is preparing to launch a mass immunisation campaign to combat an outbreak of measles which has spread from 18 to 46 districts. As of 30 Apr 2012, data from the Health Ministry showed that about 3270 children between 4 and 14 years had been recorded as suffering from measles in 18 districts.

But Ms Nakamatte has told Daily Monitor that: "To-date, 46 districts including Kampala, Namayingo, Jinja, Busia, Bugiri, Nebbi, Sheema, Wakiso, Iganga, Luuka, Lwengo, Masaka, Mayuge, Buikwe, Mityana, Koboko, Mitooma, Mbale, Bukomansimbi, Bukwo, Butaleja, Buvuma, Gulu, Kalungu, Kiryandongo, Kole, Mbarara, Namutumba, Rakai, Sironko, Buliisa, Buyende, Kalagala, Kamuli, Kanungu, Kiruhura, Luweero, Yumbe, Nakaseke, Ibanda, Kibaale, Kayunga, Bushenyi, Kyankwanzi, Budaka and Mukono have surpassed the measles epidemic threshold. We have not confirmed any deaths, but our data show an increase in new cases, with 630 measles cases recorded in May 2012 alone," she said.

The Ministry of Health says at least 42 per cent of measles cases are not vaccinated, with nearly all suspect cases in children below 9 months not vaccinated for measles, which has prompted an additional nationwide mass measles campaign that will be conducted from 26-28 May [2012].

Ms Catherine Ntabadde, the Uganda Red Cross Society spokesperson, said the exercise would target more than one million children in 14 districts that have been identified as the most affected by both polio and measles. These include Kampala, Hoima, Nebbi, Pallisa, Tororo, Jinja, Mbarara, among others.

Measles outbreak hits national service camp of students in northern Sudan
---------------------------------------------------------------
KHARTOUM: Nearly 40 students undergoing military training as part of mandatory national service in Sudan's northern state of Nile River have been quarantined after they contracted measles.

The measles outbreak started two days ago at the 49th Brigade camp of national service in the key town of Atbara, raising fears of further infections as well as concerns over health conditions in other camps. Rabi Ali Mohammed, the coordinator of national service in the state, , said that more than 30 students are suspected to have contracted measles and were therefore quarantined at Atbara Educational Hospital for further medical examination.

The national service administration in Sudan requires male students who sat for secondary schools exams to undergo arduous military training at camps in order to be able to join universities and qualify for future employment opportunities. Secondary school students are also required to wear military uniform during three years of study.

Students often complain of experiencing difficulties in the training as it takes place under unfavorable conditions and high temperature during the summer while parents tend to fret that their sons are too young to cope with military training. However, the national service official Rabie said that health conditions at the three camps in Atbara and Shendi, another key town in the state, were "under control."

Meanwhile, an official at the local ministry of health said that 37 cases of measles infections were reported to Atbara Hospital. He denied there were any death cases and described the situation of those infected as "stable". He further added that all student conscripts at the camp had been vaccinated.

Measles outbreak in Fata
---------------------
This concerns a measles outbreak in Fata, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan [20 May 2012]. The measles outbreak in Fata, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan is no doubt a matter of great concern. According to media reports, it has so far killed 12 children and the virus is set to affect more children in the region.

This is to inform the public that the ministry of inter-provincial coordination has recently held a meeting of National Steering Committee in which this matter has been taken up with great concern by the Federal Minister for inter-provincial coordination Mir Hazar Khan Bijarani. The Federal Minister, who is on an official visit to Geneva to attend the 65th World Health Assembly organised by WHO, has directed the officials of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) to enhance routine immunisation and make prolific efforts to tackle measles outbreak in the country.

In response to the report of 'loopholes' in the vaccination campaign, there is no such loophole in the campaign. The campaign is faced with several obstacles. Actually, the region where the measles outbreak has been reported is a war-torn area. The ongoing fight in the region has been constantly hindering the vaccination campaign. In addition, power outages and curfews are making it more difficult to carry out vaccination. Besides, there seems to be a campaign going on through private radio to spread misconception about the vaccination that the international community is injecting infidelity in the children of the tribal areas in the name of vaccination.

As regards the serious differences between the federal government and the provincial ones over the purchase of vaccines for measles and other diseases, the provinces are at absolute liberty to purchase vaccines for the above mentioned diseases. Lastly, the question of maintenance of cold chain for vaccines does not arise as ice-lined refrigerators are available in the nearby headquarters.

Karachi at risk from measles outbreak
----------------------------
Karachi is presently exposed to a mini outbreak of measles with 20 to 25 children brought with the disease to Civil Hospital only, on daily basis, Prof. Ayesha Mehnaz, head of paediatrics department told APP [Associated Press Pakistan] on Monday [21 May 2012]. "Situation is no different in other hospitals," said the doctor, who is also a senior member of Pakistan Paediatric Association. In reply to a question, she agreed that a mini-epidemic of measles is registered every 3rd year in the city. "However, what is different this year is the time as measles, a viral infection reported during winters, is presently registered in summers," said Prof. Ayesha Mehnaz.

Measles is not only an acute illness that causes death and complication but also holds its long term impact as post measles diarrhoea, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, encephalitis, reactivation of tuberculosis and blindness due to vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition. Although cough, pneumonia and malnutrition are the common manifestations of the disease children inflicted with measles are generally not brought to hospitals as it is conventionally accepted that no medication is required for the disease and every child had to suffer from it sooner or later. It is only if and when the children suffering from measles develop complications that hospitals are approached, said senior child specialist Dr. Mobina Agboatwala.

Prof. Ayesha attributed the current outbreak of measles to poor routine immunization coverage in the country. Dr. Agboatwala did agree with her colleague, however, suggested that in case incidence rate of measles, owing to any reason may found to be high, the government must initiate "Mopping Up Exercise". Under this strategy all children belonging to neighbouring areas of the sites, where cases of measles were detected, be immediately vaccinated against the ailment. Those from the affected areas will get afflicted at one or the other point of time and there should be adequate provision for administering Vitamin A capsules to them, reverting risks of their getting partially or even totally blind besides death.

The doctors in response to another query did acknowledge that chickenpox and skin allergies were also somehow wrongly but quite frequently inferred as measles. Measles vaccines are prerequisite for all children around the world, at least once in a life time. Vaccination of our children against measles is all the more important as our country is endemic to it, they said. Since the peak season as a norm begins from January, parents must be persuaded to ensure that all children upto five years of age are immunized against the disease. "I also strongly recommend IgM (antibodies) assessment of all suspected cases of the disease," said Dr.Agboatwala.

Measles outbreak alert issued by Ministry of Health
------------------------------
The Ministry of Health issued an alert yesterday concerning detection of a possible case of measles that affects one woman in the city of Buenos Aires who had traveled to Europe and returned with symptoms of the disease. So far no indigenous cases have been recorded in the Argentina since 2000.

The Health Minister said in a statement that the national alert system was alerted on Thursday night and said the suspected case is now the focus of efforts to contain the disease. The woman, 35, has no record of vaccination against measles, said the Ministry. She had traveled to Europe in the last 4 weeks and re-entered the country with symptoms consistent with the disease.

He explained that as in Argentina had not recorded indigenous measles virus circulation for 12 years, and consequently the emergence of a single case is considered an outbreak. Control measures against measles involve the reporting of cases to health authorities, adult and child isolation, and strict compliance with respiratory isolation in hospitals. Carla Vizzotti, the head of the National Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Control at the Ministry of Health, said the risk of introduction of this disease into our country is high as measles virus is currently circulating widely in Europe, South-east Asia, the eastern Pacific and Africa. '

In the Americas, however, the disease is in the process of elimination, the specialist reported. The last cases of measles were detected in the country last August [2011] when 2 people who had traveled to South Africa contracted the disease and infected their families on return to the country.
