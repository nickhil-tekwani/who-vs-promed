Border row could aid spread of drug-resistant malaria
-----------------------------------------------------
Health officials warn that an ongoing border dispute and subsequent
military build-up along the Thai-Cambodian frontier could undermine
global efforts to contain drug-resistant malaria, citing limited
access for surveillance, early diagnosis, and treatment.

"I hope the critical importance of a global health emergency takes
precedence over a political conflict," Robert Newman, director of the
Global Malaria Programme for the World Health Organization (WHO), told
IRIN.

His comments follow a 3-day visit to what WHO calls the epicentre of
the public health emergency: the former Khmer Rouge stronghold of
Pailin on the Thai-Cambodian border.

Health officials are concerned that along this forested and
mountainous border the parasite that causes malaria is increasingly
becoming resistant to the most effective drug they have for treating
it, artemisinin.

They are most concerned that the parasite might become completely
resistant to the drug, and that this drug resistant parasite could
reach Africa.

In January [2011], WHO launched a USD 175 million global containment
plan, in partnership with Roll Back Malaria.

Worries about drug-resistant malaria reaching Africa "wake me up in
the middle of the night," Newman said. A failure of current
containment efforts had the potential to be "a public health
disaster," he added.

Recent tests had found that in some villages it was taking twice as
long for the drug to clear the parasite from an infected patient, and
that in some clusters more than one third of those infected were
showing resistance to the drug. The drug resistance was first detected
in 2009.

"We need to stop it in its tracks," Newman warned.

Cambodian warning
-----------------
His comments follow a similar warning on [1 Feb 2011] from Doung
Socheat, the director of the National Center for Parasitology,
Entomology and Malaria that the containment effort could be hampered
by the border dispute.

After noting correlations between rises in the number of malaria
cases along both sides of the border as the conflict escalated over
the past 3 years, Socheat said the containment effort could be delayed
if conflict flared again. The situation was too unpredictable to
provide a timeframe, he said.

Socheat also said he had no direct access to data on the incidence of
malaria among Cambodian soldiers, as the military operates its own
health system, which reports to the Ministry of Defence.

Some health data, primarily reports on fatalities and injuries, is
reported to the Ministry of Health.

Epicentre
---------
WHO is working closely with the Thai Ministry of Health as well as
their Cambodian counterparts, but public health sources in both
countries say they are concerned their respective militaries are
reluctant to share medical data due to perceived security concerns.

The 1st phase of the containment project has received USD 22.5
million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is focused on
the area of the border believed to be the epicentre of drug resistant
malaria, and first detected in 2009.

This area encompasses Pailin and several districts of Battambang,
Pursat, and Banteay Meanchay provinces in western Cambodia, as well as
districts on the Thai side of the border.

A section of Kampot Province near Cambodia's Vietnamese border is
also included.

Temple
------
The majority of troops from both countries are believed to be
stationed on each side of the disputed ruins of the Preah Vihear
temple along the border.

Both sides have, however, placed reinforcements at other sites along
the 800 km [497 mi] frontier.

In 2008 Cambodia applied to the UN Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to have the temple -- to which both
countries lay claim -- declared a World Heritage Site. The application
was backed by the Thai government at the time, but was sharply opposed
by those who said it threatened Thailand's sovereignty. Since then,
strong nationalist sentiment continues, and there have been sporadic
exchanges of fire in areas around the disputed site.

According to WHO, about 3.3 billion people -- half the world's
population -- are at risk of malaria. Every year, this leads to about
250 million malaria cases and nearly one million deaths.

by IRIN, but so far it is only speculative and hopefully the present
tension will be short lasting. - Mod.EP]
