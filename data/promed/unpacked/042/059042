According to a 25 Aug 2008 statement from the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services (DOACS), a horse on a 2nd property has
tested positive for equine piroplasmosis.

Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services commissioner Charles H Bronson
announced on 15 Aug 2008 that a horse in Manatee County, FL had been
diagnosed with equine piroplasmosis, an animal disease of which the United
States has been considered free since 1988. The affected horse was
euthanized, but since that time, 4 other horses on the original property
tested positive for the disease.

Several adjacent and contact premises linked to the original positive
property have also been investigated. Of the 30 additional horses tested
late last week, one horse from a contact premises tested positive, the
DOACS said in an official statement.

State officials are working with the USDA to continue the investigation.
This work includes identifying additional horses or premises that might
have been in contact with or associated with a positive horse or premises.
Representatives of the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Diseases Study are
assisting with tick surveillance on affected premises.

Equine piroplasmosis (EP) is a tickborne disease caused by 2 parasites,
_Babesia caballi_ and _ B. equi_. The parasites are able to hitch a ride on
certain ticks, in which they can amplify, thus creating the potential for
spread to horses. The parasites can also be spread via shared needles.
According to Mike Short, DVM, equine programs manager for the DOACS, it
seems most likely that the disease was passed on the original property via
shared needles and other management practices used there.

Piroplasmosis occurs through much of the world. Areas not considered
endemic include the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, England,
Iceland, and Ireland. Horses that get EP might have a fever, anemia,
jaundice, hemoglobinuria (the presence in urine of a protein normally found
in red blood cells), central nervous system disturbances, and they
sometimes die. But some infected horses are less severely affected and
might show few or no clinical signs. These horses have the potential to
carry the parasites for prolonged periods, during which they are potential
sources of infection.

To prevent EP from entering the country, the USDA currently tests all
imported horses for antibodies during quarantine. Horses with antibodies to
_B. caballi_ and/or _B. equi_ are not allowed entry into the United States.
The only current treatment is a potent type of chemotherapy that should
eliminate clinical signs of disease; however, it won't necessarily
eliminate the parasites from infected horses.

With the exception of the quarantined premises, there are no equine
movement restrictions in Florida or between Florida and other states. As of
21 Aug 2008, Canada has advised the United States Department of Agriculture
that they will not accept horses originating from Manatee County, effective
immediately. Horses entering Florida from countries with equine
piroplasmosis will continue to be tested prior to and following entry, in
accordance with the current rule.

Horse owners are asked to report any unusual clinical signs to their
veterinarians and to use commercially available topical tick repellent
products if their horse is in an area where ticks are a problem. Include an
avermectin product in your deworming program to provide systemic treatment
for ticks.

Horse owners are also reminded not to reuse needles among different animals
while administering any medications or vaccinations.
