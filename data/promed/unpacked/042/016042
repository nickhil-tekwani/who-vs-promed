Influenza activity - United States and worldwide, 2003-04 & US vaccine
composition 2004/2005
------------------------------------------------
During the 2003/2004 influenza season, influenza A (H1), A (H3N2), and B
viruses co-circulated worldwide, and influenza A (H3N2) viruses
predominated. Several Asian countries reported widespread outbreaks of
avian influenza A (H5N1) among poultry. In Viet Nam and Thailand, these
outbreaks were associated with severe illnesses and deaths among humans. In
the United States, the 2003/2004 influenza season began earlier than most
seasons, peaked in December, was moderately severe in terms of its impact
on mortality, and was associated predominantly with influenza A (H3N2) viruses.
This report summarizes information collected by World Health Organization
(WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System
(NREVSS) collaborating laboratories, state and local health departments,
health-care providers, vital statistics registries, and CDC.
United States
-------------
Influenza viruses were first isolated in Texas during outbreaks in early-
to mid-October. The national percentage of respiratory specimens testing
positive for influenza and the proportion of outpatient visits to sentinel
physicians for influenza-like illness (ILI) increased substantially in
November and peaked in mid-December. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses were most
commonly isolated, with a small number of influenza B and influenza A (H1)
viruses identified.
[The MMWR report, available in full at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5325a1.htm>, details
surveillance in the United States under the following headings: Viral
Surveillance, ILI Surveillance, State-Specific Activity Levels, Pneumonia-
and Influenza-Related Mortality, and Pediatric Mortality.
Worldwide
---------
During Oct 2003 to May 2004, influenza A viruses circulated widely.
Influenza activity began in Oct 2003, which was earlier than usual in North
America and Western Europe; the reported impact was more severe than the
previous 3 seasons. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated in most
countries, whereas influenza A (H1) and B viruses circulated at low levels
in most parts of the world.
Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and were associated with outbreaks
in Asia (Hong Kong and Japan), Europe (Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Norway, Portugal, Romania, the
Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the United
Kingdom), and North America (Canada). H3N2 viruses also were reported in
Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Madagascar, Morocco, and Senegal), Asia (China,
India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Viet Nam), the Caribbean (Jamaica), Europe
(Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Iceland,
Ireland, Kyrgyzstan, the Netherlands, Poland, Serbia and Montenegro,
Slovakia, and Turkey), Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Guyana, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay), North America (Mexico),
and Oceania (Australia, Guam, New Caledonia, and New Zealand). The majority
of H3N2 viruses were similar to the A/Fujian/411/2002 drift variant.
Influenza A (H1) viruses circulated at low levels in most parts of the
world, and outbreaks were reported in Europe (Iceland, Ukraine, and the
United Kingdom). Influenza A (H1N1) and (H1) viruses for which the
neuraminidase was not characterized were isolated in Africa (Morocco and
Senegal), Asia (China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and
Taiwan), Europe (Belarus, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, the
Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), Latin America (Brazil,
Chile, and Peru), and North America (Canada). Influenza A (H1N2) viruses
were isolated in Africa (Senegal), Europe (France, Iceland, Norway, and
Portugal), Latin America (Brazil, Chile, and Peru), and North America (Canada).
Influenza B viruses were not reported in association with outbreaks but
were isolated in Africa (Madagascar), Asia (China, Hong Kong, Japan,
Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand), the Caribbean
(Jamaica), Europe (Belarus, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hungary,
Ireland, Italy, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom), Latin America (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Panama,
Paraguay, and Peru), North America (Canada and Mexico), and Oceania
(Australia and Guam).
Human infections with avian influenza viruses
---------------------------------------------
In Dec 2003, one confirmed case of avian influenza A (H9N2) virus infection
was reported in a child aged 5 years in Hong Kong. The child had fever,
cough, and nasal discharge in late Nov 2003, was hospitalized for 2 days,
and fully recovered. The source of this child's H9N2 infection is unknown.
During Jan to Mar 2004, a total of 34 confirmed human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection were reported in Viet Nam and Thailand.
The cases were associated with severe respiratory illness requiring
hospital admission and a case-fatality rate of 68 per cent (Viet Nam: 22
cases, 15 deaths; Thailand: 12 cases, 8 deaths). A substantial proportion
of the cases were among children and young adults (aged 5 to 24 years).
These cases were associated with widespread outbreaks of highly pathogenic
H5N1 influenza among domestic poultry.
In Mar 2004, health authorities in Canada reported 2 confirmed cases of
avian influenza A (H7N3) virus infection in poultry workers who were
involved in culling of poultry during outbreaks of highly pathogenic H7N3
on farms in the Fraser River Valley, British Columbia. One patient had
unilateral conjunctivitis and nasal discharge, and the other had unilateral
conjunctivitis and headache. Both illnesses resolved without hospital
admission.
During the 2003/2004 influenza season, a case of avian influenza A (H7N2)
virus infection was detected in a man from New York, who was admitted to
hospital for upper and lower respiratory tract illness in Nov 2003.
Influenza A (H7N2) virus was isolated from a respiratory specimen from the
patient, whose acute symptoms resolved. The source of this person's
infection is unknown.
Composition of the influenza vaccine for the 2004/2005 season
-------------------------------------------------------------
On the basis of antigenic analyses of recently isolated influenza viruses,
epidemiologic data, and post-vaccination serologic studies in humans, the
Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products
Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) recommended that the 2004/2005 trivalent
influenza vaccine for the US should contain A/New Caledonia/20/99-like
(H1N1), A/Fujian/411/2002-like (H3N2), and B/Shanghai/361/2002-like viruses.
Because of the growth properties of the A/Wyoming/3/2003 and
B/Jiangsu/10/2003 viruses, US vaccine manufacturers are using these
antigenically equivalent strains in the vaccine as the H3N2 and B
components, respectively. The A/New Caledonia/20/99 virus will be retained
as the H1N1 component of the vaccine.

Control of Influenza. T Uyeki, MD, K Teates, MPH, L Brammer, MPH, A Klimov,

MMWR editorial note:
--------------------
During the 2003/04 influenza season, influenza activity in the US began and
peaked earlier than usual and was more severe than the previous 3 seasons.
Moreover, a substantial number of laboratory-confirmed,
influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported in the US. Because no
similar national data were collected previously, whether this number of
pediatric deaths represents a change from previous seasons is unknown. One
modeling study estimated that, during 1990 to 1999, about 92
influenza-related deaths occurred annually among children aged <5 years (2).
Beginning with the 2004/2005 influenza season, the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all children aged 6 to 23
months and close contacts of children aged 0 to 23 months receive annual
influenza vaccination (3). ACIP continues to recommend that all people
aged >6 months with certain chronic underlying medical conditions, their
household contacts, and health-care workers receive annual influenza
vaccination (3).
As the season progressed, A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2) viruses, which were
antigenically distinguishable from the vaccine strain A/Panama/2007/99
(H3N2), became predominant, resulting in a less than optimal match. An
initial study to assess the effectiveness of the 2003/2004 influenza
vaccine against ILI in health-care workers did not demonstrate
effectiveness (4); however, preliminary analyses of 3 additional
unpublished studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness among children and
adults in the US were presented at the ACIP meeting on 23 Jun 2004, and all
demonstrated vaccine effectiveness.
The season also was notable because several people were infected by avian
influenza viruses. The H7N2 case associated with an illness in Nov 2003 is
the 2nd confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N2)
virus reported in the United States. One previous case was reported in a
person involved in culling activities, when an outbreak of H7N2 occurred
among turkeys and chickens at commercial farms in Virginia during 2002 (5).
In both cases, no person-to-person transmission of H7N2 viruses was
evident, and both made a full recovery from their acute respiratory illnesses.
The H9N2 case identified in Hong Kong in Dec 2003 was the 1st confirmed
human case since 1998 and 1999, when H9N2 infections were identified in
China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, respectively. All H9N2
infections were associated with uncomplicated ILI, and no evidence of
person-to-person transmission of H9N2 viruses has been reported (6). The 2
confirmed cases of avian influenza A (H7N3) virus infections identified in
Canada are the first reported with this virus and were associated with an
outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N3 among poultry. Both cases were in
poultry workers with direct contact with H7N3-infected poultry; additional
information about these cases is available at
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_04_05/en>. These patients had mild
illness, were treated with oseltamivir [a neuraminidase inhibitor], and
fully recovered. No evidence of person-to-person transmission was identified.
The 34 confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in
Viet Nam and Thailand represent the largest human outbreak of H5N1. All
human cases were associated with an unprecedented, widespread, ongoing
epizootic of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus affecting domestic poultry at
large and small farms, live bird markets, and backyard farms in Asia. 8
Asian countries have reported H5N1 poultry outbreaks, and >100 million
domestic poultry have been culled; additional information is available at
<http://www.oie.int/downld/avian percent20influenza/a_ai-asia.htm>.
Confirmed human H5N1 cases had severe illness and high mortality. The
majority of cases occurred during Jan and Feb among children and young
adults who had direct contact with live, sick, or dead poultry (7,8).
Genetic analysis of some recent human H5N1 isolates from Viet Nam and
Thailand revealed that all genes were of avian origin, and the isolates
were resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, but susceptible to
oseltamivir. No evidence of efficient person-to-person transmission of H5N1
viruses has been identified to date.
During 1997, an outbreak of H5N1 resulted in 18 cases and 6 deaths in Hong
Kong, but human-to-human transmission was rare (9).
However, the degree to which H5N1 poultry outbreaks in Cambodia, China,
Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Viet Nam have been controlled is uncertain.
For this reason, CDC continues to recommend enhanced surveillance for
suspected H5N1 cases among travelers with severe unexplained respiratory
illness returning from H5N1-affected countries (additional information is
available at
<http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/han/archivesys/viewmsgv.asp?alertnum=00204>).

[One point of interest in this report is the United States' Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices decision to recommend vaccination
against influenza for all children aged 6 to 23 months, along with their
contacts. The report (ref 3 in the above list) presents data to show that
this age group is more likely to need hospital admission for influenza than
older children, but acknowledges the need for further data on the risk of
severe complications of influenza in children and the optimal strategies
for minimising severe illness and death in children. The cost-effectiveness
of this vaccination initiative, it says, also requires further study.
Another 2 needles for infants. It will be interesting to see what level of
uptake is achieved and whether other countries follow suit. - Mod.SH]
