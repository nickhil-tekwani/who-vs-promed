This posting quoting a news release includes a geographical error.
Kenema, characterized as a "northern coast town" is neither in the north,
nor is it on the coast. It is a district headquarters town in Sierra
Leone's south east interior; it is far from the coast.
My recollection is that is is further than 60 miles from the capital,
Freetown. Even if it is that close, it is a rigorous trip, taking the
better part of a day by
private vehicle, considerably longer by public transportation.
Is Lassa Fever not somewhat like Ebola in that people who have it are
unlikely to be well enough to travel?
[Correct, but -- there is an incubation phase during which they would be
well enough to travel, only to fall sick in another town - Mod.JW]
