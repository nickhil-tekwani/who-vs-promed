According to the newspaper El Nuevo Dia on line (7 August), the dengue
epidemic now involves 50 of the 78 municipios. The article also states
that 25,000 cases of dengue were reported during the 1994 epidemic and that
there have been more cases during the period June, July, and August of this
year than there had been during a similar period in 1994.
Despite efforts by ProMED-mail moderators to obtain information directly
from Puerto Rican authorities, none has been forthcoming. CDC, of course,
does not release disease information directly, unless local authorities do.
Essentially, we have been told that daily newspaper accounts contain all
the information.
