Three stables have been locked down, 2 more are on high alert, and part of Geelong's training facilities are closed after a [DL]-trained [horse] raced at The Valley on Sunday [12 Jul 2020] with strangles. But Racing Victoria (RV) stewards are confident there wasn't any race-day transmission of the highly infectious disease, which was only discovered by vets post-race after the horse was a well-beaten favourite. [DL] told Racing.com that [her horse] had a small abscess that would come and go, but she never thought it was strangles.

The horse was tested on Monday [13 Jul 2020], with the results returned on Wednesday [15 Jul 2020] afternoon revealing a low-level reading for the disease.

[DL's] stables are in lockdown with [her horse] moved to a property away from other horses, while Geelong trainers [SC] and [CC] have also been locked down because their horses have had close contact with [DL's horse]. They will be allowed to reopen after the mandatory 14-day quarantine period and once their horses have been tested and cleared of strangles. [DL], [SC], and [CC] are all now allowed to enter horses to race, and cannot move their horses without RV approval. An [SC]-trained [horse] and a [CC]-trained horse have been scratched [at] Geelong on Friday [17 Jul 2020].

Stewards have also informed [2 other trainers, who had] horses stabled next to [DL's horse] at The Valley on race day, to keep an eye out for strangles signs. Key parts of Geelong's training facility have been closed for cleaning on Thursday [16 Jul 2020], while the pool and sand roll will be closed indefinitely.

Friday's [17 Jul 2020] meeting at Geelong is not under threat, with the training area well away from the race-day stalls. "The stewards and vets have been to Geelong. There will be a stewards' report issued this morning," RV chairman of stewards Robert Cram said. "[DL's] stable has been quarantined, but racing will continue tomorrow. The horse travelled in its own float to Moonee Valley Racecourse.

"The 2 horses either side (at The Valley), we have located those horses and the stables, and they have been notified and are on alert to be observant with their horses to see if there's an increase in temperature or bacterial signs. It's very unlikely it was transferred at the racecourse, was the initial advice."

[DL] said her horse had shown no signs of strangles. "He's had like (what I thought was) a grass seed abscess, and it never bothered him, never had a temperature. It was sort of come and go," [DL] said. "The vet vetted him after the races and said he had a strangle abscess, which I didn't think it was. It's a low-grade positive. That means he hasn't spread it to the other ones. He hasn't had mucus or snort; he's shown nothing. You hear about it (strangles), but you never really think about it." [DL] said the rest of her stable had been tested on Wednesday [15 Jul 2020]. "Hopefully they are negative. Ten days after [her horse] has left the premises, then they can be tested, and if they are negative, then it's full steam ahead again," [DL] said.

["Strangles is caused by bacterial infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ (referred to as _S. equi_). The bacteria typically infect the upper airway and lymph nodes of the head and neck.

The hallmark clinical signs of infection are fever (temperature over 101.5 deg F [38.6 deg C]), nasal discharge, and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes (in the space between the lower jaw bones), which ultimately abscess. This is a highly contagious bacterial infection, generally treated by antibiotics and rest. Therefore, isolation of those barns is appropriate to contain the disease, as is close attention to the animal's temperature."
