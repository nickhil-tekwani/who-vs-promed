The recent die-off of so many seabirds is terribly sad and alarming.
The fact that so many of these seabirds seem to be of a species that
prefers cool/cold waters (Greater Shearwater) makes me wonder whether
this die-off has to do with too much heat. Do we know what the sea
temperatures are compared to other years or whether there have been
more days above the average temperature than normal? Cold-adapted
species may suffer to a greater degree from heat stress and changes
brought about by unusual heat. (For example, heat and unusually high
numbers of mosquitoes due to heat have caused unusual mortality in an
arctic seabird; see Gaston et al. 2002, Ibis 144: 185-191).
