[The 4th OIE situation report on SARS-CoV-2 and animals, published on 31 Aug 2021, is available at https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/09/sars-cov-2-situation-report-4.pdf. This report mentioned that "while the main driver of community and international spread in the current pandemic is human-to-human transmission, animal cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2, though still only occasional occurrences, continue to rise. Currently, 572 outbreaks in animals have been reported globally, affecting 12 species in 30 countries. Some countries have experienced a high prevalence of outbreaks in mink farms, and variant strains have now been identified in mustelids. As infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging disease, the OIE strongly encourages Members to report through WAHIS the occurrence of any cases in animals that comply with the case definition provided in the OIE guidelines."
