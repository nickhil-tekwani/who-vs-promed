98 Hong Kong diners sickened by seafood on holiday outing
---------------------------------------------------------
A holiday seafood meal on an outlying island of Hong Kong left 98 people
with food poisoning in what a news report described as the territory's
worst single outbreak. Department of Health spokeswoman Diana Kam said the
victims ate prawns and fish at a restaurant on scenic Cheung Chau island,
then came down with abdominal pains, diarrhea, and vomiting on Monday, a
public holiday marking the anniversary of Hong Kong's return from Britain
to China.
The South China Morning Post newspaper called it Hong Kong's biggest single
outbreak of food poisoning but Kam said she was not immediately able to
confirm that. The victims were all still in hospital on Thursday but [said
to be] in stable condition, Kam said. Authorities were still investigating.
Kam said the summer period from June to August is the peak season of food
poisoning in Hong Kong and last week 222 people were struck down in 34
outbreaks.

[Summer is the season for foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks. This is the
third report in almost as many days (see Philippines and Bahrain articles
listed below). The above article suggests prawns and fish as potential
vehicles, but does not mention possible accompaniments such as a
mayonnaise-based sauce. In addition, the incubation period is not
mentioned. One possible etiology of this outbreak (of which there are many)
is _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, often associated with raw or incompletely
cooked seafood. The article also mentions 34 outbreaks involving 222 cases
in the preceding week. This confirms that this is the season, but also
serves as a note of the efficiency of the disease surveillance system in
Hong Kong. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated as it
becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
