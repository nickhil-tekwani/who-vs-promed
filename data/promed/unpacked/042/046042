Citizens in the locality Umm Dwaina [Umm Duwaynah] in the Wilayah Alhasahisa [map at http://fallingrain.com/world/SU/38/Al_Hasahisa.html] have complained about the emergence of a disease that affected goats and sheep, causing the death of more than 50 heads recently. They claimed that the procrastination of the authorities finding effective solutions has led to panic among citizens as a result of what is happening.

A farmer (name withheld) told "AlJarida" newspaper that a veterinarian brought in a vaccine that exacerbated the disease. Then, the farmers applied to the regional authorities in Alhasahisa, where a sample had been received and sent [for diagnosis] to Suba [see comment]. No results have become available yet. Pointing to the death of more than 50 heads of goats and sheep in the village of Umm Dwaina, they ask the involvement of Al-Jazirah's governor, in order to reassure the citizens in the region.

[The information about the animal disease, which has reportedly been affecting goats and sheep with "more than 50" mortalities in the village Umm Dwaina, Aljazirah, is rather scarce. Details on the denominator (morbidity and mortality rates), clinical signs, gross pathology, etc will enable establishing a list for differential diagnosis. It would also be useful to know if and which other animal species are kept on the affected premises, remaining unaffected.

In view of the recent outbreak of Rift valley fever (RVF) in Sudan's north-eastern states Red Sea and River Nile (20191014.6726088), to which Khartoum was later added (item 1, 20191025.6745546), RVF deserves to be included among the diseases tested for in this event. The Aljazirah state borders south-east Khartoum (map at http://ontheworldmap.com/sudan/administrative-divisions-map-of-sudan.html). The panic mentioned in the media report, in the Wilayah Alhasahisa, could have been related to news about RVF. The media report, however, does not mention any human illness among those attending the affected sheep and goats.

According to the above media report, samples from the affected animals have been submitted to Sudan's Central Laboratory of veterinary research, Suba, Khartoum. The test results are anticipated soon.

The recent RVF event in Sudan started, reportedly, in Sep 2019 (OIE report of 13 Oct 2019, notifying RVF in goats in Red Sea State which had started 25 Sep 2019). Human cases have been reported since early October 2019. According to the latest available information, published 31 Oct 2019, the total number of human cases, as of 30 Oct 2019, has reached 248 (https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-situation-report-31-oct-2019-enar). - Mod.AS
