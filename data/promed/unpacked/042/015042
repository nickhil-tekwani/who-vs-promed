The Ministry of Health reported yesterday [1 Feb 2012] that in the last week flu cases have doubled over the previous week, with a rate of 198 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, representing an epidemic situation. A note from the department reported that it expects this epidemic to last for the next 3-4 weeks and to register a large number of cases of influenza, which at the moment especially affects children under 5. The Health department said the H3 [presumably the A/(H3N2) current seasonal strain] subtype is the only one that has been isolated from samples from patients, and indicates that this situation is similar to the rest of Spain.

To date 6 cases have been hospitalized with severe flu; 3 are under 5 years old and one of them had a risk factor for complications from influenza, but they are all discharged. The other 3 cases are adults with risk factors who remain hospitalized.

The Health department insists that vaccination is the most effective measure against the influenza and all people with risk factors for complications of influenza (65 and older, chronically ill, obese, pregnant women) should be vaccinated and persons who live with or are taking care of them. It recommends that on the appearance of flu symptoms (sudden onset with cough, fever, and malaise) you should see a health centre and strictly follow the treatment prescribed by your doctor while emergency services, especially hospitals, should be reserved for severe cases and thus avoid unnecessary over-loading, affecting the assistance "of those most in need."

[The Canary Islands is a Spanish archipelago located just off the northwest coast of mainland Africa, 100 km [60 mi] west of the border between Morocco and the Western Sahara. The Canary Islands are a Spanish autonomous community and an outermost region of the European Union. The islands include (from largest to smallest): Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro, La Graciosa, Alegranza, Isla de Lobos, Montana Clara, Roque del Este, and Roque del Oeste. The Canary Islands are legally recognized as a nationality of Spain. Geographically it is a part of the African Continent. The HealthMap interactive map of the Canary islands can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/1AYl.

The predominance of the A/(H3N2) influenza virus reflects the pattern observed in mainland Spain, and Western Europe in general at the present time. The current seasonal influenza vaccine should provide adequate protection for the local inhabitants and visitors from mainland Europe. - Mod.CP]
