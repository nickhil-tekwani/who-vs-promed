More Ebola haemorrhagic fever cases detected
--------------------------------------------
A total of 3 more people had by yesterday tested positive of the ebolavirus infection and were admitted to Kagadi Hospital, raising the number of confirmed cases to 13. Of these, 6 are still admitted, 3 have since died while 4 have recovered since the Ebola virus epidemic was declared.

The disease has so far claimed 16 lives inclusive of the 13 that died before the epidemic was officially declared. Health officials in Kibaale District said they had discharged 7 patients, 3 of whom are inmates who were admitted on suspicion of suffering from ebolavirus infection. "They have been given a resettlement package to help them re-unite with their families and live better lives," Mr Stephen Mfashingabo, the vice chairperson of the District Ebola Task Force, said. They are some of the 29 patients who tested negative of ebolavirus infection and are being released gradually from hospital. They are also accompanied by counsellors to re-unite them with their respective families.

Earlier on, Dr Dan Kyamanywa, the Kibaale District health officer, said those that had tested positive were already on treatment, while those that tested negative were being examined to ensure that they regain enough strength before they are discharged. "The 3 new patients that tested positive have been put on treatment and are being closely monitored. 29 suspected cases have tested negative and are currently being screened by our officials to see who is in good shape to go back home," Mr Kyamanywa said. He added that ebolavirus infection contacts had increased from 353 by Sunday to 398 yesterday with medics following up 295 cases.

However, Asuman Lukwago, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health, told the Daily Monitor that he was not aware of any new positive cases. "The information I have extends up to yesterday night (5 Aug 2012). There is no new case of ebolavirus infection. In case of any new cases, we shall officially communicate."
