Taiwan. 26 Jul 2019. (conf.) Since 1 Jan 2019, there have been 17 cases of chikungunya confirmed in Taiwan; 1 autochthonous and 16 imported. Of the 16 imported cases, 6 were from Myanmar, 4 from the Maldives, 2 from Indonesia, and 1 from each of the following countries: Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and India. The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control reports the 1st confirmed case of autochthonous chikungunya. This is a 20-some-year-old female with no history of traveling abroad. She began to have fever, joint pains, headache and rash on 21 Jul 2019. Clinicians reported dengue fever and measles, but laboratory examination excluded both, and found the patient to be infected by chikungunya [virus].

[2] Mosquito vector control
Date: Thu 25 Jul 2019
Source: PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases [edited]
https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007538


Citation: Sharp TM, Lorenzi O, Torres-Velasquez B, et al. Autocidal gravid ovitraps protect humans from chikungunya virus infection by reducing _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito populations. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007538


Abstract
---------
Background: Public health responses to outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus have been stymied by the inability to control the primary vector, _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitos. Consequently, the need for novel approaches to _Aedes_ vector control is urgent. Placement of 3 autocidal gravid ovitraps (AGO traps) in approximately 85% of homes in a community was previously shown to sustainably reduce the density of female _Ae. aegypti_ by more than 80%. Following the introduction of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to Puerto Rico, we conducted a seroprevalence survey to estimate the prevalence of CHIKV infection in communities with and without AGO traps and evaluate their effect on reducing CHIKV transmission.

Methods and findings: Multivariate models that calculated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) showed that among 175 and 152 residents of communities with and without AGO traps, respectively, an estimated 26.1% and 43.8% had been infected with CHIKV (aPR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.37-0.91). After stratification by time spent in their community, protection from CHIKV infection was strongest among residents who reported spending many or all weekly daytime hours in their community: 10.3% seropositive in communities with AGO traps vs 48.7% in communities without (PR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.11-0.41). The age-adjusted rate of fever with arthralgia attributable to CHIKV infection was 58% (95% CI: 46-66). The monthly number of CHIKV-infected mosquitos and symptomatic residents [was] diminished in communities with AGO traps compared to those without.

Conclusions: These findings indicate that AGO traps are an effective tool that protects humans from infection with a virus transmitted by _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitos. Future studies should evaluate their protective effectiveness in large, urban communities.

Author summary: _Aedes_ species mosquitos transmit pathogens of public health importance, including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. No tools exist to control these mosquitos that sustainably and effectively prevent human infections. Autocidal gravid ovitraps (AGO traps) have been shown to sustainably reduce _Aedes_ populations by more than 80%. After chikungunya virus was introduced into Puerto Rico, we conducted serosurveys in communities with and without AGO traps. We observed a 2-fold lower prevalence of chikungunya virus infection among residents of communities with AGO traps compared to communities without. Among infected residents of communities with traps, a significant proportion likely had been infected while outside their community. These findings indicate that AGO traps are an effective tool that protects humans from infection with pathogens transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitos.

[This approach to vector mosquito control is very promising, more environmentally friendly and of longer duration than fogging with insecticides. Presumably, these AGO traps can be produced commercially. One hopes that they will be sufficiently inexpensive so that individuals and vector control agencies can afford them. - Mod.TY]

[3] Chronic joint pain

Citation: Tritsch SR, Encinales L, Pacheco N, et al. Chronic joint pain 3 years after chikungunya virus infection largely characterized by relapsing-remitting symptoms. https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.190162


Abstract
---------
Objective: To determine the frequency of chronic joint pain and stiffness 3 years after infection with chikungunya virus in a Latin American cohort.

Methods: A cross-sectional follow-up of 120 patients from an initial cohort of 500 patients who reported joint pain 2 years after infection from the Atlantico Department, Colombia. Patients were clinically diagnosed as having chikungunya virus during the 2014-2015 epidemic, and baseline and follow-up symptoms at 40 months were evaluated in serologically confirmed cases.

Results: Of the initial 500 patients enrolled in the study, 482 had serologically confirmed chikungunya infection. From this group, 123 patients reported joint pain 20 months after infection, and 54% of those patients reported continued joint pain 40 months after infection. Therefore, 1 out of every 8 people who tested serologically positive for chikungunya infection had persistent joint pain 3 years after infection. Participants that followed up in-person were predominantly adult (mean plus/minus SD age 51 plus/minus 14 years) and female (86%). The most common type of pain reported in these patients at 40 months post-infection was pain with periods of relief and subsequent reoccurrence, and over 75% reported stiffness after immobility, with 39% experiencing morning stiffness.

Conclusion: This is the 1st report to describe persistent joint pain and stiffness 40 months after viral infection. The high frequency of chronic disease highlights the need to develop prevention and treatment methods. Further studies should be conducted to understand the similarities between post-chikungunya joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis.

[Although there are many anecdotal reports of chronic joint pain lasting for years following chikungunya virus infections, the above study quantifies that persistence in a cohort of individuals following their infections. Clinicians attending patients with persistent arthralgia should take a travel history to determine if these patients had visited or resided in chikungunya virus-endemic areas, and if they have, laboratory confirmation of chikungunya virus infection is needed. - Mod.TY]
