[3] South Korea: positive PCR after recovery due to dead viral particles
Date: Wed 29 Apr 2020 17:40 KST
Source: The Korea Herald [abridged, edited]
http://m.koreaherald.com/amp/view.php?ud=20200429000724&__twitter_impression=true


South Korea's infectious disease experts said on Thursday [23 Apr 2020] that dead virus fragments were the likely cause of over 260 people here testing positive again for the novel coronavirus days and even weeks after marking full recoveries. Oh Myoung-don, who leads the central clinical committee for emerging disease control, said the committee members found little reason to believe that those cases could be COVID-19 reinfections or reactivations, which would have made global efforts to contain the virus much more daunting.

"The tests detected the ribonucleic acid of the dead virus," said Oh, a Seoul National University hospital doctor, at a press conference Thursday [23 Apr 2020] held at the National Medical Center. He went on to explain that in PCR tests, or polymerase chain reaction tests, used for COVID-19 diagnosis, genetic materials of the virus amplify during testing, whether it is from a live virus or just from fragments of dead virus cells that can take months to clear from recovered patients. The PCR tests cannot distinguish whether the virus is alive or dead, he added, and this can lead to false positives.

"PCR testing that amplifies genetics of the virus is used in Korea to test COVID-19, and relapse cases are due to technical limits of the PCR testing." As of Sunday [26 Apr 2020], 263 people in Korea tested positive for the disease again after being declared virus-free, of which 17 were minors or teens, the National Medical Center said. "The respiratory epithelial cell has a half-life of up to 3 months, and RNA virus in the cell can be detected with PCR testing 1 to 2 months after the elimination of the cell," Oh said.

The committee's findings confirmed an earlier assessment from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that repeat patients appear to have little or no contagiousness. The KCDC cited results of virus culture tests that all failed to find live virus in recovered patients.

The committee ruled out reactivation of COVID-19 as a reason for relapses and said there was little to no possibility that reinfections would occur due to antibodies that patients develop. "The process in which COVID-19 produces a new virus takes place only in host cells and does not infiltrate the nucleus. This means it does not cause chronic infection or recurrence," Oh said.

[While we have all been saying this, this is the 1st time I have come across evidence of concurrent viral isolation being conducted to document the presence of non-infectious viral debris with RNA particles. Perhaps this will put an end to the scare producing anecdotal reports that have accompanied positive PCRs post recovery. - Mod.MPP

[4] Afghanistan: possible increased transmission not captured through surveillance, RFI
Date: Mon 4 May 2020 12:07 AM AEST
Source: The Canberra Times, Australian Associated Press (AAP) report [edited]
https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6743925/one-third-positive-in-afghan-virus-tests/


One-third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan's capital have come back positive, raising fears of widespread undetected infections. The results of the tests in the Afghan capital of Kabul are concerning, Public Health Ministry spokesman Wahid Mayar said.

Afghanistan has performed only limited testing so far -- close to 12 000 -- with more than 2700 confirmed infections, in a nation of 36.6 million. As more testing becomes available, the country's confirmed infection numbers will likely rise sharply, Mayar said. He urged residents to stay home. Kabul and most other cities are in lockdown, but compliance has not been widespread. The death toll -- officially at 85 -- could also be much higher.

More than 250 000 Afghans returned home from Iran since the beginning of the year [2020], fanning out across their country without being tested or quarantined. Anecdotal reports have emerged of dozens of returnees dying of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The country's health care system, devastated by 4 decades of war, is woefully unprepared for a major outbreak. It has only 400 ventilators.

[The media report above is disconcerting. If 1 out of 3 tests performed randomly are positive, it does suggest a significant amount of ongoing transmission. The continuing civil unrest may make it difficult to verify the rumors of large numbers of deaths among Afghans returning from Iran. More information on this report and the actual situation in Afghanistan would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP

Highlights
----------
- WHO has delivered additional medicines to the Islamic Republic of Iran as part of the Solidarity Trial, a global effort to find an effective treatment for COVID-19. Find more on this at http://www.emro.who.int/irn/iran-news/who-delivers-more-medicines-to-islamic-republic-of-iran-for-covid-19-solidarity-clinical-trial.html.

- Polio disease surveillance teams are reaching into the most far-flung places of the globe to address the COVID-19 pandemic. An article on polio teams working in Somalia is available at http://www.emro.who.int/somalia/news/somalias-polio-teams-help-combat-covid-19.html.

- An update of WHO partner coordination is today's 'subject in focus' below.

Subject in focus: update on partner coordination
------------------------------------------------
Many partners have been working closely with WHO from the beginning of the response, both at WHO headquarters and in the field. UNICEF, IFRC, US CDC, and OCHA are major partners embedded in the global COVID-19 incident management team in Geneva, and are supporting all pillars of response.

127 emergency medical teams (EMTs) are registered in the Global Classification (https://extranet.who.int/emt/) of which 29 are already classified and 98 under the classification process. To date, a total of 19 EMTs have been deployed internationally and another 36 EMTs are supporting national operations in the response to COVID-19, providing support to 15 countries.

As of 27 Apr 2020, EMT operations have significantly increased in Africa -- the region with the most international operations, followed by the European Region. In particular, large EMTs have been deployed to Italy, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Kyrgyzstan. 58 training sessions have been conducted with more than 3100 front line responders trained.

Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners are: supporting risk assessment and strategic and operational planning; and providing technical advice across all health operation pillars, particularly clinical management, IPC, laboratory and risk communication, and community engagement (RCCE).

As of 4 May 2020, 400 offers of support have been received from GOARN partners. This includes a large express of interest from "One Health" partners, particularly from the South East Asia and the Western Pacific Regions. Current support includes missions to Ethiopia, Sao Tome and Príncipe, Tajikistan, and Timor-Leste.

Esri, the global leader in geographic information system (GIS) software, is providing a free and comprehensive ArcGIS package to all GOARN partners and ministries of health to support the COVID19 response. WHO and GOARN partners are working to facilitate online ArcGIS training to build and improve the operational capacity of partners. WHO is assessing GIS training needs and capacity among GOARN partners.

Asia and Africa RCCE regional coordination groups are triangulating operational social science data, including community feedback data, sentiments and perception analysis and online data mining. This will better inform decision-making and community engagement strategies. The goal is to progressively connect partners collecting data into a more comprehensive and coordinated reporting and monitoring system available to all. At regional and global level RCCE teams are exploring the development of interagency dashboards for visualizing data to better inform operational response planning.

IFRC, UNICEF, and WHO, in close coordination with GOARN and support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are working towards the establishment of a RCCE Global Collective Service to assist the public health and humanitarian response. This will build on the existing coordination efforts towards providing global, regional and country support across to the health and humanitarian architecture.

In RCCE, the focus area this week includes:
- post lockdown engagement of communities including on reopening of schools, handwashing campaign, and engagement with faith based organizations on religious festivals including Ramadan;
- compilation of tips on community of engagement in low resource settings developed and disseminated among partners, offering good practice examples and innovative outreach solutions;
- community engagement data is being triangulated in the group to better utilize and inform IMST decision making:
- exploring regional interagency dashboards for CE data to better inform operational response planning;
- rumour monitoring ongoing among partners like Internews. The goal is to better connect partners collecting data into a more comprehensive reporting and monitoring system available to all;
- proactive WHO and UNICEF engagement with faith-based organizations is being undertaken to ensure that religious events and customs are aligned with the infection prevention and control principles of this outbreak response.

On the occasion of World Hand Hygiene Day on 5 May [2020], UNICEF is mobilizing global RCCE partners to scale up handwashing outreach for COVID-19 prevention and Operationalization of the interim recommendations on obligatory hand hygiene against transmission of COVID-19.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 remains at 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 49 115 new cases (57.0% of the global newly reported cases) and -582 deaths were recorded for this 24 hour period. (Checking into this further, the CDC showed a total of 67 456 deaths, reflecting a 24 hour increase of 1719 newly reported deaths, with a statement that numbers provided over the weekend were estimates and are subject to change on Mondays). Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 64.8% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 10.1%, Canada at 7.7%, and Peru and Ecuador at 4.2% each. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 28.8% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 22.0%, Peru and Ecuador at 12.0% each, Mexico at 7.8%, and Chile at 7.1%.

The European region reported 25 250 new cases (29.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 1320 deaths. Russia reported 41.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 17.2%, Turkey 6.6%, Belarus 6.6%, Italy 5.5%, and Spain 3.5%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5690 new cases (6.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 100 deaths. Saudi Arabia reported 27.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan at 17.2%, Iran at 17.2%, Qatar 11.9%, and the United Arab Emirates at 9.9%.

The African region reported 1098 new cases (1.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 51 deaths. South Africa reported 40.7% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria at 16.3%, Senegal at 14.4%, Guinea at 5.8%, and Mayotte at 4.9%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1329 new cases (1.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 29 deaths. Singapore reported 49.4% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines at 22.2%, Japan at 16.4%, and Malaysia at 9.2%.

The South East Asia region reported 3626 new cases (4.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 88 deaths. India reported 70.4% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 18.3% and Indonesia at 9.6%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 62.0% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 32.5%, and Thailand 1.7%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 4 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend. Europe has not been rebounding as high at the end of the weekend, demonstrating decreasing newly confirmed cases.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
