The Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance has
reported that no anthrax agent or genome fragments were detected in
pathological materials collected from anthrax-suspected foals that
had been slaughtered under emergency during their transportation from
Kalmykia to the Republic of Chuvashia for slaughter.

However, horse strangles was detected in a sample from a foal ear
(Ref No. 26/10) in the GSI "ARRIVV&M" (6 Dec 2010; No. 04.08/3015).

The Rosselkhoznadzor Territorial Administration for the Republic of
Chuvashia forwarded to the Chuvashia State Veterinary Service, and to
the GI Batyrevskaya Veterinary Station, information on imposing
restrictions and implementing a plan for infection prevention and
horse strangles eradication.

[Although this was reported recently, given when the anthrax outbreak
began occurring, the actual situation may have happened as much as 3
months previously. While one or more of the foals that were
slaughtered may have had strangles, it is very likely the majority of
the animals had equine anthrax - Mod.MHJ/TG]
