The death toll from a mystery illness in Panama has risen to at least 17,
with 10 others still suffering but recovering from fever, diarrhea and
partial paralysis, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday [4 Oct 2006].
Doctors do not know the cause but say the disease progresses rapidly to the
renal system and causes neurological damage.
Two more people suffering from the unidentified illness died on Wednesday,
health minister Camilo Alleyne told reporters. He also bumped up the number
of people fighting the mystery disease to 10 from 7.
Up to Tuesday [3 Oct 2006] the disease had killed 15 over the last month,
the ministry said.
The ministry declared a national epidemic alert on Tuesday.
The dead were all over 60 years of age and most were already suffering from
high blood pressure, diabetes and kidney problems.
The illness does not seem to be contagious and dengue fever, influenza,
West Nile virus and other illnesses have been ruled out.

The official number of deaths increased to 17 yesterday with 27 total cases
affected by an as yet unknown syndrome which appeared in Panama in the
month of September, according to reports from the Ministry of Health.
The 2 new deaths had been hospitalized in the Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid
hospital complex, but more details on the course of their disease were not
provided.
The minister, Camilo Alleyne, who on Tuesday [3 Oct 2006] afternoon said
there were no new cases, confirmed that there were 5 new cases. He
indicated that the investigations thus far into the etiology of the
syndrome have eliminated bacteria such as _E. coli_ and _Campylobacter_ and
viruses such as those responsible for West Nile fever, dengue, influenza A
or B, equine encephalitis and enterovirus, as well as poisoning by
substances such as arsenic.
Yesterday he explained that there had been 3 ambulatory cases reported,
that there are 4 patients hospitalized in stable condition and that another
3 patients were in the intensive care unit, where the area has been isolated.
The infectious disease specialist Nestor Sosa said that in the Santo Tomas
hospital there were 2 patients in serious condition. He said that there
are patients under observation to determine if they had the same syndrome,
and that the 2 new fatal cases had similar characteristics in terms of age
and symptomatology.
The Director General of Health, Cirilo Lawson, talked about the
investigations into the origins of this disease. "We are open to the
possibility that this disease is either of infectious or toxic etiology".
[Of note... there are a number of infectious agents that are known to
produce toxins, so it is possible the etiology is both of infectious and
toxic origins. - Mod.MPP]
Lawson clarified that pharmacologic agents [medicines] are included among
possible toxicologic exposures and confirmed that investigations into this
possibility are currently underway.
Authorities were awaiting the arrival of 4 experts from the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] from Atlanta, Georgia [USA], who will
work together with the Pan American Health Organization [PAHO] and the
Ministry of Health to determine the cause of this lethal syndrome.

[Upon review of the updated information, this moderator has not
significantly changed her opinion on the possible etiologies of this
outbreak. The moderator comment included in the 1st posting of this thread
is reproduced below.
"From the description given in the article from the local press in Panama,
there appears to be "confidence" on the part of the Ministry that the
outbreak does not appear to be "contagious," so that person-to-person
transmission seems to be ruled out by the epidemiologic studies. Obvious
questions include what is the common exposure on the part of the patients;
the mention that they are all older individuals with pre-existing medical
problems could be an indication of an exposure that, in most cases, is
relatively benign, but when a compromised individual is exposed, then
problems are seen. Or it may be an indication of an exposure that is
occurring in the health care environment where these individuals may have a
common exposure. And a key question is whether this exposure is to an
infectious agent or a toxin.
Clearly, more information on the epidemiologic studies conducted on this
outbreak would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP"
According to the latest newswires, the more common infectious agents that
might be associated with a similar clinical picture have been ruled out
(such as _E. coli_, campylobacter, enteroviruses, dengue, West Nile virus,
equine encephalitis viruses). The common denominator seems to remain
somewhat older individuals with pre-existing medical problems... leading
one to ask whether some exposure in the health care environment might be
responsible for their illness. The Ministry of Health clearly states they
are investigating medications, suggesting that these patients may have been
exposed to a common medication.
We await further information. - Mod.MPP]
