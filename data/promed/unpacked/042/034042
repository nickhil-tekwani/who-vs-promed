A diarrhea epidemic in the remote Khin village of Kalikot district
over the past month has claimed the lives of 20 children so far. The
children died between 16 May and 11 Jun 2007 in the area some 57 km
(35.4 mi) west of district headquarters Manma. In the Chalaha area
alone, 10 children [contracted the disease], while another 10 died in
wards 1, 3, 5, and 6.
According to a local man, over 300 locals are suffering from
diarrhea. To make matters worse, neither paramedics nor medicine is
available in the village as yet. The disease has also spread in
Dhaulagoha, affecting many children and elderly there, according to a
local.
When contacted, Chief District Officer, Omkar Prasad Neupane, said a
team of 5 health workers with the necessary medicines was sent to the
afflicted village on Sat 16 Jun 2007. Mohammad Ojer Alam, an
inspector from the District Public Health Office, however, said that
the death toll was not for a one-month period but for 3 months.

Health officials said 3 people have already died and more than a
dozen others have been hospitalized in the southern city of Zamboanga.
Dr. Ricardo Angeles, head of the local epidemiology and surveillance
unit, suspected viral gastroenteritis as the cause of the death of
one victim. All the victims, from the remote village of Limpapa,
suffered diarrhea. "It may due to viral gastroenteritis," he said.
The 1st death was reported on 8 Jun 2007, and 10 other villagers were
also rushed to hospital. This was followed by 2 more deaths on 17 Jun
2007, Angeles said, adding that 3 more patients, also from the same
village, had been rushed to the hospital. Angeles allayed fears of a
cholera outbreak.

[A number of reports have appeared regarding this outbreak with
fatalities on Mindanao. More information is needed for a full
assessment whether cholera was present or not.
Zamboanga is located on the peninsula of the same name on the
Philippine island of Mindanao. The island can be found on a map of

[3] Diarrhea, dysentery - Zimbabwe
Date: Mon 18 Jun 2007

<http://allafrica.com/stories/200706181021.html>

Cities in Zimbabwe have been hit by an unprecedented water crisis
with some urban centers going for more than 2 weeks without water,
raising fears of an outbreak of diseases. Water supplies have become
extremely erratic since the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa)
wrested control of water and sewer reticulation systems from local
authorities. The crisis has forced desperate residents to dig wells.
Among the most affected cities are Harare, Chitungwiza, Chegutu,
Mutare, Gweru, Zvishavane, Kadoma, and Chinhoyi. In Harare the
worst-hit suburbs include Tafara, Mabvuku, Glen View, Budiriro,
Mufakose, Greendale, Waterfalls, Hatfield, Borrowdale, and Chisipite.
Unlike some residents of low-density suburbs such as Highlands,
Greendale and Borrowdale who have boreholes, high-density residents
have resorted to fetching water from sewage-infested streams. Their
toilets are blocked because there is no running water, while large
green flies are attracted by the stench and filth.
Harare residents said cases of diarrhea and dysentery among children
were mounting everyday as the state of hygiene deteriorates.

[4] Cholera - Somalia (Mudug)

<http://allafrica.com/stories/200706170011.html>

At least 25 people died from watery diarrhea while dozens more, most
of them children, were ailing from the disease in Mudug provincial
settlements of Haradheere in central Somalia.
Omar Abdulahi, an intellectual in the area, told Shabelle that the
plague infected a large number of children and older people in the
region. "In the past days at least 25 have died. People in the
settlements where the disease is prevailing are very much concerned
because we feel that the epidemic is rapidly spreading," he said.
Abdulahi said medical officers and clinics were very scarce in the
settlements, calling on local and international aid agencies to bring
an immediate medical assistance to the region.

[In Somalia, the term acute watery diarrhea is used, often, instead
of cholera. Cholera has certainly been occurring throughout most of
the country. Mudug is an administrative region (gobolka) in central
Somalia. Bordered by Ethiopia, the Somali regions of Nugaal and
Galguduud, and the Indian Ocean, its capital is the city of
Gaalkacyo. - Mod.LL

El Salvador's Ministry of Health decreed a state of emergency [as a
result of the deaths of] 16 children from diarrhea or gastroenteritis
in 2007, and more than 21 200 cases currently suffering the illness.
The emergency alert was emitted in western Sonsonate and Santa Ana,
on the border with Guatemala, and central San Salvador and La
Libertad, the hardest hit region, where 70 percent of ill people
live. Those in charge of assisting the sick asked the government to
supply medication, more staff, and the necessary resources.

Authorities from the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) have given the all clear for passengers aboard a flight
from Merida, Mexico, to Miami, Florida. The plane was being detained
at the gate after it arrived at Miami International Airport after 9
passengers claimed to feel ill, Local 10 reported.
AeroMexico flight 420 from Merida arrived at 1:05 p.m. at gate F5
with 45 people on board. The ill passengers were students who were on
a missionary trip to Mexico. On Monday night, 11 Jun 2007, before
they returned, they reportedly had dinner at a restaurant and some
complained they weren't feeling well prior to boarding the flight.
As a precaution, the captain radioed ahead and said he had sick
passengers aboard. CDC [personnel] arrived on the scene as well as
local rescue personnel and determined the ill passengers were
suffering from dysentery, according to Local 10.
