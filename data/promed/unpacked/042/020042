The state health administration has directed doctors in the district to change their treatment for diarrhea, after several patients later showed symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). According to the district medical authorities, the number of GBS cases reported in the district has increased to 15 from 5, and in most cases, symptoms appeared in those who had undergone treatment for diarrhea.

The doctors have been instructed to avoid prescribing oral rehydration solution (ORS) for diarrhea cases. Instead, they have been told to prescribe antibiotics under the category of quinolones, said Nuna Marja, deputy district medical officer. "Usually, doctors are prescribing only ORS for diarrhea cases. But, with paralysis or weakness of the nervous system -- which is part of GBS -- being reported in those undergoing treatment for diarrhea, we have decided to change the treatment system. But we are yet to confirm the cause of GBS," she said.

GBS was 1st reported in the Anthiyoorkunnu region of Kondotty in May 2014. A total of 4 cases were reported in the region. Two more GBS cases were also reported from Cherukavu and Kondotty. Following this, a medical team led by Marja visited Anthiyoorkunnu, an area which is facing the threat of pollution due to the several granite quarries functioning there.

The health authorities have appointed an expert medical team from Government Medical College, Manjeri to conduct a study on the reported GBS in the district. District medical officer V Ummar Farook said the study would shed light onto the factors causing GBS. Dr U Anuja, professor of the community medicine department, Dr Sangamithra, head of the department of general medicine, and Tonny Lawrence, assistant professor of the community medicine department, are the members of the team.

[Although not stated in the report, _Campylobacter jejuni_ is the likely cause of the diarrheal illnesses in this cluster of GBS. Since the 1995 paper by Rees, et al (1), _C. jejuni_ was found to be associated with GBS, as recent campylobacteriosis was found in 26 per cent of patients with GBS as compared to one per cent of matched controls. Of note, the GBS cases associated with _C. jejuni_ were significantly associated with the poorer outcome of slow recovery and residual disability. Although no specific serotype of _C. jejuni_ was linked to GBS in the study above, a subsequent paper (2) found that serotype O:19 strains were overrepresented in USA and Germany cases of GBS, and these strains were likely to be serum-resistant.

Subsequently, it has been found that the pathophysiology of the association was an example of antigenic mimicry (3). That is, the lipooligosaccharide of certain _C. jejuni_ strains cross reacted with human GM1 ganglioside and, in rabbits, anti-GM1 antibody was elicited following _C. jejuni_ lipooligosaccharide, and limb weakness developed. More recently, Bax, et al (4) reported that differences in sialic acid linkage of the bacterial saccharide produced different modulations of the immune response, which can explain why some organisms may be linked to GBS and others not.
