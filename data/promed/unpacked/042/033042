A Mexican restaurant in Chicago's Bridgeport neighborhood has pulled out of the Taste of Chicago and voluntarily closed after health officials identified an _E. coli_ outbreak linked to the eatery.

The Chicago Department of Public Health said 25 people were sickened, and 5 were hospitalized after eating at Carbon Live Fire Mexican Grill in the 300-block of W. 26th Street.

The owners of the restaurant have withdrawn their participation in this year's [2016] Taste of Chicago to focus on addressing the outbreak at their 26th Street location. They have also closed their restaurant at 810 N. Marshfield as a safety precaution.

The CDHP has identified the outbreak as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_, also known as STEC [or enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ or EHEC - Mod.LL]. Symptoms can include bloody diarrhea, and health officials said the infection can lead to more serious complications. The CDPH recommends that anyone who recently ate at the restaurant and is suffering any of the symptoms to seek medical attention.

Health officials said the menu items responsible for the outbreak have not been identified, but the investigation is ongoing.
