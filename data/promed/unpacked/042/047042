Grampian Health Board, Scotland

Thirty cases of _Escherichia coli_ O157 infection have been identified in
the Grampian region of Scotland, associated with eating cheese made from
unpasteurised goat's milk. Twenty-two of the cases are pupils in one class
of a primary school, three are teachers, and five are family contacts of
the pupils. One child has developed the haemolytic uraemic syndrome, some
of the cases are asymptomatic. All the cases had eaten the cheese, which
had been made by the grandmother of one of the pupils for a school project
on unpasteurised farm cheese and was not for sale. _E. coli_ O157 has been
isolated from the goat that gave the milk and the strain isolated from the
children has been identified as phage type 21/28.
