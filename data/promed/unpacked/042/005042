At least 25 people died of cholera in Iran by Tuesday morning, [8 Sep
1998, and thousands more are infected, the Zan (Women) newspaper reported
Wednesday. Reza Qasemi, director general for preventive affairs in the
Health Ministry, told the daily that so far 3,290 people have been infected
with the disease throughout the country. He said that most patients were
in the provinces of Tehran, Isfahan, Qom, and Sistan and Baluchestan.
Qasemi believed that main reason behind the widespread of the disease this
year was hot weather and excessive rain in these areas. He stressed that
hygiene education would be the basic way to prevent further incidences.
According to Deputy Health Minister Ali Akbar Sayari, cholera last hit Iran
in 1997, when more than 1,100 people were infected.
