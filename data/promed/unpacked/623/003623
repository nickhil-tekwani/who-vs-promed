Deadly tapeworm found in indoor pet dog
---------------------
_Echinococcus [multilocularis_], a tiny parasitic tapeworm usually
found in small animals that causes serious liver disorders when it
infects humans, was detected in 20 pet dogs in Hokkaido, including
one that lived indoors, a research group said. This is the first time
a dog living indoors -- and therefore in extensive contact with its
owners -- was found to be infected with the parasite. The survey was
conducted by a group led by Prof. Masao Kamiya of Hokkaido
University's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. Alarmed by the danger of
the rapid spread of the disease, which is passed on by animals, the
Health, Labour and Welfare Ministry instructed prefectural
governments in writing Thursday to adopt thorough measures to prevent
infection.
The disease cannot be transmitted from human to human. _Echinococcus
[multilocularis_] lays its eggs in the intestines of dogs and
northern foxes after growing into a 5-millimetre-long adult. Within
Japan, it is thought to be found only in Hokkaido. Although foxes and
dogs show no symptoms of infection, humans can develop serious liver
disorders after touching an infected animal or ingesting Echinococcus
eggs in water or food as the parasite's larvae multiply in the liver
and other organs. Once infected, humans take 10 to 20 years to
develop symptoms, but there is no effective treatment for the disease
other than the complete excision of the infected area or organ.
Infection can be fatal if its discovery is delayed.
According to a survey by the Hokkaido prefectural government,
infection by _Echinococcus [multilocularis_] -- was detected in 30
percent to 60 percent of northern foxes in the prefecture over the
past 10 years. Of 9874 stray dogs caught between 1966 and 2001, 99 of
them, or 1 percent, were found to have been infected with the
parasite.
Researchers' latest survey of the feces of 1772 pet dogs conducted
after 1997 with the help of veterinarians in the prefecture found
that 20 dogs, or 1.1 percent, were infected, showing almost the same
rate of infection among domestic as stray dogs. One of the 20
infected domestic dogs was confirmed this month to have lived
indoors, although it had long been believed that indoor pets were
highly unlikely to become infected with _Echinococcus
[multilocularis_]. The dog, a medium-sized mongrel in Sapporo, is
believed to have been infected with the parasite after eating a wild
mouse while on a walk, according to its owner. Examinations are
underway to determine whether the owner also has been infected.
Having judged it necessary to quickly establish preventive measures
after discovering the spread of the infection among domestic animals,
especially indoor pets, the ministry instructed Hokkaido and Sapporo
municipal governments to employ thorough measures to prevent human
infection. It also informed other prefectural governments of the
findings.
Echinococcus is classified in the most dangerous of 4 categories of
infectious diseases under the Infectious Disease Prevention Law.
Doctors are obliged to report any instances of infection by the
parasite to prefectural governors within 7 days through local public
health centers. According to the ministry, about 20 people are
infected with the parasite [_E. multilocularis_] every year. Most of
those infected are believed either to live in or have travelled to
Hokkaido. The ministry has been greatly alarmed by the possibility
that dogs and wild mice may bring the parasite to the main island,
increasing the number of people infected.

[Hokkaido is know to be endemic for _E.multilocularis_, and the
reservoir is the red fox (_Vulpes vulpes schrencki_) and raccoon dog
(_Nyctereutes procyonoides albus_). Bait-delivered anthelmintic to
reduce the prevalence in wild red foxes has been tried but with
inconclusive results. It is alarming that domestic dogs may become
infected and excrete eggs in the domestic environment, in theory
increasing the likelihood that humans may become infected. - Mod.EP]
