The Ministry of Health published on Sunday night [4 Oct 2015] a press release, a copy of which was received by the Mauritanian News Agency (AMI), stating that the health situation is under control and well attended. The full text of this press release follows:

"The Ministry of Health has been informed by its local services on [14 Sep 2015] of the death of a suspected case of hemorrhagic fever in Magtaa Lahjar Health Center in Tourguelil Town, Moudjeria district [Tagant region].

A multidisciplinary team from the Ministry of Health went immediately to the area and conducted investigations on cases and contact tracing. The patient was admitted at the Magtaa Lahjar health center, and samples were collected from him and sent to the Pasteur Institute in Dakar for biological analysis, which confirmed a recent infection with Rift Valley fever [RVF] virus. The same day, a joint team of the health and livestock ministries crisscrossed the localities of Moudjeria district and carried out education sessions to sensitize people about the risks of viral haemorrhagic fevers and ways to protect themselves, while searching for potential cases and following the contacts.

The detection of current suspected cases led to hospitalization, isolation and case management at the hospitals. Their condition is evolving favorably, and monitoring of contacts in Nouakchott and in the interior of the country is underway. Note that all these cases have never been in contact or made trips to countries affected by Ebola virus disease. Samples for analysis were immediately made and sent to the Pasteur Institute in Dakar.

Given this situation, the Ministry of Health has promptly taken the following measures:
- Meeting of the monitoring committee
- Monitoring and strengthening of epidemiological surveillance with daily reporting and count of weekly cases
- Sending field missions for awareness
- Extension of operational guidelines for case management at health structures
- Development and dissemination of audiovisual spots in the 4 main languages.

Remember that usually during the winter periods, sporadic cases of hemorrhagic fever occur and are well supported by our health facilities with a favorable evolution.

The Ministry of Health brings to the attention of the people that all necessary measures have been taken and that the situation is under control and well attended."

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus affects different animal species (buffaloes, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and can pass to humans either by direct contact through blood or body fluids during slaughter or ingestion of contaminated meat or indirectly through arthropod biting, especially by arthropods of the genus _Aedes_.

The disease was confirmed in Mauritania in the early 2000s and, since then, it has reappeared recurrently; the most recent epidemic dates back to 2012-2013.

The case raised by the Mauritanian Information Agency (AMI) announced a new episode of the disease that has already caused one death and led to several suspected cases, the numbers of which are not mentioned in the communique of the Health Minister. It is not clear whether epidemiological investigations have been conducted in farm animals, which are the main reservoirs of the RVF virus.

Moudjeria is a town and a district in south-central Mauritania, located in Tagant region. The region is divided into 3 districts: Moudjeria, Tichit, and Tidjikja (https://goo.gl/6uCOZk). - Mod.AB

Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks very often involve significant numbers of ill and dead small ruminant animals. It is odd that no small ruminant animal cases are mentioned, unless the animals had been vaccinated previously and are immune. RVF virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas, where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus. Adult female mosquitoes coming from infected eggs can transmit the virus during their 1st blood meals. Eradicating the virus from these areas is not possible with current technology. - Mod.TY]
