U.S. Barred From Forcing Troops to Get Anthrax Shots
----------------------------------------------------
The Defense Department must immediately stop inoculating troops with
anthrax vaccine, a federal judge ruled yesterday, saying that the
Food and Drug Administration acted improperly when it approved the
experimental injections for general use. Concluding that the FDA
violated its own rules by approving the vaccine in late 2003, U.S.
District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan said the mandatory vaccination
program -- which has inoculated more than 1.2 million troops since
1998 -- is "illegal."
Sullivan said that his ban on involuntary vaccination will remain in
place until the FDA reviews the anthrax vaccine properly or until
President Bush determines that the normal process must be waived
because of emergency circumstances.
The Defense Department has required many troops serving in Iraq and
Afghanistan to be vaccinated, and it has punished and sometimes
court-martialed those who refused. The Pentagon expanded its anthrax
and smallpox vaccination programs in July 2004 to include troops
stationed in South Korea and other areas in Asia and Africa, despite
complaints from some service members that the anthrax vaccine made
them sick.
In a statement, the Department of Defense [DoD] said it is reviewing
the decision and will "pause giving anthrax vaccinations until the
legal situation is clarified. . . . DoD remains convinced that the
anthrax immunization program complies with all the legal requirements
and that the anthrax vaccine is safe and effective."
In his ruling, Sullivan said that the FDA's approval was invalid
because it did not meet the required review standards and the agency
failed to seek the necessary public comment. "Congress has prohibited
the administration of investigational drugs to service members
without their consent," Sullivan said. "This Court will not permit
the government to circumvent this requirement. The men and women of
our armed forces deserve the assurance that the vaccines our
government compels them to take into their bodies have been tested by
the greatest scrutiny of all -- public scrutiny. This is the process
the FDA in its expert judgment has outlined, and this is the course
this court shall compel FDA to follow," Sullivan wrote.
The judge ruled on a suit filed in March 2003 by 6 service members
and civilians who argued that the FDA never properly reviewed the
vaccine's ability to protect against inhalation anthrax. The suit
contended that the drug was never shown to be effective, and that
some vaccinated troops experienced extreme fatigue, joint pain and
temporary memory loss after being vaccinated. The vaccine, made by
BioPort Corp. of Lansing, Michigan, is given in a series of shots.
Mark Zaid, an attorney for the 6 who has also defended more than a
dozen service members court-martialed for refusing the vaccination,
said one of his clients is a breast-feeding mother who does not think
the vaccine is safe for her child. "We will now initiate an effort to
ensure the government reverses all punishments that were imposed for
refusing an order to take the vaccine," Zaid said. He said he will
also seek compensation for service members who contend they were
harmed. "As we've seen in Iraq, there wasn't any actual threat from
anthrax, so there was never any real need for the vaccine," Zaid said.
Sullivan initially ruled in late 2003 that the FDA had never approved
the vaccine and ordered that the inoculations be stopped. 8 days
later, the FDA approved the vaccine based on an application made 18
years earlier, and the inoculation program was resumed. Yesterday's
ruling concluded that the agency did not follow its own rules in
declaring the vaccine safe and effective.
In particular, Sullivan criticized the FDA for not allowing the
public to comment on its decision -- a prerequisite for any approval.
There was some public comment when the approval was first sought in
1986, but the 2003 decision was based on research conducted later and
never subjected to public comment.
The FDA argued that comments had been submitted as part of a 2001
citizens' petition questioning proposals to begin the vaccinations,
but Sullivan found them insufficient. "It is clear to this Court that
if the status of the anthrax vaccine were open for public comment
today, the agency would receive a deluge of comments and analysis
that might inform an open-minded agency," he wrote.
Because the anthrax agent is so deadly, it has been difficult to test
a vaccine that might protect against it. The best data have come from
a study in the 1950s of workers at a factory that processed animal
hides and furs, which can transmit naturally occurring anthrax. That
study found that the vaccine now used by the military was effective
in reducing the incidence of anthrax spread by contact, but the
research involved only a tiny sample of people who might have inhaled
the bacteria.
Anthrax vaccine was used in a limited way in the 1991 Persian Gulf
War. A more expansive effort began in 1998. Difficulties in
manufacturing the vaccine stopped the program in 2000 and 2001, but
the vaccination effort was resumed and greatly expanded in 2002.

Michigan anthrax vaccine producer still making vaccine for now
--------------------------------------------------------------
BioPort Corp., the Michigan maker of an anthrax vaccine, said
Thursday it won't feel any immediate effect from a federal judge's
order to halt a mandatory anthrax vaccination program for U.S.
troops. BioPort spokeswoman Kim Brennen Root said the company is
continuing to produce and ship the anthrax vaccine under its $245
million contract with the Pentagon, which runs through 2006. BioPort,
which is based in Lansing, Michigan, is the nation's sole supplier of
anthrax vaccine. "It doesn't change anything from a day-to-day
perspective," Root said.
Wednesday's ruling was the 2nd time in a year that U.S. District
Judge Emmet G. Sullivan has ordered the military to stop requiring
anthrax vaccines for U.S. military personnel. Sullivan said the Food
and Drug Administration violated its own procedures when it gave
final approval to the vaccine last year because it failed to give the
public an adequate opportunity to comment.
The Justice Department was reviewing Sullivan's decision Thursday and
has not yet decided whether to appeal.
Virginia Stephanakis, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon's vaccine
program, said the ruling "hit us very suddenly and very
unexpectedly." The Pentagon halted mandatory anthrax vaccinations
until further notice but noted the court didn't question the safety
or effectiveness of the vaccine.
The Pentagon has vaccinated more than 1 million soldiers with the
anthrax vaccine since 1998. 6 unidentified service members sued,
arguing that the vaccine is experimental and that it was being
improperly used for inhalation anthrax as well as exposure of the
bacteria through the skin.
Sullivan first ordered a halt to the mandatory vaccinations on 22 Dec
2003, saying the vaccine was being used for an unapproved purpose. 8
days later, the FDA issued an order intended to give the vaccine
final approval for use to prevent inhaled anthrax. Sullivan said the
FDA had met his requirements and lifted the ban, except for the 6
plaintiffs. The soldiers then asked Sullivan to reinstate the
prohibition. He agreed, rejecting the government's claim that the FDA
had considered arguments against the vaccine.
The vaccine is given in a 6-shot series. It was unclear Thursday
whether soldiers who already have started the series will be able to
finish it. Research has shown that the vaccine is effective after 2
or 3 shots. Root said the vaccine has a 2-year shelf life, so the
Pentagon can store some supplies for later use if the vaccine program
is restarted. Root said the shelf life of the vaccine likely will be
extended to 3 years this winter.

[The problems, legal and otherwise, with the US military anthrax
vaccine continue. In the past few weeks, Gary Matsumoto's book,
"Vaccine A: The covert government experiment that's killing our
soldiers and why GI's are only the first victims," was published by
Basic Books. The title describes the author's brief. My copy has just
arrived so I haven't read it yet and I have yet to see any reviews.
It has some 67 pages of footnotes and references. It is being read
in Washington. In the past we have had related postings on squalene (a
vaccine additive). - Mod.MHJ]
