re: ProMED-mail Hemorrhagic fever - Italy ex Senegal: RFI 20091012.3525
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the patient hospitalized at the INMI Spallanzani of Rome
(described in the ProMED-mail post archived as Hemorrhagic fever - Italy ex
Senegal: RFI 20091012.3525), it has now been established that the patient
is suffering from dengue hemorrhagic fever, caused by dengue virus type 3.

The patient arrived in Senegal on 3 Jun 2009, travelling from Milan, and
staying in the village of Keur Souleye, Louga region, until 3 Oct 2009. The
patient returned to Italy from Dakar via Madrid-Turin, arriving in Turin at
20.40 hr on 4 Oct 2009. During the 3 weeks preceding the onset of symptoms
he did not travel outside the village and did not visit health care centres.

The condition of the patient is now good.

[ProMED-mail thanks Vincenzo Puro for promptly reporting the outcome of
this investigation. Interestingly a correspondent, Prof H Tolou of the
IMTSSA, Marseilles, France, suggested dengue fever, together with malaria,
yellow fever, and leptospirosis in the differential diagnosis of this
patient's illness.

The Louga region in north western Senegal can be located on the
