Abstract
Unresolved scientific questions, remaining 10 years after the anthrax
attacks, 3 years after the FBI accused a dead man of perpetrating the
2001 anthrax attacks single-handedly, and more than a year since they
closed the case without further investigation, indictment or trial,
are perpetuating serious concerns that the FBI may have accused the
wrong person of carrying out the anthrax attacks. The FBI has not
produced concrete evidence on key questions:

- Where and how were the anthrax spores in the attack letters
prepared? There is no material evidence of where the attack anthrax
was made, and no direct evidence that any specific individual made the
anthrax, or mailed it. On the basis of a number of assumptions, the
FBI has not scrutinized the most likely laboratories.

- How and why did the spore powders acquire the high levels of silicon
and tin found in them? The FBI has repeatedly insisted that the
powders in the letters contained no additives, but they also claim
that they have not been able to reproduce the high silicon content in
the powders, and there has been little public mention of the
extraordinary presence of tin. All the available evidence can be
explained by the hypothesis that the spore coats were silicone-coated
using a tin catalyst. Chemical details are presented here.

- Where did the anthrax spores become contaminated by a rare strain of
_B. subtilis_? The FBI never located the source of the strain, but
they never searched in the most likely places.

Once the method of preparation of the attack anthrax is understood,
the questions of who made it, and where, will be rapidly resolved. The
publicly-known evidence related to these questions is compiled here,
with full documentation.

[The attack anthrax spores have been found to contain silicon, oxygen
and tin on the surface of the spore coats, unlike normal anthrax
spores. Because tin is toxic, and is present in substantial amounts,
it must have been added after the spores were grown. Although silicon
occasionally occurs naturally on the spore coats of anthrax spores,
the amount of silicon on the attack spore coats was much greater than
that on other spores, even those with the highest amounts, which
implies that silicon may also have been an additive. The elements
present on the spore coats suggest that the spores may be
silicone-coated. Tin is a catalyst for cross-linking silicone
polymers. The small, silicon and oxygen-containing molecules that
react to form the polymerized coating can pass through the outer
membrane of the spore (the exosporium) to reach the spore coat, where
moisture is present to complete the reaction.

Unlike the anthrax powders in the Senate letters, the powders in the
earlier attack letters were impure and contained cellular debris,
which could also react with the additives; as a result, the bulk NY
Post letter powder has a much higher silicon and tin content than the
bulk Senate powders. Put another way, 2 separate preparations were
used. This is reinforced by the finding of the _B. subtilis_
contaminant in the coarse powder but not in the finer, nor in the
presumed source flask RMR 1029.

Microencapsulation with silicone has been used to confer high
stability on biologicals, protecting them from environmental hazards,
not a property relevant to their use in the letter attacks, but of
interest to bio-defense. (The assumption that additives must
necessarily be related to dispersibility does not necessarily apply in
the case of anthrax spores, which are surrounded by the exosporium.)
If the attack spores were microencapsulated, they were probably made
for some purpose other than letter attacks. For example, DARPA's
project on CBW detection was planning to look at microencapsulated
pathogens in 2001. - Mod.MHJ]
