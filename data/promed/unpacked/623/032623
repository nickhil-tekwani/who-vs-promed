Increasing risk of onchocerciasis the Abofour forest
----------------------------------------------------
The lives of more than 2500 residents of Asuboi,
a farming community in the Offinso Municipality
in the Ashanti Region are at risk of river
blindness unless government and benevolent organizations intervene.

Health officials say over 70 per cent of the
population is infected following the invasion of black flies in the area.

Many people especially children are plagued with
all manner of skin disorders including rashes and
lesions, which cause intense itching.

The inability of health workers to reach the
people with medical care due to poor road network
appears to be a huge impediment to addressing this precarious health situation.

An international charity organization, Sight
Savers International, estimates about 140 million
people in Africa are at risk of river blindness,
known medically as onchocerciasis.

Experts say that the disease, which is caused
mainly by the filarial worm _Onchocerca
volvulus_, is transmitted through bites from
infected black flies. The black flies are
adaptable in fast flowing rivers in Sub-Sahara Africa.

The Asuboi Township is located in the middle of
the thick Abofour Forest, about 50 miles or 80
kilometers from Kumasi. The community is
sandwiched by 2 fast flowing rivers, Subin and Nkyereade.

Though the Offinso Municipal Assembly has
provided the community with a mechanized
bore-hole, the majority of residents especially
those in nearby hamlets prefer to fetch water
from the river. And they share the water with
cattle. They complain the sitting of the
bore-hole in a steep area, about 1.5 kilometers
[0.9 mi] from Asuboi is not ideal.

The road to Asuboi is unmemorable, with deep
gullies that make it difficult for road users to
ply, virtually cutting the community from the
rest of the municipality. The easiest means to
reach the community is by bicycle or motorbikes
which also become dangerous and a nightmarish
adventure in sunny or rainy weather.

Though strange rashes and signs of river
blindness are common among the people they appear
to have no idea about their predicament.
Ignorantly, they resort to the use of traditional
methods such as warm water and locally made balms
for the treatment of the complicated medical condition.

Out of fear of the strange condition, many
residents have been seeking solace in the
Assembly Member for the area for virtually
non-existence support. Assemblyman for Kwapanin
Electoral area, Philip Amponsah Boakye is tired
of receiving complaints because according to him, there is little he can do.

He cannot fathom why it has taken health experts
so much a time to respond to the needs of the
community. Out of nothing, he directs some
affected residents to the nearby health center at
Abofuor, about 30 kilometers [approx 19 mi] which
health experts say lacks facilities to conduct
any proper scientific examinations into onchocerciasis.

"There are many children, even adults who have
got the rashes. You can see so many children with
rashesÂŠ Even their skins are getting black. Still
people are getting infested. I want to appeal to
the Central government to take immediate action
if not, the people here all of them can be blind
and it is very risky," he said.

The Municipal Health Directorate appears to have
little support for the residents at Asuboi.
Though tests carried out 4 months ago under the
Rapid Epidemical Mapping for onchocerciasis
programme, established widespread prevalence,
officials say there is little they could do.

Bernard Oppong, Municipal Disease Control
Officer, though describing the community as a
high transmission area, his outfit dares not to
go because the road is inaccessible.

"Once the community is located within the thick
forest, access to the community is a problem and
for that matter, donors who will support us with
drugs (ivermectin) and other logistics for this
treatment wouldn't be able to access the
community and this is creating a problem here" he explained.

Meanwhile, the Municipal Chief Executive for
Offinso, Victor Amponsah, says his attention has
been drawn to the development, and that steps are
being taken to address the problem. He says the
assembly will ensure routine reshaping of roads
in the municipality to create access to communities.

Under the African Programme for Onchocerciasis
Control the World Health Organization estimates
the sight of 800 000 people will have been saved by the end of 2010.

The people of Asuboi, however, can only hope for a miracle to save them.

Onchocerciasis - Cote d'Ivoire: (Yamoussoukro)
20081120.3665 where the Onchocerciasis Control
Programme, OCP, 1974-2002 is discussed.

Onchocerciasis, African river blindness, is
caused by a nematode, _Onchocerca volvulus_,
transmitted to humans by black flies. The adult
worms are found in subcutaneous nodules where
they produce microfilariae, which migrate in
tissues, especially the skin and eye.
Inflammation in the eye results in blindness or
reduced eyesight
