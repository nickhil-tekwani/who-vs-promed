BSE MOUSE TESTS
===============
[We received the following communication [1] but not knowing hat to do with
it, it just sat. (Sorry, Peter) But I lately passed it to Ralph Blanchfield
for comment, which he did [2]. As to Ralph's health ... "I have now been
home for over three weeks. Generally, I am up and about during the day,
including going for walks, driving my car on short journeys, and getting
stronger daily; but it will be some weeks before
I am back in full fighting trim. I have been doing ... just a little posting
when the provocation exceeds my determination not to get fully involved yet
:-)." Many thanks, Ralph. MHJ]

In Science News, February 1, 1997 Vol 151, No. 5., page 72, titled: "The
latest salvo in the prion debate" Reports a study in Science, January 17th:
"A research group headed by Dominique Dormont of the Atomic Energy
Commission in Fontenay-aux-Roses, France, ground up brains of cows with
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the fatal neurological disorder also
known as mad cow disease. The scientists then injected samples of the
bovine brains into the brains of 30 mice.
After peiods ranging from 368 to 719 days, all of the mice began
experiencing symptoms of a BSE-like neurological disorder. Yet when the
scientists searched the brains of those mice for prions, they found none in
55 percent of them. That was surprising, since prions are now thought by
many scientists to be the infectious agent for BSE. According to this
hypothesis, prions are malformed versions of a cellular protein called PrP.
Prions cause BSE by converting normal PrP proteins into thier own mishapen
form."
...Because they did not detect these abnormal proteins in the brains of all
the diseased mice, however, Dormont and his group speculate that prions are
not the agent for BSE. Still the prions probably play a crucial role in how
the disease develops, they note.
While the few reseachers who argue that an undetected virus or bacterium
causes BSE have taken heart from the results of the French group, other
scientists are skeptical. "Our experience is quite different than the
French goup's," observes Moira E. Bruce of the Institute for Animal Health
in Edinburgh, whose research group has also injected BSE brain tissue into
mice. The most important distinction, Bruce notes, is that in every mouse
tested so far, her group has found accumulations of prions.
Bruce argues that the work of Dormont's group does not shatter the prion
hypothesis, but she also remains undecided as to whether the prions or some
infectious microbe causes BSE. Like many other scientists, "I'm still on
the fence," she says."
Does this mean diagnosis of BSE by mouse assay may miss animals with BSE?

Commenting as requested on Peter Cyrog's message, he had evidently been
misled as a result of the report using the name "Dominique Dormont". The
news report quoted was one of the many relating to the paper invariably
referred to as by Lasmezas C et al (1997) "Transmission of the BSE agent to
mice in the absence of detectable abnormal prion protein", Science, 375, 17
January, 402-405.
Information on this has been very widely posted on listservs, including
Promed (I recall that Dorothy Preslar posted it as soon as the paper was
published).
However, I have not previously seen the comment by Moira Bruce.
Intracerebral inoculation of mice has been extensively used over the years
in BSE research, and it is surprising that this anomaly has apparently not
been recognised previously. On the occasion of Professor Charles Weissmann's
Royal Society/Glaxo Wellcome Award Lecture on 10 February, he was asked for
his views about the reported anomaly, and he quickly dismissed it as of no
real significance.
The Lasmezas et al findings suggest the involvement of an additional agent
in the transmission of TSEs, but provide no evidence as to the nature of
such an agent. The paper has, however, given rise to speculation that it
might be a nucleic acid-based agent. This seems highly unlikely. For many
years researchers have been looking for such an agent, and have found no
sign of it.
There is some evidence from mouse studies involving scrapie prions
[Brandner et al (1996), "Normal host prion protein necessary for
scrapie-induced neurotoxicity", Nature, 379, 25 January, 339-343] that
suggested that it is depletion of normal brain prions rather than deposition
of distorted prions that is linked with spongiosis, gliosis and neuronal death.
Telling et al (1995) "Prion propagation in mice expressing human and
chimeric PrP transgenes implicates the interaction of cellular PrP with
another protein", Cell, 83, 6 October, 79-90, reported experimental work
leading to the conclusion that transmission involved the interaction of
cellular PrP with another protein which they called "protein X". (N.B. the
"et al" in this case included Stanley Prusiner).
