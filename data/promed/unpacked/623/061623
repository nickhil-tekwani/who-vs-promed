Five Americans died of rabies last year [2021] -- the largest number in a decade -- and health officials said Thursday [6 Jan 2022] that some of the people didn't realize they had been infected or refused life-saving shots.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report on 3 of the deaths, all stemming from contact with bats. CDC officials said the deaths were tragic and could have been prevented.

One, an 80-year-old Illinois man, refused to take life-saving shots because of a longstanding fear of vaccines. An Idaho man and a Texas boy did not get shots because of a belief that no bat bite or scratch broke their skin. In all 3 cases, people "either trivialized the exposure (to bats) or they didn't recognize the severity of rabies," said Ryan Wallace, a CDC rabies expert who co-authored the report.

Two other deaths occurred earlier in 2021. One was a Minnesota man bitten by a bat. He got the shots, but an undiagnosed immune system problem hampered their effectiveness, CDC officials said. The other victim was bitten by a rabid dog while traveling in the Philippines and died in New York after returning to the United States.

Rabies is caused by a virus invading the central nervous system and is usually fatal in animals and humans. It's most commonly spread through a bite from an infected animal, with most US infections in recent years traced to bat encounters.

Infection can cause insomnia, anxiety, confusion, paralysis, salivating, hallucinations, difficulty swallowing and fear of water. Death can occur only a couple of weeks after symptoms begin. But it can be prevented through a series of 5 shots given within 2 weeks of exposure. An estimated 60 000 Americans are treated each year after possible exposure to rabies, the CDC says.

There were no rabies deaths reported in 2019 or 2020. The last time 5 US rabies deaths were reported in a single year was 2011, CDC officials said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning over bat-linked rabies cases among humans after 3 people died in a 5-week period in the fall [2021]. Three people, including one child, died from rabies between 18 Sep 2021 and 10 Nov 2021 after direct contact with bats in and around their homes in Idaho, Illinois and Texas in August [2021]. None of the 3 patients, who were all male, received post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) shots designed to prevent rabies before symptoms start -- at which point the disease is almost always fatal.

The patients had contact with a bat 3 to 7 weeks before developing symptoms and died about 2 to 3 weeks after these symptoms surfaced. Two of the cases were considered "avoidable," with one involving a bat roost in the patient's home and another involving a patient picking up the bat with bare hands.

Two of the patients released the bat instead of capturing it for testing. One exposed patient did have the bat tested, but after a positive test result, he did not get PEP "due to a long-standing fear of vaccines." These 3 incidents brought 2021's total rabies cases to 5 after no cases reported in 2019 and 2020, the CDC noted.

"We have come a long way in the United States towards reducing the number of people who become infected each year with rabies, but this recent spate of cases is a sobering reminder contact with bats poses a real health risk," said Ryan Wallace, an expert in the CDC's Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology.

The bats involved were the silver-haired bat, Mexican free-tailed bat and big brown bat, which are all considered "common" in the United States. Bats are the leading cause of rabies in humans in the country.

The CDC recommends any person with direct contact with bats should call their state or local health department or animal control to help capture the animal for testing. The agency then suggests exposed people discuss whether PEP is necessary with a doctor or local public health official. Bat bites or scratches are not always visible, and the disease can spread through its saliva, so receiving PEP can be a "life-or-death matter."

[Rabies is a serious viral disease in mammals. Rabies is a deadly virus. The good news is it can be prevented. It can affect any mammal and is transmitted by a bite breaking the skin, or saliva into an open wound, cut, scratch, or the eye or the mouth.

If you have been bitten, or suspect you have been exposed by saliva, please consult a physician regarding post-exposure prophylaxis. It is a lifesaving treatment in almost all cases. (The article in section [1] mentions an exception.) Wash the wound with soap and water, then seek medication attention from a physician. The timeframe from bite to when post-exposure prophylaxis should be started is limited. The adage of "be safe, not sorry" is certainly applicable to dealing with rabies virus.

Help build a barrier between this virus and yourself. Vaccinate your pets according to your veterinarian's recommendations. This may be yearly or every 3 years, and a booster may be necessary if your pet has encountered a wild animal.

While bats are very beneficial to the environment, do not toy with these animals. They are not pets, and bats in a dwelling place is a serious issue. Protect yourself from these animals. A bat can bite you and you may not know it, especially if you are sleeping.

Please protect yourself and your pets from this virus. - Mod.TG
