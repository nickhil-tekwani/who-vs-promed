Viet Nam: 14th Death This Year Recorded
---------------------------------------
Vietnamese officials confirmed on Sun 27 Feb 2005 that a 69-year-old man has
died from avian influenza, the 14th person to die from the disease this year
[2005]. The man, from northern Thai Binh province, was admitted to the
provincial hospital on 19 Feb 2005 with classic avian influenza symptoms of
high fever and breathing difficulties, said Pham Van Diu, Director of Thai
Binh Provincial Preventive Medicine Center. Samples taken from the man, who
died on Wed [23 Feb 2005], tested positive for the H5N1 virus, Diu said.
Since 30 Dec 2004, 13 people from Viet Nam have died from the avian
influenza. Last month, a Cambodian woman died of the illness in a Vietnamese
hospital. A total of 46 people from Viet Nam, Thailand and Cambodia have
perished from the bird flu over the past year [2004].
Relatives of the latest victim said his whole family had eaten chicken, a
traditional dish, during Lunar New Year festivities earlier this month. None
of them have reported any illness.
On Fri 25 Feb 2005, Viet Nam had reported that a 21-year-old man from the
same province had tested positive for the deadly disease. He is currently in
critical condition in Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital, hospital officials there
said. Initial tests on his 14-year-old sister, who was also suspected of
having contracted the virus, have come up negative.
Last week, health experts and representatives from 28 nations convened in Ho
Chi Minh City to discuss long-term strategies for fighting the deadly virus,
which has re-emerged in the region after devastating the poultry industry
throughout Asia in 2004. Experts said the H5N1 virus is now deeply entrenched
in the region, and international efforts should concentrate on containing the
disease, minimizing the risk of transmission from poultry to people. Health
experts have warned that the longer the virus remains in the environment, the
greater the chance it will mutate into a highly infectious form that can be
passed among humans. Should that happen, it would spark a global pandemic
that could kill millions.

[Almost identical reports were received from David Ozonoff MD MPH and an
anonymous correspondent in Japan. As of 2 Feb 2005, the cumulative number of
human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in Viet Nam confirmed
by the WHO was 37, 29 of whom have died. The death described above raises the
total number of deaths to 30. - Mod.CP]
