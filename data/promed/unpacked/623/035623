Karachi health officials have reported the 8th case and fatality due to infection with the parasite _Naegleria fowleri_ late last week, according to a Pakistan news source.

The adult male died at a private hospital on Wednesday [17 Jun 2015] and it is believed he contracted the amoeba via domestic water use.

Director Health Karachi Dr Zafar Ejaz said, "There is no history that the deceased had gone for swimming or outside the area. Water tanks should be kept clean and citizens should at least use boiled and chlorinated water for washing their nose."

The notification of the 8th fatality comes as the Karachi Water & Sewerage Board (KWSB) in cooperation with Sindh Health Department start a safety measure and precaution awareness campaign against Naegleria in the city.

The inauguration ceremony of the awareness campaign was attended by a large number of citizens.

KWSB Spokesperson Nazeer Mateen said the reason behind the campaign was to inform residents about prevention steps against naegleria by approaching them in their areas and educating them about the usage of sodium hypochlorite and chlorine tablets. A large number of pamphlets comprising informative literature were distributed in the ceremony.

_Naegleria fowleri_ (commonly referred to as the "brain-eating amoeba"), is a microscopic amoeba which is a single-celled living organism. It can cause a rare and devastating infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).

The amoeba is commonly found in warm freshwater such as lakes, rivers, ponds and canals.

Infections can happen when contaminated water enters the body through the nose. Once the amoeba enters the nose, it travels to the brain where it causes PAM (which destroys brain tissue) and is usually fatal. Infections usually occur when it is hot for prolonged periods of time, which results in higher water temperatures and lower water levels.

_Naegleria fowleri_ infections are rare. Most infections occur from exposure to contaminated recreational water. Cases due to the use of neti pots and the practice of ablution have been documented.

The practice of ablution is included in Yogic, Ayurvedic, and Islamic traditions. Within the Islamic faith, ritual nasal rinsing is included in a cleansing process called "wudu" or "ablution." It is usually performed several times a day in preparation for prayer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

You cannot be infected with _Naegleria fowleri_ by drinking contaminated water and the amoeba is not found in salt water.

Initial symptoms of PAM usually start within 1 to 7 days after infection. The initial symptoms may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Other symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures, and hallucinations. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly.

[Please see our comment below in the ProMED-mail post from 3 Sep 2014 (Amebic meningoencephalitis, primary - Pakistan (03): 20140903.2746573):

"Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is rare, and the reports of so many cases within a short period is unusual.

In the ProMED-mail posting from 24 Aug 2014, we pointed to the religious rite of ablution included in Yogic, Ayurvedic, and Islamic traditions. Within the Islamic faith, ritual nasal rinsing is included in a cleansing process called wudu, or ablution. It is usually performed several times a day in preparation for prayer. The parasite has also been contracted via the use of neti pots. These practices, where water is introduced into the sinuses, is an obvious route of infection with _Naegleria fowleri_."

These special rites are the most plausible source of the high number of primary amebic meningoencephalitis cases in Pakistan. The public should be informed that water used for these rites should be boiled before use, which will eliminate free-living amoeba, including _Naegleria fowleri_. Thus the information campaign initiated by the Karachi Water & Sewerage Board (KWSB) is very important to prevent new cases. - Mod.EP
