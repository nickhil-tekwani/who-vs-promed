The United States (US) will block imports of poultry and pork from the
European Union (EU) to make sure the meat is not tainted with the
cancer-causing chemical dioxin, the U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) said
Thursday.
In response to the worst food safety scare to hit Europe since the mad cow
disease outbreak earlier this decade, the United States also will review
all imports of pork and poultry products from the EU since January. The
U.S. action follows a decision by European leaders to destroy chicken and
egg-based foods originating from Belgium and made between January 15 and
June 1.
The crackdown was spurred by the discovery that 400 poultry farms in
Belgium may have used animal feed contaminated with dioxin. The Belgium
government said the feed also may have gone to 500 pig breeders. Cattle are
also being tested for dioxin.
US inspection officials described the US action as a "hold," rather than an
outright ban. It will apply to all products containing pork and poultry in
addition to just the meats, the department said.
The review of imports since January will be to determine if any additional
action is needed.
"These are precautionary steps. Americans enjoy the safest food supply in
the world and we are committed to protecting it," said Mike Mira, acting
administrator of the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).
US officials did not say how long the hold would remain in effect, or what
kinds of tests would be acceptable to win release of the commodities.
Only a small quantity of European poultry products, mostly pate, are
shipped to US buyers.
But about $250 million worth of European pork was imported last year out of
total US imports of $701 million.
Most of the 74.7 billion pounds (34 billion kg) of meat that Americans
consume each year is produced domestically.
Pork imports account for about 700 million pounds (318.2 million kg) of US
meat consumption and poultry imports only about 5 million pounds (2.27
million kg), according to US government figures.
By coincidence, the US has threatened to impose 100 percent punitive duties
on EU pork and poultry imports in retaliation for the EU's refusal to open
its market to beef from cattle treated with artificial growth hormones.
Although US officials say decades of testing show the practice is safe,
the EU has maintained its ban for 10 years.
A decision on whether EU pork and poultry would be hit with punitive duties
is not expected until mid-July, when the World Trade Organization is
scheduled to rule on the US request to retaliate on $202 million in EU goods.

[It is understandable the US would look cautiously at the dioxin issue.
However, there are no tests available to determine if hormones are
artificially given or manufactured by the animal in the body. - Mod.TG
