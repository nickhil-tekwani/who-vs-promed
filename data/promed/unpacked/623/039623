Notwithstanding a recent outbreak in Dundee [see ProMED-mail post
Legionellosis, hotel - UK: (Scotland) 20110327.0965], rates of
legionellosis in Scotland have changed little during the past 3
decades and continue to be similar to those reported in the United
States [see graph at:
<http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Legionella-Scotland.jpg>].

The following background data regarding Legionnaires' disease in
Scotland are abstracted from the Gideon e-book series. [1,2] (primary
references available on request).

Notable outbreaks:
1984 An outbreak (33 cases, 1 fatal) in Glasgow was ascribed to a
contaminated cooling tower.
1985 An outbreak (16 cases) at a hospital in Glasgow was ascribed to
a contaminated cooling tower.
1989 (publication year) An outbreak (187 cases) of Pontiac fever due
to _Legionella micdadei_ was associated with use of a whirlpool in
Lochgoilhead.
1994 (publication year) An outbreak (3 cases) in a hospital was
related to a contaminated water main.
1998 An outbreak (2 cases) was reported among passengers on a
Scottish cruise ship.
2004 An outbreak in West Fife was associated with proximity to
sullage tanks.
2008 to 2009 An outbreak (3 cases) of _Legionella longbeachae_
infection was associated with handling potting soil.
