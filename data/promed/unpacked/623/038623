France: 8th Case of Variant CJD Donated Blood
-------------------------------------------
It was stated on Thu 21 Oct 2004 that the French Health Ministry is tracing
10 people who had received blood transfusion from a person now diagnosed
with the fatal, human form of mad-cow disease (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy). This individual is the 8th French person to be diagnosed
with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD
(new var.) or vCJD], the health ministry said in a press release. A
ministry spokesperson said the patient is "a young person who is still
alive." The person gave blood "several times between 1993 and 2003", said
the press statement.
10 people received transfusions of red blood cells from the person "and
will be told by their doctor as to the nature of the risk and the
precautions to take", it added. Plasma from the donations was also used by
a French company, LFB, to make drugs based on blood derivatives, the
statement said. LFB has withdrawn all unused stocks of medications made
with this plasma and has told pharmacies and clinics to take any remaining
items made from suspect batches off their shelves, it said.
The ministry said the case of 2 people in Britain with vCJD pointed to an
"increased risk" of contracting the disease through blood transfusion.
However, the risk of infection through blood derivatives remained unclear,
pending the outcome of research.
vCJD is a human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in which a
rogue prion protein proliferates in the brain, turning it spongy. The
disease is believed to have leapt the species barrier to humans who ate
beef from infected cattle. The epicentre of the BSE outbreak was Britain,
which exported cattle and beef products to many countries within the
European Union and further afield. BSE came to the fore in the late 1980s,
but the source was curtailed only in 1996 with the introduction of tough
European Union-wide laws on animal feed, the slaughter of suspect animals,
and the ban on the sale of animal parts most likely to have the prions.
So far 144 people have died of vCJD in Britain, where there are also 5
suspected cases, according to figures on the official British vCJD website
(<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk>).
