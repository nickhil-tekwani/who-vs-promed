A rabies alert was sent out to residents Tuesday [29 Oct 2019] night in the Orr Road area of Mecklenburg County.

A cat in the area tested positive for rabies, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said, and a dog was exposed to the cat.

The dog was current on its rabies vaccine and has been taken for a rabies vaccination booster, officials said. There were also 2 human exposures.

This is the 13th animal in Mecklenburg County this year [2019] to test positive for rabies. Last year, there were 14 rabies cases in the county.

One person is being treated for rabies, and a litter of feral kittens has been euthanized after an Ocean View kitten tested positive for the virus, the Delaware Division of Public Health said Tuesday [5 Nov 2019].

According to the DPH, the rabies diagnosis was confirmed on Friday [1 Nov 2019]. Officials 1st suspected the kitten may have been infected after an Ocean View resident who was taking care of a litter of kittens living on their property brought the kitten to a veterinarian.

Based on the kitten's clinical signs, it was tested, and the results came back positive, DPH said. The person, who lives in the Plantation Park neighborhood, is being treated for rabies exposure.

DPH workers trapped and euthanized the remaining litter to prevent any further exposure, the typical recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians' Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control, said DPH spokeswoman Jen Brestel.

"DPH's priority is to protect the public's health," Brestel said. "The quarantine period for exposed animals in this case would be 6 months for each kitten, with each animal required to be in a separate, isolated room, with only one human caretaker and zero risk of escape.

"Because it would be difficult to meet these conditions, and DPH could not ensure the safety of the human caretaker, euthanasia is the most appropriate action in this case."

Brestel said DPH workers trapped and euthanized only the cats believed to be the littermates of the rabid kitten, and other animals were not targeted.

"DPH was not setting up traps throughout the Plantation Park community, only in a specific area where the litter of kittens was found," she said. "DPH trapped 3 kittens believed to be the littermates of the rabid kitten, as well as one adult cat, which is believed to also have had close contact with the litter of kittens."

Though DPH officials said the risk of additional human exposure to rabies is low, anyone who lives in or around the Plantation Park community who thinks they might have been bitten, scratched, or come in contact with a feral kitten should immediately call their health care provider or the DPH Rabies Program at (302) 744-4995.

Additionally, anyone in the area who thinks their pet may have been bitten by a feral kitten should call their private veterinarian or the Delaware Department of Agriculture at (302) 698-4500 or email <deanimalhealth@delaware.gov>.

Rabies is a preventable disease, and the DPH recommends residents take certain steps to prevent the possibility of contracting the virus. They include:

**All dogs, cats and ferrets 6 months and older are required by Delaware law to be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian.
**Pet owners can reduce the possibility of pets being exposed to rabies by keeping them indoors and not letting them roam free. It is especially important that pet owners who do allow their cats to roam outdoors to vaccinate their pets.
**Do not touch or otherwise handle wild or unfamiliar animals, including cats and dogs, even if they appear friendly.
**Do not keep a pet's food or water outdoors; bowls can attract wild and stray animals.
**Do not feed feral animals, including cats, as the risk of rabies in wildlife is significant.
**Spaying or neutering your pet may reduce the tendency to roam or fight and, thus, reduce the chance they will be exposed to rabies.
**Keep your garbage cans securely covered.
**Consider vaccinating livestock and horses as well.

Since 1 Jan 2019, DPH has tested 137 animals for rabies, 9 of which were confirmed to have the disease. They were 6 raccoons, 2 cats -- including the Ocean View kitten -- and a skunk.

Last year [2018], 19 out of 146 animals tested for rabies came back with positive results, 6 of which were raccoons. Five cats, 5 foxes, 1 dog, 1 horse and 1 donkey also tested positive, as well as 1 human, a Felton woman who died after contracting the disease.

[3] South Carolina - cat, human exp.

https://abcnews4.com/news/local/three-people-exposed-to-rabies-in-charleston-county-by-a-feral-cat


According to the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), 3 people were referred to their health care providers after being potentially exposed to rabies by a feral cat testing positive for the disease.

The potential exposure occurred Tuesday and Wednesday [5-6 Nov 2019] when the victims were attacked by a feral cat on a property near University Boulevard in North Charleston. The cat was taken to DHEC's laboratory for testing Wednesday where it was later confirmed to have rabies.

The cat is now the 15th animal in Charleston County to test positive for rabies this year [2019]. Statewide this year, there have been 130 cases of rabid animals.

Since 2013, South Carolina has averaged approximately 108 positive cases a year. Last year [2018], 3 of the 100 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Charleston County.

"Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite, which allows saliva from an infected animal to be introduced into the body of a person or another animal; however, saliva or neural tissue contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies," said David Vaughan, Director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division.

Vaughan says keeping pets up to date with their rabies vaccinations is the easiest and most effective way to prevent the disease.

If you believe you, family members, or pets have come into contact with this cat or another animal potentially having rabies, you are asked to call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Charleston Office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m. Monday-Friday). Be sure to immediately wash any part of your body possibly having come into contact with saliva or neural tissue with plenty of soap and water and seek medical attention.

To report outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number.

[Rabies virus remains a deadly disease which is preventable by vaccination. Take your pets for vaccination. It helps protect you too. There are extremely few people who have ever survived this disease, and their life post rabies is difficult to say the least. Please protect yourself. Please protect your pets by getting vaccinations.

Pets without vaccinations who may get bitten or get in a fight with a wild animal may well be euthanized out of precaution of keeping people safe. It is a painful way to lose a companion. Even young puppies and kittens can be infected with rabies.

What I notice in these reports is not a single article or apparently any of these communities held a rabies drive or encouraged individuals to get their pet vaccinated. Rabies is an old disease which can still take your life or the life of your pet. I am surprised these articles don't tell us more about rabies drives and urging the public to vaccinate.

The rabies virus infects the central nervous system. If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a potential rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death. Rabies can be prevented by vaccinating pets, staying away from wildlife, and seeking medical care after potential exposures before symptoms start.

After a bite or other rabies exposure, the rabies virus has to travel through the body to the brain before it can cause symptoms. This time between the exposure and the appearance of symptoms is called the incubation period, and it may last for weeks to months. The incubation period may vary based on the location of the exposure site (how far away it is from the brain), the type of rabies virus, and any existing immunity.

The 1st symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu, including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.

There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of the bite, progressing within days to acute symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia (fear of water), and insomnia. The acute period of disease typically ends after 2 to 10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive. To date, less than 20 cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been documented, and only a few survivors had no history of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis.

If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal, wash the bite/scratch with copious amounts of soap and water. Seek medical attention.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and, therefore, you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities. https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html. - Mod.TG]
