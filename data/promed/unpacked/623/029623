Rabies in France: a short report from the French National Laboratory on
Rabies and Wildlife Diseases (this is the national reference laboratory for
rabies of the French Ministry of Agriculture, OIE reference laboratory for
rabies and WHO coll. centre for zoonosis control).
The information on rabies edited by ProMED-mail (date: Thus, 30 Oct 1997)
should be updated.
Thanks to the oral vaccination program organised by the CNEVA Nancy, the
incidence of fox rabies has been decreasing at a constant rate since 1989
and rabies in foxes seems to be eliminated. The last rabies case in a fox
has been diagnosed in October 1996 close to the Belgian and German borders.
No other rabies case (except one case in a bat in March 1997) has been
recorded since 12 months now.
The vaccination program continuously monitored and adapted to the field and
epidemiological conditions consists of distributions of vaccine baits over
large areas by foot or by helicopter, and in the particular situations of
remnant foci, by combined delivery by helicopter followed by foot
distribution at the entrance of the dens occupied by foxes and fox cubs.
Two vaccines are used : a Vaccinia recombinant (VRG) and an highly
attenuated strain of the rabies virus (SAG2) . Both are currently the only
live vaccines that comply with the efficacy and safety recommendations of
WHO for oral vaccination of free ranging mammals. For preventing
re-infection from neighbouring countries (Germany), rabies vaccination
program is pursued over a strip 70 km wide along the border.Other areas are
under surveillance.
