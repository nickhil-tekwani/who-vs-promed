Documents unsealed in anthrax case
---------------------------------
A federal judge on Wednesday [6 Aug 2008] unsealed documents related
to the 2001 anthrax attacks, as the Justice Department prepared to
declare the case solved and make its evidence public. The documents
unsealed on Wednesday by Chief Judge Royce C Lamberth were being
scanned and had not been made public at 10 am.

Federal law enforcement officials said on Tuesday [5 Aug 2008] that
they planned to address the growing questions about the strength of
its evidence against a military scientist who killed himself after
investigators linked him to the attacks, Officials at the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are particularly eager to close the
case and publicly rebut accusations from defenders of the scientist,
Bruce E Ivins, that the bureau may have hounded an innocent man into
committing suicide.

Before more of the evidence is released, Justice Department officials
first want to brief relatives of many of the 5 people killed and 17
injured in the anthrax attacks.

Law enforcement officials would not discuss many details of the
investigation despite intense news media interest from around the
world. "What we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of
improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate
information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions," said Brian
Roehrkasse, a spokesman for the Justice Department. "None of that
serves the victims, their families or the public. Likewise, we will
not discuss reports or details on the timing of briefings to the
public or victims and their families. We will provide such details to
the press at the appropriate time, and not before."

Dr Ivins, who worked on anthrax vaccines for 18 years at the military
research facility at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, took a
fatal overdose of Tylenol and codeine last week [29 Jul 2008] at his
home near the base. He had been under investigation for more than a
year in the anthrax killings and had recently been told that the
Justice Department was on the verge of seeking an indictment against
him on capital murder charges.

Federal officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the
case remains under seal, said they were confident that Dr Ivins was
the anthrax killer and that he had acted alone. They said that new
scientific methods had allowed the FBI to trace the genetic makeup of
the anthrax sample to Dr Ivins and a pool of about 10 other people
who had access to a particular supply of anthrax at Fort Detrick.
Other evidence, much of it still undisclosed, amounted to a strong
circumstantial case against him, the officials said. Perhaps the most
provocative piece of evidence to emerge publicly is the testimony of
a therapist who treated Dr Ivins in recent months and described him
as homicidal.

But Dr Ivins's lawyer has asserted his innocence, and a number of
colleagues at Fort Detrick have defended him, saying that his recent
mental state and his suicide were the result of many months of
near-constant surveillance and scrutiny by the FBI, not a reflection
of his guilt.

Some government officials have also questioned the strength of the
bureau's case and said they were eager to see the grand jury documents.

One Congressional official briefed on the case said he was not
persuaded that the FBI had made a credible case in singling out Dr
Ivins in the group of people at Fort Detrick who had access to
anthrax samples linked to the 2001 attacks. The FBI may be able to
point to odd behavior on the part of Dr Ivins, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is under seal. But
he said the attention the bureau focused on Dr Ivins was reminiscent
of a past misstep: "It looks like what they did to Hatfill. Ivins was
the weirdest one."

Friends and colleagues, meanwhile, have offered a fuller account of
Dr Ivins's difficult last 9 months, saying that he was so distraught
by the FBI's constant scrutiny that he began drinking excessively and
had to be hospitalized twice for periods of weeks for substance
abuse. A friend and fellow member of a 12-step program for alcoholics
who spent hours counseling him said Dr Ivins, who at least in recent
years had not been a drinker, went rapidly downhill after the FBI
searched his house and questioned his wife and children last November [2007].

The friend, a fellow scientist who spoke on the condition that he not
be named, said Dr Ivins had repeatedly denied sending the anthrax
letters and was particularly upset at what he considered to be the
FBI's aggressive questioning of his children, both 24, as
investigators tried to get them to turn on their father. "He said,
'I'm innocent of these charges,' " the friend said. "He was
absolutely shocked they were going after him like this." Through much
of the year, the friend said, Dr Ivins was drinking large amounts of
vodka, combined with Ambien and prescription tranquilizers. After
being found unconscious in his home in March [2008], he spent 4 weeks
in a treatment program at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.
After that he spent another 4 weeks in treatment at the Thomas B
Finan Center in Cumberland, Maryland, being released to go home to
Frederick in late May [2008]. Judging from periodic phone calls in
which Dr Ivins often appeared to be intoxicated, the friend said he
believed Dr Ivins was drinking again between May and July [2008],
when he was admitted for 2 weeks to a psychiatric facility.

Law enforcement officials said they were confident that the FBI had
handled the investigation appropriately and had used proper
procedures in questioning witnesses and keeping Dr Ivins under surveillance.

Re: ProMED-mail Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA (03) 20080805.2406
-------------------------------------------------------------
The report overlooks some important bits of incriminating evidence
and that is an analysis of the spores used showed that they were
unique and of 2 types:
1. the Ames strain from USAMRIID [United States Army Medical Research
Institute for Infectious Diseases]
and
2. spores from Dunlap (Utah) Army Proving Ground

The spores contained in the letters were genotyped by a very
sophisticated high-resolution device by Ibis Bioscience Lab in
Carlsbad, California. This technology has only recently been made available.

Ivins admitted to the FBI during their follow-up investigation in
2002 that he used the same 2 spore types for his vaccine challenge.
He named them as the Ames and Dunlop samples. These same 2 spore
types were indeed found in Ivins's lab and on his glassware thusly
confirming his statement and confirming their unique identity with
the bioterrorist envelopes.

The "milling" was done by the post office roller machines so that the
last letter that had the longest post office route, therefore being
milled most, was the best "weaponized" sample. The others were less
"milled" so to speak. One could start out with a simple lyophilized
sample and after the post office machines processed the envelopes,
they were near military grade. That weaponization was likely
unintended, incidental, and unplanned by the perp.

[Obviously these comments may be premature subject to the details yet
to be revealed in the Department of Justice documents, but if Bruce
had been knowingly using 2 different Ames strains during his prior
vaccine challenge trials he would have been bonkers to use the same
strains, mixed or separate, in the 2001 letter events (if he were
responsible) knowing what he knew then about contemporary genomic
progress and future possible developments in the molecular
identification of _Bacillus anthracis_. If the letter products came
from his laboratory it would not have been him. The FBI has fingered
the wrong man.

The cause of Stevens' death in Florida was publicly announced and
there was a 24-hour or longer gap before the next batch of letters
was posted and therefore the deed of 2nd posting was patently a
murder attempt on multiple individuals, which was not in his
character. - Mod.MHJ]
