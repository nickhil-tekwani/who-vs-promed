[According to the OIE WAHID database, Israel, which also identified a subclinical infection of Maedi-Visna virus, and Mongolia, where the disease was suspected but not confirmed, are the only other countries in Asia reporting the disease.

Maedi" is Icelandic for labored breathing; "Visna" means paralysis and wasting, and refers to the progressive CNS degeneration in affected animals. Maedi-visna was 1st described in Iceland in the 1950s by Bjorn Sigurdsson.

The disease, which usually occurs after sheep are 4 years old or more, is characterized by wasting and progressive difficulty breathing, thus sometimes being referred to as ovine progressive pneumonia. It is caused by a lentivirus similar to the CAE virus in goats and there is often a wide variation in seroprevalence within countries and regions. Only Australia and New Zealand are free of the disease. - Mod.PC]
