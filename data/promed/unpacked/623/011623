Suspected meningitis has forced more than a 100 people into hospital beds in Astana, Tengrinews reports. According to the Department of Consumer Protection of the capital of Kazakhstan, 160 people have been hospitalized in 1 month.

"As of 25 Jul 2014, there were 160 patients in hospitals' in-patient wards with symptoms that do not exclude meningitis. Since 1 Jul 2014, after clinical examination 139 patients have been diagnosed with serous meningitis. Of them, 50 cases are laboratory-confirmed," the Department said in a response to a formal inquiry from Tengrinews.

The Department assured that it was not an outbreak but a seasonal rise, since there was a similar number of cases during the same period of last year [2013]. The number of cases peaked in July. The majority -- 95 percent -- of those diagnosed with meningitis were children under the age of 14.

"No instances of group contagion have been registered; therefore, restrictive measures are not necessary," the Department said in response to a question on whether educational institutions and kindergartens had to be quarantined.

"The Health Department ensured timely hospitalization of the patients with serous meningitis. In cases of serous meningitis caused by enterovirus, disinfection measures in crowded places are not required as personal hygiene is enough to eliminate the non-percutaneous channel of the infection," the agency said.

Virological investigators tested 11 samples from fountains, 16 samples from surface water reservoirs, and 10 samples of sewage water. Only one sewage water sample showed enterovirus, indicating circulation of the virus in the external environment.

The Department called the citizens to carefully [follow] the general preventive measures to reduce the risk of catching the enterovirus infection.

These are: drink only bottled water or boiled tap water; wash hands with soap before each meal and after each visit to the toilet; strictly observe the rules of personal and public hygiene; wash fruit and vegetables with a brush before eating them, swim only in officially designated places; abstain from purchasing food products of unclear origin or away from officially designated trading areas.

[Bacterial] meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Viral meningitis occurs more often than bacterial meningitis, and is milder. It usually occurs in the late summer and early fall. It most often affects children and adults under age 30. Symptoms usually come on quickly, and may include: fever and chills, mental status changes, nausea and vomiting, sensitivity to light (photophobia), severe headache, stiff neck, agitation, bulging fontanelles in babies, decreased alertness, poor feeding or irritability in children, rapid breathing, unusual posture, with the head and neck arched backwards.

The heath department specifically urged people not to reserve to self-treatment but to immediately see a doctor in case of noticing the symptoms.

[The term "meningitis" means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. "Serous" meningitis is a term used when clinical findings (such as a stiff neck) suggest meningitis, but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), although under increased pressure, is clear to the naked eye (http://www.bmj.com/content/2/3691/627.3).

Normally, there are 0 to 5 white cells (all mononuclear cells) per cmm [per cubic millimeter] in the CSF. CSF becomes cloudy when there are more than 500 white cells per cmm. When the CSF is visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating, the term aseptic meningitis is used.

As stated in the news report above, the most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection and enteroviruses are usually the cause of viral meningitis, especially in children during the summer months. However, aseptic meningitis may be caused by other viruses, such as arboviruses, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, some bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Non-infectious causes include certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and systemic diseases, such as lupus, sarcoidosis, and metastatic cancer.

Most people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person through fecal contamination of water or food or contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Enteroviruses can also be spread through respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person.

Astana is the capital of Kazakhstan since 1997, and is the country's 2nd largest city (after Almaty, the former capital) with an estimated population of 814 401 in 2014; it is located in the north portion of Kazakhstan, within Akmola Province (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astana). - Mod.ML]
