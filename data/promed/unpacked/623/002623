A positive case of Japanese encephalitis has been reported from Bhavani
Nagar, Talabkatta, district health authorities on Wednesday [21 Apr 2010]
confirmed. An 8 month old baby girl was diagnosed with JE and was treated
at Niloufer hospital. The baby girl has suffered partial paralysis to the
right side of her body, authorities said.

Japanese encephalitis is an ailment [caused by] a virus transmitted by
_Culex_ mosquitoes causing inflammation of the membranes in human brain.
Health authorities pointed out that the mosquitoes are getting infected
with the JE virus from pigs, which are present in large numbers in
Talabkatta area.

Usually, according to authorities, JE virus [JEV] reproduces in pigs and
mosquitoes get infected when they feed and take blood meals from pigs. The
JE virus spills over to the community when the infected mosquito starts
biting human population. [Large aquatic habitat birds, such as herons, are
wildlife reservoirs of JEV. - Mod.TY]

Preventive measures
-------------------
To prevent outbreak of JE in and around Talabkatta, district health
authorities conducted a health camp on Wednesday [21 Apr 2010] and took up
house to house survey of the area. The health authorities collected 53
blood smears. "We covered nearly 70 houses and distributed medicines,
including Homeo preventive medicines, for children below 15 years. We have
requested GHMC [Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation] authorities to
isolate pigs in the locality," said district medical and health officer Dr
Ch Jaya Kumari.

[One wonders if the report of blood smears, rather than blood samples for
JEV serology, is accurate. Perhaps they are looking for malaria infections
as well. Isolating pigs outside the flight range of _Culex_ mosquitoes may
prove a difficult task logistically. It is curious that no mention is made
of applying JEV vaccine if this case is indicative of potential risk of an
outbreak.
