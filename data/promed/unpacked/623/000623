-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In a number of instances in previous posts, but not in the current one, it has been stated that suspicion of yellow fever was ruled out because the patients had been vaccinated. It is certainly true that many causes of illness mimicking yellow fever exist. One of these is the rare occurrence of reactions to the vaccine itself. Such cases have been labeled yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) (Seligman SJ. Risk groups for yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD). Vaccine 2014;32:5769-75). No cases of YEL-AVD have been laboratory-confirmed in Africa. All of the laboratory-confirmed cases of YEL-AVD have occurred either in South America or in prospective travelers.

One knows that responding to an ongoing yellow fever epidemic with mass vaccination campaigns and with mosquito control measures is extremely challenging. However, if cases mimicking yellow fever occur in vaccinated persons, specimens should be sent for viral culture and tissue preserved by freezing. If the virus turns out to be vaccine-like rather than yellow fever, the diagnosis of YEL-AVD is confirmed and tissue sent for study to see if there is a genetic immune defect that predisposes to YEL-AVD (Seligman SJ, Casanova JL. Yellow fever vaccine: worthy friend or stealthy foe? Expert Rev Vaccines 2016;15:681-91).

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Seligman for his comments. Based on experience with yellow fever vaccinations in South America and in travelers, as Dr. Seligman noted, now with over 10 million individuals vaccinated in Angola and the DR Congo, one might expect a few cases of YEL-AVD to have occurred. Confirming them would require laboratory support sophisticated enough to do the genotyping and comparisons. That might require prior arrangements with a WHO reference laboratory, perhaps the Institut Pasteur laboratory in Senegal. - Mod.TY
