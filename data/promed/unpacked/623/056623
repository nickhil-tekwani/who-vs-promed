The Taiwan Department of Disease Control announced the 1st case of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in the country. According to the news release (computer translated), the patient is a 70-year-old male in the north who has not recently gone abroad but is often active in mountainous areas.

On [2 Nov 2019], due to repeated fever and vomiting symptoms, he went to the clinic for medical treatment. Later, due to rash and consciousness change, he was sent to hospital on [3 Nov 2019] and admitted. He was suspected of having dengue fever.

The test was judged to be SFTS virus-positive on the evening of [13 Nov 2019], and the expert meeting held yesterday [18 Nov 2019] confirmed the virus sequence and the date. Korean epidemic strains are similar to this Taiwan case.

A total of 68 contacts will be monitored until the end of the month [November 2019].

This is the 1st SFTS case reported in Taiwan. Cases have been previously reported in China, Japan, and South Korea.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a newly emerging infectious disease. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities are fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and elevated serum enzyme levels. Multiorgan failure occurs in severe cases, and 6%-30% of patients die. The syndrome is caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV) (genus _Phlebovirus_, family Phenuiviridae).

Ixodid tick species are implicated as vectors of SFTSV.

[Cases of SFTS are being detected in new areas in Asia since it was first reported in China in 2009. At that time, researchers identified the virus responsible in blood samples from a cluster of people who shared a combination of symptoms that included high fever, gastrointestinal problems, low white blood cell count, and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). The virus killed 30 percent of those infected in China that year. It was even more lethal when the 1st cases appeared in Japan and South Korea in 2013. More than one-third of those infected in Japan and nearly half of those infected in South Korea died that year. Now a case of that virus infection has occurred in Taiwan.

SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well, so the previous numbers may be an underestimate of the total number of infections. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, but that appears to be a rare event. The virus is doubtless endemic in several countries in Asia, and cases have occurred previously in Japan. Apparently, there are 2 previously reported affected individuals who acquired their infections directly from an SFTS virus-infected cat. No mention was made of tick transmission in that instance. The possible route of transmission from the cat to the veterinarian and veterinary nurse via exposure to blood or other bodily fluids is not mentioned (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - East Asia (02): Japan (MZ) 20181211.6204927).

The Asian longhorn tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, is a vector of SFTS virus. Interestingly, this tick has recently been found for the 1st time in several states in eastern USA, but fortunately, without evidence that they carry SFTS virus.

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of an _H. longicornis_ tick, the SFTS vector, can be seen at https://entomologytoday.org/2018/04/24/invasive-tick-persists-new-jersey/. - Mod.TY
