BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, TV PROGRAM - USA

ABC News has announced an edition of their program "Prime Time Live", which
will focus on biological weaponry. The program, scheduled for Wednesday,
Feb. 25, is hosted by Diane Sawyer. Included is a discussion with the
former Deputy Director of the Civilians Biological Warfare Program for the
Soviet Union and an interview with Larry Wayne Harris, one of the men
arrested by the FBI last week for alleged possession of anthrax; that
interview had been conducted in New York prior to Harris' arrest.
It is to be expected that the program will be somewhat sensationalistic but
it does cover areas of interest to ProMED-mail subscribers.
