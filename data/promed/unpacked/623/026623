The cooler weather and shorter days of fall have sent the species of
mosquitoes that can carry malaria searching for places to hibernate for the
winter, which could delay until spring plans for aerial spraying to kill
the infected insects, health officials and bug experts said yesterday.
Officials in Maryland also said a third pool of malaria-carrying mosquitoes
has been discovered in Montgomery County as part of an ongoing testing
program led by military mosquito experts. The latest pool was found on Van
Deventer Island, a small sliver of land in the Potomac River beside Selden
Island, where positive mosquitoes had been found. The anopheline mosquitoes
that can carry malaria tend not to fly unless it's about 55 degrees F after
sunset. And forecasts are for cold nights to continue. Health officials in
Loudoun County, the jurisdiction closest to the islands, met with area
residents yesterday and said the latest discovery does not change their
plans for addressing the rare, U.S.-based malaria outbreak that sickened 2
Loudoun teenagers this summer.
Already, the weather and the loss of daylight are nudging mosquitoes to
seek shelter for the winter, and that is complicating spraying plans.
Officials are planning to continue their surveillance into next
year. Winter affects species of mosquitoes differently, and the insects
have different strategies of over-wintering, experts noted. "Cold weather
isn't favourable to any mosquito species at this latitude," said David
Gaines, entomologist for the Virginia Department of Health. For example,
the adult aedes mosquito, one of the many species that can carry the West
Nile virus, "will pretty much disappear" after the first couple of frosts,
he said. The aedes over winters in the egg stage, Gaines added. Anopheline
mosquitoes overwinter as adults. They seek warm places, such as barns,
holes in trees, storm drains, and nooks under houses, for hibernation. In
general, winter weather does not harm them "unless they happen to choose a
shelter that was not ideal," he said, adding that the creatures have become
well attuned to various climates. "They've had millions of years to adapt,"
Gaines said.
Anopheline mosquitoes can survive temperatures of 15 degrees F below
freezing, said Col. Daniel Strickman, chief of entomology at the Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research. "They have a natural antifreeze that
keeps them liquid inside," he said. Strickman said the insects can
sometimes be seen emerging again even before winter's end. "Some might
start flitting around in February or March. But the bulk won't become
active until April or May," he said. Hundreds of mosquitoes have been
already found in tree holes in Maryland, suggesting that many have found
places to hibernate, Strickman said. If warm nights return soon, many
anophelines could head out again to look for food, experts said. Health
officials from Maryland and Virginia said they have found no additional
human cases of the disease since the Loudoun teenagers were infected. So
far 31 workers from a Selden Island sod farm have been tested for malaria,
and other area residents should undergo checks if they have the intense
fevers and chills associated with the disease or if they spent much time
near the islands at night, health officials said.

[The article focuses on the ability of the mosquito to stay alive at low
temperatures, but the important aspect here is the survival of the
parasite, which requires a 24-hour average temperature of 16C. The risk for
new cases is therefore decreasing with lower ambient temperatures. Even if
the mosquitoes start to appear in March and April, a new _P. vivax_
gametocyte carrier is required to reinfect the mosquito pool and adequate
temperatures to allow the parasite to develop within the mosquito. The
focus in the article is entirely on spraying for mosquitoes, but a targeted
survey of humans with a history of residence in a _P.vivax_-endemic country
would probably be more effective. Lastly, it should be noted that for
non-immunes, _P. vivax_ causes serious disease, which although it has a
lower mortality than _P. falciparum_, still is very unpleasant. - Mod.EP]
