Influenza update - 324 (based on data up to 2 Sep 2018)
-------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained elevated in South America and appeared to decrease in Southern Africa. Influenza activity remained at low seasonal levels in Australia and New Zealand and at inter-seasonal levels in most of temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. Decreased influenza activity was reported in most countries of tropical America. Worldwide, seasonal influenza subtype A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 81 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 20 Aug 2018 to 2 Sep 2018 (data as of 14 Sep 2018 04:22:09 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 47 128 specimens during that time period. 1934 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1597 (82.6 percent) were typed as influenza A and 337 (17.4%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 761 (64.9%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 412 (35.1%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 81 (66.9 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 40 (33.1 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System), FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[The detailed influenza update is available at http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2018_09_17_surveillance_update_324.pdf.

Overall, low or inter-seasonal level activity is reported in most parts of the southern and northern hemispheres, except South America. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B-Yamagata lineage predominated in the reporting period. - Mod.UBA]
