Influenza B virus outbreak closes schools in Kentucky
-----------------------------------------------------
A flu outbreak has forced schools in Kentucky and neighboring states to
shut down in recent weeks. Thousands of children have fallen ill. Health
officials attribute the outbreak in part to a new [strain] of influenza
virus spreading around the country. At least 2 districts in Kentucky and 4
in Tennessee have closed, and schools in Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa,
and Mississippi also have reported a rash of sick students. An elementary
school in Bloomington, Indiana, reported last week that 40 per cent of its
217 students were absent. Last week in Georgia, nearly a third of the
pupils in Glynn County's 18 schools were out with flu-like illnesses.
Last week "it was hitting our middle school and one of our elementaries the
hardest, and then this week it hits the high school and our other
elementary school," said Gerald Fulk, of Mason County Schools in north
eastern Kentucky. In western Kentucky, schools in Ballard County were
closed for the rest of the week after attendance dipped below 75 per cent.
The strain of influenza B virus had until recently had been reported only
in South East Asia, said Alicia Postema, an epidemiologist at the United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "Kids that are 12
or younger have probably not seen a virus similar to the influenza B virus
that's circulating this year," Postema said. "That's one of the reasons I
think kids are getting hit particularly hard." Though most people recover
in one or 2 weeks, influenza can be deadly. About 36 000 people die from
the virus each year, according to CDC.
