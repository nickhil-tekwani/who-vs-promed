[1] Banana bacterial wilt - Kenya: confirmed, (Teso, Busia)

The banana wilt disease has been reported in Teso and Busia districts in
Kenya. Teso district agricultural officer Linnet Kibisu said the disease
had attacked Malaba, Chakol, and Busia, where people easily cross from
Uganda into Kenya.

Kibisu said the banana wilt disease was reported in Uganda some years back
and the government had tried to curb it. In 2001, the banana wilt disease
was reported in over 32 districts in Uganda. "The disease can be spread by
people, birds and animals from Uganda," the official said on Friday [6 Jun
2008]. Kibisu revealed that a quarantine had been imposed on a farm in
Busia district. The owner of the farm was banned from selling banana, she
added.

Insects are thought to be the most common vector of transmission at the
field level. Infected plants produce ooze, which is rich in the bacteria.
It drips from natural scars associated with the male bud of the plant.
Insects feeding on the bud carry the bacteria to other plants. Spread over
longer distances is more likely to be by human intervention. "Bacteria can
easily be carried on tools used to cut infected plants, so a farmer may
inadvertently transfer the disease while trying to control it," Kibisu added.

[2] Banana bacterial wilt - Uganda: spread

The volume of banana taken to markets has, over the years, continued to
decrease. This is partly attributed to attack by the deadly banana
bacterial wilt disease, also known as _Xanthomonas_. This comes as a global
food crisis continues to hit the world hard as well as the livelihoods of
millions of Ugandans, most of whom depend on bananas. Their food crop
continues to be threatened by current outbreaks of banana bacterial wilt
disease.

In the last 8 months, the disease has been reported in close to 10
districts in the country, with district Agricultural Officers calling for
immediate intervention to combat the disease. In Ntungamo district, parts
of 3 sub-counties have been badly hit, and some affected plantations have
been destroyed, while technical and political sensitization on the disease
is going on in a move to eradicate it.

In Rukungiri district, the dreaded banana bacterial wilt ravaged banana
plantations in 7 out of 11 sub counties, putting the banana industry at a
big risk of being wiped out. In Kasese district, banana bacterial wilt
disease [BBWD] destroyed close to 100 acres of crops in the past 8 months.
In Kanungu district, the disease was detected in plantations in 3
sub-counties as well as in Kanungu Town Council some few months ago.

The Ugandan government says banana bacterial wilt disease is the number one
plant disease problem in Uganda. The disease can potentially devastate
thousands of acres of banana crop, on which millions of Ugandans depend for
their daily sustenance. It is important that farmers learn to recognize and
watch out for signs and the possible presence of the disease.

Characteristics of this disease include yellowing and wilting of the plant
starting with the peripheral leaves. After wilting, the leaves tend to
droop, and the plant eventually stops growing and dies. Some of the steps
to fight this disease include destroying banana plants that are affected by
the disease and burying the whole affected plant.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of banana
bacterial wilt (BBW) in Uganda and other East African countries. It also
causes a wilt disease of enset (_Ensete_ species, family _Musaceae_), a
root staple food used, for example, in Ethiopia. The pathogen affects all
banana types and causes wilting and premature ripening of the fruit. An
incidence of 70-80 per cent in many plantations and yield losses of up to
90 per cent have been reported.

The pathogen survives in soil and plant debris and is mainly spread via
infected planting material, insects, mechanical means, and contaminated
farm tools. A range of alternate crop and weed hosts including cereals,
cabbage, tobacco, and ornamentals may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease
management techniques such as removal and burning of all diseased plants,
removal of spent male flowers and use of clean tools have been successful
in reducing the number of new infections on individual farms. Nevertheless,
BBW continues to spread in the region.

A banana wilt was reported from Kenya's Teso district last year [2007], but
clarification on whether it was bacterial or fungal could not be obtained
at the time (see previous ProMED-mail posts no. 20070407.1169 and
20070415.1256). From the report above, it now appears more likely that it
already may have been BBWD.

In Uganda, the disease started in Mukono district (Central Region) in 2001
and has been spreading since. BBW has inflicted damage by reducing cropped
area by 13 per cent between 2001 and 2004, causing production to decline by
between 65 and 80 per cent in the affected areas. Conservative estimates
indicate an annual USD 4 billion loss if BBWD is not controlled. The
disease is a significant concern in the region, jeopardizing food security.
