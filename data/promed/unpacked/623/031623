Two beef cattle in Kentucky have tested positive for bovine
tuberculosis, and state veterinarian Robert Stout says results are
pending on a 3rd animal.

Stout said [Wed 26 May 2010] that the 2 infected cows were in a
Fleming County herd in northern Kentucky, but he said the 3 animals
didn't enter the food supply.

He said the disease was discovered when a cow from the farm was
slaughtered in Pennsylvania and tested positive. Stout said the rest
of the herd was tested, and 2 other cattle were suspected of having
the disease. One tested positive for the disease.

Stout said Kentucky has been classified as free of bovine
tuberculosis since 1987. He said that status would likely not change
if no other animals test positive in the next 6 months.

Bovine tuberculosis causes severe coughing, fatigue, emaciation, and
debilitation in cattle and results in reduced milk and meat
production.

Humans can catch the disease from contact with infected cattle, but
that's rare.

[Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. While
there are other _Mycobacterium_ spp, _M. bovis_ and _M. tuberculosis_
are among the most important, as these tend to move between animals
and people.

Disease caused by mycobacteria often develop very slowly and may take
months to years to develop. These bacteria grow very slowly and only
replicate every 12-20 hours. While the pathogenic species (those
which can cause disease) such as _M. tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ can
infect a human or an animal, often the individual does not know that
he has been infected. In humans, those infected but without active
disease can be treated to prevent disease from occurring. To prevent
other animals from being infected, a diseased animal must be culled
from the herd.

The disease primarily affects the respiratory tract but can also
spread to other parts of the body. The primary route of transmission
is the exchange of respiratory secretions between infected and
uninfected animals. This can be achieved through nose-to-nose contact
or by the inhalation of aerosol droplets that have been exhaled by an
infected animal. Animals may also become infected with _M. bovis_ by
ingesting the bacteria. This could occur by ingesting feeds that have
been contaminated with _M. bovis_ by other infected animals.
Carnivores may become infected with bovine TB by eating infected
carcasses.

Various factors affect the efficiency in which _M. bovis_ is spread
within a cattle herd. The number of infected animals shedding the
organism, as well as the number of susceptible animals present within
a herd can have an impact on the transmission of the bacteria. For
example, the more animals within a herd that are shedding _M. bovis_,
the greater the chance of an uninfected animal coming into contact
with an infected animal. The animal density of a herd also influences
the efficiency of _M. bovis_ transmission. Transmission of _M. bovis_
among animals housed in confinement facilities may be greater because
of close contact. Cattle infected with bovine TB may shed bacteria in
their feces, urine and milk, but these are felt to be a minor source
of bacterial transmission.

Environmental contamination with _M. bovis_ may play a role in the
spread of bovine TB. Survival of _M. bovis_ in the environment is
primarily affected by exposure to sunlight. Reports on the length of
survival of _M. bovis_ vary from 18-332 days at temperatures ranging
from 54-75 deg F (12-24 deg C). Under laboratory conditions, _M.
bovis_ has been isolated for up to 8 weeks from various feeds kept at
75 deg F (24 deg C) and 14 weeks from various feeds kept at 32 deg F
(0 deg C). However, under field conditions, it is difficult to
isolate _M. bovis_ from pastures grazed by animals known to be
infected with bovine TB.

Kentucky will be tracing all animals having moved into the herd of
origin (trace-ins) as well all animals that have moved out of the
herd of origin (trace-outs). If they find more animals that are not
related to this herd, there free status may be in jeopardy.
