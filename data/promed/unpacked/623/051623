[Organic] sesame products coming from Burkina Faso have been blocked
from entering the European Union (EU) due to contamination with
_Salmonella sp_.
The 2 operators concerned, along with the support of Helvetas Burkina
Faso, organized a round table with all of those involved with the
sesame network on Wed 8 Feb 2006 at the Ran Hotel in Ouagadougou in
order to set up a series of measures to confront the risks of contamination.
The _Salmonella sp_ are bacteria that cause diseases such as typhoid
fever and paratyphoid fever as well as other gastroenteridities. This
bacterium is responsible for the nightmare confronting BurkiNature
limited liability company and Sopradex, export firms of organically
grown sesame seed, and the remainder of the sesame network in Burkina
Faso. Since 2005, analyses conducted at the entry point to the EU
market revealed, according to the director of BurkiNature -- Claude
Bovey, the presence of _Salmonella sp_ in the sesame seed [products].
Result: containers of BurkiNature and Sopradex have not received a
visa for entry into the European market. In response to this there
are 2 possible solutions: treat the sesame at a relatively high cost
or return it to the exporter. According to Claude Bovey, one of the
clients opted for the 1st solution so as not to loose
everything. Conscious of the problem, the 2 operators concerned
have, with the financial and technical support of Helvetas Burkina
Faso, decided to inform the network members about the bacterium but
above all to exchange certain measures in order to reduce the risk of
contamination of the organic sesame by salmonella.
The director of BurkiNature explained that different prophylactic
measures were proposed from harvest up through exportation in order
to avoid the aforementioned contamination. The purpose behind the
round table discussions is to provide a platform for presentation of
proposed instruments and methods of prevention against salmonella
contamination of the sesame products. This work was conducted with
the assistance of research institutes, laboratories and Burkinabe
organizations. A question that was raised was whether the
recommendation to forgo the use of pesticides as done in organic
farming, leads to insect free fields in which the salmonella will develop?
Not at all, replied the Director of the Helvetas Burkina Faso
Program, Daniel Valenghi, who specified that salmonellosis is not a
disease of plants but rather comes from the action of animals and of
man. According to him, the dirty hands and/or the poultry waste
material which often contain the salmonella organisms are a more
favorable means for contamination of the sesame, whether
conventionally or organically grown. The players in the sesame
network must pay attention to the presence of salmonella which will
one day also affect the conventional sesame.
