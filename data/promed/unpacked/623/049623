A deadly tropical fungus that 1st colonized eastern Vancouver Island
is now believed to have spread to the Lower Mainland.

Researchers say the number of cases of infected people and animals in
Greater Vancouver and the lower Fraser Valley suggests _Cryptococcus
gattii_ has crossed Georgia Strait. Since 1999 a total of 217 British
Columbia (BC) residents have been infected with cryptococcal disease,
a lung infection that can result when people or animals breathe in
airborne spores released by the fungus. Eight people have died.

"There are an increasing number of people who live on the mainland
who are getting sick," said Dr Eleni Galanis, an epidemiologist with
the BC Centre for Disease Control.

Until recently, researchers thought those people encountered the
fungus while travelling on Vancouver Island or in the tropics, not
close to home.

But 6 people who hadn't travelled anywhere the fungus is found were
infected between 2004 and 2006 -- one from the Sunshine Coast, 2 from
Greater Vancouver, and 3 from the Fraser Valley. "We are certain they
were exposed on the mainland," Dr Galanis said.

Soil, air, and tree sample tests have so far found the fungus is
mainly entrenched around Courtenay, Parksville, Duncan, parts of
Victoria, and Saltspring Island. Most Lower Mainland samples taken
have come back negative, but "transient" positive tests show the
fungus was at least temporarily present at sites in northern Langley
and southern Chilliwack. It's not clear why the fungus has been
detected only very rarely and sporadically in the Lower Mainland. "It
may only temporarily come to the mainland and doesn't take hold,"
Galanis said. "Or it's present here only in patches or low
concentrations that we haven't really been able to find easily." She
said 34 BC residents were infected in 2007 -- the most in any year to
date. She still counts the illness as very rare, but calls it "quite
serious" and says doctors and the public should be aware of it.

For some infected people there are no symptoms and the disease might
only be detected via a routine chest X-ray. Others can become very
sick, suffering from pneumonia or meningitis. Most victims complain
of headaches, fevers, night sweats, and coughing. It's readily
treated through several months of anti-fungal medication, Galanis said.

People in affected areas shouldn't change their habits or make
attempts to avoid the fungus, she said. "We encourage people to
continue to enjoy the outdoors," she said. "The advantages of that
vastly outweigh the risks of getting this infection." _C. gattii_ can
also infect dogs, cats, livestock, and marine mammals. Veterinarians
are asked to watch for cases in animals that could be a prelude to
human infections. The fungus may have crossed over from Vancouver
Island by way of someone's boots or vehicle tires. Galanis said the
fungus has recently spread south into Washington State but added it
is not likely to spread much farther in BC because it requires a very
mild but dry coastal climate. It's mainly found in South America,
Africa, and southeast Asia. BC is the 1st temperate area it has colonized.

[The spread of _Cryptococcus gattii_ has been described recently in
the paper by S Kidd et al: _Cryptococcus gattii_ dispersal
mechanisms, British Columbia, Canada. Emerg Infect Dis 2007; 13: 51-7
(available at <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/13/1/51.htm>). It seems
that the spread is related to traffic routes, and if this is true, it
is not surprising that the infection spreads to the mainland. - Mod.EP]

[While "boots" are a possible mode of spread it may well prefer to be
wind-borne. Once a source has reached a threshold level of _C.
gattii_ contamination, the probability of downwind spread
significantly increases from possible and intermittent to probable
with secondary cases. According to the UBC (University of British
Columbia) website: "_C. gattii_ was 1st identified in the environment
in March of 2002, among trees in Parksville on Vancouver Island,
close to the homes of some of the humans and animals who had been
infected with the fungus. Since then many different types of trees
have tested positive for _C. gattii_ on Vancouver Island. Dr Karen
Bartlett and her research team have established the presence of _C.
gattii_ on trees, in soil, in the air, and in water at many different
areas of Vancouver Island. Recently, _C. gattii_ has been detected in
air samples on the BC lower mainland."
<http://www.cher.ubc.ca/cryptococcus/new/default.htm>

In their research, "Since 2002 more than 3000 different trees in BC
have been tested for _C. gattii_, and approximately 240 have tested
positive. The trees that have tested positive to _C. gattii_ belong
to more than 10 different species, including Douglas-fir, arbutus,
red cedar, red alder, Garry oak, and maple, and are located in many
different areas of Vancouver Island and BC. In addition we have
identified _C. gattii_ in soil, air, and water samples from many
different parts of BC."

There is an excellent map of the human and animal cases during
1999-2006. They have found twice as many cats as dogs affected, as
well as recovering the organism from the nasal passages of BC
squirrels, horses, dogs, and cats, which would reinforce the concept
of airborne risk and spread. In addition one of their graduate
students, Sunny Mak, has been niche modelling, presumably using GARP
(Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction) , the geographic
distribution of _C. gattii_ in BC. This should, by extension, show
where the organism should be looked for in adjoining areas and in
Washington State.
(The thesis reference is: S Mak et al, 2007: Ecological niche
modeling of _Cryptococcus gattii_ in British Columbia, Canada. MSc
Thesis. Department of Geography, University of British Columbia,
Vancouver, Canada -- available at
<http://gis.esri.com/library/userconf/proc07/papers/abstracts/a1204.html>.
The data for the niche modelling can be found at
<http://www.bccdc.org/downloads/pdf/epid/reports/envtal_sampling_2001-2006b.pdf>,
which is a subset of <http://www.bccdc.org/topic.php?item=109>).

This is very similar to what we have been doing in Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan. It works like a charm. Obviously there is something
special in the contaminated sites that allows the _C. gattii_ to
thrive there and not a few hundred metres away. We found that it is
far better to map on the vectors than on the human or animal cases. I
suspect that this is the case in BC. Plus, there seems to be an
addition human risk of exposure to recent tree felling and similar
environmental disturbances.

While the Canadians make much of dirty pickup truck tires, muddy
boots, etc., my background and research in biometeorology makes me
think that this fungus is much happier flying than hitching lifts. Of
course how did it get from Australia to Victoria, BC? ... I would
plump for contaminated timber, specifically shipping pallets. These
have been proven to be ideal transporters for a range of botanical
threats, including moths. US ports have moth traps set up to monitor
for free riders and you would be amazed at what they pick up. - Mod.MHJ]
