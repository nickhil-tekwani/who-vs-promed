Blight destroys coconut crop
----------------------------
The blight that affected coconut crops in the South has resulted in a
40 percent drop in coconut production in the region.

The blight (yellowish rotting of coconut leaves) which commenced from
Weligama in the Matara district resulted in 332 152 coconut trees
being completely destroyed affecting an area of around 16 000 acres
[approx 6500 ha]. The loss resulting from the blight so far has been
estimated at Rs. 152 million [approx. USD 1.32 million] while the
loss to the economy as a whole is Rs. 7970 million [approx. USD 69 million].

Coconut Research Board Chairman Prof. Chitrangani Jayasekera said
they had no alternative but to cut down all affected coconut trees.
The areas where the disease has been most widespread are Weligama,
Kamburugamuwa, Matara, Dickwella and Hakmana, Kirinda Puhulwella and
Walasmulla across Hakmana and from Hakmana to Beliatta and Tangalla
[in Hambantota district]. That stretch has been declared a disease zone.

[2] Lethal yellowing - Mozambique: (Zambezia) spread

Funds to save palm plantations in Mozambique fall short
-------------------------------------------------------
The funding to control diseases that are decimating the palm
plantations in Mozambique's Zambezia province is not enough to deal
with the magnitude of the problem, according to Mozambican newspaper Noticias.

The paper reported that lethal yellowing disease and the oryctes
[rhinoceros beetle] pest were the 2 factors that were leading the
province to lose what is still the mainstay of its economy, namely
the sale of copra, the dried flesh of the coconut. Copra production
in Zambezia has fallen from around 500 000 tons per year and now
stands at little more than 100 000 tons, reflecting the death over
the last few years of around 6 million coconut palms both in the
business and family sectors.

Of the more than USD 500 million that is being invested in Mozambique
in several areas, USD 17.4 million is to support farmers' incomes,
including control of pests and lethal yellowing disease. However, the
paper said, to combat the two diseases USD 200 million is required.
The project was awarded to set up nurseries and to for technical
assistance to rural workers.

[Weligama wilt
---------------
Weligama wilt of coconut palm is a newly reported disease emerging in
southern Sri Lanka. Symptoms are described as similar to Kerala (or
root) wilt in India and may include leaf yellowing, necrosis, and
rapid decline of the crown. An as yet unclassified phytoplasma was
shown to be associated with diseased palms, and nucleotide sequencing
data suggest that it is 98 percent homologous to sugarcane white leaf
phytoplasma and about 80 per cent homologous to the lethal yellowing
phytoplasma (ProMED-mail post 20080225.0757). This is the 1st time
the country's coconut crop has been hit by a major disease.

It is suggested that the phytoplasma infection may not be lethal by
itself but that it predisposes the palms to a secondary infection by
fungal leaf rot (LRD; due to a complex of up to 14 different fungal
species) which then causes the death of the palms. A 3 km [2 mi]
exclusion zone initially set up around the disease area in 2000 to
limit spread was considered insufficient since insect vectors are
likely to be involved and able to spread phytoplasmas over long
distances. A programme to remove all wilt affected trees was
established in 2008, the main concern being to keep the disease out
of Sri Lanka's "coconut triangle" in the north-west with around 45
percent of the total national crop acreage. No resistant or tolerant
cultivars have yet been identified for Weligama wilt.

Lethal yellowing
-----------------
Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm
lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains have
been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and
southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the
respective areas and can also affect a large number of other palm
species. Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of
inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually
within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to
be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved
in the spread of LY strains elsewhere (for example, Mozambique). Seed
transmission of the pathogens cannot be excluded and some weed
species may serve as reservoir hosts. Commercial control of LY relies
on replanting with resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance
breakdown of some widely used Malayan Dwarf hybrids is causing great
concern. Reasons for the breakdown are still uncertain.

In Mozambique, LY has been spreading continuously in the coastal
coconut belt to the north and south of Quelimane in Zambezia
province. Nevertheless, substantial areas still remain LY free and
quarantine measures are in place to restrict movement of coconut
planting material. It is most unfortunate that apparently sufficient
funding for LY control and replanting programmes cannot be found.
