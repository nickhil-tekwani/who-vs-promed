Dozens of children have been admitted to a state-run hospital in
Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur district with symptoms of encephalitis. The
disease first came to India in 1978. Thousands of children have since
succumbed to encephalitis and those who survived are either
physically disabled or mentally unsound.

It is not the season for the disease, yet 210 patients have been
treated so far. Cases of encephalitis are expected to increase with
the arrival of monsoon and may continue till December [2010]. "The
most important thing is awareness among the people. Hygiene is
necessary because Japanese encephalitis is transmitted by mosquitoes.
There is a need to control mosquito growth and ensure personal
hygiene. Japanese encephalitis can thus be reduced," said Dr AK
Pandey, Research Officer at the National Institute of Virology.

According to specialists, the vaccine for encephalitis should be
administered around 3 months before the monsoons, but the
administration has not taken up such a step so far. In 2006, the
government had launched an encephalitis vaccination campaign but only
a few children were benefited by the campaign.

Encephalitis generally affects children between the ages of 1-15 years.

[The region of Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, reported over 500
encephalitis cases last year (2009), some due to Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) and others were described as acute
encephalitis of undefined etiology but not due to JEV infections.
There is no information indicating how many of these current cases
are due to JJEV and how many to another etiological agent, perhaps
enteroviruses or Nipah virus.
