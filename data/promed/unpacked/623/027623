BSE PRION DESTRUCTION
=====================

Subject: Re: processes to destroy prion proteins?

I have seen no information, indeed I doubt that there is any, on the
safety and effectiveness of incinerating BSE infected material. I beleive
some trial work is being done at Didcot Power station.
There is information on sterilisation procedures, but this is of little
help in this case.
I can offer my ***opinions*** and ***personal comments***, for what they
are worth.

A good question, and one I personally would be interested in. I can see
no easy answer to this.
If rendering, and then incinerating, is the most effective route then
one must ensure that larger particles that may have survived a lower
time-temperature treatment do not pass into the atmosphere. Handling as
a powder has many problems of dust contamination up to the point of
incineration. A coarse granule would be very much better.
One might assume that a specified time (quite short for small particles)
at a specified temperature (400-500C??) in an oxidising atmosphere would
give complete destruction. So burning in a power station with facilities
for granular coal should be acceptable providing excellent dust
extraction facilities for the waste gases are ALWAYS in operation. This
dust must be considered as potentially contaminated at a VERY low level
until proven otherwise.
The ash from the station would presumably have been held at a
temperature of maybe 700C+ for many minutes and so it should not be hard
to test to see if this is contaminated. I would imagine that it would
not be. Initially the work on rendering procedures could be used to get
a good estimate. Note that the centre of a granule may well remain well
below the outside temperature for rather a long time if the material (as
is likely) is a moderately good insulator and the centre is cooled by
evaporationg volatiles.
It would be safer to handle genuine cases of BSE separately in more
secure incinerators. This would also be good PR and allow the UK to
continually point out how much good and nutritious beef it is destroying
in order to reduce the level of disease. It would also allow good PR by
pointing out the very low chance that ANY of the incinerated animals had
any disease anyway.
IMHO the 30 month rule is entirely a PR measure and will have no effect
on human contamination levels worth considering. The removal of Brain
and spinal chord is the key to this which occurs for ALL animals anyway,
and has for some years.

The Institute For Animal Health have a www page. I extracted from one of
their documents, although it is not properly and uniquely labelled, ....
Rendering under commercial conditions
Facsimiles of the rendering processes used within the EU were conducted
in commercial pilot-scale rendering equipment using raw materials spiked
with either BSE or scrapie agent. BSE infectivity survived in meat and
bone meal produced by four of these procedures, and these have now been
modified or outlawed by the EU. The scrapie-spiked study is still in
progress but it can already be seen that meat and bone meal produced
by all processes, except those involving steam under pressure, have
produced infected meat and bone meal.

of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent by rendering procedures.

I have only read the abstract above. One should read the paper.
I wouldn't mind a copy myself!
