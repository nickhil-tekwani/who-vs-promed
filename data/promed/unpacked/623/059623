Mute Swan:_Cygnus olor_(Anatidae) / ** / ** / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: H5N6 was confirmed in 7 _Cygnus olor_ found in wetland areas near Elburg and Hulshorst. Subtype H5N6 is a reassortment linked to H5N8, it is not the Asian zoonotic H5N6.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, Lelystad (National laboratory)/ Mute Swan / polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/ 13 Dec 2017/ Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The following is part of the text of recent information published by the diagnostic laboratory at Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR) on [Thu 14 Dec 2017], and available at https://www.wur.nl/nl/Expertises-Dienstverlening/Onderzoeksinstituten/Bioveterinary-Research/Onderzoek-en-projecten/Show/Vogelgriep-in-Biddinghuizen.htm

In Biddinghuizen (municipality of Dronten, province of Flevoland) on [Fri 8 Dec 2017] avian influenza was diagnosed by Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR) from a sample obtained from a company with meat-type ducks. The virus was characterized as highly pathogenic, H5N6. This company also became one of the 1st to be infected last year [2016]. WBVR did not detect any new infections in poultry farms located within 3 Km [1.86 miles] of the infected farm.

To prevent further spread of the virus, the infected farm has been depopulated by the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). About 16 000 meat-type ducks were in the affected flock. There are no farms within a one Km [0.62 miles] radius of the infected farm that have to be disposed of preventively.

A 1st genetic analysis shows that the virus is not related to the zoonotic H5N6 strain, which circulates in Asia and can also make people ill.

The H5 is related to the highly pathogenic H5N8 virus that was found in the Netherlands in 2016.

The N6 is related to low pathogenic viruses previously found in wild birds in Europe.

The H5N6 virus was created by exchange of genetic material, or reassortment. WBVR is conducting follow-up research to gain further insight into the origin and genetic composition of this virus.

On [Mon 11 Dec 2017], Wageningen Bioveterinary Research tested positive birds for avian influenza (locations Hulshorst and Elburg). On [Wed 13 Dec 2017] it became clear that these were also related to H5N6 avian influenza.

No new infections in Biddinghuizen have been reported. In the area of 3 Km [1.86 miles] around the infected company, there are 4 other companies. These last poultry farms have been sampled and examined by WBVR for avian influenza. On [Mon 11 Dec 2017] it became known that no new infections were found at these companies.

On [Fri 8 Dec 2017], Minister Schouten, Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV,) announced a transport ban for poultry in a zone of 10 Km [6.21 miles] around the affected farm in Biddinghuizen. The transport ban applies to poultry, eggs, poultry manure and used bedding, but also to other animals and animal products originating from farms with commercially kept poultry. On [Mon 11 Dec 2017], this transport regulation was adjusted.
