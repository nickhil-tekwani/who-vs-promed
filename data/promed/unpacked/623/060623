A dairy herd which had milk drop, pyrexia (fever) and severely reduced fertility was investigated by Athlone Regional veterinary laboratories (RVL).

The milk drop and raised temperatures had been occurring for a number of weeks, a report by the laboratory and seen by FarmIreland details.

It also found that the cows showed depression and there was a drop in their milk yield for 4 or 5 days before returning to normal without any treatment.

Schmallenberg virus [SBV] infection was suspected and confirmed by positive ELISA assay results in serum taken from affected cows.

The farmer estimated that 25 percent of his cows previously confirmed as pregnant by scan had lost their calves.

It is anticipated that foetal malformations may occur at calving next spring.

The report also said that there are indications based on clinical evidence and ELISA results that Schmallenberg virus has been active in the summer/autumn just past.

The Department of Agriculture has said that schmallenberg virus is an emerging disease.

[Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an orthobunyavirus discovered in European livestock in late 2011 for the 1st time, causes a vectorborne disease in cattle and sheep. Its main effects in pregnant animals are abortions, premature or stillbirth, and severe fetal malformations; see references.

Following reemergence of SBV in the Netherlands and Germany in late 2014, and its apparent absence in Europe during 2015, reemergence of this teratogenic culicoides-borne virus was reported from the Netherlands and Germany in October 2016. At the same time or shortly thereafter, SBV renewed its circulation in Wales and the west of England. The dynamics of its overwintering mechanism are still in need of research.

According to accumulated information, it is very unlikely that SBV poses a risk to humans.

The Irish event may have been investigated in retrospect, when the farmer noticed a fertility problem. According to the report, milk drop and raised temperatures, signs of a clinical event, "had been occurring for a number of weeks". It further states that "foetal malformations may occur at calving next spring". The laboratory results are indicative of a history of SBV circulation in the herd.

SBV may cause some abortions; its main effect is upon embryos surviving infection during certain stages of their development. The damage, if caused, becomes obvious when such foeti conclude their gestation period. Infection in susceptible cattle during early pregnancy may cause foeti death and/or - in surviving foeti - CNS damage (mainly hydranencephaly). SBV infection during later stages of pregnancy is expected to cause mainly arthrogryposis.

The information that "cows previously confirmed as pregnant by scan had lost their calves", without aborted calves being noticed, may indicate that the cows were in their early pregnancy during the event. If this is the case and if SBV involvement is confirmed, it may be assumed that the event, which might have taken place during October-November 2017, may lead to arthrogryposis in the early calves and hydranenceplay in the later ones.

The county in which the affected farm is located is not given; the regional laboratory is located in Athlone, Midlands Region (which consists of 4 counties). This event may have affected additional farms in Ireland.
