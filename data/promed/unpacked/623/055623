[This is the 4th outbreak of African swine fever detected in China.

"China has more than 400 million pigs, over half the world's swine. Pork is the country's principal source of dietary protein. Further spread could lead to significant culling of animals, hurting the livelihoods of pig producers, cutting pork production, pushing prices higher, and driving consumers to other sources of protein. There may also be major repercussions on international trade as a result of import bans. In the European Union, where African swine fever emerged in 2014, outbreaks have spread across the region at a rate of about 200 km [about 124 mi] per year, causing an estimated several billion euros in annual losses" (see https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-23/the-deadly-african-virus-that-s-killing-chinese-pigs-quicktake).
