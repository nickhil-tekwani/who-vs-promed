Taiwan is still in the peak season for Japanese encephalitis, with 4 new cases confirmed across the nation last week, according to a statement issued on Tuesday [17 Jul 2018] by the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

The 4 cases of Japanese encephalitis reported last week ranged in age from 37-52 years. One each of the cases was recorded in Yilan, Taoyaun, Yunlin and Hualien. All 4 patients are in intensive care, and one of them is still unconscious, the CDC said.

The confirmation of the 4 most recent cases brings the total number for the year [2018] to 26. CDC data show that over the past 6 years, the number of Japanese encephalitis cases in Taiwan were 26 in 2012, 15 in 2013, 12 in 2014, 24 in 2015, 16 in 2016 and 19 in 2017.

In Taiwan, Japanese encephalitis is usually prevalent from May to October and peaks between June and July. The disease is mainly transmitted by the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito, which is known to breed in rice fields, ponds and irrigation canals.

The CDC has advised people to avoid visiting such places and farms, especially at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active, and to make sure their young children are vaccinated against the disease.

[The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season is now well under way in Taiwan, as indicated by last week's 4 new cases, reported above. We expect cases to occur sporadically until the transmission season ends in October 2018. The mosquito species, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, is an efficient vector of JEV and breeds in wet areas such as rice paddies. These culex mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individuals above probably had not been vaccinated. The advice to ensure that children are vaccinated is prudent. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.
