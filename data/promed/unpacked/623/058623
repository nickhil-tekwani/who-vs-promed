[1] Case update
- Sun 12 Aug 2018. Epidemiological situation. DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=144926c9c0

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 12 Aug 2018:
- A total of 52 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 25 confirmed and 27 probable;
- 48 suspected cases are under investigation;
- 3 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni and 2 in Mangina (including a health staff from the Mangina Reference Health Center);
- 1 death of a confirmed case in Mabalako

Alerts had been reported in the Idjwi health zone in South Kivu province. The samples taken were analyzed at the Goma mobile laboratory and the tests were negative.

Remarks
- To avoid [confusion with the total number of cases varying] (up or down) daily, the suspect cases have been placed in a separate category. Thus, suspect cases with positive laboratory tests will be added to the confirmed category, while negative ones (non-cases) will be removed from the table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation. The investigations will determine whether these deaths are related to the epidemic or not.

- Sat 11 Aug 2018. Four new Congo Ebola cases as medics prepare experimental treatment
[Reuters, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo/four-new-congo-ebola-cases-as-medics-prepare-experimental-treatment-idUSKBN1KW071

The health ministry said 4 new cases of Ebola virus have been confirmed in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, as authorities prepare to deploy an experimental treatment.

The latest confirmed cases near the town of Mangina in Congo's North Kivu province bring the total for the current outbreak to 21, the ministry said in a statement late on [Fri 10 Aug 2018].

Another 2 people -- one near Mangina and another in the city of Beni -- died of Ebola, the ministry said. In all, the haemorrhagic fever [see note in ProMED mail Ebola update (65): Congo DR (NK) cases, vaccines 20180812.5960584 regarding misnomer "hemorrhagic fever" for the recent outbreaks] is believed to have killed 38 people, although several of these cases have not been confirmed.

Authorities this week [week of 6 Aug 2018] began vaccinating health workers and people who had contact with confirmed cases. The experimental vaccine, manufactured by Merck, proved effective against an outbreak in western Congo that ended late last month [July 2018].

Officials are also ready to use an experimental treatment called mAB114 on Ebola patients for the 1st time, Steve Ahuka, a virologist at the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) in the capital Kinshasa, told Reuters.

The treatment was developed in the United States using the antibodies of the survivor of an Ebola outbreak in the western Congolese city of Kikwit in 1995 and was 100 percent effective when tested on monkeys.

"It's experimental. So we are following the protocol. It has been submitted to the ethical committee and the ethical committee gave its okay," Ahuka said, adding it could be used within days.

He said other experimental treatments, including ZMapp, a similar antibody drug made by Mapp Biopharmaceuticals in San Diego, could also be used.

Ebola, which causes fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, is spread through direct contact with body fluids.

It killed more than 11 000 people during the largest-ever outbreak in West Africa from 2013-16. Authorities in Congo, which has experienced 10 outbreaks since 1976, have been more successful in containing it.

But the current flare-up poses fresh challenges as it is in a part of Congo stalked by myriad militia groups that regularly battle one another and kill and kidnap civilians.

So far, however, the disease has not touched so-called "red zones" where security risks would severely limit access for health workers.

[Jennifer Garland, PhD epidemiologist and special pathogens nursing manager in Los Angeles has highlighted 2 issues: the precise number of infected healthcare workers (HCWs), and how laboratory confirmation is made. A direct accounting of the number of HCWs with confirmed illness has not been provided. Healthcare workers are currently being vaccinated and those who had contact with infected individuals are being quarantined, but numbers have not been provided. In addition, it is not clear exactly what tests are required in the laboratory to consider a case confirmed. Is one positive PCR assay considered confirmatory? Or are 2 distinct targets required?

It is good news that a new promising anti-viral is available in addition to ZMapp. mAb114 is a single monoclonal antibody (as opposed to ZMapp, comprised of 3 chimeric monoclonal antibodies) isolated from a human survivor of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, DRC. Nancy Sullivan, PhD, chief of the Biodefense Research Section in NIAID's Vaccine Research Center (VRC), and her team, in collaboration with researchers from the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in the DRC and the Institute for Biomedical Research in Switzerland, discovered that the survivor retained antibodies against Ebola 11 years after infection. They isolated the antibodies and tested the most favorable ones in the laboratory and non-human primate studies, and selected mAb114 as the most promising. ...[more] (Excerpted from https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-begins-testing-ebola-treatment-early-stage-trial). - Mod.LK]

[2] Response
- Sun 12 Aug 2018. Beni healthcare workers on leave

"The temporary release process for the 74 staff members of the Mangina Reference Health Center (CSR) who are considered contacts is also complete. All those who have been in contact with confirmed cases will be followed up for 21 days and can not return to CSR until one month later. During this period, they were asked to avoid any movement outside the area. They will be temporarily replaced by temporary health workers from other health centers in Oicha, Mabalako, and Musienene," the health ministry said in a statement on Sat 11 Aug 2018.

The Ministry of Health also indicates in the same communiqu√© that, through its World Bank-funded health system development project (PDSS), it has finalized the practical arrangements to start free healthcare in 3 health zones. health around the epicenter, namely Mabalako, Beni, and Oicha.

"In an epidemic, it is important that the financial barrier is not a barrier to access to health care. This measure to introduce free healthcare in the affected areas aims to encourage the population to go to an approved health center as soon as the 1st symptoms appear, increasing their chance of survival," argues the Ministry of Health.

Two mobile laboratories of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) have arrived in Goma and Mangina to accelerate the testing of samples taken across the province of North Kivu.

To avoid that the total number of cases varies (up or down) daily, the suspect cases have been placed in a separate category. Thus, suspect cases with positive laboratory tests will be added to the confirmed category, while negative ones (non-cases) will be removed from the table.

The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation. The investigations will determine whether these deaths are related to the epidemic or not. ...[more]

- Sun 12 Aug 2018. WHO calls for free and secure access in responding to Ebola outbreak in the DRC
[WHO/AFRO, Democratic Republic of Congo, News, edited]
https://www.afro.who.int/news/who-calls-free-and-secure-access-responding-ebola-outbreak-democratic-republic-congo

WHO's global and African regional leadership saw 1st-hand the complexities of implementing the Ebola response in North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in visits with the Ministry of Health officials to affected areas over the last 2 days. While this is the country's 10th Ebola outbreak, it is the 1st time that the disease has struck a densely populated active conflict zone.

"WHO is calling for free and secure access by all responders to the affected populations," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "All of those participating in the response must be able to move freely and safely in conflict areas to do the work that is needed to bring the outbreak under control. The population must also have access to treatment centers that save lives and stop the spread of disease."

As was done in the recent outbreak in the west of the country, WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in key aspects of the response.
A little more than a week since the government declared the new Ebola outbreak, Dr Tedros, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, and Dr Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General, Emergency Preparedness and Response went on a 2-day mission to the city of Beni and to the Mangina health area in North Kivu. Mangina, which is 30 km [about 19 mi] from Beni, lies at the epicenter of the epidemic and accounts for most of the confirmed cases so far.

A range of armed groups are active in the area and this insecurity creates a challenge for health teams needing to go deep into communities to actively find cases and then monitor them twice a day for 3 weeks. It can also discourage members of the community from coming forward for treatment.

"WHO has vast experience with delivering health services in conflict zones in Africa," said Dr Moeti. "We will build on this experience to ensure that our staff and partners can do their work and save the lives of the people we are here to help."

Together with the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga, the WHO delegation observed the launch of the Ebola vaccination for health workers in the Beni reference hospital. They also visited the Emergency Operations Centre in Beni, which was built and provided to partners by the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, known as MONUSCO. They met with partners and staff to discuss the challenges ahead, and to take stock of what has already been put in place, including treatment centers run by partners, outreach to communities, a review of infection prevention and control in health centres, and reinforcement to the surveillance system.

- Wed 8 Aug 2018. The latest on the new Ebola outbreak in Central Africa; [BBC interview with Peter Salama, edited]
https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cswjkt

The latest on the new Ebola outbreak in Central Africa by Dr Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General, Emergency Preparedness and Response Director of Health Emergencies Programme at WHO since 2016.

Just weeks after the outbreak of Ebola was declared over in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a new outbreak has emerged in the east of the country. The World Health Organization has responded rapidly to the emergency -- having learned lessons from the west Africa outbreak which killed more than 11 000 people. The WHO's Deputy Director of Emergency Preparedness Peter Salama says the current outbreak will be much trickier to contain because of conflict in North Kivu province.
