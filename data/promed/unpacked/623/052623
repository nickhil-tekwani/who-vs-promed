[As in 2013 and 2014, the location of the outbreak on the northern border of Botswana can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

The last recorded livestock case of anthrax in Botswana was in 2007, but anthrax outbreaks in wildlife in the Chobe National Park are ongoing. Elephant cases have been reported in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013, and 2014, sometimes in significant numbers; latterly only single cases are reported. How elephants get infected is unclear, but they do graze as well as browse. - Mod.MHJ
