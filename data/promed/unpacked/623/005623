This are interesting cases.
I would be interested to know if the investigators took histories on
the use of fertilizers that may contain meat and bone meal. Or if the
men took any nutritional supplements that also might contain ground
up beef or sheep products. Neither of these substances has yet been
associated with any case of CJD but it would be interesting to know
if there might be some connection.

[Dr. Horwitch raises some interesting questions. A review of the
literature did not reveal any articles addressing the relationship of
fertilizers or meat and bone meal with respect to human CJD disease.
With respect to the bovine disease (BSE), the association between
rendered meat and bone meal as food source for subsequently infected
bovines is fairly well established. The theoretical risk of
ingestion of nutritional supplements that might contain animal by
products has lead to several countries banning imports of nutritional
supplements from countries with known BSE. - Mod.MPP
