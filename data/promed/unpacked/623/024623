A surge in cases of gastroenteritis in South Australia has prompted a
warning from health authorities for people to take greater care with
personal hygiene.
The outbreak of cryptosporidium infections may also be linked to the
drought, with concerns that more children are bathing together to
save water and the water in wading pools is being changed less frequently.
Health department spokeswoman Ann Koehler said there have been 228
cases of gastroenteritis so far this year [2007], compared to 52
cases in the same period last year [2006].
Dr Koehler said there was clear evidence that cryptosporidiosis was
being spread within families, and efforts should be made to reduce
the risk of infection.
"The most important way is through good personal hygiene, make sure
anyone with diarrhoea does not prepare food for others, and ensure
those who are infected stay out of shared baths and swimming pools,"
she said. "Our research has found children sharing baths have
contracted cryptosporidiosis, so we are urging parents with children
who are or have been infected, that they make sure these children bathe alone."
The department's water quality adviser David Cunliffe said the
organism was commonly spread by contact with people already infected
or from contaminated water or livestock. "Swimming pools are a
particular concern because they can be a source of outbreaks if used
by people with cryptosporidiosis," Dr Cunliffe said. "The organism is
shed for an extended time after symptoms have ceased and it is
difficult to kill by chlorination." Health authorities said the risk
of infection could be reduced by washing hands with soap and water
after using the toilet, before eating, and after handling animals.

[Spread from person to person is not usual for _Crytosporidia_. We
agree that washing hands is always good, but will probably not
contain spread of the bacterium. Use of common water facilities, like
swimming pools, are the main risk factor, which is also pointed out
here. - Mod.EP
