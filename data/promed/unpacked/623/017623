A search is on for a woman that may have contracted rabies while handling a rabid raccoon in Burlington last week [15-21 Aug 2016].

According to the Burlington County Times, the unknown woman rescued the injured raccoon from the intersection of High Street and Route 130 on 15 Aug [2016]. The raccoon has since tested positive for rabies, and officials from the Burlington County Health Department are trying to identify her so that she can seek medical treatment.

As of 30 Jun 2016, there have been 113 cases of rabies this year [2016] in the state, according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Burlington County has had 4 confirmed rabid raccoon cases from 1 Jan through 30 Jun 2016. There were 306 cases of rabies in New Jersey in 2015, 154 of which were raccoon related.

Rabies in humans is almost always fatal unless treated before clinical signs of rabies appear. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, treatment of rabies has proven nearly 100 percent successful.

[Rabid raccoons might lose their fear of humans and other animals, and they may become slower and are brought into stupor. They present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting, and odd vocalizations. It can be confused with distemper.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs in the area up to date, including both rabies and distemper. - Mod.PMB
