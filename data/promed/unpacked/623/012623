From 28 Dec 2018 to 3 Jan 2019, 2305 people have caught measles in Ukraine, the country's Healthcare Ministry said in a statement on Tue 8 Jan 2019. "There is no specific treatment for measles.
Vaccination is the only way to prevent measles-driven complications and deaths," the statement, posted on Facebook, read.

The ministry emphasized that measles could trigger serious complications, including pneumonia, ear infections, and encephalitis. It can also result in disability and death.

One child has died of measles complications since the beginning of the year [2019] in Ukraine, the ministry said, calling on parents to vaccinate their children in compliance with the immunizations schedule. As of 3 Jan 2019, a total of 809 073 doses of measles, parotitis, and rubella vaccines are available in the country, the Healthcare Ministry specified.

On 2 Jan 2019, the Ukrainian Healthcare Ministry said that 54 481 people had caught measles in Ukraine in 2018, with over 50% of them being children.

There were 34 suspected cases of measles reported to Public Health England (PHE) for Croydon, South London, England in 2018. This is more than 3 times the 10 cases reported in 2017, and the highest number in a one-year period since available records began in 2010.

PHE repeatedly warned of measles outbreaks across England in 2018, linked to outbreaks in Europe, and particularly affecting teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were younger.

According to PHE, between 1 Jan and 31 Oct 2018 (the most recent published figures), there were 913 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England. This is a steep increase in cases compared with 259 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in the whole of 2017.

Registered medical practitioners in England and Wales have a statutory duty to notify their local authority or local Health Protection Team of suspected cases of certain infectious diseases.

The figures show cases of scarlet fever also hit record highs in 2018. There were 193 cases of scarlet fever reported in Croydon in 2018, up from 86 in 2017. Other infectious diseases reported in Croydon included tuberculosis, with 69 cases, mumps, with 37 cases, and whooping cough, 8 cases.

Across England and Wales, there were 2599 suspected cases of measles reported in 2018, up from 1692 in 2017. This was the highest number of reports since 2013, when there were 6191 cases. Reported scarlet fever cases hit a record 31 865 in 2018, up from 17 813 in 2017.

Health officials in Macedonia are reporting a measles outbreak in the capital city of Skopje. Minister of Health Assoc. Dr. Venko Filipce announced the outbreak declaration today [2 Jan 2019].

In addition to the 7 cases that appeared in the Skopje settlement Radishani 10 days ago, there are now 12 new cases from almost all municipalities in Skopje, of which 6 are officially laboratory confirmed and 6 have a clear clinical picture and are awaiting official laboratory confirmation. The outbreak has affected both children and adults, all of whom were unvaccinated.

"Of the 15 000 unvaccinated children with vaccine calls, only 310 were vaccinated, which is a small figure. It is a good circumstance that schools [were closed] because of the holidays.

"But, of course, we have the situation under control. This is an extremely serious disease that, unfortunately, is sometimes fatal to the lives of children. Any disregard for the recommendations is an additional risk for the health of the whole population," said Minister Filipche (computer translated).

Two cases of measles have been confirmed in the northwest: one in Vancouver, Washington, and the other in Portland, Oregon. The Oregon Health Authority says a man with the illness spent time in The Dalles and Hood River. If you visited those areas on 29-30 Dec 2018, you may want to watch out for symptoms.

Lane County Public Health's Dr. Patrick Luedtke says vaccination is key to making sure you don't catch the disease. "We worry about outbreaks from measles kind of like a wildfire," said Dr. Luedtke. "It just spreads. If you have one case and people are susceptible, pretty soon you're going to have hundreds, that's just the way it is."

[See source URL for references, table, figures and full report of the measles outbreak in Brazil. - Mod.LK]

In February 2018, a measles outbreak was reported in the state of Roraima, Brazil and was found to be associated with the ongoing measles outbreak in Venezuela [1]. As of 10 Dec 2018, 349 cases have been confirmed [2]. Between 2001 and 2017, the Amazonas state did not report any confirmed measles cases [3]. Here, we report the ongoing measles outbreak in Manaus capital of the Amazonas state in Brazil. The north of Amazonas state borders Venezuela. Manaus has 2 145 444 inhabitants.

In 1969, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Brazil established that all suspected measles cases seeking health services must be reported to the local authorities; cases must also be registered in the National System of Notifiable Diseases (Sinan) [4].

The 1st laboratory-confirmed case of the ongoing outbreak was a woman in her early 20s living in the northern district of Manaus. She had rash onset on 21 Feb 2018 and presented with fever, cough, coryza and conjunctivitis. She was identified during the investigation of her one-year-old child's case, who had rash onset on 1 Mar 2018 and presented the same symptoms as the mother. Laboratory confirmation of measles was obtained on 23 Mar 2018.

The D8 genotype measles virus was identified in a urine sample from the infant, which was identical to the one that is circulating in Venezuela; genotyping also showed that it was a wild-type measles virus. The mother reported having had contact with 3 Venezuelan migrants in January 2018.

Although the current available information suggests a link between the outbreaks in Venezuela and Manaus, further molecular epidemiological studies are needed to help understand the reintroduction of measles in the municipality.

From 6 Feb to 3 Nov 2018, 8070 suspected measles cases were reported; the median interval between the date of notification and the date of the final classification of the case was 37 days (range, 0-140 days). All the confirmed cases were Brazilians. The incidence of measles among confirmed cases was 75.3 per 100 000 inhabitants; the incidence was higher among infants (1003.9 per 100 000 inhabitants) and children 1 to 4 years of age (175.3 per 100 000 inhabitants). Up to 3 Nov 2018, the northern district accounted for the largest number of cases (2753 cases) (Table 1).

The Davao City Health Office is now intensifying its efforts to explain the need for measles vaccination, as many are still reluctant to avail of immunization because of the Dengvaxia issue. Curtis C. Lazarraga of the City Health Office (CHO) said, in a press conference on Thu [10 Jan 2019], the agency "is having a hard time" in reaching out to communities because many are still doubtful of the safety of undergoing vaccination.

"It is still very hard to convince the public that vaccination is needed especially for children because they are still afraid that it may cause them harm," said Lazarraga. Lazarraga added that of the 90% total target population, only 30% to 40% were vaccinated in 2018. He said this is still a conservative estimate.

It was in February 2016 when Health Secretary Janette Garin hosted the nationwide launch of Dengvaxia, and in April of the same year the government started the school-based dengue immunization program that gave 3 doses of vaccines to 830 000 students every 6 months after the Philippines approved the sale of Sanofi Pasteur's Dengvaxia vaccine. Dengvaxia is the world's 1st dengue vaccine.

In November 2017, the manufacturer, Sanofi Pasteur, announced that Dengvaxia posed a risk to people who had not previously been exposed to dengue. This followed the withdrawal of approval of the Food and Drug Administration after citing safety concerns. This set off a panic among parents of vaccinated children that resulted in public outrage.

Lazarraga said the CHO has been intensifying its campaign to the public, going house to house in the community to further explain the need to let their children be immunized. The World Health Organization reported that cases of measles in the Philippines have increased up to 367% in 2018, reaching up to 17 298 cases, compared with 2017 when there were only 3706 cases.

In October last year [2018] around 300 cases were reported in Bicol region, resulting in the death of 6 individuals.

"It is a challenge how the CHO will reach out to the remaining percentage of the public that needs vaccination. But we will do all efforts," said Lazarraga. No less than Mayor Sara Duterte is leading the campaign and asking the public to let their children avail of the free vaccination from the CHO, but Lazarraga said there is a lot to do this year to gain public trust.

A total of 5 children in the western Ugandan district of Hoima have died of measles, the country's health ministry said on Thu [10 Jan 2019]. Emma Ainebyoona, the ministry's public relations officer, told Xinhua by telephone that all the children were under 10 years of age. The cases occurred in the past week.

The officer said the country is facing a measles outbreak and that 56 districts have already been affected. Ainebyoona urged parents to take their children for vaccination against the disease. "We shall soon roll out the mass measles and rubella immunization campaign before the end of this month [January 2019]," Ainebyoona said.

Measles, according to the ministry of health, is one of the killer diseases among children under 5 years of age. The others include diphtheria, polio and tuberculosis.

A new study from Dartmouth College shows that past problems with vaccines can cause a phenomenon known as hysteresis, creating a negative history that stiffens public resolve against vaccination. The finding explains why it is so hard to increase uptake even when overwhelming evidence indicates that vaccines are safe and beneficial.

A hysteresis loop causes the impact of a force to be observed even after the force itself has been eliminated. The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, is the 1st study to demonstrate that hysteresis can affect public health.

"Once people question the safety or effectiveness of a vaccine, it can be very difficult to get them to move beyond those negative associations. Hysteresis is a powerful force that is difficult to break at a societal level," said Fu, who led the research team.

Low vaccine compliance is a public health issue that can cause the loss of "herd immunity" and lead to the spread of infectious diseases. In parts of Europe and North America, childhood diseases like measles, mumps and pertussis have returned as a result of insufficient vaccination coverage.

Previous studies have combined behavior models with epidemiology to understand the challenge of voluntary vaccination, but have been unable to completely explain the persistence of low vaccine compliance. The Dartmouth research specifically studies how past problems associated with vaccinations can affect present and future vaccination decisions.

"This study shows why it is so hard to reverse low or declining vaccine levels," said Xingru Chen, a graduate student at Dartmouth and the 1st author of the research paper. "The sheer force of factual, logical arguments around public health issues is just not enough to overcome hysteresis and human behavior."

According to the research, the hysteresis loop can be caused by questions related to the risk and effectiveness of vaccines. Negative experiences or perceptions related to vaccination affect the trend of uptake over time -- known to the researchers as a "vaccination trajectory" that gets stuck in the hysteresis loop.

Hysteresis prevents an increase in vaccination levels even after the negative objections have been cleared, making society increasingly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. "When it comes to vaccination levels, the past predicts the future," said Fu.

Abstract
---------
Addressing vaccine compliance problems is of particular relevance and significance to public health. Despite resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases and public awareness of vaccine importance, why is it so challenging to boost population vaccination coverage to desired levels especially in the wake of declining vaccine uptake? To understand this puzzling phenomenon, here we study how social imitation dynamics of vaccination can be impacted by the presence of imperfect vaccine, which confers only partial protection against the disease. Besides weighing the perceived cost of vaccination with the risk of infection, the effectiveness of vaccination is also an important factor driving vaccination decisions. We discover that there can exist multiple stable vaccination equilibria if vaccine efficacy is below a certain threshold. Furthermore, our bifurcation analysis reveals the occurrence of hysteresis loops of vaccination rate with respect to changes in the perceived vaccination cost as well as in the vaccination effectiveness. Moreover, we find that hysteresis is more likely to arise in spatial populations than in well-mixed populations, even for parameter choices that do not allow for bifurcation in the latter. Our work shows that hysteresis can appear as an unprecedented roadblock for the recovery of vaccination uptake, thereby helping explain the persistence of vaccine compliance problem.
