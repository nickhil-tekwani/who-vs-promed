[1] Vaccinations

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has begun vaccinating people against Ebola after the recent death of a boy from the virus, health officials said.

According to WHO, vaccinations began in the DRC's North Kivu Province on Wednesday [13 Oct 2021], a week after the young boy died.

The boy lived in the same community where a father and his 2 children died in September [2021] after experiencing Ebola-like symptoms. None of the 3 was tested for Ebola or buried in a safe manner, WHO said. North Kivu is only months removed from the end of an Ebola outbreak that killed 6 people.

More than 170 contacts of the boy have already been identified and are being monitored, according to WHO.

"Ebola is a virulent, lethal virus that can spread aggressively and fast. But vaccines can create a firewall of protection around cases, stopping the chain of transmission, averting a potentially large outbreak and saving many lives," WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti, MD, MPH, said in a press release. "The Democratic Republic of the Congo is spearheading the efforts to halt this latest Ebola resurgence, banking on expertise built in responding to previous outbreaks.

According to WHO, 1000 doses of Merck's Ebola vaccine and other medical supplies were delivered to Goma city in North Kivu and around 200 doses were sent to Beni city near the Butsili health area where the boy lived.

Officials are using the "ring vaccination" approach, which has been successful in previous Ebola outbreaks, beginning with people at high risk, such as contacts of the confirmed case and first responders.

WHO said 12 000 additional vaccine doses are available in nearby Kinshasa if needed.

[2] Africa CDC report
Date: Sun 10 Oct 2021

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/ebola-in-dr-congo-africa-cdc-report-12556/


On [8 Oct 2021], the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene, and Prevention (MoH) reported a confirmed death of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Beni health zone, North Kivu province. This comes barely 5 months after the end of the most recent outbreak that was detected in the same province.

The index case is a 3-year-old male child who died on [6 Oct 2021] in a local health facility after presenting with hemorrhagic symptoms. Samples collected, tested positive for Ebola virus at the Goma reference laboratory.

"We see this with great concern as we are going to fight against multiple disease outbreaks in DRC, including, cholera, monkeypox, yellow fever, meningitis, and EVD, on top of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic," said Dr John Nkengasong, the Director of Africa CDC.

Health teams decontaminated the affected health facility and 100 contacts have so far been identified. The provincial and zonal rapid response teams have deployed to the affected area to conduct active case finding and identify additional contacts.

In response to this new EVD case, the African Union Commission (AUC) has been informed of the outbreak and is ready to offer comprehensive support of all AU organs. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has repurposed 5 of the existing Africa CDC emergency response team of experts in Goma and Kinshasa to support the ongoing EVD response effort of the Government and is working on deployment of additional technical assistance from the headquarters. AUC/Africa CDC will continue to closely monitor the situation and will work with the government of DRC to deploy more emergency response support teams of experts, supplies, and equipment as needed. Africa CDC will work closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) to coordinate and align emergency response activities across the region.

[The DRC is well prepared to take charge of this latest outbreak. One hopes with more than 100 contacts already identified and the vaccination campaign about to begin, the virus will not be able to spread. Unfortunately, the 1st 3 suspect cases died without an etiology being determined or action being taken. With the multitude of pathogens circulating in the DRC, many of which appear similar in the early stages, diagnosis may be missed, as it was with the 3 earlier cases. -Mod LK]

[3] Lab confirmation

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over the weekend [9-10 Oct 2021] reported a lab-confirmed Ebola case and 3 suspected infections, all fatal, in an area in North Kivu province that was one of the main epicenters in earlier outbreaks.

The new case marks the country's 1st Ebola infection in 5 months and its 13th Ebola outbreak. It's not yet clear if the flare-up is linked to an earlier outbreak in the same area that was declared over in early May [2021] after 11 confirmed cases, 6 of them fatal, were reported.

Three neighbors died after similar symptoms
-------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [10 Oct 2021] in a statement, based on information from the DRC's health ministry, that the confirmed case involves a 3-year-old boy from the Butsili health area of Beni Health Zone. His symptoms began in early October and included weakness, appetite loss, dark stools, and bloody vomit. He died on [6 Oct 2021]. Samples were tested at a lab in Beni the next day, then sent to the National Institute of Biomedical Research lab in Goma on [8 Oct 2021], where tests confirmed Ebola virus.

The boy's illness was preceded by the deaths of 3 of the boy's neighbors, a father and 2 of his children. The 3 people died in the last half of September [2021] after having symptoms consistent with Ebola, but none were tested.

One of the children in the family cluster tested positive for malaria at a health facility. She was treated for severe malaria but died on [29 Sep 2021].

Investigators from the local health department and the WHO investigated the deaths and conducted contact tracing, collecting 2 samples for COVID-19, but not Ebola. The people weren't buried safely, and the list of potential causes of their illnesses included severe malaria, Ebola, measles, and meningitis. The DRC is experiencing a meningitis outbreak, but it is centered in the northeastern part of the country, about 430 miles [692 km] west of Beni.

The outbreak response team as of [9 Oct 2021] has identified and is following 148 contacts.

Links to earlier outbreaks?
---------------------------
Beni was one of the main hot spots in a large Ebola outbreak that took place between 2018 and 2020, the DRC's 10th and biggest. The WHO said 763 probable and confirmed cases were reported from Beni during that outbreak, which resulted in 3470 cases, including 2287 deaths.

The location of the new outbreak is also near Butembo in North Kivu province, where the outbreak occurred earlier this year. The 2 locations are roughly 30 miles [about 48 km] apart, and the flare-up earlier this year [2021] resulted in 11 confirmed and 1 probable case, along with 6 deaths.

Genetic sequencing suggested that the outbreak was linked to the 2018-2020 event, but the source of the infection wasn't found. The virus can persist in immune protected parts of the body, such as the eyes and testes, and sexual contact involving a survivor is one of the suspected transmission routes.

Earlier this year [2021], an investigation into the source of a case in Guinea pointed to a human link to West Africa's massive 2014-2016 outbreak and suggested that survivors could harbor the virus much longer than 6 months.

The WHO said it's not unusual for sporadic cases to occur after major outbreaks, but it's too early to say if the new cases are linked to earlier outbreaks. The virus is also present in animal populations in the DRC, including the region where the latest outbreak is occurring.

The group warned that the outbreak poses a risk of further spread, given that Beni is a commercial hub that has links to 2 neighboring countries: Uganda and Rwanda. The WHO said other challenges include COVID-19 activity and other factors such as political instability and weak health systems.

[Ebola outbreaks always present the threat of spread, but the country is highly experienced at responding to the threat with the expertise they have gained from earlier outbreaks, the established infrastructure albeit somewhat weak, contact tracing already well underway, and vaccination. Unfortunately, the response is exacerbated by COVID-19 and other pathogens such as TB, malaria, dengue, cholera, measles, meningitis, and more, circulating in the area, as well as political unrest which interferes with the operation. - Mod.LK
