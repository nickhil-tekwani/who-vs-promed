Avian influenza - Eurasia (22): Japan (Ibaraki), H5N2
-----------------------------------------------------
re: "The type of virus in each case is almost identical to that of a strain
that originated in Central America. The possibility of a strain of bird flu
so similar to the Central American strain developing independently in Japan
is extremely slim. Therefore, a ministry subcommittee for poultry disease
pointed out in September the possibility that an illegal bird flu vaccine
was used. If a vaccine is chemically processed incompletely, infectious
virus remains in the vaccine and can spread when administered to poultry".
There is a much simpler explanation than that. Just look for an illegally
trafficked parrot or other exotic bird -- not necessarily of a Central
American variety, since the Central American traffickers also relay birds
from South American, Africa, and the Caribbean.
Japan is among the major destinations of illegally smuggled exotic birds.
