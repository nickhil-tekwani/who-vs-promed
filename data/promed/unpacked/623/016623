Thailand: 6-year-old Boy is 5th [Suspected?] Avian Influenza Death
--------------------------------------------------
A 6-year-old Thai boy has died from avian influenza, becoming
Thailand's 5th confirmed fatality from the disease, Health Minister
Sudarat Keyuraphan said on Wed 4 Feb 2004.
"The boy from Kanchanaburi province, who had already died (on
Monday), became the country's 5th confirmed case," Mr Sudarat told
reporters. The boy had been listed as one of Thailand's 10 suspected
bird flu fatalities, but extensive laboratory tests confirmed he had
been stricken by avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, the minister said.
[N.B. As of Wed 4 Feb 2004 WHO has reported laboratory confirmation
of infection for 4 cases only, all of whom have died. See: WHO Update
17 above. - Mod.CP]
A sick 5-month-old baby girl from Chainat province in central
Thailand was also removed from the suspect list, she said. As well as
the 5 confirmed deaths, there are now 17 suspected cases of bird flu
infections in Thailand, of which 9 have died, including a 4-year-old
boy suspected of having the disease who passed away on Tuesday.
All 5 of Thailand's confirmed bird flu cases have been fatal. The
virus has now been detected in poultry in half of Thailand's 76
provinces, and to fight the disease 24.8 million chickens have been
culled nationwide. The mass slaughters were continuing on Wednesday
in 7 provinces after being completed in the other 31 provinces where
H5N1 has been detected.
The 4 other people confirmed to have died from the disease are 2
boys, both 6 years old, who died on 25 and 27 Jan 2004, a 58-year-old
woman who died on 28 Jan, and a 7-year-old boy who died on Tuesday.
All are from Thailand's rural central provinces, as was Wednesday's
fatality. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has also caused 11
deaths in Vietnam, but the other 8 countries hit [by avian influenza
outreaks] have not reported any human fatalities.

[There is a discrepancy between the figures quoted in the above
agency report and those contained in the WHO Update 17 posted above
as part [1]. The discrepancy may be due to differences in the
definition of laboratory confirmation by WHO and the Thai
authorities. - Mod.CP]
