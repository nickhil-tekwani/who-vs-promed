A Comment on the Prevalence of Echoviruses 9, 13 & 30 in NSW & the ACT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to the recent articles on the newly described echovirus 13
activity in the US [see: Meningitis, echovirus 13 - USA 20010914.2219
and in Western Australia [see: Meningitis, echoviruses 13 & 30 -
Australia (West.) 20010917.2247 we describe our own local experience.
The virus isolation laboratory at ICPMR, Westmead hospital, Sydney,
Australia, is a reference laboratory for enteroviral typing of
clinical isolates in the state of New South Wales (NSW) and the ACT.
Electronic records have been kept since 1995 with data including the
serotype and site of collection.
Echovirus type 13 has been rarely isolated at our laboratory, with a
lone identification noted from a nasopharyngeal aspirate in 1995. Over
the first 7 months of 2001 we have detected echovirus type 13 in 12
unique samples including 4 CSF isolations. The age range of patients
was 4 months to 71 years, with 8 of the samples originating from
subjects 1 year or less of age. Only one patient with meningitis was
less than 12 months old. Unlike in the US report we have noted no
geographic link between cases. This has occurred in the context of
very high local non-polio enteroviral activity in 2001.
In the first 6 months some 168 non-polio enteroviral isolates have
been received and typed, with echovirus type 9 being identified most
frequently (32%). In comparison, our highest documented isolation rate
in a calendar year (1999) was 258, although anecdotally our staff
believe this is the busiest year for more than 25 years. The overall
proportion of isolates originating from the CSF has been 17.5% over
the last 5 years, with the highest rate noted in 1998 (27%). In the
first 6 months of 2001, 40% of isolates originated from CSF samples.
This is largely due to the preponderance of echovirus type 9 CSF
isolation, with 39/54 (72%) samples originating from the CSF,
consistent with a local outbreak.
Echovirus type 30 contributed to a lesser extent, with 8 of 11
specimens representing CSF samples. Together these viruses
[echoviruses 9 and 30 have been circulating locally for some years
representing 12-20% of total non-polio enteroviral activity over the
last 3 years. In contrast, the average proportion of CSF samples for
echoviruses 30 and 9 has been 39% and 33% respectively over the 5-year
period. Given the abrupt rise in CSF isolation of echovirus type 9
despite recent circulation of this virus within the community, the
possibility of a subtype epidemic is a possible explanation of recent
phenomena. Viral sequencing is being considered to further explore
this issue.

[ProMED-mail welcomes this comment from Drs Leroi and McPhie, which
provides further evidence of the emergence of echovirus type 13 as a
significant human pathogen, and in addition of the possible
circulation of an echovirus type 9 strain with altered virulence. -
