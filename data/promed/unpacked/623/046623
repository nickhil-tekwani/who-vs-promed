The veterinary authorities in Portugal have confirmed the circulation
of bluetongue virus serotype 1 in sheep from a farm located in the
region of Alcacer do Sal [southeast of Lisbon], where clinical cases
of the disease had been recorded in the past.

The same serotype is continuing its circulation in the areas between
Asturias and Cantabria [northern Spain].

To prevent the spread of the virus, the vaccination programme has been
reinforced around the affected areas by extension of the declared
restricted areas.
