Brucellosis has been discovered in 2 districts, Lyubinskiy and
Sherbakulskiy in Zameletenovka, Astrahanovka, Chadskoye, and Sherbakul
villages. Veterinarians discovered brucellosis in sheep, cows, and swine.
Quarantine measures have been introduced in some of the most [at risk]
villages.

The press secretary of the Russian Sanitary Surveillance Service, Elena
Dayrukina, said that 300 people who had possible contact with ill animals
went through medical check ups. Out of the 300, 39 were positive for
brucellosis and 8 of them were treated in hospital. Those with suspected
brucellosis were sent to Omsk infections diseases hospital.

[It is not stated in the posting if the diagnosis of brucellosis was made
clinically (usually based on an undifferentiated febrile illness with known
exposure to infected animals or unpasteurized dairy products),
serologically using a specific antibody test, or by culture. The quarantine
measures referred to are likely to be for the livestock not the humans
since brucellosis is not generally transmitted from person-to-person.

Omsk is an oblast (province) of Russia, located in southwestern Siberia; it
can be found on the maps at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omsk_Oblast> and
