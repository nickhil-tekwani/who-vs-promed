[Re: ProMED-mail post Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Congo DR: susp
20080603.1779, Maia Funk-Baumann, MD of the WHO Collaborating Centre
for Travellers' Health at the University of Zurich has pointed out
that this suspected Ebola case is from Boende, in the northwestern
province of Equateur, not Kasai Occidental province as stated in the
moderator's comment. Accordingly, this post has been revised to take
account of the error. Dr Funk-Baumann's help is appreciated. - Mod.CP]

A case of hemorrhagic fever has been reported in the Boende health
zone of Tshuapa District. The chief medical officer in the area, Dr.
Cesar Moyeli, believes that symptoms exhibited by a woman admitted to
a general hospital in the zone are consistent with those of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever.

Dr. Moyeli stated that: "After 2 days, the patient began to
experience hemorrhage: 1st from the genitalia, then from her eyes,
gums and even her ears. In addition, red patches appeared on her
skin. Taken together, these features suggested a diagnosis of
hemorrhagic fever. In order to avoid disseminating the infection, we
informed the family that, due to the danger of the illness, the body
could not be released to the family for normal burial. Instead, the
body was disinfected and taken directly to the cemetery for burial.
All materials used in the care of the patient have been burnt, and
the treatment room remains closed."

The patient died last Thursday [29 May 2008]. Clinical samples have
been taken and dispatched to Kinshasa [the capital of Congo DR] for
virus identification. Meanwhile, the family of the deceased and all
her known contacts will be kept under observation for a period of 3
weeks.
