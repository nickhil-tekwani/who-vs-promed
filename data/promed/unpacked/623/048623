[As can be seen from the references below, outbreaks of Newcastle
disease (NCD) in pigeons are not completely new. We are very happy to
have the multiple confirming laboratory tests from IZS, Padova.

Of course, it is good that the disease did not spread to commercial
poultry and there is no reason to think it will progress further. The
only question that remains is: Why didn't all the pigeons die or be
depopulated? There are 16 susceptible pigeons and only 11 cases -- all
of which died, so where are the other 5 pigeons? Did they remain on
the premises? Could they be a source of spread?

The location of the outbreak can be seen in the OIE report - Mod.PC]
