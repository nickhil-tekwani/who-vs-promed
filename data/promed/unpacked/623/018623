[My fellow moderator Maria Cristina David very kindly provided the data above data on anthrax outbreaks in Chile for 2014-2020.

These are modest sporadic outbreaks, and should provide background to the most recent report from Chile. There have been a few more outbreaks than we have been able to report. - Mod.MHJ
