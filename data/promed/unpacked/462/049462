Gonorrhea strains resistant to antibiotics show up on mainland
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gonorrhea strains that are resistant to additional antibiotics have reached
the mainland US from Asia and Hawaii, prompting health officials to
re-evaluate their guidelines for treating the disease. In a sign of what
California cities [and others further eastward as well - Mod.LL] may expect
to see in coming years, researchers in Hawaii have identified the first
American cases of gonorrhea resistant to multiple currently used drugs.
Gonorrhea is typically treated with one of 2 classes of antibiotics:
fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, and cephalosporins, such as
cefixime or ceftriaxone. But today, more than half of gonorrhea cases in
East Asia show resistance to fluoroquinolones, as do 20 percent of cases in
Hawaii.
Fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea has become increasingly prevalent in
California cities, including San Francisco. Charlotte Kent, chief of
epidemiology in the sexually transmitted disease prevention and control
services unit of San Francisco's Health Department remarked "Gonorrhea has
consistently demonstrated its ability to develop resistance to treatment."
San Francisco epidemiologists started seeing resistant strains in 2000.
Last year, when 3 percent of gonorrhea cases were found to be resistant to
fluoroquinolones, the city's Health Department began advising against using
those drugs.
Dr. Karen Mark, a medical epidemiologist with the San Diego County Health
Department, said that 4.1 percent of the gonorrhea cases tested in San
Diego at the end of 2001 were the resistant strain, all in cases of gay
men. "In 2002, we made the recommendation to stop fluoroquinolones as
treatment for men who have sex with men," Mark said.
The emergence of drug-resistant gonorrhea strains is disturbing to public
health officials for several reasons. Patients who think they are cured,
but are not because of inadequate treatment, can pass their resistant
bacteria to other sexual partners.
New guidelines for treating sexually transmitted diseases are to be released
later this week [see below - Mod.LL]. A shift to cephalosporins and other
second-tier antibiotics brings different problems. People who are severely
allergic to penicillin may have a cross-allergy to cephalosporins [2-8
percent cross-reactivity in IgE-mediated hypersensitivity - Mod.LL]. Other
drugs
are also more expensive, have side effects, or are less readily available,
Mark said.
Epidemiologists have tracked the eastward march of drug-resistant strains
of gonorrhea for decades. Penicillin-resistant gonorrhea first arose in the
1970s and migrated to Hawaii and then California. By 1987, public health
officials dropped penicillin as a treatment option altogether.
The movement of fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea has followed a similar
eastward path, researchers say, but may not become a major problem for most
of the US for at least 5 more years.
Dr. Susan Wang, a CDC epidemiologist, reported the findings on California's
fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea in March 2002 at the National STD
Prevention Conference. Wang [also] presented data on 3 gonorrhea cases in
Hawaii that showed high resistance to fluoroquinolones and intermediate
resistance to one of the cephalosporin drugs. They are the first cases of
these Asian multiple drug-resistant strains in the US.

[Sentinel studies such as the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP)
sponsored by the CDC in data from Hawaii and similar efforts in Australia
and Asia have clearly documented increasing resistance of the gonococcus to
fluoroquinolones. These strains are now seen more frequently in cities on
the US west coast. How much the expanding use of this class
of antimicrobials in the treatment of respiratory infections has affected
this trend is not clear.
This week's new recommendations from CDC [ref. below] retains ofloxacin and
ciprofloxacin as recommended regimens. The guidelines, however, now state
"quinolones are no longer recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea in the
State of Hawaii and should not be used to treat infections that may have
been acquired in Asia or the Pacific (including Hawaii). Recent data from
several GISP sites in California demonstrate an increased prevalence of
quinolone-resistant gonorrhea; therefore, the use of fluoroquinolones in
California is probably inadvisable. Clinicians should obtain a recent travel
history, including histories from sex partners, from those persons with
gonorrhea to ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy."
Although polyresistant strains are likely to occur in increasing frequency
in the US, to date, one of the 'old standbys,' spectinomycin, has remained
active, as has ceftriaxone.
