Typhoid epidemic continues to spread in Kyrgizia
-------------------------------------------------
The situation with typhus is still serious in Kyrgizia. On Tue, 18 Nov
2003, the Sanitary Epidemiological Surveiilance Department reported that
the number of people hospitalized with a preliminary diagnosis of typhoid
fever in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan has reached 200.
According to specialists, the most serious situations are in the Jalalabad
and Batken regions of Kyrgyzstan, where people suspected of having typhus
are being admitted to hospitals on a daily basis. About 100 people have
confirmed diagnoses of typhoid fever. According to the specialists, the
main cause of the [outbreak] was contamination of the rivers and ariks
(artificially designed channels for drinking water) by sewage. The local
population drinks water from these rivers and channels.
In Batken (bordering Tajikistan) for example, because of the lack of water,
people had to use typhoid-contaminated water from sources in Tajikistan.
