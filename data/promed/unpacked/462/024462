Indonesian health officials said on Thu [6 Oct 2005] that 2 young
men, including one who died a week ago, had proved positive for avian
influenza virus in local tests. I Nyoman Kandun, Head of disease
control at the Health Ministry, said specimens had been sent to a
Hong Kong laboratory recognised by the World Health Organisation for
further testing. Results should be available in the next few days.
Indonesian health officials suspect avian influenza [to be the cause
of] 6 deaths since July 2005 in the world's 4th-most-populous nation,
[whereas the WHO-designated reference laboratory in] Hong Kong has
confirmed only 4 cases.
"The PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) showed positive for both (men),"
said Kandun. "One is a 21-year-old man ... he is still alive and in a
stable condition. The other one had died. Both are proven to have had
direct contact with dead poultry."
Bird flu has killed more than 60 people in 4 Asian nations since late
2003 and has been found in birds [as far west as the European part of
Russia]. One of the greatest fears of experts is that the H5N1 bird
flu virus will mutate to become easily passed between humans,
triggering a pandemic. The current H5N1 strain cannot be easily
transmitted by people. Millions have died in past flu pandemics.
Authorities in Indonesia say they have found infected chickens that
were asymptomatic, which could raise a greater threat to humans by
making it harder to detect [see also ProMED-mail post entitled: Avian
influenza - Asia (36): Indonesia 20051005.2905]. Health experts say
the finding was bad news, but more information was needed, as there
are many different strains of H5N1. Many have low pathogenicity and
are relatively harmless, and only some have proven to be deadly for
birds and humans. Some species of waterfowl, like ducks and geese,
are natural hosts of the H5N1 and do not fall ill from it. The virus
has always been known to be virulent in chickens, but they typically
fall sick quickly and die within 24 hours of contracting it.
Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari said chickens without symptoms
had been found among those kept in backyards, while commercial
chickens usually died quickly when they contracted the disease.
"Certainly, it poses a greater danger for humans because we don't
know whether the poultry are infected, as they do not show any
symptoms," Supari said.
The country has come under fire for reluctance to carry out mass
culling of chickens in infected areas, like those conducted in some
other countries.
Supari said Indonesia had received 60 000 doses of the anti-viral drug Tamiflu
[for human use], mostly aid from neighbouring Australia. Tamiflu will be
distributed to 44 designated hospitals across the sprawling archipelago.
Indonesia cumulatively has had nearly 90 human cases under observation for
suspected bird flu, but most have proved negative. The virus has spread to 22
provinces out of 33 in Indonesia, killing more than 10 million domesticated
birds since late 2003. One of the difficulties in controlling the disease is
that a large number of people in both rural and urban areas of the country
keep a few chickens and other livestock.

2 other people in Indonesia have reportedly contracted the avian
influenza virus which is blamed for the deadly bird flu disease,
Health Ministry`s disease control and environmental sanitation,
director general I Nyoman Kandun said here today [Thu 6 Oct 2005].
The 2 patients were identified as a 21-year-old resident of Lampung
who had been treated at the Abdul Moeloek general hospital in Lampung
and a 23-year-old resident of Bogor, West Java, who died at the
Sulianti Saroso hospital here few days ago, Kandun said.
Quoting the results of the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) test of the Research and Development Agency at the
Health Ministry and Jakarta-branch Naval Medical Research Unit
(NAMRU), Kandun said the 2 patients were positively infected with
H5N1 virus which causes the bird flu illness. "Their samples will be
sent to a World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory in Hong Kong for
further confirmation," he said. He also said a team of the Health
Ministry and Atlanta-based Centre for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) were conducting investigation in Lampung following the report.
[As of 5 Oct 2005] the Health Ministry [stated that] 75 people in
Indonesia were believed to have contracted the bird flu virus, 11
others were probably infected with the H5N1 virus as they had
laboratory tests showing the tendency [?] of avian influenza virus
infection, and 4 others were confirmed by the WHO laboratory in Hong
Kong to have been infected with avian influenza virus. Another one
reportedly had a positive serological test but did not show clinical
symptoms, the data said. The people who were probably infected with
avian influenza virus were [residents of] Jakarta, Banten, West Java,
North Sumatra, East Kalimantan and Lampung.
According to [Ministry of Health] data, 11 of the people had died
but only 3 of the dead were confirmed to have contracted [avian H5N1
influenza virus infection]. Kandun said all the people were treated
at hospitals the government named as health centers for bird
flu-infected patients. In Jakarta alone, at least 20 people were
treated at Sulianto Saroso hospital as of 4 Oct 2005, he said, adding
that many of them had become sick after visiting the Ragunan Zoo in
South Jakarta.

A 20-month-old baby who was suspected of developing bird flu symptoms finally
died after 3 days of intensive treatment at the Sulianti Saroso Hospital in
Jakarta, a hospital spokesman said Thursday [6 Oct 2005]. The baby died
Wednesday evening due to respiratory problems and worsening pneumonia,
hospital spokesman Ilham Patu was quoted by the Detikcom online news service
as saying. Avian influenza has killed at least 7 people in the country [only 3
so far confirmed by WHO. - Mod.JW]. Indonesian healthcare authorities have
said at least 85 people were hospitalized for developing [avian influenza-
like] symptoms. The Sulianti Saroso Hospital, which is specialized for
patients with infectious diseases, is treating at least 20 suspected bird flu
patients.

The number of people suspected of having bird flu has doubled to 85
in Indonesia, a government official said here Wednesday [5 Oct 2005].
The cases were dispersed in 9 out of 30 Indonesian provinces, said I
Nyoman Kandun, director general of disease prevention with the
Ministry of Health. Kandun confirmed that 4 patients have tested
positive for bird flu, which [is suspected of having] killed 7
Indonesians so far. The ministry's earlier report put bird flu cases
at 42 nationwide.

Indonesia's Health Minister lowered the country's number of confirmed
human deaths from bird flu to 3 on Thursday, in line with figures
from the WHO. There had been confusion surrounding Indonesia's toll
from bird flu since its 1st death was reported in July 2005, in part
because local laboratory tests were not always consistent. Until
Thursday [6 Oct 2005], Indonesia had reported 6 fatalities from the
virus.
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has swept through poultry
populations in many parts of Asia since 2003, jumping to humans and
killing at least 62 people region-wide and resulting in the deaths of
tens of millions of birds. Most human cases have been linked to
contact with sick birds. Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari told
reporters there was only one other confirmed case of bird flu, and
that the patient was recovering.

[Reporting by the Indonesian healthcare authorities has confused assessment of
the extent of infection of the human population in Indonesia. Taken together,
these reports indicate that there have been 3 WHO-laboratory confirmed fatal
cases of avian H5N1 infection in Indonesia, one [confirmed] non-fatal case,
and a large number of suspected cases (variously given by Indonesia sources as
up to 75, 85 & 90), which have yet to be confirmed by the WHO-designated
reference laboratory in Hong Kong. - Mod.CP]
