["Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterised by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory problems of piglets and growing pigs. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), a virus currently classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_.

"The primary target cells of the virus are differentiated macrophages of the pig, mainly alveolar but also present in other tissues. Two major antigenically different types of the virus exist: Type 1 (previously described as European - EU) and Type 2 (previously North American - NA). Historically, Type 1 was restricted to Europe and Type 2 to North America; currently they are spread globally.

"The virus is primarily transmitted via direct contact but also by contact with faeces, urine, semen and fomites. The possibility of insect vectors (houseflies and mosquitos) and aerogenic spread for short distances has also been confirmed.

"PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world. The reproductive failure is characterised by infertility, late fetal mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and secondary infections. Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of respiratory disease, usually complicated by secondary infections."

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.8. 6 "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.06_PRRS.pdf (Adopted by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates, May 2015).

The following information was provided by Dr. Javier Vargas, Animal Health director, Agrocalidad: "Virus characterization will be conducted to identify the subtype associated with this outbreak. The source of infection has not been determined yet, therefore, identifying the subtype is important. Sanitary measures are being implemented to prevent the spread of the disease, and surveillance of the epidemiologically linked commercial operations is been done to determine their current status." We thank Dr. Vargas for providing this useful additional information related to this event.

There is no evidence of human infection with PRRS virus.
