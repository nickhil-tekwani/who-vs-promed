Where did the new coronavirus come from? Various clues point to the South China Seafood Market, which is considered the most likely source of the virus.

A 10-minute walk from Hankou Railway Station, you can reach the South China Seafood Market, which is the largest seafood market in Wuhan and the largest seafood market in central China. The 1st case of a new type of coronavirus pneumonia was found here.

Since the closure of business on 1 Jan 2020, the South China Seafood Market has continued to be closed, and more than 1000 shops in the Eastern and Western Districts have been closed.

Gao Fu, a member of the high-level expert group of the National Health and Medical Commission and director of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said yesterday [Tue 21 Jan 2020] that the source of the new coronavirus is currently inferred in the South China seafood market, with wild animals playing a key role. Academician Zhong Nanshan also pointed out that it is not clear which animal the virus originated from. According to the epidemiological survey, the virus comes from wild animals, and the most likely ones are bamboo rats and crickets.

Public information indicates that there are stalls selling legal wildlife in the South China market. According to the news released by the Wuhan Municipal Market Supervision and Administration Bureau on [25 Sep 2019], on the morning of the same day, 2 2-level market supervision departments in the urban area cooperated with the city's forestry, forest police, and other departments to launch a special wildlife market rectification operation. In the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, law enforcement officers at 2 levels in the urban area conducted carpet inspections of nearly 8 merchants selling tiger frogs, snakes, hedgehogs, and other animals, and examined their approval documents and business licenses for wild animal business licenses one by one. It is strictly forbidden to operate unapproved wild animals.

The locals are no stranger to the South China market. In the memory of C.C., a citizen of Wuhan, the South China market has been around for at least 15 years. In his opinion, it is an open secret to sell game in the market. "Civers, tiger frogs, peacocks ... you have everything." The owner of a shop in the South China market, L., told reporters that the stalls selling wild animals in the market are concentrated in a corridor in the central part of the Western District.

A staff member of the China Wildlife Conservation Association told reporters that there is still great difficulty in monitoring the management of wildlife. "It is difficult to determine the source of the wildlife sold, whether it is wild or artificial breeding. The source is only clear to the operator himself."

He said that if it was sold secretly, the source of the channel would be suspect, and there might be illegal acts such as illegal hunting. Some merchants may have violated the regulations without applying for the relevant business use licenses and breeding licenses, whether the sale of wild animals has been tested by a formal quarantine system, and whether they have the relevant health and quarantine department's permission.

Zhang Jinshuo, Ph.D., of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, participated in the [investigations into the wildlife] source of SARS in 2003, and finally pointed out with the research team that the source of the SARS virus was bats.

"We later published many papers and popular science articles, urging everyone to stop eating wild animals and not to have too close contact with wild animals. Only the health of wild animals and the health of ecosystems can [secure] human health."

To his disappointment, 17 years have passed, a new virus has appeared, and the bad habits of eating wild animals have not changed.

"2019 New Coronavirus" (2019-nCoV) pneumonia (Wuhan pneumonia) continued to develop fever, and the number of infections continued to rise. On the evening of [Tue 21 Jan 2020], Taiwan was diagnosed with the 1st severely infectious pneumonia case overseas, but the source of the virus was unknown. Chinese media believes that the Wuhan South China seafood market is the cause of the outbreak of Wuhan pneumonia, and Zhong Nanshan, China's chief infectious disease expert, said that it is more likely to be transmitted from wild animals to humans.

Zhong Nanshan said that in the early days of the outbreak, most cases of infection were related to Wuhan South China Seafood Market. At present, the market has been closed by the Wuhan Municipal Government, but what exactly does the Wuhan South China Seafood Market sell? As the pneumonia epidemic gradually became serious, it attracted outside attention.

Recently, a "game price list" sold at the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan has been reposted online. The address is "Popular Animal Husbandry and Game" booth located in the east area of South China Seafood Market in Hankou Railway Station, Wuhan. It sells various wild animals, including live deer. The highest price is RMB 6000 [USD 865.55], and the cheapest centipede is only RMB 5, but some "games" do not specify the price [a picture of the price list is presented at the source URL. - Mod.AS].

In addition to Wuhan, Hong Kong media took photos and pointed out that a farm wholesale market in Qingyuan, Guangdong province, also sells "game," including Chinese bamboo rats (_Rhizomys sinensis_), cats of different breeds, porcupines, dogs, and mink, and they are all wild.

It is understood that the Wuhan South China Seafood Market is divided into Eastern and Western Districts. The Western District mainly sells seafood and aquatic products, while the Eastern District is mainly based on poultry meat, shrimps, and fresh seasonings.

Zhong Nanshan pointed out in an interview with China Central Television that the epidemic was concentrated in 2 districts in Wuhan, both of which have relatively large "seafood markets," but in fact there are more game products. He said that preliminary epidemiological analysis has indicated there is a greater possibility of transmission from wild animals to people. He further stated that the source of the new coronavirus is likely to be wild animals.

Gao Fu, a member of the high-level expert group of the National Health Commission of China, pointed out that a new coronavirus has been detected in the environment in which wild animals are sold, but the source of the infection is unknown. He pointed out that the new coronavirus should be said to be the 7th [zoonotic] species. A total of 6 [coronavirus] species, including SARS, have been known in the past to be transmitted by a mammal or wild animal, and then infect humans through the host.

Gao Fu believes that the virus was in the Wuhan South China Seafood Market because the earliest patients were related to the Wuhan South China Seafood Market at the beginning of the outbreak of pneumonia. Jumping from animals to humans, there is adaptive mutation, which is a limited human-to-human transmission.

https://technews.tw/2020/01/22/wuhan-pneumonia-virus-source/


The State Council Information Office held a press conference on pneumonia prevention and control of new coronavirus infections in the morning of [Wed 22 Jan 2020]. In response to questions, Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, frankly stated that the recognition of the virus is a "gradual process" and is "in the process of constant recognition."

Regarding the question of whether there is a "super communicator," Gao Fu said, "there is no evidence yet."

The source of the virus may point to wildlife in the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan. Gao Fu said today [Wed 22 Jan 2020]: "Now we already know the source of this virus. Now everyone is focusing on a market where there are wild animal transactions, so the source may be its wildlife and the environment it pollutes."

He added that at 1st it was only animal-to-human transmission, and then the adaptive mutation of the virus to the host, and the phenomenon of human-to-human transmission has appeared, and there have been some community transmissions. "Its source is the wild animals sold in the seafood market, and this wild animal virus is gradually adapting."

Gao Fu also mentioned that according to the current epidemiology and observation, younger children are indeed less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus.

As of 24:00 on [Tue 21 Jan 2020], a total of 13 provinces in China had an epidemic. A total of 440 cases have been confirmed so far, and 9 cases have died. Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Committee of China, said that the cases were mainly related to Wuhan, and human-to-human and medical staff infections had occurred, and there was a certain range of community transmission. The epidemic is mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract. The virus may mutate, and the epidemic is at risk of further spread.

Abstract
The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019‐nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many patients were potentially exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To determine the possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on existing sequences of the newly identified coronavirus 2019‐nCoV. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019‐nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin‐unknown coronavirus. The recombination occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019‐nCoV based on its RSCU bias resembling snake compared to other animals. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein may contribute to cross‐species transmission from snake to humans.

[The authors mention the following animal species known to them as traded in the Huanan seafood wholesale market: snakes, marmots, bats, birds, frogs, hedgehogs, and rabbit. Other sources (see items) mentioned additional species.

To estimate the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of the 2019-nCoV and its potential host(s), the coding sequences of 2 snakes species, 5 other wild animal species, and human were analysed. The snakes were: _Bungarus multicinctus_ (Many-banded krait) and _Naja Atra_ (Chinese cobra). The other animal species were: _Rhinolophus sinicus_ (Chinese rufous horseshoe bat), Marmota, _Erinaceus Europaeus_ (European hedgehog), _Manis javanica_ (Malayan/Javan pangolin) and _Gallus gallus_ (red junglefowl; the progenitor of the domestic chicken, _Gallus gallus domesticus_).

The squared euclidean distance indicates that the 2019-nCoV and snakes from China had the highest RSCU bias compared to those of marmota, hedgehog, manis, bat, bird, and human, leading to the authors' conclusion that "the results from the analysis suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir responsible for the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV infection."

According to the paper, the 2 mentioned snakes are present in vast parts of China, including Hubei (map, fig 4 in the paper). They also address their respective distribution in other regional countries. - Mod.AS]

[It should be noted that this remains a preliminary result, and that other phylogenetic analyses conducted thus far indicate that the Wuhan 2019-nCoV clusters most closely with certain bat beta coronaviruses. David Robertson and Xiaowei Jiang have conducted their own preliminary molecular evolutionary analyses, and these as well as Robertson's critique of the Ji et al. results above may be viewed at http://virological.org/t/ncovs-relationship-to-bat-coronaviruses-recombination-signals-no-snakes/331.

It is also possible that a wild animal species sold at the Huanan seafood wholesale market or similar markets could be an amplification host rather than the actual animal reservoir in the wild. In any case, we have as yet no confirmatory evidence of the animal source of the current Wuhan outbreak, let alone the wild animal reservoir of the 2019-nCoV virus.

[5] WHO recommendations to reduce health risk from live animal markets
Date: Thu 23 Jan 2020 [accessed]

WHO recommendations to reduce risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to humans in live animal markets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On [31 Dec 2019], WHO was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology (unknown cause) detected in Wuhan City, Hubei province of China. A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on [7 Jan 2020].

Investigations are ongoing to evaluate the source of the outbreak, mode(s) of transmission, and the extent of infection. Available evidence on the 2019-nCoV virus and previous experience with other coronavirus (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) and other respiratory viruses (e.g., avian influenza) suggest that there may be zoonotic transmission associated with the 2019-nCoV.

In light of available evidence and past experience, WHO makes the following general recommendations:

1. As a general precaution, anyone visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets, should practice general hygiene measures, including regular handwashing with soap and potable water after touching animals and animal products, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with hands, and avoiding contact with sick animals or spoiled animal products. Any contact with other animals possibly living in the market (e.g., stray cats and dogs, rodents, birds, bats) should be strictly avoided. Attention should also be taken to avoid contact with potentially contaminated animal waste or fluids on the soil or structures of shops and market facilities.

2. The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk, or animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.

Recommendations for at-risk groups:

1. Until more is understood about the 2019-nCoV, people with underlying medical conditions are considered at higher risk of severe disease. Therefore, individuals with these underlying medical conditions should avoid contact with live animal markets, stray animals and wild animals, should not eat animal raw meat. Such recommendations should also be disseminated to travellers and tourists with underlying medical conditions.

2. Slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians in charge of animal and food inspection in markets, market workers, and those handling live animals and animal products should practice good personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing after touching animals and animal products. They should consider wearing protective gowns, gloves, and masks while professionally handling animals and fresh animal products. Equipment and working stations should be disinfected frequently, at least once a day. Protective clothing should be removed after work and washed daily. Workers should avoid exposing family members to soiled work clothing, shoes, or other items that may have come into contact with potentially contaminated material. It is therefore recommended that protective clothes and items remain at the workplace for daily washing.

3. Based on available information, it is not known if the 2019-nCoV has any impact on the health of animals, and no particular event has been reported in any species. As a general recommendation, sick animals should never be slaughtered for consumption; dead animals should be safely buried or destroyed, and contact with their body fluids should be avoided without protective clothes. Veterinarians should maintain a high level of vigilance and report any unusual event detected in any animal species present in the markets to veterinary authorities.

https://www.oie.int/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/


Questions and answers on 2019novel-Coronavirus
-----------------------------------------------

1. Are animals responsible for 2019novel-CoV infections in people?

Genetic sequence data reveals that 2019-novelCoV is a close relative of other CoV found circulating in _Rhinolophus_ bat (horseshoe bat) populations. There is suspicion that the 2019-novelCoV may have had an animal source, but further investigations are required to confirm this.

Although there is suspicion that the initial introduction of 2019novelCoV to humans may have come from an animal source, the predominant route of subsequent transmission appears to be from human to human. Ongoing investigations are important for identifying the animal source (including species) and establishing the potential role of an animal reservoir in this disease.

2. Are there any precautions to take with live animals or animal products?

In accordance with advice offered by the WHO, as a general precaution, when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets, general hygiene measures should be applied, including regular handwashing with soap and potable water after touching animals and animal products, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with hands, and avoiding contact with sick animals or spoiled animal products. Any contact with other animals possibly living in the market (e.g., stray cats and dogs, rodents, birds, bats) should be strictly avoided. Attention should also be taken to avoid contact with potentially contaminated animal waste or fluids on the soil or structures of shops and market facilities.

Standard recommendations issued by WHO to prevent infection spread include regular handwashing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Raw meat, milk, or animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices. Further recommendations from WHO can be consulted here: https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#.

Based on currently available information, travel or trade restrictions are not recommended.

One Chinese media source (https://moore.live/news/186136/detail/, dated 22 Jan 2020, in Chinese) informed about wild canids and dogs being suspected. It included the following: "From the data of RT-PCR and in vitro experiments, the new coronavirus has achieved complete replication in dog cells, and can be transmitted to humans and dogs by non-contact air, but incomplete replication in human cells," and "According to a survey, wolf cubs and wolf cub meat were indeed sold in game restaurants in the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan. Well, the source of the pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus may be wolves illegally sold in some South China seafood market game restaurants." The source concluded, "Therefore, for the purpose of epidemic prevention, it is best not to make frequent contact with dogs and keep dogs away from hospitals in the near future." No supportive evidence from a scientific source could be traced.

Notably, one of China's leading centers for coronavirus reservoir research is situated in Wuhan. It is the Center of Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The Center is led by Prof. Shi Zhengli.

Following the SARS event, her team investigated bats in 18 of China's provinces. Eventually, they found a group of bats carrying a SARS-like coronavirus in a remote cave in Yunnan province, with a high degree of homology to the SARS virus involved in the 2003 event (United Chinese Press report, 20 Jan 2020 at https://tinyurl.com/sojmooy).

The above research was eventually published in 2017 in the following (open access) paper.

Hu B, Zeng L-P, Yang X-L, Ge X-Y, Zhang W, Li B, et al.: Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus. PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13(11): e1006698. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698.

"Abstract
A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China. However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc.) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. In addition, we report the 1st discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b. Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that 3 newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases."

It may be assumed that the animal reservoir of 2019-novelCoV, and possibly intermediate animal(s) between the reservoir and humans, are being investigated by several other research institutes in China; their findings are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
