_Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 in Australia linked to Helva
confectionary
imported from Turkey
--------------------------
Since 12 Jun 2001, the Communicable Diseases Section, Department of
Human
Services, Victoria, Australia has been investigating a cluster of 14
cases of _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 (STM 104) in metropolitan
Melbourne, Victoria. All cases are aged between 3-40 years and all are
of Middle Eastern backgrounds (Turkey, Iraq). STM 104 is a rare
serovar in Australia and is usually associated with overseas travel.
None of the cases had a history of travel overseas.
Initial investigations, including a case-control study and
environmental sampling had failed to detect a source although a clear
association with shopping in continental delicatessens was
established. On the 23 Jul 2001 the Department became aware of an
outbreak of STM 104 in Sweden which had been linked to the SERA brand
of Helva, (otherwise known as Halva or Halwa [or Halvah), a type of
sweet made from sesame seeds, sugar, and flavouring which had been
imported from Turkey.
The Department has now established a clear epidemiological association
with the consumption of helva in Victoria. Subsequent sampling of
helva products has resulted in the isolation of STM 104 from 2 brands
of Helva which have both been imported from Turkey:
GULSAN Brand: Kakaolou (chocolate), 800g, production date 10/2000,
expiry date 10/2001
Kakaolou (chocolate), 400g, production date 10/2000, expiry date
10/2001
Sade (plain), 400g, production date 10/2000, expiry date 10/2001
Antep Fistikli (pistachio), 800g, production date 10/2000, expiry date
10/2001
CEREN Brand: Vanilyali (vanilla), 350g, production date 10/2000,
expiry date 10/2003
Kakaolu (chocolate), 350g, production date 10/2000, expiry date
10/2003
The STM 104 isolates from the Gulsan brand have the same antibiotic
resistance patterns as the cases. Antibiotic sensitivities are not yet
available for the isolates from the Ceren products.
Investigations are continuing to determine whether the products are
produced by the same manufacturer. A national recall of GULSAN and
CEREN helva is being coordinated by the Australia New Zealand Food
Authority (ANZFA). Also 2 further cases have been notified by another
state in Australia and a potential link to helva is currently being
investigated. The Department is maintaining a close liaison closely
with the Swedish investigators [see below.

_Salmonella typhimurium_ outbreak in Sweden from contaminated jars of
helva
(or halva)
-------------------------------
In early June 2001, at least 10 people resident in the south of Sweden
were found to be infected with _Salmonella typhimurium_ definitive
phage type (DT)104. They were mostly children with a predominance of
Arabic names. An earlier outbreak of _S. typhimurium_ infection,
involving both DT9, DT30, and probably also not specifically typeable
(NST) strains of _S. typhimurium_ that had a common phage type
pattern, was associated with the consumption of tahini (sesame paste),
with most cases also in the south of Sweden. It was therefore
suspected that the new cases had acquired the
infection in a similar way.
The first interviews showed, however, that the cases had not been
eating tahini, but imported helva (or halva)- a type of dessert or
sweet made from sesame seeds. The first case in the recent outbreak of
_S. typhimurium_ DT104 infection fell ill on 13 Apr 2001 and the
latest reported case on 19 June. The investigation showed that 27
people (23 from the south of Sweden -- 2 of them asymptomatic -- and 4
from another county) had become infected after consuming helva. Of the
4 people in the nearby county, 3 belonged to the same family.
The phage typing has been completed for all but 2 of the patients, and
all 25 have _S. typhimurium_ DT104. The age of the cases ranged from 5
months to 50 years, with 15 of the cases being younger than 10 years.
Of the cases 11 were men and 16 women, none of whom died. Salmonella
of the same type has also been directly isolated from 5 jars of helva,
4 with pistachio and one with cocoa flavouring. Information about
salmonella isolated from helva (pistachio flavour) was first
disseminated by the Swedish Food Administration on 11 June, with
notification on 20 June that
cocoa-flavoured helva was also contaminated.
Initial information about the product stated that it had been
distributed solely in the very south of Sweden, but the appearance of
4 cases from another county showed that this was incorrect. This
uncertainty about the distribution area underlines the difficulty of
informing all at risk, particularly those who may still have the
product at home. Language problems also added to the difficulties of
disseminating prevention
information.
Full details of the contaminated helva product, which was distributed
in 350 g and 750 g jars, are available on the website of the Swedish
Food Administration (<http://www.slv.se/livstecknet/>). On 19 Jun 2001
an international alert notification was distributed through the
European Commission's Rapid Alert System for Food. The extent of
international distribution of the contaminated product is unclear at
present.
In recent years, Smittskyddsinstitutet (SMI, Swedish Institute for
Infectious Disease Control) has seen an increase of salmonella
infection from outbreaks and from food samples associated with
different types of imported vegetables, spices, and seeds, including
tahini, fresh and dry spices, banana leaves, and bean sprouts.
