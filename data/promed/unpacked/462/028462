Parks Canada reports possible Wood Buffalo anthrax outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------
Parks Canada says a possible anthrax outbreak among bison is being investigated in what it called a "remote backcountry area" of Wood Buffalo National Park.

In a statement this week, the federal agency said the suspected outbreak was in a southern area of the park away from visitor facilities and roads that cross the park. "Late last week, staff received mortality signals from several collared bison in the southern area of the park," Parks Canada stated. "Three bison were observed deceased in the Sweetgrass area and 2 were field tested for anthrax. The samples are being sent to a lab to confirm the results."

Since then, Parks Canada added, "More bison have been found deceased and anthrax is suspected."

Carcasses have been found at Lake One and the Trident Creek or Trident Meadows area. "So far, the deceased bison have been located in remote locations of the park and we don't foresee any threat to the public," Parks Canada stated. An area closure is in place for Sweetgrass, Trident Creek and Trident Meadows.

[For a description of the park and its location, go to Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Buffalo_National_Park. If you wish to see a map of the known and long documented bison anthrax sites in NWT go to http://norj.ca/2015/07/anthrax-confirmed-in-wood-buffalo-national-park-bison/. My comments are in the post Anthrax - Canada (04): (NT) bison, no new cases 20150728.3543114.

Every summer surveillance flights are flown by Parks Canada to look for dead bison in the park, where anthrax has a long history. Until recently all dead bison were burnt. The sites noted in this report have all had anthrax cases in the past. Parks Canada used 'Hot Shot' teams from fire response, who would be flown in by helicopter and were extremely efficient and quick in burning the bison carcasses. I suspect that this sudden appearance of multiple possible anthrax deaths at different sites may initiate discussion on renewing carcass burning. It was very successful in reducing the number of cases and can be credited for the apparent absence of cases over a number of years recently. But it should be noted that latterly during the March darting & bleeding exercises bison with anthrax antibodies have been noted in areas where no deaths had been seen during the previous summers. A puzzle. - Mod.MHJ
