The overall epidemiologic status of Guinea's Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is improving, with 4 of the 6 locations that have reported cases passing the 21-day incubation period with no new cases, according to an update from the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa; 2 incubation periods [42 days] need to pass before the outbreak can be declared over in a particular location.

Ten more cases and 5 more deaths have been reported in Guinea, pushing the country's outbreak total to 218 suspected or confirmed cases, 141 of them fatal; 3 more cases were confirmed by lab tests, raising that total to 115. The latest illness onset of a suspected case was 23 Apr 2014, and the isolation of the most recent confirmed case was 22 Apr 2014.

Liberia has reported one more illness clinically compatible with EVD, raising its total to 35; 6 are confirmed, 2 probable, and 27 suspected cases. The WHO said the country's health ministry is working on reconciling suspected cases with lab-confirmed cases and expects that most suspected cases will be ruled out.

Sierra Leone's health ministry is investigating 3 patients who have illnesses compatible with viral hemorrhagic fever for possible Lassa fever or EVD, the WHO said. So far, no Ebola outbreak cases have been detected in the country.

If the isolation of the most recent confirmed case was 22 Apr 2014, and there are no more, Guinea could be declared free of Ebola on 7 Jun 2014. But there have been reports of people in Guinea concealing sick and dead family members, which could result in the outbreak continuing, so to speak, underground. - Mod.JW
