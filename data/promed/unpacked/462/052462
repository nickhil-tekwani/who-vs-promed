Some background data on cryptosporidiosis in Spain:
-----------------------------------------
182 cases of cryptosporidiosis complicating AIDS were reported in 1994;
156 in 1995;
133 in 1996;
65 in 1997.
97 positive laboratory reports were received in 1999;
54 in 2000;
88 in 2001.
112 confirmed cases and an additional 107 suspect cases were reported among
British tourists staying at a hotel in Majorca in 2000 [see ref. below]. A
contaminated swimming pool was implicated. The same resort had been
associated with cases of cryptosporidiosis in 1997.
One waterborne outbreak was reported during 1986 to 1996. An outbreak (8
confirmed cases) among pre-school children in Guadarrama during 1998 was
ascribed to contaminated tap water.

[Infections with cryptosporidia are not notifiable and are most likely to be
reported during outbreaks and from diagnostic laboratories. The numbers
therefore represent only a small part of those infected and just illustrate
that infection by cryptosporidia is found in Spain. - Mod.EP]
