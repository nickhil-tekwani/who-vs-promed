On 7 Oct 2020, a patient in Alberta, Canada presented to a rural hospital with a 4-day history of cough, fever, pharyngitis, and rhinorrhea. The nasopharyngeal swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and positive for influenza A using the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex Corporation). Influenza A was confirmed using a real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the M-gene; however, it could not be typed as human or avian H3, H1, pandemic H1N1, H5, or H7 subtypes using primers/probes from the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) [1].

Partial sequence of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes was obtained by Sanger sequencing. Sequences were compared to the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nr database using blastn, resulting in high nucleotide similarity to H1 and N2 subtypes of swine origin.

Prospective and retrospective testing of respiratory specimens from the region of Alberta where the case was found (2 weeks prior to and 4 weeks after the case) detected no other cases of influenza A. To date, Alberta has not reported any cases of influenza A for the 2020/2021 influenza season [2]. This is the 1st case of H1N2v reported from Canada [3].

The patient recovered at home without complication and did not require hospitalisation. One of 3 other household members had mild symptoms but was never tested and remained at home for 10 days on recommendation from public health officials due to respiratory symptoms. No other household members developed symptoms. Upon determination of this to be H1N2v, the case was reported to government authorities [4] as well as to the Public Health Agency of Canada [3], with notification to the World Health Organisation as per International Health Regulations [5].

[ProMED thanks Jamil Kanji and colleagues for their contribution and update on the human case of swine origin influenza virus A/H1N2v.

This is the 1st reported human case of swine origin A/H1N2v reported from Canada and was reported earlier in November 2020 in ProMED-mail. See: Influenza (13): Canada (AB) swine origin H1N2v 20201107.7920376. Earlier in July 2020, 2 human cases of swine origin A/H1N2v were reported from Brazil [https://www.who.int/csr/don/09-jul-2020-influenza-a-brazil/en/].

To date, 27 cases of influenza A(H1N2)v have been reported to WHO since 2005 [including the above report]. Most of the cases have presented with mild illness, and there has been no evidence of person-to-person transmission.

Swine influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. Most human cases are the result of exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations around the world, further human cases can be expected. Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, with timely sharing of such changes for risk assessment. - Mod.UBA
