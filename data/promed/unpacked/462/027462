South Dakota's Animal Industry Board says 2 cases of vesicular stomatitis virus have been confirmed in livestock in the western part of the state. The highly contagious animal disease is transmitted by flies and midges. It can infect horses, cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. It is rarely fatal.

There also have been cases this year [2015] in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and Arizona.

South Dakota State Veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven says good sanitation and biosecurity measures can help prevent the spread of the disease.

[This report is very vague. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) affects cattle, and horses but can also affect swine, sheep and goats. Neither this article nor the South Dakota animal Industry Board indicate which animals are infected.

Owners should remember:
- Strict fly control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of the disease.
- Avoid transferring feeding equipment, cleaning tools, or health care equipment from other herds.

How vesicular stomatitis spreads is not fully known; insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and movement of animals are all factors. Once the disease is introduced into a herd, it may move from animal to animal by contact or exposure to saliva or fluid from ruptured vesicles. Humans rarely contract vesicular stomatitis, but they can become infected.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. Humans can also become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. Vesicular stomatitis has been confirmed only in the western hemisphere. It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, but outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically.

In people, the disease causes an acute influenza-like illness with symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache, and malaise. To avoid exposure to this disease, individuals should use personal protective measures when handling affected animals.
