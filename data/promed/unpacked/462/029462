Avian influenza has struck Viet Nam again with 6 outbreaks of the
H5N1 strain since the weekend [19 - 20 May 2007], killing almost 2000
unvaccinated ducks, veterinary officials said on Tuesday [22 May
2007]. Almost 6000 more birds were culled on the affected farms,
stretching from Son La province in the mountainous north to the
southern Mekong Delta province of Can Tho, said the animal health
department in an online report. "It's not a surprise," said UN Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) representative Andrew Speedy.
"It's unfortunate that it goes on happening, but it will go on happening."
Speedy said efforts will focus on containing H5N1 with vaccination
campaigns that have proved highly effective, rather than trying to
eradicate the virus, which is thought to be widespread across Viet
Nam's bird population. "We are now convinced that it's pretty much
endemic and that the vaccinations will be required for the
foreseeable future, although there will be an attempt to find an exit
strategy at some point," he said.
Outbreaks among unvaccinated ducks have also been reported in the
northern provinces of Quang Ninh and Nam Dinh, and the virus is
spreading in central Nghe An province, where an outbreak was reported
early this month [May 2007]. Viet Nam -- once the country worst hit
by avian influenza, with 42 human deaths between 2003 and 2005 -- has
since won plaudits for effectively containing the spread of the virus
through culls, vaccinations, and public education.
However, ducks, which traditionally roam across Vietnamese rice
fields and ponds, have been a special source of concern because they
carry and spread the virus without showing symptoms of illness.
Earlier this year [2007], Viet Nam lifted a ban on raising ducks that
experts said had been widely ignored. Veterinarians are now starting
the year's [2007] 2nd nationwide round of vaccinations in order to
contain the H5N1 strain of avian influenza.
Avian influenza has killed 185 people since late 2003, most of them
in Southeast Asia, according to World Health Organization (WHO)
figures. In its present form, H5N1 is lethal for birds and people in
close proximity to infected fowl, but experts fear that it could one
day mutate to easily spread from human to human and trigger a deadly pandemic.

The Veterinary Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development has officially confirmed that avian influenza has
returned to many communes of the provinces of Quang Ninh, Son La, and
Nam Dinh, in the north, and Can Tho in the south. Tests show that all
dead fowls in those provinces are positive for the H5N1 virus.
[On 16 May 2007, H5N1 bird flu virus was detected in 116 dead ducks
and geese of a total of 443 unvaccinated baby fowls belonging to a
family in Mong Cai Town (Quang Ninh province). In the south, the
epidemic reemerged in Can Tho province on 17 May 2007, with 375
ducks, also dead because of the H5N1 virus, of the 1500 unvaccinated
ducks that belonged to 2 families in Thanh Loc commune, Vinh Thanh district.]
The disease also attacked the northern mountainous province of Son La
with 130 ducks and geese dead of the total 960 heads, [also not vaccinated].
[Avian influenza was detected in Nam Dinh on 19 May 2007, where over
1200 unvaccinated ducks owned by 3 families, also died because of H5N1 virus.]
The localities cited above have already culled all the ill fowls and
decontaminated the disease-stricken areas. The Veterinary Agency has
sent their experts to those provinces to help local authorities
prevent the spread of this dangerous epidemic. So far, 60 provinces
have been implementing [1st phase vaccination for 2007,] with over
116.6 million birds injected.

On Tue 22 May 2007, veterinary officials in Ghana declared the 2nd
outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus in the west African country.
The latest outbreak was on a farm in Sunyani, a provincial capital
400 km (250 mi) north of Accra. Gary Quarcoo, head of veterinary
services at the agriculture ministry, confirmed that samples from the
farm had tested positive for the deadly bird flu virus. The latest
case comes less than a month after Ghana's 1st case of H5N1 was
detected on a farm near Tema, a port city to the east of Accra.
Quarcoo said veterinary officials have culled thousands of birds in
Sunyani and destroyed animal feed and farm equipment. Ghana is the
8th African country to report a case of the H5N1 bird flu virus in poultry.
According to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, avian influenza
has killed 185 people since late 2003, most of them in Southeast
Asia. In its present form, H5N1 is lethal for birds and people in
close proximity to infected fowl, but experts fear that it could one
day mutate to easily spread from human to human and trigger a deadly pandemic.

The livestock wing of ministry of food and agriculture has confirmed
the presence of the menacing bird flu in 4 chicken farms of Chak
Shazad [Islamabad]. [The owners of the farms had refused to cooperate
but agreed to the culling of 10 000 birds after the livestock
department's assurance of compensation.]
The commissioner for livestock, Dr. R. H. Usmani, informed the [media
about the situation and said that although tests have confirmed the
presence of bird flu virus, it is not widespread.] He added that a
survey was underway, but so far, there has been no information
regarding bird flu. Still, the vigilance has been enhanced, and
[Usmani] cautioned that if the farm owners continued to resist, help
of the district administration would be sought in order to contain the virus.

[5] OIE - press release/comment
Date: Tue 22 May 2007

59 countries have reported outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of avian
influenza from 2003 to date. The Veterinary Services (VS) in the
majority of these countries have successfully dealt with these
outbreaks. Globally, countries have improved governance on
implementation of preventive measures as recommended by the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Health Organisation
(WHO) to avert the disease.
"In the first half of 2007, countries reported fewer deaths of wild
and migratory birds, which could indicate the disease is coming
closer to the end of a cycle. Reversely poultry flocks still continue
to be infected in some countries and that shows the international
community needs to keep up its high level of prevention and control
measures of the disease in animals," commented Dr Bernard Vallat,
Director General of the OIE.
The disease remains endemic in at least 3 countries (Indonesia ,
Nigeria and Egypt) and continues to appear in previously unaffected
countries. These events offer valuable opportunity to further
identify the complex issues in dealing with the disease.
Stronger veterinary governance and solidarity worldwide: a strategy
as valid as ever
----------------------------
The OIE continually strives to align strong and credible Veterinary
Services (VS) with international standards in terms of governance,
organization and establish necessary scientific, diagnostic expertise
and capacity in all OIE member countries . This will be the key in
the continued success of dealing with highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI), as well as any other emerging and re-emerging
disease in the future.
The Veterinary Services (VS) are the very core of the system for the
prevention and control of HPAI and play a major role in every country
as guarantors of animal health and in associated public health
issues. A single failing country and the whole world is at risk of
infection. Solidarity is a critical component of the fight against
avian influenza. This is why the OIE uses the "Performance, Vision
and Strategy" tool to identify the needs for investment in developing
countries which is key for the prevention and eradication of avian
influenza worldwide.
With the focus of the international community on the current global
HPAI disease situation, the OIE's objectives of promoting
transparency in collecting, analysing and disseminating veterinary
information, strengthening international coordination and cooperation
in the control of animal diseases and zoonoses continue as a priority
of the organisation.
Science and peer-reviewed guidelines as a foundation
------------------------
The science-based standards, guidelines and recommendations issued by
the OIE thanks to its worldwide network of scientists are designated
as the international reference in dealing with HPAI. The OIE
continues to develop and revise those standards and to address
scientific and technical issues of prevention, control and eradication.
OIE reaffirms the most effective strategy for dealing directly with
HPAI in poultry; early detection and early warning, rapid
confirmation of suspects, rapid and transparent notification, rapid
response (including containment, management of poultry movement,
humane stamping out and vaccination where appropriate).
The long term vision of this strategy that OIE shares with FAO is to
minimize the global threat of HPAI in domestic poultry and human
infections through progressive control and eradication the disease in
poultry. Achieving this goal will stabilize poultry production and
food security globally, enhance market access and trade in poultry
and poultry products; improve public health including food safety,
improve the livelihoods of rural populations and diminish the global
threat of a human pandemic .

[Avian influenza is obviously not going away any time soon. However,
the progress that a wide variety of countries have made is proof that
this virus can be managed. Furthermore, the OIE statement is a signal
that progress can be made; there is hope it will eventually be
overcome if everyone continues to put their best efforts forward. The
best defense is a strong offense.
There is also much room for ample caution with Indonesia, Nigeria,
Egypt (and now it appears, Ghana) still battling this virus.
Certainly, we will have the opportunity to gain further insight
regarding this epidemic. The information on Viet Nam, one of the most
heralded success stories of this pandemic, should serve as a
cautionary tale to anyone who thinks we have turned the corner.
The OIE statement declares we have the capability and veterinary
infrastructure to beat the virus down to low levels, but a careful
reading underscores the point that we must stay vigilant if we are to
maintain the momentum in the fight against this pandemic. We will
need to continue to develop structures for the effective delivery of
preventive services, understanding the interface been wild birds and
domestic poultry populations, and improve surveillance systems.
Most importantly, we should learn from history. This is about the
time when exhaustion, over confidence, complacency and, most
importantly, a shift in resource priorities can weaken or even
reverse the momentum of control and/or eradication campaigns. Given
the human, animal, and economic stakes involved in Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza (HPAI) we should be most vigilant now. It is
pertinent to recall that this H5N1 virus has given us several
surprises in the past and it is best to keep both eyes trained on it. - Mod.PC]
