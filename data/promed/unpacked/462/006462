A brucellosis outbreak in central Uzbekistan is linked to problems with
veterinary and sanitary measures, a local human rights group said on Mon 10
Jan 2005.
Dr Kurbon Turdiev, a physician from a hospital in the Jizzak region, was
quoted by Uzbekistan's Human Rights Society, Ezgulik, as saying that 19
people are in hospital with brucellosis.
World Health Organization information said brucellosis is transmitted from
animals to humans through contaminated and untreated milk and milk products
or by direct contact with infected animals and animal carcasses. Cattle,
sheep, goats, pigs, and camels can transmit the disease. WHO officials said
brucellosis is accompanied by fever, generalized aches and pains, fatigue,
and depression.

[_Brucella sp._ are Category B bioterrorism zoonotic agents. Of the 3 major
species, _abortus_ is found in cattle, _melitensis_ in goats and _suis_ in
swine. In this area of the world, the caprine species is most common.
Symptoms of brucellosis are protean in nature, and none are specific enough
to make the diagnosis. Symptoms include fever, which is intermittent in 60
per cent of patients with acute and chronic conditions, undulant in 60 per
cent of patients with subacute brucellosis, and can be associated with a
relative bradycardia. Fever of unknown origin is not an uncommon initial
diagnosis for patients in areas of low endemicity.
Constitutional symptoms include anorexia, asthenia, fatigue, weakness, and
malaise.
Bone and joint symptoms include arthralgias; low back pain; spine and joint
pain; and, rarely, joint swelling. Symptoms were present on presentation in
as many as 55 per cent of patients.
Respiratory complaints of cough and dyspnea are present in as many as 19
per cent of cases, but these complaints rarely are associated with active
pulmonary involvement. Pleuritic chest pain can be observed in patients
with underlying empyema.
Neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequent despite the rare involvement of the
nervous system. Headache, depression, and fatigue are the most frequently
reported complaints.
Gastrointestinal complaints, present in 51 per cent of patients, include
abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting.
Neurologic symptoms can include weakness, dizziness, unsteadiness of gait,
and urinary retention. Complaints associated with cranial nerve dysfunction
can be present in those with chronic CNS involvement. - Mod.LL]
