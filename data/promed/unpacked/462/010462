Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comments: Key interventions in order to contain the spread of the Rift Valley disease
In order to minimize the contact between sick and healthy animals, quarantine measures such as banning the movement of all livestock and livestock products in Ngoma, Kirehe, and Kayonza districts were imposed. Targeted vaccination of healthy livestock in the 3 districts is under way, starting from affected zones and moving to cover the risk area. Vaccination cost is fully covered by the government of Rwanda. A strong awareness campaign is underway through several radio (RBA, IZUBA, ISANGO STAR, KT Radio, Huguka, New times, Radio Salus, Communities Radio Nyagatare, Huye) announcements educating the public on how to avoid further spread of the disease, especially avoiding mosquitoes, sleeping under mosquito nets, and clearing bushes that are hiding and breeding areas for mosquitoes. People are advised to report signs of suspected cases of livestock to veterinarians and to avoid meat from livestock that shows signs of the disease. MINAGRI has acquired an acaricide (drug used to control ticks and mosquitoes) that has proved to be very effective and has deployed staff to help farmers spray their livestock, paying particular attention to proper mixing and application of the acaricide. FAO has provided PPEs and sample shipment materials to the National Veterinary Laboratory from the USAID-funded emergency stockpiles. A total of 237 386 cattle, 22 727 goats, and 17 872 sheep were vaccinated, which represent 84.6 per cent of the risk area. In addition, 457 858 animals (cattle, goats, and sheep) were sprayed using an acaricide.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, screening, zoning, disinfection, control of vectors, vector surveillance, ante and post-mortem inspections, no treatment of affected animals

[Although this report was reported late to the OIE, it does provide information on the outbreaks that occurred in Kirehe and Ngoma. No information has been provided on outbreaks occurring in Kayonza and Kamonyi; but vaccination in response to the outbreak(s) was applied in all these districts. See comments of Mod.AS in ProMED-mail posts 20180731.5938668 and 20180808.5953335.

The following background information about RVF is excerpted from OIE (see http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/animal-diseases/rift-valley-fever/#G):

"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute viral disease that can cause severe disease in domestic animals (such as buffalo, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and humans. Disease in these species is characterized by fever, severe illness, abortions, and a high morbidity and mortality rate.

"The virus that causes RVF belongs to the genus _Phlebovirus_ in the family Bunyaviridae. Many of the related Bunyaviridae viruses can cause fever and encephalitis. Another commonly known Bunyaviridae virus is the hantavirus.

"Many different species of mosquitoes are vectors for the RVF virus, and RVF is most commonly encountered during years of unusually heavy rainfall and subsequent flourishing of mosquito populations. "Mosquitoes will feed on viraemic (virus circulating in the bloodstream) animals and then transmit the virus to other animals on which they subsequently feed. "Some species of mosquitoes (_Aedes_, for example) are capable of transmitting the virus from infected female mosquitoes to offspring via its eggs.

"This contributes to the survival of the virus in the environment. Mosquito eggs may survive during prolonged periods (up to several years) in dry conditions. During periods of high rainfall and/or flooding, the eggs hatch, and there is an increase in the infection of animals on which these mosquitoes feed.

"RVF is a zoonosis (a disease that primarily affects animals but causes disease in humans). Humans are highly susceptible to the RVF virus and may become infected by being bitten by infected mosquitoes; through contact with blood, other body fluids, or tissues during killing, skinning, and cutting of infected animals; or by consumption of raw milk or uncooked meat from infected animals. Humans working in slaughter facilities, laboratories, or hospitals are at risk of acquiring infections."
