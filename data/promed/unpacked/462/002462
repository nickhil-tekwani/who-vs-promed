The Lyme disease spirochete, _Borrelia burgdorferi_, has been isolated from
a blacklegged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_, removed from a songbird in Canada.
On 28 May 1999, this engorged blacklegged tick nymph was removed from a
common yellowthroat, _Geothlypis trichas_, collected during bird banding on
Bon Portage Island, Nova Scotia.
The Atlantic Bird Observatory participated in collecting attached ticks
from passerine birds banded on Seal Island and Bon Portage Island off the
southwest tip of Nova Scotia. During spring migration, 21 ticks were
collected from 12 individual birds (4 species) from 14 to 29 May 1999.
These immature (larva, nymph) ticks on birds included the rabbit tick,
_Haemaphysalis leporispalustris_, and _I. scapularis_.
As part of a monitoring program of ticks on birds in southern Canada, these
engorged ticks were forwarded for identification by courier to the British
Columbia Center for Disease Control Society (BCCDCS) for spirochetal
analysis. At the BCCDCS, the tick identifications were confirmed and the
ticks were surface sterilized using 10% hydrogen peroxide followed by 70%
isopropyl alcohol, and transferred to sterile tissue to remove excess water.
Dead ticks underwent DNA analysis directly using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) testing. For live ticks, the midgut contents were cultured and
checked weekly by dark-field microscopy. Within 10 days, characteristic
motile spirochetes were observed in one culture.
The isolate was immunostained with monoclonal antibodies of _B.
burgdorferi_, and found to be reactive. Using PCR, DNA amplification was
conducted on the isolate and confirmed positive for _B. burgdorferi_. This
is the first isolation of _B. burgdorferi_ from a blacklegged tick removed
from a migratory bird in Canada.
In fact, it is the first isolation of _B. burgdorferi_ in Nova Scotia. On
route to Nova Scotia, tropical-wintering species of birds, (i.e. Swainson's
thrush, northern waterthrush, and common yellowthroat) fly through the New
England states which are endemic for _Ixodes scapularis_ and Lyme disease.
Interestingly, song sparrows, which overwinter in Nova Scotia, were only
infested with rabbit ticks which are indigenous to the area(1).
The first record of an _I. scapularis_ (reported as _I. dammini_) removed
from a bird in Canada was a nymph collected from a road-killed common
yellowthroat at Windsor, Nova Scotia, in late May 1990(2). Since then,
researchers reported immature blacklegged ticks on an American robin and
chipping sparrow at Thunder Cape on Sibley Peninsula, Ontario, in the late
spring of 1995(3). Of epidemiologic significance, the common yellowthroat
acts as a competent reservoir for _B. burgdorferi(4)_ .
Even though random occurrence of blacklegged ticks have been previously
reported in Nova Scotia, no known population has been identified. The
present evidence clearly points out that spring migratory birds are
involved in bringing _B. burgdorferi_- infected _I. scapularis_ ticks long
distances into Canada.

Editorial Comment:
This report further extends observations of the blacklegged tick in areas
of Canada not currently known to be endemic. To date, the blacklegged tick
has been shown to be endemic at Long Point and Point Pelee on Lake Erie in
southern Ontario. However, the blacklegged tick has been documented in
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quebec,
mainland Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan; isolates of _Borrelia
burgdorferi_ have been made from ticks collected in several of these
provinces (Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quebec, mainland Ontario,
Manitoba, and now Nova Scotia).
Also, _B. burgdorferi_ has been isolated from _I. pacificus_ and _I.
angustus_, from different locations in British Columbia. In Alberta, _B.
burgdorferi_ has been isolated from _Haemophysalis leporispalustris_. These
observations serve as an important reminder to the public in general, and
physicians in particular, that Lyme disease can be contracted in Canada in
areas not currently known to be endemic for this major tick vector.
