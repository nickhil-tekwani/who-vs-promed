The owners of an elite dairy herd could be forced out of the milk sector after losing 60% of their cows in just 16 months.

The Williams family, who run the multi-award-winning Willhome herd of Ayrshires, Holsteins and Brown Swiss in Pembrokeshire, are distraught after their latest TB test resulted in the slaughter of 17 animals, bringing to 138 the cows removed from the herd since April 2019.

Among the latest casualties was [the dairy cow] "Willhome Challenger Amanda EX94," who produced her 5th calf just 10 days before she was slaughtered on 7 Aug 2020. Her accolades included being placed in the top 3 at the All Britain Calf Show and at the National Ayrshire Show. She was destroyed because it was the 3rd time a test had flagged her up as an inconclusive reactor (IR); she had, however, tested clear on a gamma blood test after the 2nd IR reading.

[SW], who farms with his parents, [PW and SW], and his wife, [VW], questioned the value of gamma testing. The family, he said, had pleaded for her to be spared. "We tried to make the case that she had tested clear on gamma and should therefore have been treated as a 1st-time IR on that 3rd test, but the ministry wouldn't accept that. What is the point of that blood test?"

Until April 2019, the Willhome herd had never had a breakdown in the 2 generations that the Williamses have farmed at Home Farm, Leweston, near Haverford-west. The 16-month breakdown has nearly destroyed their business, reducing their milk income by 52%.

It has been a massive mental strain, and a physical one too, as they currently have to run 3 separate herds. They had been given permission to buy 40 cows, but these must be kept separate from the main herd, as do the group of IRs.

The next test in 60 days' time could break the business, as it will fall under the Welsh government's Enhanced Measures policy. In Wales, tests on herds that are 18 months into a disease breakdown are carried out under severe interpretation and all IRs are removed for slaughter.

With cow numbers down to 130, he said further losses would make the business unviable. "Our milk cheque has dropped by 52%, and we can't sustain the business on that, let alone with more losses."

[Mr. W] said bovine TB was casting a shadow over the whole family, especially his father, who is past president of the Ayrshire Cattle Society. "Dad is taking it very badly because the herd is his lifetime's work. Any cows that we are given permission to buy back in are never going to be our cows.

"Today was the hardest day because of the loss of one of our best cows. But we have also had days when we have had to watch heavily pregnant cows being shot on the yard, watching their calves kicking for several minutes later.

"I wouldn't wish that on anyone."

In a statement, the Welsh government said its priority was to find and remove infected cattle from herds before they had the chance to infect others. Recent testing had provided additional options for testing higher-risk animals and had allowed the government to review its earlier policy of slaughtering all IRs in persistent TB breakdowns, it said.

That review has resulted in a revised policy of continuing to slaughter all standard IRs, but to conduct antibody and gamma tests on severe IRs. Therefore, from February 2020, cattle testing inconclusive at the standard skin test interpretation continue to be removed, along with any test-positive animals, while cattle testing inconclusive at the severe test interpretation only -- but which would pass if the herd test had been read at standard -- are antibody and gamma interferon tested.

Cattle are only permitted to be retained in the herd, in isolation and pending follow-up skin testing, if they test negative to both blood tests.

The revised policy uses an antibody test approved by Welsh ministers, alongside the gamma interferon test, to increase the chance of detecting infected animals, while at the same time reducing the risk of removing cattle which may not be infected.

A government spokesperson said: "Data gathered from tests between 2010 and 2015 showed that a high number of standard and severe IRs went on to become reactors at further testing, and are at higher risk of becoming TB reactors -- 40% of animals with consecutive negative IR results on the gamma test went on to become reactors in the most persistent herds."

[The gamma interferon assay is a laboratory-based blood test increasingly being used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle and for other animals (e.g., goat, buffalo). The test is based on measuring the levels of a cytokine (an immunological hormone or messenger protein) called interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma is released by the white blood cells of cattle infected with TB when stimulated with bovine and avian tuberculins (the same as used in the tuberculin skin test). A description of the test is available in article 31 of the bovine tuberculosis chapter 3.4.6 of OIE's Terrestrial Manual, at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.06_BOVINE_TB.pdf (version adopted in May 2019).

DEFRA's policy paper "Bovine TB strategy review: summary and conclusions," updated 5 Mar 2020, is available at https://bit.ly/3fVewEa. From its chapter "Surveillance and diagnostics," the following segment addresses some of the issues raised by the cattle-breeding family interviewed in the above media report:

"Policy makers need to balance the disadvantages of low specificity (more cattle sent to slaughter and herds placed under provisional restrictions) and low sensitivity (infections going unrecognised). We see a strong argument for moving to a more sensitive test (probably the SICT = single intradermal cervical test) for surveillance in the high-risk area (HRA) and edge area (EA) to enable the detection of infections in these regions as early as possible. In the low-risk area (LRA), the numbers of new infections detected would not justify the increased number of false positives. Such a change would be allowed given current EU rules. Once outside the EU, there would be scope to use either the SICT or caudal fold test (CFT) for herd screening and to retest reactor animals with the interferon-gamma test to reduce the number of false positives detected by the more sensitive screening test.

"Were this change to be made, the number of herd breakdowns would in the short term go up as more infections are revealed. It is very important that policy makers and all stakeholders understand this epidemiological reality and do not misinterpret it as a policy failure.

"Once infection is discovered in a herd, it is important to identify all cattle infected with the bacterium. There are a number of circumstances where there is particular premium on removing infections from herds as quickly as possible. These include herds with persistent and recurrent infections, herds in badger cull areas where it is important to avoid re-infecting wildlife, herds in the EA where preventing geographical spread into the LRA is a high priority, and emerging hotspots of infection within the LRA. Here, combining a skin test, the interferon-gamma test and the IDEXX ELISA serological test should be considered, as each test detects some infected animals that the other tests miss. The costs of testing would increase, but the epidemiological benefits in these critical cases would be substantial."

Various modelling and analytic methods have concluded that badgers or environmental sources contribute to a large proportion of herd breakdowns. Hence, culling and vaccination of badgers are potentially important tools for effective bovine tuberculosis control.
