France reports the highest rate of leptospirosis in Europe. In the
following graph, I have compared reported rates per 100 000 in France
with those of contiguous countries [1,2]
http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Lepto-France.png.

Most cases occur in the river basins of the south west coast, notably
Franche-Comte, Champagne-Ardennes, and Poitou-Charentes. During 1996
to 2005, disease rates in Ardennes varied from 1.7 to 7.9 per 100 000,
which is approximately 10 times the national rate. 48 per cent of
cases are reported during July through September.

The principal reservoirs in this country are rats, pigs, cattle,
mice, buffalo, horses, and coypu (_Myocastor coypus_).

Prevalence surveys:
-------------------
29.7 per cent of cattle, 51 per cent of pigs, 78.6 per cent of
horses, 10 per cent to 20 per cent of wild rodents (1997)
44 per cent of rodents (2008 publication)
1.3 per cent of bacterial species causing uveitis (2001 to 2007)
23 per cent of European mink (_Mustela lutreola_), 22 per cent of
polecats (_Mustela putorius_), and 15 per cent of free-ranging
American mink (_Mustela vison_) in south western France (1990 to
2007)

Infecting species:
------------------
The principal species are _Leptospira_ serovars _L.
icterohaemorrhagiae_ (30 per cent of cases), _L. australis_, _L.
grippotyphosa_ (23 per cent of cases), _L. sejroe_, _L. ballum_, _L.
hebdomadis_, _L. canicola_, _L. bataviae_ and _L. pomona_. Rare
instances of infection by _Leptospira broomii_ have been reported.

[ProMED-mail once again thanks Dr Berger for his background reports.
The coypu or nutria (_Myocastor coypus_) are large, herbivorous,
semiaquatic rodents. Originally native to subtropical and temperate
South America, coypu have since been introduced to North America,
Europe, Asia, and Africa, primarily by fur ranchers
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coypu). For a picture of coypu, see
