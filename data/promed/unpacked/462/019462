Actually, during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia in 1997, wasn't it
myocarditis rather than encephalitis that was the life-threatening
condition? I remember there were many discussion about it.

[Since the major outbreaks in Sarawak, Malaysia (1997) and Taiwan (1998),
there have been intensive studies about HFMD. Many questions have been
addressed and clarified and the viral causative agents identified. In the
Sarawak outbreak, at least 34 children died. All the children who died from
EV71 also carried another virus called adenovirus, which is difficult to
detect because it is very slow-growing. It has been suggested that this
virus infects the heart and, when it is present with EV71, the viruses
interact to bring the rapid onset of fatal complications. Fatalities arise
from extensive destruction of centers in the brain stem -- the lower-most
section of the brain, near the spinal cord -- that regulate breathing. Some
authorities think the virus also causes acute inflammation of the heart
muscles, which can result in death. This remains speculative. Please see
also: "Continued speculation on the identity of the aetiological agent " in
Hand, foot & mouth disease - Singapore (06) 20001005.1715.
In the Taiwan outbreak (1998), of about 100 000 cases reported, 90 percent
recovered without any complications. But a total of 78 children died from
pulmonary edema, excessive fluid in the lungs, or a type of internal
drowning. This just means that the clinical presentations may vary between
different geographic settings. But some fatal symptoms may present as
aseptic or viral meningitis or encephalitis.
In the current (seasonal) epidemic of HFMD, EV 71 was identified as the
prime etiology. I have discussed the matter with an experienced
pediatrician who has worked locally with HFMD for a number of years. I was
assured that there were no myocardial symptoms diagnosed in the current
outbreak and that the cases presented with either meningitis and/or
encephalitis. - Mod.RY]
