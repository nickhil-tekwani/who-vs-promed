Viet Nam: 6-year-old Boy is 2nd Avian Influenza Death Reported this Week
---------------------------------------------------
A 6-year-old boy has become the 2nd reported victim this week of avian
influenza in Viet Nam -- sparking fears of a new outbreak. Health
authorities in the country have warned consumers to be careful when buying
chicken, after tests showed that the boy had died of [avian influenza virus
infection]. The youngster died on 30 Dec 2004 after being admitted with a
high fever and serious lung infection. Tests in Ho Chi Minh City on a
specimen taken from the boy's throat were positive for avian influenza virus.

Viet Nam: Avian Influenza Situation Update
------------------------------------------
As of 6 Jan 2005, WHO has received reports of laboratory tests conducted in
Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, indicating 2 new human cases of infection with
avian influenza. Both patients have died. Initial tests have identified the
H5 subtype of avian influenza virus. Further testing is under way.
The 1st patient was a 6-year-old boy from the southern province of Dong
Thap. He died on 30 Dec 2004. The second patient was a 9-year-old boy from
Tra Vinh Province, also located in the southern part of the country. He was
hospitalized on 2 Jan and died on 4 Jan 2005.
An additional recent case in Viet Nam, reported in late December 2004,
remains hospitalized in critical condition. All 3 of these most recent
cases have occurred in the southern part of the country, where poultry
outbreaks have been recurring since December 2004.
Close contacts of these cases are being monitored for any signs of illness.
Health authorities in Viet Nam, supported by WHO staff, have undertaken
several measures to strengthen case detection. Avian influenza viruses
become more active when temperatures turn cooler. Activities associated
with the approach of the Lunar New Year festivities in early February 2005
may also increase the risk of further human cases.

[On the suspicion that the suspected fatal case (the 9-year-old boy)
described in Avian influenza, human - Viet Nam (13): susp. 20050105.0020 is
accepted as a confirmed case by WHO), the death of this 6-year-old boy
brings the number of confirmed avian influenza virus cases in Viet Nam to
31 (or 30 according to WHO figures), and the number of fatalities to
22. The cases remain sporadic and so far there is no indication of
efficient person-to-person transmission of avian influenza virus in the
human population in either Viet Nam or Thailand. - Mod.CP]
