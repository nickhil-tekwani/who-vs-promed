Small children are among more than 100 West Australians who have
fallen ill with salmonella poisoning after eating sprouts sold in
supermarkets.
Contaminated alfalfa sprouts, mung beans, bean shoots and other
sprout products have been sold in Action, Coles and Woolworths
supermarkets since Nov 2005, resulting in 110 reported cases of food
poisoning.
A Health Department investigation led to the sprout products being
pulled from supermarket shelves on Fri, 17 Feb 2006. The department
believes animal waste is a likely reason for salmonella in the
sprouts, which were germinated in South Australia.
West Australian Health Department communicable disease control
director Paul Van Buynder urged people to discard any Parilla Fresh
sprouts products. He said it was rare for the particular strain of
salmonella to result in death and said no one had been admitted to
hospital after eating the sprouts.

[Other than the statement that small children were involved, no other
demographics of the outbreak were given nor whether one or more
serotypes of salmonellosis were involved. As shown below, enteric
infections, particularly salmonellosis, are not uncommonly linked to
a variety of sprouts. A map of Australia can be found at the
