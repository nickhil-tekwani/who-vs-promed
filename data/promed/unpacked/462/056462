Viral Gastroenteritis Associated with Eating Oysters  Louisiana, December,
1996  January, 1997
Viral gastroenteritis outbreaks caused by caliciviruses (i.e. Norwalk-like
viruses or small round-structured viruses) have been associated with eating
contaminated shell-fish, particularly oysters (_Crassostrea virginica_).
This report describes the findings of the investigation of an outbreak of
oyster-associated viral gastroenteritis in Louisiana during the 1996-97
winter season and implicates sewage from oyster harvesting vessels as the
probable cause of contaminated oysters.
MMWR Editorial Note: Caliciviruses are small single-stranded RNA viruses
that cause acute gastroenteritis characterized by vomiting and/or diarrhea.
The viruses are difficult to detect, requiring relatively sophisticated
molecular methods to identify the virus in fecal specimens and in oysters.
There is no reliable marker for indicating presence of the virus in oyster
harvesting waters.
This report represents the third oyster-related gastroenteritis outbreak
attributed to calicivirus in Louisiana since 1993...In this outbreak, the
link to the large number of wholesalers and retailers suggests that the
oyster contamination preceded distribution and probably occurred in the
oyster beds. In addition, harvest sites were 12-15 miles from the nearest
community sewage outlet, recreational boating was infrequent in December,
commercial boating traffic was infrequent because of the shallow depth of
the water, and all oil rigs were considered to have had adequate sewage
facilities. The only known source of caliciviruses, such as that implicated
in this outbreak, is feces from ill persons. Therefore, based on these
considerations, the probable source of human sewage found in the implicated
waterways was oyster harvesters, who admitted to routinely discharging
their sewage overboard, despite recent recommendations in Louisiana for
proper sewage collection and disposal. Prevention of oyster-related
outbreaks of gastroenteritis requires intensified efforts to 1) develop and
enforce laws for appropriate sewage containers on oyster harvesting boats
with dump-pump out stations at docks, 2) educate workers in the oyster
industry about the consequences of improper sewage disposal, 3) improve
record-keeping by oyster harvesters, wholesalers, and retailers to enhance
the reliability of traceback investigations, and 4) further assess the
relation between environmental conditions and contamination of oysters.
