[It is not clear which species of _Schistosoma_ is found in Myanmar. _S. mekongi_ has been reported from Shan state, Myanmar (Ohmae H, Sinuon M, Kirinoki M, et al. _Schistosomiasis mekongi_: from discovery to control. Parasitol Int. 2004; 53(2): 135-42); https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15081945.

_S. japonicum_ is also a possibility and further studies are needed to identify the species, which is important to develop proper control programs. - Mod.EP
