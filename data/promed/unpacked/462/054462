Ministry of Agriculture considers purchase of bluetongue vaccine type 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (NLV) is
considering the purchase of vaccine against bluetongue serotype 1
[BTV-1]. This serotype, which has been spreading northwards from
Spain and France, is a different variant of bluetongue than serotype
8, against which the Dutch livestock has been vaccinated.

"Preventive vaccination against BTV-1 is currently not allowed.
According to the European legislation, vaccination is allowed only
after a confirmed outbreak of the disease [in the relevant country];
only then, vaccination may be performed within the 150-km (93.2 mi)
zone around the outbreak," said a spokesman for the Ministry. This
regulation is currently being debated.

In France, there is already a zone where both serotypes 1 and 8 are present.

Bluetongue case in Hungary
T Biro, National Disease Control Centre, Hungary
------------------------------------------------
1. The facts
- On 5 Sep 2008, PCR [polymerase chain reaction] positivity was
proven for BT [bluetongue] in 4 bovine animals.
- The location: LAT North 47 50' 04'', LON East 20 48' 11''.
- Animals were killed and destroyed.
- ADNS [animal disease notification system] notification on 8 Sep 2008.
- OIE [World Organisation for Animal Health] notification on 9 Sep 2008.

2. The details
- On 4 Jul 2008, 142 cattle imported from France.
- The officially issued test results showed all of them were
serologically negative.
- During [post import] isolation [in the receiving holding, Hungary],
the animals were tested serologically: 47 found seropositive, 1 found
viropositive.
- 17 cattle were PCR-positive out of the 47 seropositive animals.

Because of the viropositivity, all animals in the affected holding were tested.
- 4 cattle were seropositive for bluetongue disease out of the 281
tested animals.
- Further laboratory tests showed all 4 animals were PCR positive.
- These animals are recognised as the 1st Hungarian bluetongue case.

3. The measures
- Immediate movement restriction in the affected holdings after seropositivity.
- Viropositive animals were killed and destroyed.
- Seropositive, but vironegative animals were slaughtered.
- After the 1st BT case, the National Disease Control Centre was set up.
- The protective and surveillance zones were officially declared.
- Chemical air extermination of the insects by airplane.
- Serological, virological, and entomological examinations have been
carried out in the 20 km (12.4 mi) zone (still in progress).
- The most recent data show:
a. the captured _Culicoides_ mostly belong to the _nubeculosus_ complex;
b. _C. pulicaris_ complex also available;
c. no additional positive animals found.

on the Food Chain and Animal Health) meeting, Brussels, 16 Sep 2008

Extension into the Romanian territory of the surveillance zone
demarcated around a bluetongue outbreak in Hungary -- Measures to applied
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The facts
On 10 Sep 2008, the Central Veterinary Authorities of Hungary
informed the National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority
(NSVFSA) in Bucharest about the existence of a bluetongue outbreak on
the Hungarian territory located in Forraytania and that the
surveillance zone demarcated around the outbreak involves a part of Romania.

On the same day, the European Commission (Animal Health and Welfare
Directorate) sent to NSVFSA official information by fax regarding the
same matter.

2. Current situation
The surveillance area involves:
- 473 administrative units (villages),
- 18 assembly centers for export in [to?] 3rd countries, and
- 445 000 susceptible animals (domesticated and wild ruminants) as follows:
70 000 large ruminants, mainly cattle; 355 000 sheep; 16 000 goats;
4000 wild ruminants.

Romania is free of bluetongue; [this is based upon the following]:
- serological surveillance, enforced since the year 2000. Every year
the serum samples taken from a percentage of susceptible animals were
negative for bluetongue antibodies;
- entomological surveillance, performed since 2005. Competent vectors
belonging to _C. obsoletus_, _C. pulicaris_ complexes, and _C.
nubeculosus_ species were identified.

The vector-free period usually starts in December and lasts [until]
the end of March.

3. Current epidemiological status
The Romanian territory is free of bluetongue. 2008: during the period
1 Jan 2008 to 31 Aug 2008, 42 330 serum samples were tested for
bluetongue antibodies. They included 25 113 sera collected from
cattle, 15 710 sera collected from sheep, 1507 sera collected from
goats. All samples reacted negative for bluetongue antibodies.

768 vector catches were collected and examined; no other new vector
species were identified.

4. Actions to be applied in the surveillance zone
The legal basis:
Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 Nov 2000, laying down specific
provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue;
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 of 26 Oct 2007 on
implementing rules for Council Directive 2000/75/EC as regards the
control, monitoring, surveillance, and restrictions on movements of
certain animals of susceptible species in relation to bluetongue.

- Identification of all holding with ruminants and a census of all
susceptible domesticated ruminants will be performed this week [week
of 15 Sep 2008];
- identification of areas with wild ruminants and estimation of their number;
- periodical clinical survey of all susceptible animals performed by
veterinarians;
- permanent passive clinical survey performed by the owners or
keepers of the animals;
- serological monitoring on sentinel animals established in
epidemiological units of 20/20 km during the intense vectors activity
season (from May to October) and 40/40 km during the low vector
activity season (from November to April);
- [mandatory for] hunters associations or other similar state or
private bodies to notify all cases of wild ruminants found ill or
dead to the local veterinary services, in order to be transported to
the laboratory and investigated for bluetongue infections;
- virological investigations on samples taken from live or dead
animals, aborted fetuses or stillborns, presenting clinical signs or
lesions resembling bluetongue;
- entomological surveillance by weekly capturing of vectors to asses
the structure, size, and dynamics of vector populations, in order to
quantify the level of risk transmission of the bluetongue virus;
- all ruminants are allowed to exit the surveillance zone only under
the provisions of the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007;
- depending on further epidemiological developments, the measures
enforced at present will be improved or modified.

5. Miscellaneous
The facts
a. On 8 Sep 2008, 2 consignments of 4 rams were transported from a
restricted area in France to a holding in district Vaslui, Romania.
All animals were certified as being vaccinated against bluetongue
more than 60 days before the dispatch. Within the laboratory checking
at destination, among other tests, the serum samples were assessed by
ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] for bluetongue antibodies.
All samples reacted negative for the presence of antibodies against
the bluetongue virus.

b. On 10 Sep 2008, one consignment of 49 sheep was transported from a
restricted area in UK to a holding in district Bihor, Romania. All
animals were certified as being vaccinated against bluetongue less
than 60 days before dispatch. Therefore the sheep were also tested by
PCR and certified as negative for bluetongue viral antigen. Within
the laboratory checking at destination, among other tests, the serum
samples taken from 28 animals were assessed by ELISA for bluetongue
antibodies too. 18 (about 70 percent) of the samples reacted positive
and 8 (about 30 percent) of the samples showed negative results for
bluetongue antibodies.

Questions
This could happen because:
1. The vaccine
- the vaccine is not immunogenic?
- the vaccine dose was not of the required concentration?
- could [there be a problem with the] adjuvant?

2. The animals
- maybe there are significant differences in the animals' reactivity
to the vaccine in terms of animal species, breeds, age, local
environmental conditions, or health status in relation to other diseases.

3. The mode of vaccination
- probably one inoculation is not sufficient to achieve good
immunization in small ruminants too?
- maybe 2 shots will be necessary?
- the inoculation route or the inoculation site could be important as well.

4. The vaccination policy
- were those animals really vaccinated?
- how can the authorities be sure that the vaccine was inoculated
into the animals?

Answers
We can have the answers only after more research is performed.
What can we do?
Options:
- testing of all vaccinated animals by PCR before leaving the place
of origin, or
- testing by PCR of all new introduced vaccinated ruminants at destination, but
Who will pay for the tests?

[The description of Romania's measures to demonstrate its freedom of
BT infection and to maintain this freedom is interesting.

Article "5. Miscellaneous" addressing the case of imported sheep,
certified as vaccinated but found seronegative at destination, is of
concern. Replies to the raised questions, and possible relevant
decisions, are anticipated with interest.

We are grateful to Sabine Zentis for drawing our attention to the
publication, on 16 Sep 2008, of the presentations on EU's website.
The site includes also presentations on the updated bluetongue
situation in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Spain, and Sweden.

The Czech report is of particular interest, presenting the following,
hitherto unpublished data: the last outbreak was confirmed on 22 Aug
2008 in a 6-month-old bull without clinical symptoms. On 11 Sep 2008,
a new case was confirmed in the same herd, involving 13 ELISA
positive bovines of which 6 were RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction) positive.
