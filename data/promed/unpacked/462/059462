WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT E. COLI O157: H7
Washington State University began research into the on-farm ecology of _E.
coli_ O157 in 1990. We have completed a number of separate projects, some
on our own, but most in collaboration with other universities or with state
or federal agencies. On most farms ...
_E. coli_ O157:H7 (we'll call it "O157") exists, at least intermittently,
on a majority of cattle farms. It is distributed across the U.S. and in
other countries in both dairy and beef herds. Typically, O157 is detectable
in the feces of cattle at any point in time is less than 5 percent.
The agent has been detected at similar, or slightly higher, prevalence
among cattle being held at slaughter plants and on the external surface of
the hides of recently slaughtered animals. O157 also has been found in
feces from several species other than cattle, including deer, sheep, dogs,
horses, flies, and birds. A long-term reservoir species (if one exists) has
not been identified.
Colonization of cattle with O157 typically is of short duration -- one to
two months. O157 is not associated with any recognizable disease in cattle
but instead appears to behave as transient _E. coli_ "normal flora." A
minority of cattle can be colonized by low doses of O157 (<250 cfu), and
these animals amplify the infection and transmit O157 to other cattle.
Growing cattle (3 to 18 months of age) have a higher prevalence of O157
than either younger calves or adult cattle. This finding likely reflects
less stable _E. coli_ flora among younger animals.
O157 prevalence in a herd is not associated with manure application to
grazing land. Tentative links with other practices have been observed but
have not yet been tested in targeted studies.
The typical pattern of O157 shedding in a herd followed over time is one of
epidemic shedding interspersed with longer periods of rare or no shedding.
These epidemics occur mainly during warm weather, suggesting that
environmental proliferation may play an important role in the epidemiology
of this agent.
O157 can multiply prolifically in cattle feeds when moisture is added,
which commonly occurs in total mixed rations. O157 also has been found in
water troughs on numerous farms. It persists at least four months in water
trough sediments and can even multiply in this environment, suggesting that
water troughs could be a long-term reservoir, maintaining O157 in herds
during periods of low infection prevalence. (See January 10, 1998 issue,
page 17.)
Considerable strain diversity among O157 isolates can be detected between,
and even within, some herds. Specific strains of O157 can persist on
particular farms for at least two years.
Regional transmission of O157 appears to occur, since indistinguishable
strains have been found in herds more than 300 miles apart. Isolates from
non-bovine species are closely related or identical to bovine isolates.
Watching waterers ...
Our current work is focused on water troughs, in which _E. coli_ O157 can
survive for long periods and multiply, and on feed, in which _E. coli_ O157
can potentially replicate to infectious doses during summer months. We are
attempting to identify the importance of the role played by water troughs
in _E. coli_ O157 ecology as well as a sanitation strategy that will
interrupt transmission from this source.
We are also beginning work on a project related to replication of _E. coli_
O157 in wet feeds. Pilot work appears to indicate that _E. coli_ in
general, and _E. coli_ O157 in particular, will not grow in total mixed
rations containing a silage naturally high in propionic acid. Experiments
have confirmed that adding sodium propionate to moistened mixed grain
rations will inhibit O157 growth. In contrast, in moistened mixes without
added propionate, it grows robustly.
Propionic acid is a natural product considered GRAS (generally regarded as
safe) by FDA. It is a common human food additive and is available at a
fairly cheap price for addition to animal feeds. For these reasons, we
propose to clarify the levels of propionic acid needed to inhibit growth
and then to test the impact of this practice on _E. coli_ O157 ecology on
farms.
