To the footnote on the Utah measles outbreak, we add that while
measles is re-emerging only in the USA, you should take into
consideration that measles is virtually eliminated from the Western
hemisphere. Therefore, the other countries in Latin America
and the Caribbean also qualify as areas in which the disease could
now re-emerge if an introduction of the virus should occur.
Don't you know that measles has virtually been interrupted in all of
the Americas, with exception of the USA?
it is now over four years since the last case in the English-
speaking Caribbean, over three years since the last case in Cuba and
Chile, and probably there is no transmission in other Latin
American countries.
All blood samples that test positive for the IgM
[immuno-globulin M
indirect test turn
out to be negative when we test with the IgM capture test, which is
our gold standard for measles diagnosis at this stage.
You may have read our article on measles elimination published by
JAMA in February of this year, in the issue dedicated to emerging
infections.
By the way, do you receive our newsletter that periodically reviews
the measles situation in the Americas?
Also, we have our weekly measles surveillance report in the PAHO
home page of the WWW [http://www.paho.org/.
