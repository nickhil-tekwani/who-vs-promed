The deadly bat disease known as white-nose syndrome is probably
present in Buncombe County, according to a new report from the N.C.
Wildlife Resources Commission. The news raises the number of affected
counties in western North Carolina to 4. Since its initial appearance
in a New York cave in 2006, the fungal disease has killed bats at a
startling rate. Biologists worry that mortality from the disease is so
high, we may be witnessing an extinction event.

A dead bat, found outside a Buncombe County residence, was submitted
for lab testing after agency biologists suspected it had the disease.
Tests results indicate that the bat was positive for _Geomyces
destructans_, the fungal organism associated with the syndrome.

Wildlife biologist Gabrielle Graeter tells Xpress that the fungus
could not be cultured in the lab, and there was no evidence of
infection based on a microscopic evaluation. "Confirmed positive bats
are those that fulfill the histopathologic criteria for the disease.
There has to be evidence of a specific pattern of fungal colonization
of the epidermis [skin]," Graeter said. "Thus, this bat is given the
'suspect' designation."
