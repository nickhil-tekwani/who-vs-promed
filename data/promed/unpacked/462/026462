A 52-year-old man hailing from Karimnagar district was diagnosed as
suffering from the relatively lesser known hantavirus [infection] at a
private hospital in the city.

Terming this as the 1st case of hantavirus in the state at a press
conference on Friday [28 Oct 2011], specialists at Yashoda hospital
said that the patient, a man who works in the postal department in
Karimnagar, was admitted to the hospital on 15 Oct [2011] with a
history of fever and dry cough associated with mild shortness of
breath. A day after he was admitted, his condition deteriorated and he
suffered a sudden cardiac arrest. He was revived and put on ventilator
support and showed signs of improvement gradually.

Meanwhile, the man developed a state of unresponsiveness as he lost
eye contact. While several tests for other viral infections came out
as negative, Dr M V Rao, general physician said that all the features
were connecting to [a] hantavirus [infection] and based on suspicion,
his samples were sent to a lab at Mumbai for confirmation. The tests
confirmed that Rao was suffering from the life threatening disease
that is carried by rodents, especially deer mice. [This is not
correct. Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, occur in North America
and are not found in India. - Mod.TY]

According to Dr M V Rao, general physician, it is caused due to [virus
is transmitted by] rodent urine and droppings. "Although it is a
non-transferable disease but the complications may also lead to
kidney, lung or heart failure," said Dr M V Rao, senior general
physician, Yashoda hospital, Somajiguda adding that there is no
effective treatment for hantavirus infection involving the lungs.

The early symptoms of hantavirus disease include chills, fever and
body ache. If treatment is delayed, within one or 2 days the patient
may also develop breathing problems. "To avoid the disease, people
have to avoid rodent dens, drink disinfected water and clear out
potential nesting sites in their surroundings," Rao added.

[This is the 3rd case of a hantavirus infection in Andhra Pradesh
state this month (October 2011). The specific hantavirus involved in
this case is not stated and it would be of interest to know which
tests were used to establish the diagnosis of hantavirus infection.

Previously, Dr J. Clement and colleagues of the National Reference
Laboratory for Hantavirus Infections, University Hospital
Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium, found evidence in India of the murine
Seoul virus (SEOV) infection, and also of the arvicoline Puumala virus
(PUUV) infection, the latter in 2 fatal cases (from the Cochin,
respectively Chennai region) with acute respiratory syndrome --
symptoms similar to those in the recently described Nellore cases (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20111026.3187) as well as in the case
described above. Puumala virus occurs in Europe and Russia and the
rodent host is the bank vole, _Myodes glareolus_, which does not occur
in India.

It would be of interest to conduct a field study in the area where
these cases have occurred to determine which animals are reservoir
hosts of the virus accompanied by virus isolations to determine the
similarity of these viruses to Seoul and Puumala viruses.
