Mexico: West Nile virus emergency declared
------------------------------------------
Mexico on Mon 14 Jul 2003 declared a state of emergency against the
mosquitoborne West Nile virus, declaring it a severe risk to its horse
population and a growing threat to people. West Nile virus was discovered
in Mexico on 16 May 2003 in a dead crow in Tabasco state, prompting the
government to launch a campaign to vaccinate the state's equine population.
But Mexico's animal health authority said in the government's official
gazette on Mon 14 Jul 2003 that the disease has since spread to horses in
the states of Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Veracruz, Tabasco, Quintana
Roo, and Yucatan. The United States has been fighting the virus for 5
years. The virus infected more than 4000 people in 44 US states and killed
284 people last year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. No human deaths from West Nile have been reported in Mexico,
which shares a 2000 mile border with the US.
On Monday, the government warned that Mexico provides an ideal breeding
ground for the disease because it is home to a large number of wild birds.
Mosquitoes that bite infected birds and then bite people transmit West Nile
virus, which can cause fatal inflammation of the brain in humans. "The
natural cycle of the disease occurs between wild birds and mosquitoes (that
feed on birds). As the number of birds rises, however, other types of
mosquitoes can become infected and can be responsible for eventual
transmission to humans or horses," the official gazette said.
Among actions to combat West Nile virus infection, Mexican sanitary
authorities have asked horse owners to vaccinate their animals and to
report any suspected cases of West Nile virus infection immediately. The US
Agriculture Department has reported that about one third of the 15 000
horses infected with the virus in 2002 died.
