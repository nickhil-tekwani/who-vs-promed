This morning [4 May 2021] Hong Kong's CHP reported mainland China's 12th H9N2 infection of 2021, involving a 30 year old woman from Guangdong province with onset on 20 Apr 2021. Also, Cambodia reported a case -- also in April -- involving a 3 year old boy.

While most H9N2 infections are mild, their reported incidence has risen sharply in 2021. Whether this rise is more to do with better surveillance and reporting or is propelled by increased transmission of the virus to humans, is unknown.

The following update comes from the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO):

"Between 23 and 29 Apr 2021, there was one new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) reported from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to WHO in the Western Pacific Region. The case is a 30 year old female from Huizhou, Guangdong Province. The case had onset of mild symptoms on 20 Apr 2021.

"To date, 12 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported from China in 2021, and a total of 54 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region since December 2015."

Admittedly, the numbers we have -- as elevated as they may be of late -- are believed to be significant undercounts. Most people in China (or elsewhere) who get minor-to-moderate flu-like symptoms never bother to see a doctor or get tested.

Serological studies suggest human infection is far commoner than those numbers would have us believe (see report on high seroprevalence of avian influenza H9 among poultry professionals in Pakistan in J Infect Public Health: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2018.11.009).

We've covered the growing risks from the avian H9N2 virus numerous times over the years, not only as a standalone virus (see Viruses: characterization of the H9N2 avian influenza viruses currently circulating in South China https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2019/11/viruses-characterization-of-h9n2-avian.html) but also for its ability to reassort with other -- potentially more dangerous -- influenza subtypes (see Viruses: PA from recent H9N2 AIV enhances H5N1 infection in mammalian systems https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/09/viruses-pa-from-recent-h9n2-aiv.html).

In December 2019, in Emerging Infectious Diseases (Novel reassortant HPAI A(H5N2) Virus in broiler chickens, Egypt https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/1/19-0570_article), we saw a new proof of concept in the field, after an HPAI H5N8 virus reassorted with an LPAI H9N2 virus, and produced a new HPAI H5N2 virus in Egyptian poultry.

And a year ago the CDC added a 2nd lineage of the H9N2 virus to their IRAT (Influenza Risk Assessment Tool) short list of novel flu viruses with pandemic potential -- H9N2: avian influenza A(H9N2) Y280 lineage [A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018] virus:

"Low pathogenic avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry in many countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Since the late 1990s when the 1st human infections with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus were identified, detection of this virus has been reported infrequently in humans and in swine and other mammals. In 2018, there were 7 reported human infections, most with known exposure to poultry and with the majority involving viruses of the Y280 lineage.

"Summary: A risk assessment of avian influenza A(H9N2) Y280 lineage A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018 virus was conducted in July 2019. The overall IRAT risk assessment score for this virus falls into the moderate risk category. The summary average risk score for the virus to achieve sustained human-to-human transmission was 6.2. The average risk score for the virus to significantly impact public health if it were to achieve sustained human-to-human transmission was 5.9, also in the moderate range. For a full report, see https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/IR-001Rev0D-CDC-IRAT-Virus-Report_H9N2_2019.pdf."

While perhaps not the biggest pandemic threat we face -- very much like the sporadic jumping of swine-variant viruses to humans (see Canada: Manitoba Public Health reports 2 unrelated novel swine variant infections [H1N1v & H1N2v] https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2021/04/canada-manitoba-public-health-reports-2.html) -- we need to take the species jumping of novel viruses seriously, as even a mild influenza pandemic (on top of COVID) right now would present considerable difficulties.

[It's worth mentioning that influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.

Avian H9N2 influenza A virus has caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. An H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5 year old child in Hong Kong in 2003. The human H9N2 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/2108/03, is of purely avian origin and is closely related to some viruses circulating in poultry in the markets of Hong Kong. The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission. Since the mid-1990s, 2 lineages of H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established in domestic poultry in southern China (a 3rd lineage described in above report), Duck/HK/Y280/97 (Y280-like) and Quail/HK/G1/97 (G1-like) viruses, which are predominantly found in chickens and quail, respectively. These viruses have been sporadically introduced into humans and cause a flu-like illness. In the meantime, H9N2 influenza Y280-like viruses were also isolated from domestic pigs in Hong Kong in 1998. These findings indicate that the interspecies transmission of H9N2 influenza virus from avian to mammalian hosts continues to occur and poses a persistent threat for humans.

Furthermore, the number of human infections with A/H9N2 avian influenza viruses has been higher in 2021 (13 cases including the new case from China in the above report -- and it has been only 4 months so far) compared with earlier years, which is a cause for concern and highlights the need for continuous monitoring and risk assessments of these viruses with pandemic potential. - Mod.UBA
