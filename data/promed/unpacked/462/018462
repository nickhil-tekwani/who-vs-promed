Lumpy [skin disease] virus is spreading across the country in Himachal Pradesh. The disease caused an uproar throughout the country in Shimla.

After creating panic in other states including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana, now its infection has spread in Himachal too. Dozens of cows died in Anandpur, Bada villages, and Panthaghati areas adjacent to the state capital Shimla. Many animals were infected, and more than 50 animals died.

Neeru Shabnam, deputy director of Animal Husbandry Department in Nahan, said that Naina Tikkar, Narag and Nahan block under Rajgarh in Sirmaur and Calamba Sainwala and Shambhuwala under Nahan block have been infected.

[Since the start of the event in India, late 2019, 9 states have become published as infected with lumpy skin disease [LSD]: Odisha, Kerala, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and, most recently, Punjab. Himachal Pradesh, the northernmost state of India, has become India's 10th state publicly known to be LSD-infected. It is situated in the Western Himalayas, sharing borders with the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to the north, the (similarly LSD-infected) state of Punjab to the west, Haryana to the southwest, Uttarakhand to the southeast, and a very narrow border with Uttar Pradesh to the south. The state also shares an international border to the east with the Tibet Autonomous Region in China. The LSD capripox virus may have already been circulating in other northern states, and probably elsewhere in India. - Mod.AS

The Punjab government has procured over 66 000 doses of goat pox vaccine [see comment] from Hyderabad to check the spread of lumpy skin disease among cattle in the state.

These vaccine doses will be administered free of cost to the healthy livestock, said Punjab Animal Husbandry, Fisheries and Dairy Development Minister Laljit Singh Bhullar on Sunday [7 Aug 2022].

Lumpy skin disease infects cows and buffaloes mainly through vectors like blood-feeding insects. It leads to the formation of nodules on the animal's skin or hide that look like lumps, fever, runny nose, reduced milk yield, and difficulty in eating.

Till Saturday [6 Aug 2022], over 400 cattle have died due to lumpy skin disease in a month, and around 20 000, mostly cows, have been infected in Punjab.

Barnala, Bathinda Faridkot, Jalandhar, Moga, and Muktsar were among the worst-affected districts of the state.

Mr. Bhullar, who visited some dairy farms in the Khemkaran constituency on Sunday [7 Aug 2022], said the goat pox vaccine, which was specially ordered from Hyderabad, has been sent to all the districts of the state, and the doctors have started administering the doses.

He said the Bhagwant Singh Mann-led government in Punjab was taking all necessary steps to prevent the spread of the disease.

The animal husbandry minister said officials of his department are constantly in touch with the authorities to ensure there is no shortage of vaccine doses.

Indian rupee 76 lakh [INR 7.6 million / USD 95 500] has been disbursed to all districts, and veterinary officers have also been deputed to help the field staff, Mr. Bhullar said. He urged farmers to bury the carcass and not throw it in the open. The minister also asked them not to buy cattle from other states for the time being to prevent the spread of the disease.

[Following the introduction and spread of lumpy skin disease in South, East, and Southeast Asia, FAO's Animal Production and Health, Rome, published in November 2020 LSD paper No. 183 'Qualitative risk assessment and management' (see ProMED post 20201112.7937140). The 65-page document is available at http://www.fao.org/3/cb1892en/cb1892en.pdf.

Annex 3 (page 49) presents the table "Producers of lumpy skin disease vaccines," which includes the following sections:
1. Attenuated LSDV vaccines: LSDV Neethling strain (6 producers)
2. Attenuated SPPV vaccine: sheeppox virus strain RM-65 (1 producer)
3. Attenuated GTPV vaccine: goatpox virus strain Gorgan (1 producer)
4. Potential attenuated GTPV vaccine: goatpox virus, live, Uttarkashi strain (1 producer). The following footnote relates to the latter: "*goatpox virus Uttarkashi strain (vaccine needs to be validated to confirm it provides the same protection against LSD as the LSDV vaccines."

The paper's chapter "Vaccination" (pages 29-31) includes the following comment about the goatpox virus (No. 4 above):

"In India, the GTPV Uttarkashi strain is being evaluated for level of protection against LSD as compared to the LSDV vaccine and is already used for emergency vaccination. In Bangladesh, GTPV vaccine was used in Chattogram and found to be effective against LSD."

"With successful testing, validation, and approval, the GTPV Uttarkashi strain vaccine could be a more affordable option that is more quickly available and useful for large-scale immunization programmes."

Likely, this is the goatpox vaccine, procured by the Punjab government. Information on its validation results and licensing will be appreciated.

Subscribers are encouraged to visit the paper. - Mod.AS]
