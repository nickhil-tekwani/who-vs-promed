Bird flu was mutating at B.C. hatchery
------------------------
New tests have revealed that a rural B.C. chicken farm was [virtually] a
virus soup infected with mutating strains of avian flu, the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency said today.
The agency said the tests found both mild and severe strains of the H7
virus. Originally, the agency thought it was dealing only with the weaker form.
"It is unusual -- not unheard of -- but it's a rare event to have both
viruses on the same premises," said Dr. Ken Stepushyn, a veterinarian with
the agency.
Tests show the virus was in the process of changing from a low to high
pathogenic form in a second barn at the Loewen Acres hatchery in
Abbotsford, B.C.
Pathogenicity refers to the intensity of the virus and its ability to jump
to humans.
"It means it's a nasty virus on birds, it does kill birds at a higher rate,
so it's more deadly for the birds," Stepushyn said.
The agency stressed the risk to human health remains low and said this is
not the same form of the virus that is killing people in Asia.
The agency said the farm followed strict international guidelines to stamp
out high pathogenic outbreaks. It was quickly quarantined; some 16 000
birds on the property were slaughtered and an extensive disinfection
process is underway.
"Our original response was quite timely. Putting the flock down was the
right thing to do at the time," Stepushyn said.
Area poultry businesses did their part to stop the bird flu from spreading,
making a pact to stay out of a hot-zone around Loewen Acres.
However, the plan might not have been successful. During February 2004, a
second farm was quarantined where some birds seemed to be suffering a low
level of illness.
After initial tests were done at a provincial lab, the samples were sent to
the CFIA headquarters to determine whether avian flu is the culprit.
Results are expected within the next day or so. Meanwhile, the CFIA has set
up an active surveillance program on the property.
The agency said it is continuing to check poultry farms in the area for
signs of the virus, which was likely spread by wild ducks. During February
2004, some 16 000 chickens were put to death at Loewen Acres.
5 workers fell ill with mild flu and conjunctivitis, but tests showed avian
flu was not to blame in 3 of those cases.
The outbreak -- only the third case in recent history -- was found by a
farmer who became alarmed when his birds began dying. That prompted
several countries, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, restricted
imports of Canadian poultry.
Canada only exports about 7 percent of the chicken it produces, and
agriculture economists are confident that if consumption were to dip it
would only be a temporary hiccup.
Chicken farms in Delaware and Texas were also infected with avian flu
during February 2004.

[Although this report says that Avian Influenza was not to blame in 3 of 5
cases of ill workers, it does not tell us anything about the other 2
workers. Perhaps the cases are inconclusive, or perhaps we are left to
conclude that there is a human health consequence to this mutating strain
of Avian influenza. If there is definitive information available on the
human health issues, ProMED-mail would appreciate that information. ­ Mod.TG]
