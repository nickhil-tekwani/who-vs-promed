South Korea has confirmed that a few people were infected with avian influenza
in late 2003 and early 2004, a health ministry official said on Friday [24 Feb
2006]. Nearly 400 South Korean poultry farms were affected by bird flu between
December 2003 and March 2004, but no human cases were reported at that time.
That outbreak marked bird flu's re-emergence and was followed by cases around
the world involving the deadly H5N1 strain, most recently in Hungary, Croatia
and Cambodia, for example.
The Ministry will hold a news conference [see [2] below] at 0800 GMT and said
the discovery did not pose a threat to people's health. The official said
blood tests showed some South Koreans had developed antibodies for bird flu.
The people were poultry workers and did not develop major illnesses when South
Korea had its bird flu outbreak in poultry.

[2] South Korea - asymptomatic human infection

4 South Koreans were infected with the H5N1 strain of bird flu in late 2003
and early 2004, but none of them developed any serious illness, a South Korean
health official said on Friday [24 Feb 2006]. These 4 are the first people in
the country confirmed to have been infected with the H5N1 strain, Oh Dae-kyu,
the head of the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told a news
conference. South Korea now becomes the 8th country to report a human
infection of the H5N1 strain since 2003.
About 400 000 poultry at South Korean farms were infected by bird flu between
December 2003 and March 2004, but no human cases were reported at that time.
About 5 million poultry were slaughtered, health officials said. That outbreak
marked bird flu's re-emergence and was followed by cases around the world
involving the deadly H5N1 strain, most recently in France, India and Malaysia,
for example.
Oh said the discovery did not pose a threat to people's health. He said blood
tests showed the 4 poultry workers had developed antibodies for the H5N1
strain of the virus. "Bird flu is totally under control here now and there is
no need to panic. People can safely consume eggs and chicken," Oh said
The ministry had sent blood samples from 318 poultry industry workers to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States for tests and
received confirmation of the antibodies in the blood of the 4 on Thursday [23
Feb 2006]. The blood was drawn at the time of the outbreak and tests were
first conducted in South Korea. Those blood samples were also sent to the CDC
in the United States in November 2005 for more accurate testing, Oh said.
South Korea plans to ask the CDC in the coming months to test samples drawn at
the time of the outbreak of 1600 other people who were involved in culling of
fowl in South Korea.
The 4 did not develop major illnesses when South Korea had its bird flu
outbreak in poultry and are all healthy now. 3 have been contacted by the
ministry about the findings, while the other person is studying in Japan and
his family reported he has been healthy.
There have been no cases of bird flu in South Korea since the 2003-2004
outbreak.
North Korea had an outbreak of bird flu about a year ago at poultry farms in
its capital Pyongyang, and it reported there were no human infections. At
least 16 countries have reported outbreaks in birds this month, an indication
that the virus, which has killed more than 90 people, is spreading faster. So
far, there have been no known cases of the virus spreading between humans -- a
development experts fear could trigger a pandemic.

[Retrospective analysis has established that during mid-2003 HPAI H5N1 virus
began to cause outbreaks of poultry disease in Asia which were unrecognized at
that time. In December 2003, 2 tigers and 2 leopards in a Thai zoo died as a
result of consuming H5N1-infected chicken carcasses. Later in the same month
the Republic of Korea confirmed that HPAI H5N1 virus infection was the cause
of poultry deaths at 3 farms. In early 2004 H5N1 virus infection was reported
from Viet Nam, Japan, and Thailand. The 1st laboratory-confirmed cases of H5N1
human infection were reported in Thailand and later sporadically throughout
East Asia. (All were symptomatic cases). The outbreaks in South Korea and
Japan were (as they had been previously in Hong Kong in 1997) rapidly
contained and eradicated by a combination of early detection, extensive
culling, and continued surveillance. H5N1 virus infection has not recurred in
South Korea. No human cases of infection were reported at that time, but the
above reports indicate that a small number of those involved in poultry
culling experienced asymptomatic infection and developed immune responses.
Similar data are still largely lacking for the subsequent extensive H5N1 virus
outbreaks throughout the rest of East Asia.
The virus responsible for the outbreaks in South Korea and Japan belongs to
the V genotype of H5N1 avian influenza virus, whereas the predominant virus in
East Asia belongs to the Z genotype. However, this is unlikely to be a
relevant factor in human susceptibility to infection, since these genotypes
are reassortants which differ only in the origin of their NA genome subunit. -

[3] Malaysia - no human cases confirmed

All 10 people quarantined in Malaysia with suspected bird flu this week have
tested negative for H5N1 virus infection, a government official said on Friday
[24 Feb 2006]. The 10 were hospitalised with flu-like symptoms after the H5N1
virus was detected in 40 chickens found dead last week in Malaysia's first
poultry infection in over a year.
"The test results on the last 2 patients were also negative and they have been
discharged. There have been no new admissions," Disease Control Division
director Ramlee Rahmat told Reuters.
No human cases have so far been reported in Malaysia, which last reported the
H5N1 virus in a chicken in the northern state of Kelantan in 2004. Health
officials have combed through 505 houses, screening more than 2000 residents
living within a 300-metre radius of the infection site on the fringe of the
capital. Mustapa Abdul Jalil, acting chief of veterinary services, said more
manpower has been mobilised for the culling operation within a 1-km radius of
the site. Surveillance tasks would be extended to a 10-kilometre (6-mile)
zone, Mustapa said, stretching into the heart of Kuala Lumpur in an operation
that will run until 3 Mar 2006. Since Monday, 2451 chickens, ducks and other
birds have been killed and 516 eggs destroyed, he told reporters. No new cases
of H5N1 have emerged since 19 Feb 2006, with clinical tests on swab samples
from 329 birds so far turning out to be negative, Mustapa added.
