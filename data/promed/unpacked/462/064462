Saudi Arabia reports 6 new MERS cases, 4 deaths in last 6 months
----------------------------------------------------------------
Saudi Arabia reported 6 fresh cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from August [2021] through February 2022, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The country also recorded 4 deaths from MERS infection during the period, the United Nations health agency noted. Household contacts of the 6 patients tested negative for the infection.

The respiratory disease was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The virus resurfaced after 9 years in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic last year [2021].

The country recorded 11 new MERS infections and 2 deaths from January to July 2021, according to the August 2021 bi-annual update by the global health body.

The world has witnessed 2585 cases and 891 associated deaths so far, data available with WHO showed. The case fatality rate of the disease is 35%, according to the health agency.

The cases were concentrated in countries in the Arabian Peninsula, barring an outbreak in May 2015 during which South Korea and China recorded 186 cases and 38 deaths, WHO said.

The 6 new cases were spread over 3 regions -- 4 in Riyadh and one each in Hafar Albatin and Taif -- that were also the hotspots last year [2021].

There were no new cases this year [2022] but one death was recorded in January 2022, the global health organisation noted.

MERS is a zoonotic disease that usually travels from dromedary camels to humans. The infected camels have been quarantined, the country's agriculture ministry said.

WHO noted in its April 2022 bi-annual report:
"The notification of the 6 cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedary camels."

MERS-CoV cases have been on a decline ever since COVID-19 struck in late 2019, just like other infectious diseases, the international health organisation said. The dip has been attributed to reduced testing due to reallocation of resources to fight the ongoing pandemic.

Strong surveillance is a critical tool to mitigate a possible outbreak, said WHO, urging member states to not let their guards down. It also addresses the need to strengthen infection, prevention and control measures to prevent human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings.

MERS-CoV belongs to the same family of viruses that causes COVID-19. The symptoms of the disease are fever, cough, shortness of breath, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea), WHO said.

The severity of the infection can range from asymptomatic, symptomatic and severe acute respiratory disease to death, the global health body noted.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
This is the bi-annual update on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections reported to WHO from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Between 1 Aug 2021 to 28 Feb 2022, 6 additional cases of MERS-CoV infections, including 4 associated deaths were reported to WHO from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. These cases were reported from Riyadh (4 cases), Eastern (one case), and Taif (one case) regions. Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and careful review of any unusual patterns.

Description of cases
--------------------
Since the last Disease Outbreak News on MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia published on 17 Aug 2021, the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia has reported 6 additional cases, including 4 associated deaths. The geographical distribution of these reported cases is shown in Figure 1.

This link provides details of the 6 reported cases: MERS-CoV cases reported from 1 Aug 2021 through 28 Feb 2022 [https://cms.who.int/publications/m/item/mers-cov-cases-reported-between-1-august-2021-to-28-february-2022]

Between September 2012 and 28 Feb 2022, a total of 2585 cases, including 891 associated deaths (case fatality rate: 35%) have been globally reported to WHO under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) (Figure 2). The majority of these cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula, with one large outbreak outside this region in May 2015, when 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and one in China) and 38 deaths were reported.

[1] No cases of MERS-CoV have been reported between 1 Jan to 28 Feb 2022. However, one death was reported in January 2022.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection that is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems and until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.

Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels who are the natural host and zoonotic source of the MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings. Outside of the healthcare setting there has been limited human-to-human transmission.

MERS-CoV infections range from showing no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems and those with chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.

No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV specific vaccines and treatments are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient's clinical condition.

Public health response
----------------------
Follow up of the household contacts was conducted for all 6 cases, and no secondary cases were identified.

The Ministry of Agriculture was informed, and an investigation of camels was conducted. The identified positive camels were quarantined.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
The notification of the 6 cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedary camels, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedary camels or their products (for example, consumption of camel's raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

The number of MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 2). This is likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized, resulting in reduced testing and detection of MERS-CoV cases. The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia continues to work to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

WHO advice
----------
Surveillance: Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control in healthcare settings: Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures. IPC measures are therefore critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people, particularly in healthcare facilities.

Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, at every interaction in healthcare settings:
• Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection;
• Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection;
• Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where aerosol-generating procedures are conducted.

Case management: Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures in healthcare settings and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.

MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. Timely, effective, and safe supportive management of patients with MERS should be provided, particularly for those at risk of more severe disease.

Infection prevention and control in the community: General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

International travel and trade:
• All 6 cases reported above are locally acquired infections. However, WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection may be exported from countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedary camels, by travelers, who might acquire the infection after exposure to infected dromedary camels or dromedary products (for example, following contact with camels), or to infected humans (for example, in a healthcare setting).
• WHO does not advise specific MERS-CoV screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) has informed that a case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) has been confirmed. The case is a male national aged 85 years.

He had complained of multiple chronic diseases and had a history of travel outside the country as well as direct contact with camels.

The patient started to develop symptoms before his arrival in Qatar. Upon reaching Qatar, he was admitted to a hospital for the necessary medical care in accordance with the national protocol to deal with confirmed or suspected cases of the disease, the ministry said in a statement on its website.

Last month [March 2022], the MoPH had confirmed another case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the country, that of a male resident aged 50 years.

MERS is a viral respiratory disease that is caused by one of the coronaviruses (MERS-CoV), but it differs from the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19. The 2 viruses differ in terms of the source of infection, mode of transmission and disease severity.

The Ministry of Public Health has called on all members of public, and especially people with chronic diseases or those with immunodeficiency disorders, to adhere to public hygiene measures. These include washing the hands regularly with water and soap, using hand sanitisers, avoiding close contact with camels and seeking medical advice when experiencing symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat or shortness of breath.
