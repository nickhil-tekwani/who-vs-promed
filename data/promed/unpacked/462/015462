Movement of horses into the Western Cape will be restricted to protect the province from an outbreak of African horse sickness (AHS) elsewhere in the country.

The disease, which affects the horse's respiratory system and causes dehydration, is transmitted by insects like mosquitoes.

Western Cape Veterinary Services chief Gininda Msiza said major access routes into the Western Cape -- on the N1, between Laingsburg and Touws River, the N2 at Suurbraak, the N7 at Trawal and outside Barrydale on the R62 -- would have clear road signs to indicate to horse owners that they were moving their animals into a control area.

Msiza urged owners to ensure their animals were vaccinated and said horses that succumbed to AHS had not been vaccinated. Horses coming into the province would be quarantined if their owners could not provide proof they had been vaccinated, he said. "These restrictions have been instituted due to the increasing number of reported and suspected cases of AHS in the rest of the country.

"This AHS season [2013], which stretches from January up to June, has already seen 208 cases reported of which 126 were fatal. Due to persistent high rainfall in the interior, cases have increased dramatically and also earlier than in previous years," Msiza said. There have been no AHS cases in the province this season, he said.

Agriculture and Rural Development MEC [Member of the Executive Council] Gerrit van Rensburg said the local horse-breeding industry was under a 2-year export ban, resulting from an outbreak of the disease in Mamre in 2011. "We are hopeful to see this ban lifted in June [2013] after an EU inspection and on condition (there are) no further outbreaks in the controlled area," he said.

He urged horse owners to co-operate with the control measures and said another outbreak could result in another ban, which could cause financial losses to the equine industry.

[A check of The Cape Times shows no prior reports of this disease since 2011. And OIE has no South African notifications for 2013 that I could find. Would someone please update us on the actual situation in South Africa for African horse sickness outbreaks? This Western Cape report says there have been 208 cases elsewhere in the country with some 60 percent case fatality rate. - Mod.MHJ]
