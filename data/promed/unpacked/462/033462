Global influenza situation as of 8 October 1997:
Sporadic cases continued to be diagnosed in some northern hemisphere
countries during the summer months: USA and UK in June, in Finland and UK
in July and August and in Canada in early August. The influenza A isolates
in Canada and the USA were further subtyped as A(H3N2), while isolates in
the UK were influenza A(H1N1) and influenza B. No outbreaks have been
reported.
The 1996-1997 season in the northern hemisphere was mainly associated with
influenza A(H3N2), which in many countries was followed by influenza B.
Both influenza types were diagnosed in the season in the southern
hemisphere. At the end of the season influenza A(H1N1) became more
frequently diagnosed: the first H1N1 cases in Senegal in August-September,
along with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B. Influenza A(H1N1) outbreaks
were reported in Tahiti, French Polynesia in September, and Manila,
Philippines in July-August. This subtype became relatively more common in
Hong Kong in August when H3N2 activity waned. Influenza A(H1N1) virus was
also isolated in Singapore. Cases of influenza A were reported in Chile in
August-September after influenza B activity had declined.
The vaccine recommended for use in the 1997-1998 season should contain an
A/Wuhan/359/95(H3N2)-like strain; an A/Bayern/7/95(H1N1)-like strain; and a
B/Beijing/184/93-like strain. Further details on the recommendations were
published in Weekly Epidemiological Record, No. 9 (28 February 1997).
[Influenza virus antigenic variation continues to fascinate. Whether there
has been some significant "drift" lately, or not, is a question that
remains to be answered. -Mod. CHC
