Cholera outbreak kills 32 in Niger
----------------------------------
A cholera outbreak in 3 regions of Niger has killed 32 persons among
1573 reported cases, the National Health Information Office (SNIS)
affirmed here Fri, 3 Sep 2004, in a preliminary report.
The epidemic hit Tillabery, Maradi and Diffa in the western, central
and eastern regions, respectively. But SNIS said health authorities
have set up a number of treatment camps delivering free care to
patients, predominantly women and children.
The director of SNIS, Dr Kairo Kara Kiari, said cholera was first reported at
the Lake Chad basin, especially at the Doro fishing port [see report from
Chad below], killing 1 of 25 patients, and then in the commune of Maradi,
where it killed 4 of the 17 affected persons. Kiari said the epidemic hit
the region of the Niger river and the Urban Community of Niamey [the capital]
when rains began in early June 2004.
SNIS noted that the Niger government, Japan, Italy, Canada and a
number of international bodies, including the WHO and UNICEF, have
provided the health sector with enough drugs to fight the disease.
Since 1970, cholera epidemics have perennially hit Niger, especially in areas
along the Niger river, the source of drinking water for most of the
population.

Chad: Cholera Epidemic in Western Chad Kills 123
------------------------------------------------
More than 120 people have died of cholera in western Chad and nearly
3000 cases of the water-borne disease have been reported since an
epidemic broke out at the start of the rainy season in mid-June 2004,
the government told relief agencies this week.
"At yesterday's coordination meeting, the Chadian authorities said
they had recorded 2895 cases of cholera and 123 deaths throughout the
territory," Genevieve Salise, the Cholera Coordinator for Medecins
sans Frontieres (MSF) Belgium told IRIN by telephone from the Chadian
capital N'djamena.
The cholera outbreak started in Guitte, a fishing village on Lake Chad [see
report from Niger above] on 16 Jun 2004, but it subsequently spread south to
N'djamena, a city of nearly a million people.
The last major cholera outbreak in Chad occurred in 2001, when a
total of 5244 cases were recorded. No cholera cases have so far been
reported in Eastern Chad, where nearly 200 000 refugees from Sudan's
troubled Darfur region are packed into often overcrowded refugee
camps with limited supplies of clean drinking water and limited
sanitation facilities.

Guinea-Sierra Leone: Death Toll From Cholera Outbreak Rises
-----------------------------------------------------------
The death toll from a cholera outbreak in Guinea and neighboring
Sierra Leone rose to 86 at the end of August 2004, the Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies reported.
The Geneva-based Federation said in a statement on Mon, 6 Sep 2004,
that 561 cholera cases and 55 deaths had been recorded in Sierra
Leone up to 30 Aug 2004, giving a death rate of nearly 10 percent.
It said the Red Cross was making plans to deal with up to 4000 cases
of the highly infectious disease in the West African country.
The Federation said Guinea had reported 333 cases of cholera and 31
deaths up to 31 Aug 2004, but the situation there seemed to be under
control.
The disease 1st appeared in Guinea following exceptionally heavy
rainfall during the second half of July 2004. It spread to Sierra
Leone shortly afterwards.
The cholera outbreak in Sierra Leone is the 1st to be recorded in the
country since 1999, but the Federation noted that no proper
contingency planning had been put in place by the government to deal
with such an emergency.
The Federation said the cholera outbreak in Guinea was concentrated
in the capital Conakry and the nearby towns of Coyah, Kindia and
Forecariah, all of which lie close to the frontier with Sierra Leone.

Dysentery outbreak in Mandalay
------------------------------
There has been a serious outbreak of dysentery at Mandalay in the
central part of the country. Several people, mainly school children,
have died as the result of the outbreak. According to a local
resident, the outbreak has lasted nearly a week.
Both public and private hospitals have been filled with patients, and
some have to camp outside the hospitals on bamboo mats due to lack of
beds. The outbreak is due to the chemicals and fertilizers used to
make fruits and vegetables more productive.
The local authorities are shutting down all fruit and vegetable
stores and warning people on loudspeakers not to eat ripened fruits
and vegetables.

[If this outbreak is indeed due to shigellosis, it is likely that it is not
the chemicals or fertilizers causing it, unless the fertilizers are of human
origin. - Mod.LL]
[Alternatively, the journalist is using the word "dysentery" in its broad
sense to mean bloody diarrhea, independent of cause, in which case this could
be an episode of chemical poisoning. More details would be welcome. - Mod.JW]

An outbreak of dysentery in Perm
--------------------------------
In Perm, 89 people from various parts of the region, including 2
children, have developed dysentery.
According to the sanitary surveillance center, the infections were

Disease and positive tests for _Shigella sonnei_ were reported among
the staff of the shops.

Doctors probe 2nd food bug outbreak
-----------------------------------
Doctors are probing Ulster's 2nd salmonella outbreak in 3 months.
The Eastern Health Board said the latest involved 13 people -- half
of them from the greater Belfast area -- who picked up the food bug
over the last 8 days. 5 of the total needed hospital treatment as a
result.
In July 2004, up to 100 people were struck down by salmonella in the
Downpatrick area. A final report on that outbreak is currently being
put together by Board chiefs.
Commenting on the latest outbreak, a spokesman said: "The Board
normally sees an increased prevalence of salmonella during the summer
as many people return from overseas holidays. This period also
presents seasonal risks to food hygiene, and people should be mindful
of the need to carefully refrigerate perishable foodstuffs and to
ensure these are used promptly.
