Man dies from Eastern equine encephalitis
-----------------------------------------
2 human cases of Eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] have recently occurred. A
man in Escambia County has died from the virus, and a Baldwin County resident
is recovering from it, the Alabama Department of Public Health announced this
morning [Fri 15 Jul 2005].
In addition, 7 cases of the virus have been confirmed in horses: 5 in Baldwin
County, one in Escambia County and one in Mobile County. EEE and other mosquito-
borne viruses, such as West Nile virus, are transmitted from bird to mosquito
to bird.
Mosquitoes can spread these viruses by feeding on the blood of infected birds
and then biting another host animal such as a horse or human. Although humans
and horses can become ill from the infection, the disease cannot be spread from
people or horses [because the level of virus in their blood is too low to
infect mosquitoes. It is not spread directly human-to-human, horse-to-horse,
horse-to-human or vice versa. - Mod.JW].
Recent rains and debris that may be keeping water from draining properly
heighten the risk for additional human and horse exposures from mosquitoes [as
they provide mosquito breeding places. - Mod.JW]. The public is advised to make
every effort to reduce exposure to mosquitoes in the aftermath of Hurricane
Dennis.
