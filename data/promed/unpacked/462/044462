Dozens of children have died in Hyderabad as a result of what has been termed the "world's first outbreak of drug-resistant typhoid." The Aga Khan University (AKU) has blamed contaminated water for the lethal disease, but the Sindh Health Department has ruled it out.

Two regions of Hyderabad are in the grip of a drug-resistant strain of typhoid caused by "poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water", said the AKU in a statement on Tuesday [23 Jan 2018] and announced the launch of an emergency vaccination drive to protect children from the lethal disease.

Although no confirmed number of deaths due to the drug-resistant typhoid was provided to the media, the health department and local gastroenterologists said that over 100 cases of the lethal bacterial disease had been reported to date since November-December 2016, as compared to only 6 cases across the country between 2009 and 2014.

"Typhoid cases resistant to the 3rd-generation cephalosporin antibacterial ceftriaxone have been reported from different areas of Hyderabad, but so far we're unable to find its source," Health Services Sindh Director General Dr Muhammad Akhlaq Khan told The News. "Children in the age group of 2-10 years are being affected by this type of disease, but so far we don't have any exact data on the deaths caused by this lethal disease."

Dr Khan confirmed that the AKU's researchers and pediatricians had identified the drug-resistant typhoid in Hyderabad, but he said that so far they had not shared the data on the deaths caused by it. He, however, claimed that it was not the contaminated water that was causing the disease. "It's not the water-borne typhoid, otherwise the entire population of Hyderabad would've suffered from the lethal disease," he said, adding that the health department, in collaboration with the AKU, was launching a mass immunization campaign to vaccinate 250 000 children in the district.

But pediatricians and gastroenterologists serving at different public and private hospitals in Hyderabad said typhoid cases were on the rise in the city resulting in several deaths on a daily basis, deploring that even the ceftriaxone was not working against the lethal disease. "Several children have died in front of my eyes during the past few weeks due to typhoid and its related complications, as they didn't respond to therapy available in the market," said Dr Abbas Tunio, a pediatrician serving at a private clinic in Hyderabad's Qasimabad area.

Even the AKU's experts and researchers who detected the drug-resistant typhoid cases during the past 14 months confirmed that the newer type of water-borne disease was not responding to ceftriaxone, which was a serious cause of concern for them and international health agencies. "This is the world's 1st outbreak of typhoid that is resistant to ceftriaxone, which is a standard treatment for the disease around the world," said Dr Farah Qamar, an associate professor at the AKU's Department of Paediatrics and Child Health. "Our research has pinpointed the areas of Hyderabad district with the greatest need and shows that children represent the majority of those affected by the disease. We're glad to partner with the government on this important initiative, which would save lives and stop new cases of this preventable disease."

Around 250 000 children in Latifabad and Qasimabad, the worst-hit talukas in Hyderabad district, will receive doses of the new Typbar TCV vaccine, which is the only solution to preventing cases of this type of typhoid.

Researchers and laboratory staff from the AKU have detected over 800 cases of drug-resistant typhoid in Hyderabad alone in a 10-month period between 2016 and 2017. This is an alarming development since only 6 cases of drug-resistant typhoid were found in the entire country between 2009 and 2014.

"We recently completed a pilot program in the affected areas that saw high demand for the vaccine from the community and proved that the vaccine could be safely administered," said Dr Khan. "The pilot provided us with valuable insights on how to effectively scale up the campaign, and we look forward to working with our private sector partners so that we can reach every child in the affected areas."

The vaccination drive will be conducted over a 3-4 month period by 15 teams of vaccinators from Hyderabad's health department. They will be working alongside officials from the district health department, the provincial disease surveillance unit, the district administration and local government officials. Private partners such as the AKU and staff from the Field Epidemiology & Laboratory Training Program of the Centres for Disease Control & Prevention will also be part of the emergency campaign.

Doses of the vaccine were purchased through funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Emergency Response programme after the AKU's researchers presented data on the outbreak -- gathered from its extensive laboratory network in Hyderabad -- at an international summit in Uganda in April 2017. The control and prevention of neglected tropical diseases such as typhoid is a global health priority, with targets under Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals calling for the eradication of such diseases by 2030.

Dr Anita Zaidi, director of vaccine development, surveillance and enteric and diarrheal diseases at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, supported global efforts to generate evidence of the efficacy of this vaccine against typhoid fever. "It is unconscionable that children are still dying by the thousands every year from diseases like typhoid that are completely preventable," said Dr Zaidi, an AKU alumnus and former chair of the AKU's Department of Pediatrics and Child Health. "We are pleased to support the Sindh government's initiative as part of our overall strategy to combat typhoid through an integrated approach including access to clean water, improved sanitation and immunization."

Researchers from the AKU will be collecting data during the 4-month vaccination drive to assess the impact of the typhoid conjugate vaccine in an outbreak setting. Findings from the study will inform efforts to tackle outbreaks of typhoid in other parts of the world and to investigate whether the vaccine should be made part of Pakistan's national immunization program.

[This outbreak may well be caused by _S._ Typhi, H58, defined based on single nucleotide polymorphisms frequently referred to as SNPs (pronounced "snips"), which has been accounting for a significant amount of morbidity and mortality, which may be based on its increasingly antimicrobial resistance. ProMED would appreciate more information regarding the outbreak strain and its antimicrobial sensitivity pattern(s).

The following is abstracted from the introduction of the article, Wong VK, Baker S, Pickard DJ, et al: Phylogeographical analysis of the dominant multidrug-resistant H58 clade of _Salmonella_ Typhi identifies inter- and intracontinental transmission events. Nature Genetics. 2015;47:632-639 with the citations removed:

"_S._ Typhi, the primary global cause of human typhoid (enteric fever), is a monophyletic serovar of _S. enterica_. Unlike many Salmonella, _S. Typhi_ are highly restricted to infection of humans and are associated with systemic infection, prolonged fever and an asymptomatic carrier state. Typhoid is still a common disease in many regions of the world with poor infrastructure and limited economic development and is also a risk for travelers who visit such regions. It is estimated that 20-30 million cases of typhoid occur annually, although deaths are less frequently reported than before the availability of effective antimicrobials.

In addition to improvements in access to clean water and sanitation, typhoid can potentially be controlled by other interventions such as vaccination and antimicrobial therapy. Chloramphenicol, ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were traditional 1st-line drugs commonly used to treat acute typhoid, and these agents continue to be used in areas of the world where _S._ Typhi are deemed susceptible. However, since the 1970s, _S._ Typhi have emerged that display multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to the above antimicrobials, compromising treatment. Since the 1990s, alternative treatment options have included fluoroquinolones, 3rd-generation cephalosporins (such as ceftriaxone) and the azalide azithromycin. The early emergence of MDR _S._ Typhi was driven in large part by the acquisition of IncHI1 plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes and, more recently, by chromosomal mutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones, and MDR strains have been reported across Asia and Africa.

Phylogenetic analysis, initially based on subgenomic DNA sequences but later on whole-genome DNA sequences, showed that the global _S._ Typhi population is highly clonal and likely originated from a common ancestor that moved into the human population several thousand years ago. It also indicated that the population is relatively small and that recombination between _S._ Typhi and other salmonellae is rare. Simple SNP-based typing schemes have been developed that stratify the _S._ Typhi population into haplotypes, and these schemes are now used to unequivocally map new isolates to the phylogeny. Notably, this approach identified a single emerging, highly clonal MDR haplotype of _S._ Typhi, H58, which is being reported with increasing frequency from many countries in Africa and Asia. Within the H58 lineage, IncHI1 MDR plasmids of the restricted subtype PST6 and chromosomal point mutations conferring quinolone resistance are common."

Regarding typhoid immunization, an important report has been published recently [Thu 28 Sep 2017] in Lancet: Jin C, Gibani MM, Moore M, et al: Efficacy and immunogenicity of a Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine in the prevention of typhoid fever using a controlled human infection model of _Salmonella_ Typhi: a randomised controlled, phase 2b trial. Lancet. 2017. pii: S0140-6736(17)32149-9. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32149-9. [Epub ahead of print], available at: http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32149-9.pdf.

An excellent accompanying editorial (Feasey NA and Levine MM: Typhoid vaccine development with a human challenge model. Lancet. 2017. pii: S0140-6736(17)32407-8. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32407-8. [Epub ahead of print], available at:
http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32407-8.pdf) is reproduced below (the references cited can be found at the original URL):

"Experimental human typhoid fever challenge was first described in 1896 by Wright, who vaccinated 2 men against typhoid fever and challenged one with what was then known as _Salmonella typhosa_ [1]. While challenge models are sometimes controversial, they offer enormous potential to study the pathogenesis of disease and to accelerate vaccine development, particularly in human-restricted pathogens such as _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi. The Maryland typhoid human challenge model, which ran from 1952 to 1974, led to insights into typhoid fever and facilitated the development of live attenuated typhoid vaccine Ty21a [2, 3]. A 21st-century typhoid challenge model has been developed by the Oxford Vaccine Group [4].

"In The Lancet, Celina Jin and colleagues [5] report results from challenging 3 groups of healthy adults from Oxford, UK, who were randomly assigned to receive Vi-conjugate vaccine, unconjugated Vi-polysaccharide vaccine, or control vaccine (ACYW135 meningococcal conjugate) with wild-type Quailes strain _S._ Typhi. Results of this volunteer challenge have been awaited with much anticipation by the public health community interested in control of typhoid fever in endemic areas of south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where _S._ Typhi is increasingly antibiotic resistant and few treatment options remain. Vi-conjugate vaccines that have been in development represent a new instrument to help to control typhoid. The most advanced conjugate vaccine, Typbar-TCV (Vi-polysaccharide [Vi-PS] conjugated to tetanus toxoid, Vi-TT, Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, India), is licensed in India where it has been shown to elicit robust serum Vi antibody responses after only one dose, even in Indian infants as young as 6 months [6]. In toddlers, older children, and adults, Typbar-TCV was shown to be significantly more immunogenic than the unconjugated Bharat Vi-PS [6]. Bharat Biotech has submitted an application to WHO for pre-qualification of their Vi-TT. If approved, this would allow the vaccine to be procured by UN agencies. However, despite evidence of safety and immunogenicity in Indian children and adults, heretofore, there has been no evidence of actual efficacy of the vaccine in diminishing the attack rate of typhoid fever upon exposure to virulent _S._ Typhi compared with the control participants. Importantly, the authors provide the first data documenting that Typbar-TCV is protective.

"A total of 112 participants were enrolled in this observer and participant-blinded, randomised controlled trial, which showed that the Vi-TT is well tolerated, achieved 100 percent seroconversion of Vi antibody (versus 89 percent for Vi-PS), and stimulated significantly higher geometric mean titres than did unconjugated Vi-PS. Most importantly, Jin and colleagues document that Vi-TT recipients had a significantly lower attack rate for the primary aim endpoint diagnosing typhoid fever than control recipients. With the primary endpoint used in this ambitious trial, the attack rate for typhoid diagnosis was 24 (77 percent) of 31 in control participants, 13 (35 percent) of 37 in Vi-TT recipients, and 13 (35 percent) of 35 in those who received Vi-PS. This translates into vaccine efficacies of 54.6 percent (95 percent CI 26.8-71.8) for Vi-TT and 52.0 percent (23.2-70.0) for Vi-PS.

"As the authors suggest, the field efficacy of Vi-TT vaccine might be higher; for example, a well-designed and executed field trial of an unlicensed Vi-conjugate produced by the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) in Vietnamese pre-school children showed an efficacy of 89 percent (95 percent CI 76-97) over 46 months of follow-up. [7] One possible explanation lies in the primary endpoint of so-called typhoid infection used by Jin and colleagues [5] (persistent fever of 38 deg C or higher for 12 hours or longer or _S._ Typhi bacteremia), which arguably is better suited to studying typhoid pathogenesis than assessing the efficacy of typhoid vaccines. Using slightly different endpoints such as fever 38 deg C or higher followed by a positive blood culture, similar to surveillance in a field trial and to endpoints used in the Maryland challenge model, Jin and colleagues [5] report that the efficacy of Vi-TT was 87.1 percent (95 percent CI 47.2-96.9), while efficacy of Vi-PS was 52.3 percent (-4.2 to 78.2). Although future typhoid challenges based on this as a co-primary endpoint would require larger sample sizes, the information gained might be more relevant and predictive of the efficacy that might be noted in a randomised controlled field trial. This highlights the need for the phase 3 and 4 trials, the first of which is expected to be initiated in Asia in late 2017 by the Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC), a partnership between the University of Maryland, the University of Oxford, and PATH funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. However, because it will be some years before these field trials are reported, Jin and colleagues' challenge study results are timely and engender optimism that an effective new instrument has become available to help to control typhoid in hyperendemic populations." - Mod.LL
