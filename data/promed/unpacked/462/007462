[3] Yemen: MSF report
Date: Thu 21 May 2020
Source: Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) [edited]
https://www.msf.org/aden%E2%80%99s-only-covid-19-treatment-centre-we-are-seeing-catastrophe-unfold


The number of deaths occurring in the COVID-19 treatment centre that MSF runs in Aden, Yemen, speaks to a wider catastrophe unfolding in the city, the international medical organisation said today [20 May 2020], and the UN and donor states need to do more urgently to help the response.

The centre that MSF runs in the city is the only dedicated COVID-19 centre for the whole of southern Yemen. From [30 Apr 2020 to 17 May 2020] we admitted 173 patients, at least 68 of whom have died. Many patients are arriving at the centre already suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome, making it hard to save their lives and suggesting that many more people are sick at home.

That many people are also dying at home is shown by government burial statistics that reveal that as many 80 people have been dying in the city per day in the past week, up from a pre-outbreak normal of 10. Another indication of just how widespread the outbreak has become is the number of healthcare professionals we are treating in the centre and the many members of our own staff that are sick.

"What we are seeing in our treatment centre is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of people infected and dying in the city," said Caroline Seguin, MSF's operations manager for Yemen. "People are coming to us too late to save, and we know that many more people are not coming at all: they are just dying at home. It is a heart-breaking situation."

"The United Nations and donor states need to do more and do it urgently, not just for Aden but for the whole of Yemen," said Seguin. "Money to pay healthcare workers must be found and supplies of the personal protective equipment necessary to keep them safe need to be organised. The country also badly needs more oxygen concentrators to help sick patients breathe. The local authorities need to do all they can to facilitate the work of international organisations like MSF who are working with them to respond to the virus, ensuring the entry of medical supplies and international staff to reinforce teams on the ground."

A team of Yemeni and international staff is working around the clock to provide the best treatment they can at the treatment centre in Aden, which MSF has been fully managing since [7 May 2020]. Like in other places around the world, however, we are witnessing just how deadly this disease can be. "The high level of mortality we are seeing amongst our patients is equivalent to those of intensive care units in Europe, but the people we see dying are much younger than in France or Italy: mostly men between 40 and 60 years old," continued Seguin.

Aden was already struggling with a healthcare system that had collapsed after 5 years of war in Yemen before COVID-19 arrived, and the authorities lack the means to properly respond to the outbreak. There is no money to pay staff, little personal protective equipment, and very few tests, so the exact numbers of cases cannot be known. The patients we see dying clearly have the symptoms of COVID-19, however. Diseases such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya are endemic to the city, but they have never produced so many deaths in such a short amount of time.

"Hospitals have had to close elsewhere in the city or are refusing certain types of patients because staff members lack the personal protective equipment to keep them safe, which leaves us very concerned about the knock-on effects of this outbreak on other types of illnesses," said Seguin. MSF's trauma hospital in Aden is still open, and has seen an increase in the number of admissions since other hospitals started closing. We have instituted triage and other protective measures to keep staff and patients safe at the hospital as much as is possible. Any staff member who begins to show symptoms is immediately sent home to self-isolate.

"We are doing all that we can, but we cannot face this virus alone," said Seguin. "It would be unconscionable for the world to just leave Aden and the rest of Yemen to face this crisis by themselves."

[The challenges of developing a surge capacity in an area with prolonged civil unrest are huge. The need for tests, PPE, oxygen, and ventilators is similar to reports out of other areas under development, but knowledge of the pre-existing interruption of the healthcare infrastructure makes the setting worse. The observed case fatality rate of 39% in hospital is of great concern as well. The news release is oriented towards a plea for humanitarian assistance -- I can't help but agree with this plea. - Mod.MPP

[4] WHO situation report 122 (as of 21 May 2020)
Date: Thu 21 May 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200521-covid-19-sitrep-122.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 21 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The WHO World Health Assembly has ended with a global commitment to the COVID-19 response (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-05-2020-historic-health-assembly-ends-with-global-commitment-to-covid-19-response). Delegates adopted a landmark resolution to bring the world together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic (https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA73/A73_CONF1Rev1-en.pdf).

- WHO has been supporting Somalia since the beginning of this outbreak to enhance its infection control measures, testing capacities, and case management. In particular, training has been provided for the healthcare workers of the De-Martino hospital and 13 other isolation centres across the country, which have also received medical supplies and budget support for salaries. However, so far, only 26% of WHO's urgent appeal of USD 21.95 million for emergency response to COVID-19 in Somalia has been funded (http://www.emro.who.int/somalia/news/who-intensifies-support-to-improve-case-management-during-covid-19-pandemic.html).

- The World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, celebrated every year on 21 May, is an opportunity to celebrate not only the richness of the world's cultures, but also the importance of cultural competency and intercultural dialogue within healthcare systems. It also reminds us that public health efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic require a whole-of-society approach and must include vulnerable populations such as refugees and migrants in national plans and strategies (http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-determinants/migration-and-health/news/news/2020/5/embracing-cultural-diversity-unlocks-key-resources-for-more-inclusive-health-systems).

The Americas region is maintaining its status as having the highest cumulative case count of the 6 WHO regions, with the European region as the 2nd-highest region.

The European region reported 17 811 new cases (17.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 1250 deaths (28.0%). Russia reported 49.7% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by Belarus 10.5%, Turkey 5.5%, Germany at 4.2%, Sweden 4.1%, and Italy at 3.7%. The UK reported a decrease of 525 cases.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 14 477 new cases (13.9% of the global newly reported cases) and 165 deaths (3.7%) - the largest daily new case report from this region. Pakistan reported 20.1% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 18.6%, Iran 16.2%, Qatar 10.3%, the United Arab Emirates 6.5%, Kuwait 5.6%, and Egypt at 5.1%.

India reported 70.1% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 20.2%, and Indonesia 8.6%. These 3 countries make up 98.8% of all reported cases in the region. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 67.2% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 28.8%, and the Maldives 1.8%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 21 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkins' CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Johns Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
