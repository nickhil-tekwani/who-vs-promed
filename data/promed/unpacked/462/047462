Molecular Basis for High Virulence of Hong Kong H5N1 Influenza A Viruses
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have pinpointed genetic changes
that converted a chicken influenza virus into a deadly menace to humans.
The chicken [influenza virus was found in Hong Kong in 1997. Though bird
flu viruses usually do not infect humans, this one did, killing 6 of 18
people who contracted it, a high death rate for any infectious disease. To
[eradicate the virus, the government of Hong Kong ordered the slaughter of
all chickens. But the virus has returned there this year -- not once but,
after a limited slaughter, a second time.
The question of what makes a flu virus turn deadly is of enormous concern
to public health officials, who still shudder at what they consider a near
miss of a vast epidemic in Hong Kong in 1997. The virus then, of a type
known as H5N1, first appeared among chickens being sold live in Hong Kong
markets. Influenza is common in birds and usually of no consequence even to
them. This virus, however, not only was killing chickens but quickly
appeared in humans as well. Dr. Kennedy Shortridge, a virologist at the
University of Hong Kong, was investigating the ravaging of the chickens.
"We saw a bird standing up there, pecking away at its food," Dr. Shortridge
said, "and then very gently fall over, lying on its side, looking dead.
Blood was trickling." "It was a very unreal, bizarre situation," he added.
"I had never seen anything like it."
The virus of 1997 seemed gone for good after Hong Kong's chickens, nearly a
million in all, were slaughtered. But it returned in chickens there this
year, a development that led to a culling of them in May. Since then, said
Dr. Robert Webster, a leading flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital in Memphis, it has come back yet again in the chickens, which are
shipped from China.
In the meantime, the University of Wisconsin researchers were analyzing
strains of the H5N1 virus from 1997. The investigators, Dr. Yoshihiro
Kawaoka, Dr. Masato Hatta and colleagues, took advantage of an unusual
feature of the virus: While most human flu viruses do not make mice ill,
these strains generally affected mice and people in the same way. Those
that killed people killed mice, in both cases spreading from the lungs to
the brain and other organs. But other H5N1 strains that appeared in Hong
Kong at the same time did not kill people or mice, and remained in the
lungs. Dr. Kawaoka explained that bird flu viruses sometimes acquire
changes in a protein, hemagglutinin, that the virus needs to burst into
cells and infect them. The change allows the virus to grow outside the
lungs and the intestines, where bird flu viruses are usually contained, and
turns the virus lethal for birds.
The Hong Kong virus infecting and killing chickens had acquired that
hemagglutinin change. But, Dr. Kawaoka asked, why were strains of that
virus, unlike most bird viruses, also able to grow so well in people? Using
new methods of synthesizing live flu viruses in the laboratory, Dr. Kawaoka
and his colleagues meticulously went through the Hong Kong virus's 8 gene
segments, switching a gene from a lethal strain with its counterpart in a
nonlethal strain, and asking if the change made the new virus nonlethal to
mice. They repeated the procedure with different genes. They also did the
reverse, starting with a nonlethal strain and replacing individual genes
with counterparts from a lethal strain.
The results led them to a particular gene, PB2, that is used in viral
replication. They continued the substitution process on a finer scale,
working this time at the level of the bases, the chemical units that make
up a gene. That led them to a tiny mutation that made all the difference.
The lethal virus, they discovered, had an alteration in one base in that
gene. That, Dr. Kawaoka said, let the bird virus grow in mice.
Dr. Lambert, of the Infectious Diseases Institute, said the change in the
PB2 gene also appeared to allow the chicken virus to infect people. And,
she said, the lethal chicken strains in Hong Kong in 1997 already had the
hemagglutinin change and were rapidly evolving to have the PB2 genetic
change as well.

Recombination in the Hemagglutinin Gene of the 1918 "Spanish Flu"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The joining of genetic sequences from pig and human influenza created the
deadly strain that killed up to 40 million people around the world in 1918
and 1919, say Australian researchers. Unlike other flu outbreaks, which
prey heavily on the old and the young, the 1918 "Spanish" flu killed many
healthy people in their prime. "It tended to give people pneumonia," says
virologist Mark Gibbs, who led the research at the Australian National
University (ANU) in Canberra. "That suggests that it infected much deeper
in the lungs than influenza normally does -- that it had a different tissue
specificity."
Flu pandemics are thought to arise when a human flu virus acquires a bird
flu gene, which helps it evade human immunity [antigenic shift. Smaller
pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were triggered this way. But the ANU team found
no trace of genetic material from avian flu in a key gene that helped the
1918 virus infect cells. Instead, they identified a fragment of a gene from
a pig flu strain. The new analysis boosts researchers' knowledge of the way
human influenza can mutate -- which will be vital for understanding how
another pandemic might arise in the future, says the team.
Jeffery Taubenberger of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in
Rockville, Maryland isolated gene sequences for the 1918 virus in 1987.
These samples were found in lung biopsies from 2 American soldiers who
succumbed in 1918, and in the lungs of a third victim who was exhumed after
80 years from a grave in the permafrost soil of Alaska. When Taubenberger
analyzed the 1918 gene sequences -- specifically a gene called
hemagglutinin, which helps the virus infect cells -- he found no evidence
that it came from birds, and no clues regarding the source of the virus's
aggressiveness.
Gibbs took a different approach. Rather than analyzing hemagglutinin as a
whole, he used special software to see if different parts of the gene came
from different sources. He found the middle half of the gene seemed to come
from a pig virus. This pig segment might alter the virus's tissue
specificity -- pushing it deeper into the lungs -- and also help the virus
escape human immunity. Gibbs believes the virus acquired that gene segment
just months before the pandemic started, and "it seems very likely that
this triggered the pandemic."
However, some researchers are doubtful. Taubenberger says the middle part
of the hemagglutinin gene appears pig-like because this gene has evolved
more slowly in pig viruses. Gibbs counters that less than 10 per cent of
the 1918 hemagglutinin gene would evolve slowly (and therefore appear
pig-like) for this reason, whereas his results show that fully half the
gene comes from pigs.

[These 2 reports refer to papers published in the current issue of the
journal Science, and describe different approaches to investigation of the
genetic determinants of the extreme virulence of some strains of human
influenza virus. The titles and abstracts of the 2 Science papers are the
following:
(1) Molecular Basis for High Virulence of Hong Kong H5N1 Influenza A
Viruses. Masato Hatta, Peng Gao, Peter Halfmann, and Yoshihiro Kawaoka
Science 2001 293: 1840-1842.
In 1997, an H5N1 influenza A virus was transmitted from birds to humans in
Hong Kong, killing 6 of the 18 people infected. When mice were infected
with the human isolates, 2 virulence groups became apparent. Using reverse
genetics, we showed that a mutation at position 627 in the PB2 protein
influenced the outcome of infection in mice. Moreover, high cleavability of
the hemagglutinin glycoprotein was an essential requirement for lethal
infection.
(2) Recombination in the Hemagglutinin Gene of the 1918 "Spanish Flu". Mark
J. Gibbs, John S. Armstrong, and Adrian J. Gibbs Science 2001 293: 1842-1845.
When gene sequences from the influenza virus that caused the 1918 pandemic
were first compared with those of related viruses, they yielded few clues
about its origins and virulence. Our reanalysis indicates that the
hemagglutinin gene, a key virulence determinant, originated by
recombination. The "globular domain" of the 1918 hemagglutinin protein was
encoded by a part of a gene derived from a swine-lineage influenza, whereas
the "stalk" was encoded by parts derived from a human-lineage influenza.
Phylogenetic analyses showed that this recombination, which probably
changed the virulence of the virus, occurred at the start of, or
immediately before, the pandemic and thus may have triggered it.
The results of the two analyses differ; neither definitively establish the
nature and origin of the highly lethal virus responsible for the 1918
"Spanish flu" epidemic. - Mod.CP
