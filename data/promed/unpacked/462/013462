Authorities are warning that the anthrax danger is higher after 2 bison northwest of North Battleford, Sask. recently died after contracting the highly contagious disease.

"Whenever we have drier summers, anthrax is always a higher risk," said Dr. Kent Weir, associate veterinarian with Weir Veterinary services in Lloydminster.

Anthrax spores can survive for decades in wet areas such as sloughs and potholes, especially in alkaline soils. When bodies of water dry up, spores are exposed and animals can ingest them, with their corpses leaving more spores on the ground and heightening the danger. Since the disease can kill cattle in as little as 2 hours, sudden death is the most common symptom.

"The thing a producer needs to be most wary of is something that is unexplainably dead," said Weir. "When you find them, the animals are often extremely bloated -- more bloated than you would expect for the amount of time that they have been dead.

"It's literally like you check the cows the night before and you show up the next morning and you have a dead cow."

Animals that have died from anthrax will often have blood coming out of an orifice.

Humans are susceptible to anthrax and can contract it if they cut into animals that have died of anthrax, and inhale some of the spores. They could also become infected if they have a cut or skin abrasion that comes into contact with the spores.

Humans who catch anthrax will have flu-like symptoms, nausea, high fever and have trouble breathing. They may also cough up blood, and in rare occasions, can die.

"The risk to humans is quite low and it's not something that you need to worry about unless you're cutting into them," said Weir.

A producer who suspects a case of anthrax should call their veterinarian immediately and cover the body with a tarp to prevent scavenging and spread of disease. The vet will come out and take blood samples. (Blood doesn't clot in an animal that has died of anthrax.)

Anthrax is a federally reportable disease, and all cases will be reported to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

If anthrax is suspected, producers should move their live animals off that pasture to avoid contamination.

"The disease doesn't transfer from animal to animal," said Weir. "If one cow inhales it and then walks over to another cow and breathes on it, it doesn't get transferred that way. It's from ingesting it."

After the veterinarian has taken samples from the dead animal, producers should burn the carcass and bury the remains to ensure they are killing the anthrax spores.

Producers who have had more than 1 anthrax death may want to invest in the anthrax vaccine. Although not expensive, the vaccine must be specially ordered as it's not commonly used.

[Anthrax is a naturally occurring disease caused by a spore-forming bacterium called _Bacillus anthracis_. It can have devastating effects on cattle, sheep, goats, horses and bison.

Laboratory animals, such as guinea pigs, rabbits and mice, are also susceptible to anthrax.

Pigs, dogs and cats are less susceptible. They can be exposed to the bacterium repeatedly before ever becoming infected. Birds and wildlife also appear to be at lower risk for anthrax.

Anthrax is a "reportable disease" under the Health of Animals Act. This means practitioners and laboratories are required to report suspect positive anthrax test results to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).

Humans are susceptible to anthrax. However, human cases associated with an animal outbreak are rare if proper precautions are taken when handling and moving affected animals and carcasses.

Humans can become infected by: direct or indirect contact with infected animals or carcasses, or exposure to infected or contaminated animal products.

There are 3 types of anthrax that can occur in humans.

1. Cutaneous anthrax, the most common, is acquired through breaks in the skin. It causes black, coal-like skin lesions.

2. Pulmonary anthrax, which is rare, is acquired by inhaling airborne spores. Signs of this form of the disease resemble the common cold and can progress to severe breathing problems and shock.

3. Gastrointestinal tract anthrax is contracted from eating contaminated meat from an animal that died of anthrax. This form of the disease can result in fever, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and other gastrointestinal problems.

Most anthrax outbreaks in recent history have been recorded in beef cattle and bison. Anthrax can also occur in dairy cattle. However, the risk of contracting anthrax from milk or dairy products is extremely low.

Often the 1st sign of an anthrax outbreak is 1 or more sudden deaths in affected livestock. In highly susceptible species like cattle, the time between the onset of mild symptoms (such as feed refusal and/or lower milk production) and death can be a matter of hours.

Animals that do not die suddenly may:
- appear distressed
- have difficulty breathing
- stop eating and drinking
- develop swellings, often under the jaw where the head joins the neck and lower abdominal areas
- have a normal or elevated temperature.
- After death, the animal carcass may leak bloody fluids from body openings (rectum, nostrils, mouth, etc.) and bloat rapidly. Rigor mortis might not occur, and blood may not clot.

_Bacillus anthracis_ is shed by an animal that has died of anthrax. This provides a source of infection for other animals. It can be inhaled or it can enter the body through an existing break in the skin or mucous membrane.

Livestock are most commonly infected by ingesting the spores from contaminated pastures, feed or soil (while grazing). Once ingested, the bacterium grows and multiplies in the bloodstream.

Anthrax is diagnosed by examining blood or tissues for the presence of the bacteria. Samples must be carefully collected to avoid environmental contamination and prevent human exposure to the bacteria. Post-mortem examinations should not be performed on animals suspected to have died from anthrax.

Anthrax can be treated with antibiotics, such as penicillin. Control and treatment is intended to break the cycle of infection.

However, antibiotics should not be administered during the 8 days immediately before or after vaccination, as they interfere with the development of post-vaccination immunity.

Vaccinating livestock is the best protection against anthrax. The Sterne vaccine is the only licensed anthrax vaccine in Canada, and it prevents anthrax in most animals for about 1 year. It is licensed for use in cattle, sheep, horses, goats and swine. Use of the vaccine in bison is considered extra-label and must be recommended by a veterinarian.

While vaccinating livestock is the best protection against anthrax, producers should also:
- avoid giving hay that was cut close to the soil or feed that had contact with soil to non-vaccinated animals
- thoroughly clean and disinfect equipment and footwear that may have had contact with contaminated soil
- wash clothes worn when tending to sick animals separately from the rest of the household laundry.

Producers seeking advice on the prevention, diagnosis, treatment or disposal of anthrax cases in their herd are encouraged to contact their private veterinarian.

Information on how to properly dispose of anthrax-infected carcasses, and cleaning and disinfection procedures is also available on the CFIA website.
