Sudan: Suspected whooping cough outbreak in Equatoria
-------------------------------------------------------------
Over 100 children, mostly under age 5, have died from a suspected outbreak
of whooping cough in Kimatong Budi county, Equatoria state, according to
the NGO, Medair.
In the space of 4 weeks from 20 Aug until 22 Sep 2003, 126 children had
died in the villages of Chawa, Kimatong, Thurunge, and Kali, said Els Stam,
Programme Coordinator for Medair.
With no NGO presence in the area for 5 years, only one health facility with
limited medicines, and no laboratory facilities, it had been impossible to
establish the precise causes of death, but whooping cough was suspected,
she said. Of the 312 apparent cases observed by a Medair team from 22
until 25 Sep 2003, half of them also had enlarged livers and spleen, she said.
A Medair team returned to Kimatong Budi country on Thu, 2 Oct 2003 and
plans to split into 2 teams, based in Chawa and Kimatong, to treat people
and give them preventative medicine. A doctor, a number of nurses, and a
laboratory technician will be located in each place.
Without vaccinations in the region, chronic malaria (and ongoing rains
bringing further mosquitoes), plus the almost total lack of health care,
children were very likely to become infected, she warned.

[Nothing objective is stated here regarding the illness to suggest or
refute the diagnosis of pertussis. The classical paroxysmal coughing
period during a single expiration preceding a "whoop" (massive inspiration
with air forced against a partially narrowing glottis) would be highly
suggestive in an unimmunized population as described here. Most deaths
seem to occur in young (especially less than 1 year of age) unvaccinated
children.
The presence of hepatosplenomegaly is probably multifactorial, not related
to the presumed pertussis. Factors relevant in these cases are most likely
malaria infection and malnutrition. - Mod.LL]
