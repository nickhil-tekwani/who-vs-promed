Beware of regular or pigmy hamsters, Canadian health authority warns
------------------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada is advising Canadians in British
Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and north western Ontario who
have purchased a dwarf/pigmy or regular hamster in the past 3 months of a
potential health concern.
Ill hamsters from a pet distributor in Manitoba have tested positive for
type B tularemia. It is a rare and usually mild disease in humans that can
be treated with antibiotics. In rare cases, some forms of tularemia can be
fatal. The purpose of this advisory notice is to ask people who have
purchased a hamster in the past 3 months to contact their health care
provider if both they and their hamster have experienced illness.
"We believe the risk to human health is low, but if people have sick
hamsters and are feeling ill themselves, we want them to advise their
health care provider," explained Dr David Butler-Jones, the chief public
health officer of Canada.
Ill hamsters, along with other small mammals (chinchillas, guinea pigs,
gerbils, degues) that were included in shipments with the hamsters, were
sent to pet stores in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,
and north western Ontario. At present, there is no indication of illness in
the other animals.
The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, Alberta Health and
Wellness, Saskatchewan Health, Manitoba Health, the Ontario Minister of
Health and Long-term Care, and the Public Health Agency of Canada are
working together closely on this investigation.
Tularemia, a bacterial disease, is found naturally in wild animals,
particularly rodents. Human tularemia disease is rare and is not known to
spread from person to person. Tularemia is usually transmitted by contact
with infected animals or their cages/immediate environment. This means:
- being bitten or licked by the animal,
- handling or cleaning the animal, its toys, cage and feeding equipment,
- breathing in air contaminated with the bacteria, or
- eating or drinking contaminated food or water.
Symptoms of tularemia may include ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen
glands and painful lymph glands, sudden fever, chills, headache, diarrhea,
muscle aches, dry cough, progressive weakness, joint pain, sore throat and
swollen and painful eyes. Symptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after
exposure to the bacteria but can take as long as 14 days to appear.
If your hamster appears sick or dies, and within 14 days you also feel ill,
see your health care provider. Be sure to let your health care provider
know why you think you may have been in contact with tularemia. Advise your
health care provider to speak with your local or regional public health
office.
Pet stores should closely monitor their hamsters and notify their local
veterinarian if they observe illness and higher than usual mortality.
When handling sick or dead animals or items from their environment (cages,
toys, dishes), wear gloves made of rubber, latex, or other waterproof
material. Commercially available dishwashing gloves that have no tears are
adequate.
Remember to wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap or an
alcohol hand gel after removing your gloves and after every contact with
the sick animal or its environment. If your hamster dies, you should
double-bag it and dispose of it in the garbage or bury it deep enough (1
metre) that it will not be dug up by other animals.
The cage and animal accessories should be washed in hot soapy water using
any commercially available household disinfectant. Rinse the cage in a 10
per cent bleach solution (one part household bleach, 9 parts water). Let
the cage air dry for at least 10 minutes. A 70 per cent solution of alcohol
can then be used to further clean the area and reduce the corrosive action
of the bleach. Consult your pet store before using the cage for another
animal. [Consulting your veterinarian prior to using the cage may be a more
informed approach. Pet stores may not be aware of which animals may
contract tularemia, if you use the cage for some other type of animal. -

Equipment, including cages and toys, can be disposed of in regular
household waste. All the items should be cleaned using the procedure
described above before disposal. When handling litter, if possible, wear a
mask. Wrap contaminated litter in plastic prior to disposal. Do not attempt
to disinfect the litter. After handling animals, or after being licked or
bitten by a household pet, be sure to always wash your hands thoroughly
with warm water and soap or an alcohol gel. The same should be done after
handling pet toys or cleaning bowls or cages used by animals. Hand washing
is the best way to prevent the spread of disease.

["Pocket pets," which also include small animals such as hamsters, gerbils,
rats, mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits, are also means of transmission of
diseases to other animals. Cats and prairie dogs are sensitive to tularemia.
_Francisella tularensis_, the causative agent of tularemia, is an
intercellular bacterial pathogen that can affect a wide range of animals
including small mammals, birds, and humans. The organism is spread to
people from insect bites, direct contact from skinning a wild rabbit, or by
eating improperly cooked meat. Incidence of the disease follows a bimodal
cycle, with higher numbers of humans infected in July due to ticks and in
December due to the hunting season. Inhalation exposure can occur if large
numbers of the organism are aerosolized in a confined space.
Clinical signs in animals include high fever, weight loss, and possibly
death. - Mod.TG
_F. tularensis_ can be divided into two clinically significant subspecies,
F. tularensis tularensis (also known as type A or subspecies nearctica) and
F. tularensis holarctica (also known as type B or subspecies
palaearctica). Other much less clinically relevant subspecies are also
described.
Type A appears to be the most prominent type in North America, primarily
endemic in rabbits, and was involved in the Martha's Vineyard pneumonic
tularemia outbreaks. The infectious dose to produce infection in humans to
cause moderately severe disease is as few as 50 bacilli and it is lethal to
guinea pigs and rabbits.
Type B is found in Europe and Asia but also in North America. The
reservoirs include rodents, voles, muskrats and beavers. An infectious
dose of 12 000 bacilli is much more likely to produce only mild,
self-limited disease in humans. It is not lethal in rabbits and guinea
pigs. - Mod.LL]
