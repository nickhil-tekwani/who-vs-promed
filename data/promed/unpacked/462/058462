Chinese swine herds. Virol J. 2010; 7: 333 doi:10.1186/1743-422X-7-333]

----------------------------------------------------------
To determine whether the novel porcine parvovirus type 4 (PPV4) recently
reported in America is prevalent in China, a set of specific primers was
designed and used for molecular survey of PPV4 among the clinical samples
collected from various provinces of China between 2006 and 2010. The
results showed that PPV4 is present in Chinese swine herds at a rate of
2.09 per cent (12/573) among the clinical samples examined and 0.76 per
cent (1/132) among the samples taken from healthy animals.

We also noted that PPV4 was not detected in samples taken prior to 2009.
Analysis of the coding sequences showed that the Chinese and American PPV4
genome sequences are closely related with greater than 99 per cent
nucleotide sequence identity.

Similar to a previous study, viral genomes in head-to-tail configuration of
various lengths of the non-coding region were detected. Our findings
confirmed that PPV4 is a unique recently discovered virus in pigs.

Phylogenetically, PPV4 is most closely related to bovine parvovirus 2
(BPV2, which is not a _Bocavirus_ and is not assigned to any _Parvovirinae_
genus) and shares limited ORF1 (33.6 per cent) and ORF2 (24.5 per cent)
amino acid identity. With respect to genome structure and organization,
PPV4 encodes an ORF3 in the middle of the viral genome that resembles the
_Bocavirus_ genus.

However, the PPV4 ORF3 encoded protein shares minimal amino acid identity
with the ORF3 encoded proteins of the _Bocavirus_ genus.

[The full article is available at
<http://www.virologyj.com/content/pdf/1743-422X-7-333.pdf>. The paper
includes the following conclusions:

"In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that PPV4 existed in
some breeding pig farms in China, probably since 2009. Phylogenetically,
the Chinese and American PPV4s are closely related and cluster in the same
clade. They share greater than 99 per cent nucleotide sequence identity in
all 3 ORFs [open reading frames]. The American PPV4 was first identified
among swine suffering from an acute onset disease of high mortality in
North Carolina, USA during late 2005. Examination of the farm records
showed that the 2 PPV4-positive Chinese farms had purchased swine from a
common source in North Carolina prior to the discovery of PPV4. Since the
Chinese and American PPV4s are very similar with respect to nucleotide
sequence and deletions in the non-coding region, it is possible that PPV4
was introduced into China through the importation of PPV4-infected pigs
from the US.

"The fact that PPV4 was detected in diseased animals with other
co-infecting viruses, further investigations are needed to determine the
pathogenic capability of PPV4 and surveillance studies are needed to
determine whether PPV4 could spread and become a serious emerging swine
pathogen."

The following background information has been derived from The Merck
Veterinary Manual
(<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/110309.htm&word=porcine%2cparvovirus>):

Porcine parvovirus is ubiquitous in pigs in the USA and most of the world.
Almost all females are naturally infected before their 2nd pregnancy, and
immunity is lifelong. Consequently, it is a disease of 1st parity pigs.
Fetal infection before 70 days of gestation can result in death of the
fetus. Not all fetuses are infected at the same time, and death at
different stages of pregnancy is typical. Some fetuses survive and are born
alive but persistently infected. Most fetuses infected after 70 days of
gestation mount an immune response, clear the virus, and are healthy at
birth. Infected litters are carried to term. Litters with dead fetuses of
varying sizes, including mummified fetuses, along with stillborn and
healthy pigs born to 1st parity sows are the hallmark of porcine
parvovirus. Diagnosis is by fluorescent antibody testing, virus isolation
using lung from mummified fetuses, or demonstration of precolostral
antibody in stillborn pigs. Boars shed virus by varying routes, including
semen, for a couple of weeks after acute infection and can introduce the
virus into a herd. Effective inactivated vaccines are available. - Mod.AS
