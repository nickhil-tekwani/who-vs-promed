[1] Vaccine effectiveness against asymptomatic infection
Date: 29 Mar 2021
Source: Washington Post [abridged, edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/29/vaccine-effective-essential-workers-study/


The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines being deployed to fight the coronavirus pandemic are robustly effective in preventing infections in real-life conditions, according to a federal study released Mon 29 Mar 2021 that provides reassurance of protection for front-line workers in the United States.

In a study of about 4000 health-care personnel, police, firefighters and other essential workers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the vaccines reduced the risk of infection by 80 percent after one shot. Protection increased to 90 percent following the 2nd dose. The findings are consistent with clinical trial results and studies showing strong effectiveness in Israel and the United Kingdom and in initial studies of health-care workers at the UT Southwestern Medical Center and in Southern California.

The CDC report is significant, experts said, because it analyzed how well the vaccines worked among a diverse group of front-line working-age adults whose jobs make them more likely to be exposed to the virus and to spread it.

The workers came from 8 locations in 6 states: Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Oregon, Texas and Utah. They received vaccinations between mid-December 2020, when the doses 1st doses became available, to mid-March 2021, a 13-week period that included the deadly winter surge that was killing more than 3000 people a day by January 2021. The study is also one of the 1st to estimate vaccine effectiveness among participants against infection -- rather than just monitoring for symptomatic cases -- including infections that did not result in symptoms, according to the CDC.

Among 2479 fully vaccinated people, just 3 had confirmed infections. Among 477 people who received one dose, 8 infections were reported.

By comparison, among 994 people who were not vaccinated, 161 developed infections.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the study shows that national vaccination efforts are working.

The authorized coronavirus vaccines "provided early, substantial, real-world protection against infection for our nation's healthcare personnel, 1st responders, and other frontline essential workers," she said in a statement. "These findings should offer hope to the millions of Americans receiving coronavirus vaccines each day and to those who will have the opportunity to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated in the weeks ahead. The authorized vaccines are the key tool that will help bring an end to this devastating pandemic."

The study is ongoing, and researchers will share more details on the infections in people who were partly or fully vaccinated, known as "breakthrough infections." Researchers are also studying whether people who became infected despite vaccination may have less severe or briefer illnesses and whether they shed a lower amount of virus for less time.

Infectious disease and vaccine experts said the latest data prove encouraging.

"It's not surprising, but it's incredibly reassuring," said Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who helps review vaccine safety and efficacy as an outside adviser to the Food and Drug Administration and was not involved in the CDC study. "It's yet another reason to get vaccinated."

The drug companies' clinical trials of their coronavirus vaccines in 2020 were conducted when the United States was not experiencing the largest surges in Covid-19 cases, said Monica Gandhi, an infectious-diseases expert at the University of California at San Francisco.

"What we really want to do is test these vaccines in the real world to see how well they work," said Gandhi, who was not involved in the CDC study. That study took place during "one of the scariest, most horrible surges" in the United States, she said, describing it as an important stress test for the vaccines. The results, she said, show how "it's really incredible news for how safe you can feel after vaccination."

The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which require 2 doses, were more than 90 percent effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 disease in clinical trials conducted before the vaccines received emergency use authorization in December 2020 from the FDA. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires special handling and must be kept at especially cold temperatures in special freezers long-term.

"There was no guarantee that the vaccines were going to perform the same in the real world, where there were a lot of concerns about freezers and temperatures," said Mark G. Thompson, a CDC epidemiologist and lead author of the report. The clinical trials had large numbers of older people, but the CDC study focused more on working-age adults and the ability of the vaccines to protect against infection, regardless of whether symptoms developed.

"The big takeaway here is that starting 14 days after receiving both doses of these vaccines, these front-line workers were 90 percent less likely to be infected with the virus that causes Covid-19," Thompson said.

Reducing risk for transmissible infection, which can occur several days before symptoms appear, is especially important for health-care personnel and other essential workers who may not know they are infected, he said.

About 72 percent of the participants were 18 to 49 years old, and the majority were female. Most participants were White and healthy, with no chronic medical conditions. About half were health-care providers; 21 percent were firefighters, police and emergency medical technicians; nearly 1/4th were teachers, delivery workers, and other essential personnel whose jobs required contact within 3 feet of the public or co-workers.

About 63 percent of participants received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and 30 percent received the Moderna shot. Five people received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Researchers are trying to verify what vaccine was administered among the remaining participants. Most got their 1st dose during the last 2 weeks of December 2020.

Participants conducted nasal swabs weekly for 13 weeks, regardless of whether they experienced symptoms. If they showed symptoms of Covid-19-like illness, such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or change in smell or taste, they collected an additional nasal swab and saliva sample. All specimens were sent to one lab in Marshfield, Wisconsin.

Thompson said the study was by far the most complicated and ambitious to design in his more than 30 years of conducting field research. It was challenging to recruit thousands of participants from a variety of backgrounds in the context of widespread skepticism and lack of trust in science and research, he said. Researchers had never asked people to collect their own nasal swabs and ship saliva specimens, and it was unclear at the start whether busy adults working in front-line jobs would consistently respond to those tasks.

"But participants have been very dedicated, and, so far on average, 80 to 100 percent of participants complete these tasks every week," Thompson wrote in an email.

The CDC had to negotiate with FedEx and UPS to allow thousands of specimens to be shipped for testing, he said.

The study did not provide an estimate of the vaccines' benefits against the virus variants circulating in the United States. Thompson, who is leading CDC's evaluation of coronavirus vaccine effectiveness, said the agency will have more to say in about a month when scientists have completed genetic characterization of the collected virus specimens.

As the study progresses, scientists will also analyze the effectiveness of the specific coronavirus vaccines, and their effectiveness in preventing symptomatic infections or severe outcomes, such as hospitalization.

Despite the strong protection afforded by the vaccines 2 weeks after the 1st dose, scientists are still trying to figure out how long someone is protected against the disease after being fully vaccinated and whether 2 doses provide longer-lasting protection than one dose.

Limitations of the study include the small number of confirmed infections and self-collection of specimens and delays in shipments to the lab that could reduce detection of the virus and result in overestimating vaccine effectiveness.

[These are extremely important results. The vaccine clinical trials clearly showed efficacy against symptomatic COVID, but largely didn't assess whether asymptomatic infection was also prevented. If not, vaccinated individuals could still play a role in spreading infection, since asymptomatic spread is a major factor in the spread of COVID. This study, though with limitations mentioned in the article, demonstrates 90% effectiveness in preventing even asymptomatic infection as detected by PCR. 80% protection was afforded 2 weeks after the 1st dose.

The full study is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7013e3:

Thompson MG, Burgess JL, Naleway AL, et al. Interim Estimates of Vaccine Effectiveness of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Health Care Personnel, First Responders, and Other Essential and Frontline Workers -- Eight U.S. Locations, December 2020-March 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 29 Mar 2021.

Here is the discussion from the report:

"Prospective cohorts of health care personnel, 1st responders, and other essential and frontline workers over 13 weeks in 8 U.S. locations confirmed that authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 and Moderna's mRNA-1273) are highly effective in real-world conditions. Vaccine effectiveness of full immunization with 2 doses of mRNA vaccines was 90% (95% CI = 68%-97%) against RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are consistent with those from the mRNA vaccines' Phase III trials (1,2) and recent observational studies of the mRNA vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 (3). The findings complement and expand upon these preceding reports by demonstrating that the vaccines can also reduce the risk for infection regardless of COVID-19-associated illness symptom status (4,5). Reducing the risk for transmissible infection, which can occur among persons with asymptomatic infection or among persons several days before symptoms onset (6), is especially important among healthcare personnel, 1st responders, and other essential and frontline workers given their potential to transmit the virus through frequent close contact with patients and the public.

Partial immunization (around 14 days after 1st dose but before 2nd dose) provided preventive benefits with vaccine effectiveness of 80%. This finding is similar to an analysis of Phase III trial results (1,2,7) and 2 other recent estimates of vaccine effectiveness for partial immunization with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine among health care personnel, including a vaccine effectiveness (around 21 days after 1st dose) of 72% (95% CI = 58%-86%) against PCR-confirmed infection identified by routine testing in the United Kingdom (4) and a vaccine effectiveness (over 14 days after 1st dose) of 60% (95% CI = 38%-74%) against PCR-confirmed infection identified by records review in Israel (5). This finding is also consistent with early descriptive findings of SARS-CoV-2 employee and clinical testing results by mRNA vaccination status in the United States (8,9).

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. 1st, vaccine effectiveness point estimates should be interpreted with caution, given the moderately wide CIs attributable in part to the limited number of postimmunization PCR-confirmed infections observed. 2nd, this also precluded making product-specific vaccine effectiveness estimates and limited the ability to adjust for potential confounders; however, effects were largely unchanged when study site was included in an adjusted vaccine effectiveness model and when adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, and occupation separately in sensitivity analyses. Finally, self-collection of specimens and delays in shipments could reduce sensitivity of virus detection by PCR (10); if this disproportionately affected those who received the vaccine (e.g., because of possible vaccine attenuation of virus shedding), vaccine effectiveness would be overestimated.

The scientific rigor of these findings is enhanced by prospective design and the participants' very high adherence to weekly specimen collection. As the study progresses, viruses will be genetically characterized to examine the viral features of breakthrough infections. Given that there is uncertainty related to the number of days required to develop immunity postvaccination (3-5,7), future research examining vaccine effectiveness at different intervals is warranted.

These interim vaccine effectiveness findings for both Pfizer-BioNTech's and Moderna's mRNA vaccines in real-world conditions complement and expand upon the vaccine effectiveness estimates from other recent studies (3-5) and demonstrate that current vaccination efforts are resulting in substantial preventive benefits among working-age adults. They reinforce CDC's recommendation of full 2-dose immunization with mRNA vaccines. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all eligible persons, which currently varies by location in the United States."

[2a] Death Rates

https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/death-rate-from-covid-19-variants-60-per-cent-higher-epidemiologist-1.5363953


The spread of coronavirus variants in Ontario has caused hospital and intensive care admissions to double, and has driven the risk of death up by about 60%, says a member of Ontario's COVID-19 Science Advisory Table.

"It's roughly a 60% increase in hospital admissions associated with new variants, it's roughly a doubling of ICU admissions, and it's roughly 60% [of] deaths associated with variants," Peter Juni, who is also a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Toronto, told CTV News Channel. "That's what we're seeing."

Those numbers align with figures coming out of United Kingdom and Denmark, said Juni, which both have been hit by the fast-spreading B.1.1.7 variant. A Danish study released in February [2021] showed people infected with the variant were hospitalized at a rate 64% higher than other variants.

"What Ontario sees right now is entirely consistent with international experience," Juni said.

B.I.I.7 is now believed to be the dominant strain of COVID-19 in Ontario, which reported an additional 2169 cases on [Fri 26 Mar 2021] and a 7-day rolling average of 1855, up from 1480 the previous week. The province has also seen a rise in hospitalizations.

According to CTVNews.Ca's COVID-19 case tracking data, Canada has reported 22 809 COVID-19 deaths out of 954 700 total cases to date.

The rise of the deadlier variant comes as Canadians are increasingly dealing with the stress of a full year of pandemic vigilance. The pace of vaccinations, meanwhile, has frustrated many Canadians, with just 13% of the population having received at least one dose to date, a figure that lags many other countries.

Juni stressed the need to maintain proper distancing and masking measures until the vaccine can be distributed more widely.

"It's important now that we let go of the notion that the vaccines will just, you know, save us now," he said. "We did the right thing a year ago. Right now, we can also start to leverage the good weather, and go out, but be safe outside. It means we need to distance."

Canada is set to receive large shipments of vaccines next week, including 1.5 million AstraZeneca doses from a dose-sharing deal with the United States and 1.2 million doses from Pfizer-BioNTech. But Juni said the public must continue to be vigilant about their behavior.

"If every single resident of the province does this for several weeks, we'll get this thing under control. The problem is people let it slip," he said.

[2b] Tracking variants of the novel coronavirus in Canada
Date: Fri 26 Mar 2021

As COVID-19 continues to spread, several new variants of the novel coronavirus have emerged.

There are currently 3 new strains of the virus that have been identified: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.

COVID variant cases in Canada

B1.1.7: 7152
B.1.351: 266
P.1: 263

COVID variant cases by province (updated 26 Mar 2021)

Province: B.1.1.7 / B.1.351 / P.1
Alberta: 2601 / 20 / 5
British Columbia: 1666 / 47 / 199
Ontario: 1494 / 60 / 58
Quebec: 594 / 107 / 1
Saskatchewan: 465 / 8 / 0
Newfoundland & Labrador: 178 / 0 / 0
Manitoba: 109 / 14 / 0
New Brunswick: 28 / 0 / 0
Nova Scotia: 13 /10 / 0
Prince Edward Island: 4 / 0 / 0
Yukon: 0 / 0 / 0
Nunavut: 0 / 0 / 0
Northwest Territories: 0 / 0 / 0

Note: Health Canada has identified 3 variants of concern, which CTVNews.ca is tracking on a daily basis. In addition to these 3 variants, the province of British Columbia has also identified 2 confirmed cases of the B1.525 variant, 1st identified in Nigeria, which isn't currently reflected in our data.

Our data also currently reflects only laboratory-confirmed cases of variants of concern. While public health officials have linked the St. John's outbreak to the B.1.1.7 variant, this chart shows only the portion of those test samples that have undergone genetic sequencing. Read more about the testing and publishing process here [link on the URL].

The virus has spikes on its surface that helps it attach onto human cells. Scientists say that these new variants of the virus have changes in their spikes, which can cause them to interact with the human body differently than the original virus.

B.1.1.7 1st emerged in the U.K. in September 2020. Doctors say that this variant spreads faster than others, and could be transmitted in less time than the original strain.

The B.1.1.7 variant is the most prominent in Canada, with hundreds of cases having been identified. Ontario has seen the most number of cases, where an outbreak involving this variant at a long-term care home has resulted in all residents but one contracting the virus and more than 100 positive cases amongst staff.

The B.1.351 variant was 1st discovered in South Africa in December 2020. Scientists say that this variant is more efficient than others in targeting healthy cells.

P.1 was first identified in December 2020 when this variant caused one of the deadliest outbreaks in Manaus, Brazil. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, contracting this variant could affect the ability of antibodies developed from previous infections and vaccinations. Canada reported its 1st case of this variant on [7 Feb 2021].

Public Health Ontario issued in their epidemiologic summaries that variant tracking data may change as they continue to analyze cases:

Caution should be taken when interpreting [variants of concern] data due to the nature of the screening and confirmation process, including delays between specimen collection and whole genome sequencing.

Data corrections or updates can result in case records being removed and/or updated and may result in totals different from past publicly reported case counts.

Backstory:

Data is collected from official provincial sources, including live press conferences. Not all provinces currently publish updates online.

[3] Common cold vs COVID19
Date: Tue 23 Mar 2021
Source: BBC [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56483445


Some viruses are known to compete in order to be the one that causes an infection. And University of Glasgow scientists say it appears cold-causing rhinovirus trumps coronavirus. The benefits might be short-lived but rhinovirus is so widespread, they add, it could still help to suppress Covid.

Think of the cells in your nose, throat and lungs as being like a row of houses. Once a virus gets inside, it can either hold the door open to let in other viruses, or it can nail the door shut and keep its new home to itself. Influenza is one of the most selfish viruses around, and nearly always infects alone. Others, such as adenoviruses, seem to be more up for a houseshare.

There has been much speculation about how the virus that causes Covid, known as Sars-CoV-2, would fit into the mysterious world of "virus-virus interactions".

The challenge for scientists is that a year of social distancing has slowed the spread of all viruses and made it much harder to study.

The team at the Centre for Virus Research in Glasgow used a replica of the lining of our airways, made out of the same types of cells, and infected it with Sars-CoV-2 and rhinovirus, which is one of the most widespread infections in people, and a cause of the common cold.

If rhinovirus and Sars-CoV-2 were released at the same time, only rhinovirus is successful. If rhinovirus had a 24-hour head start then Sars-CoV-2 does not get a look in. And even when Sars-CoV-2 had 24-hours to get started, rhinovirus boots it out.
"Sars-CoV-2 never takes off, it is heavily inhibited by rhinovirus," Dr. Pablo Murcia told BBC News. He added: "This is absolutely exciting because if you have a high prevalence of rhinovirus, it could stop new Sars-CoV-2 infections."

Similar effects have been seen before. A large rhinovirus outbreak may have delayed the 2009 swine flu pandemic in parts of Europe.

Further experiments showed rhinovirus was triggering an immune response inside the infected cells, which blocked the ability of Sars-CoV-2 to make copies of itself.

When scientists blocked the immune response, then levels of the Covid virus were the same as if rhinovirus was not there.

However, Covid would be able to cause an infection again once the cold had passed and the immune response calmed down.

Dr. Murcia said: "Vaccination, plus hygiene measures, plus the interactions between viruses could lower the incidence of Sars-CoV-2 heavily, but the maximum effect will come from vaccination."

Prof Lawrence Young, of Warwick Medical School, said human rhinoviruses, the most frequent cause of the common cold, were "highly transmissible". He added that this study suggests "that this common infection could impact the burden of Covid-19 and influence the spread of SarsCoV2, particularly over the autumn and winter months when seasonal colds are more frequent".

Exactly how all this settles down in future winters is still unknown. Coronavirus is likely to still be around, and all the other infections that have been suppressed during the pandemic could bounce back as immunity to them wanes.

Dr. Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, has already warned of a "hard winter" as a result. "We could see surges in flu. We could see surges in other respiratory viruses and other respiratory pathogens," she said,

Abstract
"Virus-virus interactions influence the epidemiology of respiratory infections. However, the impact of viruses causing upper respiratory infections on SARS-CoV-2 replication and transmission is currently unknown. Human rhinoviruses cause the common cold and are the most prevalent respiratory viruses of humans. Interactions between rhinoviruses and co-circulating respiratory viruses have been shown to shape virus epidemiology at the individual host and population level. Here, we examined the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in the human respiratory epithelium in the presence or absence of rhinovirus. We show that human rhinovirus triggers an interferon response that blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication. Mathematical simulations show that this virus-virus interaction is likely to have a population-wide effect as an increasing prevalence of rhinovirus will reduce the number of new COVID-19 cases." - Mod.LK]
