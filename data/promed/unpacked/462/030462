A possible epidemic that causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea in young
children has been reported in a village in the province of Mariscal
Caceres, in the region San Martin.

Over 100 similar cases have occurred among the population of the
Bagazan area in the Sapuena district capital, which has caused
concern from health authorities.

Provincial Health Directorate has initiated research to determine
which organism is causing the symptoms in the child population in
that part of the country.

The increase of cases of diarrhea has worried the authorities of the
Ministry of Public Health and Asistencia Social (MSPAS). From 1 Jan
2010 to [21 Apr 2010], 28 deaths by this cause have been registered.
Of the total deaths, 16 were reported in the National Hospital of Children.

The majority of the mortal victims were female. "There is an original
patient from Honduras; the rest are Salvadorian. These deaths come
from 10 of the 14 departments," said the Vice-minister of Sectorial
Policies of Health, Eduardo Espinoza. According to the report of
Health, 58 percent of all the deaths by diarrhea are concentrated in
3 departments: San Salvador, Santa Ana and the Freedom.

[Deaths from diarrheal diseases in small children often relate to
fluid and electrolyte abnormalities caused by the disease, which, in
the presence of available medical care, can be ameliorated. - Mod.LL]

[3] Shigellosis - USA (Kentucky)

Kentucky health officials in 3 counties are attempting to battle an
outbreak of shigellosis that has continued for several weeks, but
despite their efforts, the disease continues to spread.

The outbreak, 1st reported at the beginning of May 2010, has more
than doubled in size every week, according to weekly updates from
local news media. There are now a reported 30 cases in Daviess
County; additional cases have been confirmed in Meade and Hardin counties.

Most of those sickened by the outbreak are children under 13.
Shigellosis is a highly contagious disease caused by a bacterial
infection and is spread mainly through food and drink contamination.
Day care workers say the disease is especially common among young
children who routinely put things in their mouths and don't wash their hands.

In response, health officials are urging residents to constantly wash
their hands. Day care workers are also urging kids to wash their
hands and warning parents about the possible symptoms and precautions
associated with a shigellosis outbreak.

[The species of _Shigella_ in the outbreak is not stated. Indeed,
because this infection spreads more readily than salmonellosis with a
low inoculum, it is easier to transmit in day care and school
settings. - Mod.LL]
