Dengue fever has been blamed for the deaths of two people and another 452
have become ill in the Cordillera since July 14; numbers of cases appear to
be increasing. The fatalities are from Mankayan town in Benguet and Lagawe
town in Ifugao.
Health officials said they have sent doctors and medicines to
dengue-stricken towns to reinforce medical personnel in treating patients
and to conduct an information drive to stop the spread of disease.
Bengwayan said 177 cases with one death were reported in Ifugao, 109 cases
with one death in Benguet, 54 cases in Mountain Province, 15 cases in
Kalinga, and 10 cases in Baguio City. Forty-eight victims were admitted in
different hospitals here. Health officials said nine cases came from
Pangasinan and Ilocos Sur. The regional health director has ordered a stop
to fumigation because "these only drive away the mosquitoes". [My quotes. -
