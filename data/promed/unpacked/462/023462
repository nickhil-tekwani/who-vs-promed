Re: Dengue/DHF update 2007 (43) 20071105.3600
---------------------------------------------
The official dengue count [in the Cayman Islands] is now 5 cases (4
from Jamaica, one from Nicaragua). These figures have been released
by the Public Health Department. MRCU's [Mosquito Research & Control
Unit] unofficial testing by RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction] has shown 5 positive samples of [dengue virus]
serotype 2 from Jamaica and a serotype 4 from Nicaragua. [The] 24
other samples have all tested negative by PCR. Because we are not an
official diagnostic lab we are unable to release these figures. [Dr.
Wheeler later authorized the report of these figures. - Mod.TY]

I am still concerned about the conclusion that there is any evidence
of local transmission given that in every confirmed case there is
evidence of recent (less than 7 days) travel to a dengue endemic
country. All the "suspected cases" of local transmission have tested
negative by PCR and IgM ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.]
The hospital is awaiting the results of the convalescent sample to
confirm they are IgG negative. Given the results we have I would
conclude that as yet there is no evidence of local transmission. MRCU
control operations are maintaining _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes
albopictus_ populations at relatively low levels and I am hoping that
we can maintain Cayman free from local dengue transmission.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Wheeler for his prompt response correcting
the speculation that dengue virus was being transmitted on the Cayman
Islands. One hopes that their efforts to keep mosquito vector
populations at low levels are successful in preventing local
transmission of dengue viruses there.

The deaths of 4 people in a Jamaican parish have been attributed to
dengue fever.

Chief medical officer for the parish of St Elizabeth, Dr Derrick
Ledford, was quoted by RJR News as making the claim at a meeting of
the Parish Council Thursday morning [8 Nov 2007]. Ledford added that
through there were 50 reports claiming to be dengue fever related;
only 4 autopsies have actually confirmed the victims were killed from
the disease.

Jamaica joins Martinique in reporting recent dengue fever deaths.

Some 14 people have died and more than 26 500 have been affected by
dengue in Honduras so far this year [2007].

The most recent victim is a girl who died this weekend [3-4 Nov 2007]
in the state hospital of San Pedro Sula, about 180 km (112 mi) north
of Tegucigalpa [the capital. - Mod.TY]

Up to October 2007, 26 539 classic dengue [fever] cases and 1503 DHF
[dengue hemorrhagic fever] cases have been registered in the country,
according to information from the Secretariat of Health.

DHF caused the deaths of 6 people in 2006, with 7800 Hondurans
affected [by dengue virus infections].

This situation has occurred despite teams from the army and civil
service employees who have gone through the main neighborhoods of the
country to remove trash, fumigate houses, and destroy breeding sites
of the dengue vector mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_.

The government has constantly asked the population to eliminate water
catchments in their homes, specifically bowls, bottles, and tires,
where this insect proliferates. The mosquito reproduces in fresh
water puddles left by the tropical downpours during the rainy season
in Honduras.

Official statistics indicate that in 6 years more than 60 000 dengue
cases have been registered in Honduras.

Costa Rican health authorities warned on Friday [9 Nov 2007] that
they are deeply concerned over the increase of cases of hemorrhagic
dengue in the country, with 288 people infected and 7 deaths reported
since January [2007].

Official figures revealed the number of cases have increased by 300
percent over that reported in 2006, when only 72 people had the
hemorrhagic type.

A total of 24 000 cases of classic dengue have been reported, with
children as the most affected, and probabilities that babies will be
born infected, thus increasing infant mortality risks.

In a recent report the Health Ministry informed that the provinces of
Guanacaste, Puntarenas [both on the Pacific coast], and Limon
[Caribbean coast - Mod.TY] bear 98.6 percent of all serious cases.

The report indicates the number of patients with classic dengue
decreased 35 percent, but the hemorrhagic type shows an alarming rise.

[As many as] 300 Paraguayans might get dengue hemorrhagic fever
[because of] the threat of a new epidemic in Paraguay, said sanitary
authorities in this South American country Friday [9 Nov 2007].

The Public Health Ministry Surveillance director, Gualberto Pinanez,
said more than 28 000 sick people with classic dengue fever and 54
with hemorrhagic fever have been reported, which might be worse with
the arrival of high temperatures.

The number of cases has not increased rapidly but Pinanez called the
population to contribute in the struggle to eliminate mosquito nests
to avoid propagation.

Hundreds of Paraguayans could die if it is not possible to stop the
extension of the disease, the official said after specifying that the
biggest incidence of cases takes place in the departments of Asuncion
and Central, both with high index of larvae infestation.

Meanwhile, environmental brigades, integrated by public officials and
sanitary specialists, carry out raking works [prioritization? -
Mod.TY] and elimination of foci of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in
the area of the capital.

The objective is to stop a turnaround of the disease and make the
population aware about the importance of its participation in the
prevention tasks Hugo Quintana, director of the mentioned sanitary
region, emphasized.

The National Institute of Health (NIH) has diagnosed 9 cases positive
for the dengue virus out of the 55 referred to it by the Islamabad
hospitals over the past few months, said NIH Chief Executive General
(r) Masood Anwar. He said that of these 9 cases, 2 patients had been
admitted at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), 2 at
the Polyclinic, 2 at the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL) Hospital,
and 3 at Shifa International Hospital. He said the hospitals sent the
NIH blood samples of the patients suspected of suffering from the
disease where the Institute tested the samples and informed them
about the results. "We know which hospital is sending in how many
samples for pathological tests and nothing more than that," he said
when asked the names of the patients suffering from dengue fever.

He informed Daily Times that 9 cases of dengue fever had been
confirmed at different hospitals in Rawalpindi. He further said that
so far out of the 105 cases suspected in [Punjab], 90 had tested
positive whereas of the 2100 suspected cases in Sindh, 720 were
positive. There have been only 30 possible dengue cases reported in
the NWFP [Northwest Frontier Province], of which 15 cases are
positive, whereas there is no dengue case reported from Balochistan.
When contacted, all the concerned hospitals, however, denied that any
patient admitted therein had been diagnosed with the dengue virus
[infection]. A PIMS spokesperson said the hospital had yet to
received any report from the NIH about the samples sent there.
