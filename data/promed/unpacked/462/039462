This was cross-posted from FMD News. The original text was:

Subject: FMD News: Russian Federation, FMD outbreak on Mongolian border
COUNTRY & DATE: Russian Federation, 11 Aug 2006
TYPE: Unofficial
ISSUE: FMD suspected on the Russian-Mongolian border
SUMMARY: There is an outbreak of FMD reported on the
Russian-Mongolian border. In Buryatiya, on separate farms, more than
30 percent of cattle are sick. (We gratefully acknowledge Yusup
Adzhiev for directing us to this news item.)

But Natalia Pshenichnaya, ProMED-RUS Associate Moderator, writes:
There is no outbreak of FMD in Russia (Buryatia) at present. The FMD
News above is based upon a wrong translation or editing of the
original Russian text at
<http://novosibirsk.rfn.ru/rnews.html?id=20705&cid=8>.
The correct translation is:
"Multiple cases of leucosis in cattle have been recorded in Buryatia
[Russia]. On separate farms, more than 30 percent of cattle are sick
[with leucosis]. And outbreaks of FMD have been recorded in adjoining
Mongolia" [but see below - Mod.JW].
This information has been confirmed from other Russian sources:
<http://www.regnum.ru/news/686240.html>
and the Russian News Agency Annews.ru, 9 Aug 2006
<http://www.annews.ru/news/detail.php?ID=6570>,
reported as follows: "Outbreaks of FMD have been recorded in
Mongolia in 2001, 2002 and 2004. The threat of introduction of FMD
virus from Mongolia [into Buryatiya] is a constant threat." [end quote]
Obviously, this does NOT imply that an outbreak of FMD in Mongolia is
occurring now. - Mod.NP
[It now appears from the original Russian text that there is
currently no FMD outbreak in Russia, including Buryatiya. Apparently,
the report dealt with the current animal disease situation in
Buryatiya, mentioning several diseases, including enzootic bovine
leucosis, and brucellosis. FMD was mentioned as a potential threat,
due to its repeated occurrence in neighboring Mongolia. Indeed,
according to OIE's Handistatus epidemiological data, FMD has been
reported in Mongolia in the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004. During
2005, Mongolia reported outbreaks of FMD serotype Asia 1 in bovines,
ovines and caprines, and vaccination against this serotype was
applied. The last notification was sent to the OIE on 19 Oct 2005; see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_48.HTM#Sec8>. ProMED reported
a cow had died of type "O" FMD near the capital of Mondolia in April
this year (2006) -- see ref. below.
This whole report would have been deleted had we known it dealt with
a potential threat and not with a suspected outbreak.
FMD News has posted a correction about Buryatiya, but says that their
reading of the Russian reports still leaves open the possibility of a
current outbreak in Mongolia. ProMED would appreciate further
information from our readers. - Mod.AS/JW].
