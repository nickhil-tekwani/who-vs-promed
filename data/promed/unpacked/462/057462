Q FEVER - USA (IOWA, ILLINOIS): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The infectious diseases division at the University of Iowa has seen 8
cases of Q fever in the last 6 months. The state health department
reports another 11 cases in 2006 alone (19 total). Given a total of 4
cases in the previous 3 years, this activity represents a significant
increase in incidence and/or reporting. Is anyone else seeing similar
numbers (or increases in numbers) of cases of Q fever?
The 8 patients live in southeast Iowa or northwest Illinois within an
area approximately 100 miles in diameter. Only 2 of the cases had an
apparent direct epidemiological link to one another. The cohort had
an age range of 41-71 yrs. Clinical presentations were prolonged
fever (>4-6 weeks) with mildly elevated transaminases in 7 cases; one
of these cases had significant cough early in the course of illness,
though he had no infiltrates on chest x-ray. The 8th patient
presented with acute hepatitis with very high transaminases and
fever, which resolved spontaneously. No patient had a history of
cardiac valvular disease, evidence for it on exam, or sonographic
evidence of endocarditis.
Seven patients had either detectable IgM and/or IgG to phase II
antigens or high overall (IgG+ IgM) titers to phase II antigens. The
other patient had a single IgG titer to phase II antigen of 1:256. 3
of the cases have had markedly elevated IgG titers to phase I antigen
(greater or equal to 1:1024). Two patients had liver biopsies; one
showed the classic donut granuloma. The other biopsy showed fatty
infiltration with an epithelioid granuloma and a lipogranuloma.
Two of the 8 had clear exposure histories to domesticated cattle,
goats, or horses. Four patients had more tenuous histories of animal
exposure. Another patient's illness closely followed his return from
a military tour in Afghanistan. Finally, 2 patients were coworkers
who had recently cleaned out some heavy equipment stored in a shed at
their workplace. No patients are known to have consumed unpasteurized
dairy products.
All but one of the 8 patients is currently on antimicrobial therapy.
A response to therapy (usually a combination of doxycycline and
either a quinolone or hydroxychloroquine) has taken a few weeks. One
patient presented after approximately 1 month of therapy with [for?]
erythema nodosum.
The cases show that the exposure to animals can seem trivial on
initial questioning, which may reflect the highly infectious nature
of the organism and its ready dissemination via aerosols. One notable
feature of the illnesses of many of these patients is the prolonged
fever and malaise in the setting of very high titers to phase I
antigens, as if the patients were/are in the process of converting to
chronic Q fever.
We are curious whether readers of the listserv have experience with
cases characterized by such high IgG titers to phase I antigen
relatively early in the disease (that is, less than 6 months
following onset and thus not fitting the arbitrary definition of
chronic disease).

[Q fever was first described in Australia: it was called "Query
fever" because the causative agent was initially unknown. _Coxiella
burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism
is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and highly
infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may
produce clinical illness. Indeed, in primates, the dose to kill 50
percent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).
Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals,
including other species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C.
burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals,
although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_
infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of
infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are
shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta.
Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission
(2).
The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for
long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C.
burnetii_ is associated with compact small-cell variants of the
organism that are produced during standard replication (along with
the less resistant large-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and
spore-like (3). The Q fever organism is a Category B bioterrorism
agent and, in fact, although not thought to be related to
bioterrorism, was spread by mail in a post office in the UK in 1987
(4).
Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms
from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried
placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd
animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very
few organisms may be required to cause infection.
Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and
inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of
transmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,
including tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.
An earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK was
tied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol
for at least 1/2 mile.
