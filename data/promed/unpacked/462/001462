The Bulgarian Food Safety Agency reported in a statement on Wednesday [3 Feb 2021] an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza.

The virus was detected in a farm with 99 000 laying hens in the town of Slavyanovo, some 190 km [118 mi] north east of Sofia, after mortality there has increased, the statement said. All measures have been taken immediately to eradicate the outbreak, it said.

The last outbreak of the disease in Bulgaria was registered in June 2020, the statement added.

[The causative agent is most likely the same HPAI H5N8 strain circulating throughout Europe since the start of the current winter season, introduced by migrating birds. This is yet to be lab confirmed and reported to the OIE. The previous event in Bulgaria, terminated in June 2020, was caused by HPAI H5N8.
