COMPUTER VIRUS ALERT
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

Computer Virus Alert!
---------------------
A new virus, dubbed "Melissa", can affect people who use Microsoft Word 97
(or Word 2000 with Outlook 97, 98 or 2000).
How to Identify Melissa:
-----------------------
Melissa is a Word 97/2000 macro virus delivered VIA EMAIL in an attached
Word document.
The email contains the subject line:
"Important Message From "UserName"
and/or contains in the message body:
"Here is that document you asked for ... don't show anyone else ;-)".
If the attached Word document is opened and the macro virus is allowed to
run, it can propagate itself by sending email with the infected document to
a number of recipients.
Simply reading the e-mail message WILL NOT activate the virus.
Opening the attached Word document WILL activate the virus.
The virus does not appear to cause any damage to a PCs memory or programs.
The danger is it's self-propagation property which has the potential to
overload email
systems.
How to Protect your PC:
----------------------
Verify that the macro virus protection feature in Word is turned on. (The
default is on.) To do this, in Word 97:
1. On the Tools menu, click Options.
2. On the General tab, check Macro Virus Protection.
With the macro virus protection turned on, every time you receive a Word
document that contains macros, a dialog box opens and allows you to choose
whether to enable the macros. Always choose "disable macros" when you are
not certain of a macroÂ´s purpose or functionality. By choosing to disable
the macros, you will prevent this and any macro virus from running,
rendering it harmless.
The virus is only activated if you open the attached
Word document and choose to enable the macros, or if your macro virus
protection settings have been turned off. (Most Word documents do not
contain macros.)
If You Receive Melissa:
----------------------
Please contact your Computer Systems Support group immediately.
Do not delete the email message. They will assist you with
removing the virus from your PC.
Other Virus Protection Measures:
-------------------------------
The Computer Systems Support group recommends the use of virus protection
software on your PC. Please contact if if you would like it installed on
your PC.
