[Lumpy skin disease (LSD) was detected for the 1st time in Saudi Arabia in April 2015. At that time 3 outbreaks were reported to the OIE.

For the 1st reported outbreak the infection actually started 5 Feb 2015 in cattle that were in Ash-Sharqiyah [Eastern province] in Tarout Island and Al-Hafouf on the mainland. However, the disease was confirmed on 8 Apr 2015 using real-time PCR -- all cases and some susceptible animals were destroyed. In addition to disinfecting the affected farms, vaccination was applied in all districts.

Al-Hafouf (also Al-hofuf, Hofof or Hufuf) is located on Saudi Arabia's mainland, within the Al-Ahsa Oasis (Eastern province), about 200 km [about 125 miles] from Tarout Island which is connected to the mainland by 2 causeways (http://tinyurl.com/jrxkwyg). Interestingly, the initial outbreak in 2015 involved both areas. See report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=17605.

The 2 later outbreaks situated in the same area were handled less aggressively -- both reportedly started 15 Jun 2015 and were declared as resolved 10 Jul 2015. In both, no mortalities were reported. On one (farm, Alhafuf) there were 2224 cases out of 31 723 susceptible animals of which 2518 were destroyed. On the other one (farm, Tarout) there were 567 cases out of 15 207 susceptible animals, of which only 47 were destroyed (=520 cases kept alive). Vaccination continued to be applied reaching a total of 72 958 vaccinated cattle within the entire ("all districts") Ash Sharqiyah province. See report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=18682.

The 2016 event reportedly started in Ash-Sharqiyah (Eastern) province close to the 2015 event. During May it spread further within the Eastern province (southwards, 400-500 km?) and north-westward into 2 other uninfected distant provinces -- Al Qasim and Ar Riad -- over 500 km [310 miles] from the index outbreak.

This 2016 index case is either a flare-up of residual 2015 infection (likely), or a new introduction of a more virulent strain (12 percent case fatality rate, compared to zero last year -- provided the information was accurate). Genotyping could hopefully provide an answer.

The situation in neighboring Bahrain, Qatar, and UAE will be of interest. All 3 countries imported cattle for slaughter, particularly given the Haj season. During 2015 Saudi Arabia imported around 10 million cattle, mostly from east Africa. - Mods.AS/CRD
