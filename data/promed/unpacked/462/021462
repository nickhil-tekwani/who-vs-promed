The Director of the Directorate of Agriculture, Bani Kinanah Department, Eng. Abdul Ilah Obeidat, denied that the vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) caused the death of livestock and abortions in goats owned by district's farmers.

Obeidat insisted that the vaccine is safe and has nothing to do with deaths, noting that dead animals [species and number not specified] have been examined and found affected by anthrax. According to him, no deaths have been recorded among the 36 000 sheep, goats and cattle which have been vaccinated, so far, with the FMD vaccine.

He explained that the [vaccination] campaign is continuing, aiming to reach a maximal number of vaccinated livestock in order to limit the spread of FMD, a disease which causes death of sheep and goats.

One of the farmers visited the district's administrator, complaining about abortion of several goats following their vaccination.

[Bani Kinanah Department is one of the 9 departments that constitute the Irbid Governorate of Jordan; see the map at https://tinyurl.com/2tjserdc. This area (bordering Syria on its north) and southern Golan (administered by Israel; on its northwest) was one of Jordan's departments affected by FMD during late 2021-early 2022.

From the above response of the regional authorities, it appears that there have been several mortalities due to anthrax in unspecified livestock. The complaint about abortion in goats remained to be explained. Notably, several pathogens of livestock endemic in Jordan are abortifacient, most prominently _Brucella melitensis_.

Information from a knowledgable source confirming, or otherwise, the anthrax cases, providing the cause of abortions, preferably specifying the species affected, as well as providing details of the safety tests of the FMD vaccine applied, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
