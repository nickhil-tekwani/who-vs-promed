[1] First fatal case

The Czech Republic confirmed on [Thu 27 Sept 2018] its 1st case of West Nile fever contracted domestically. It was first reported by local Nova television on [Thu 27 Sept 2018], and confirmed by later the same day by Czech deputy health minister Roman Prymula. The case was a 72 year old woman who also suffered from other serious chronic problems and died after contracting the virus in the Czech Republic.

Epidemiologists had already identified the virus in mosquitoes and horses in south Moravia in June [2018]. The 1st case occurred in early September [2018], when a Czech man returned from Greece in August [2018] was taken to the infection clinic of the Central Military Hospital (UVN) in Prague after suffering health troubles.

The Health Ministry spokeswoman Gabriela Stepanyova said that this is a logical development of the situation due to climate conditions and the distribution of the incidence of the West Nile fever. She said no case has been recorded in which West Nile virus has been transferred from one man to another. The relevant measures have been taken and the relevant authorities, such as the State Veterinary Administration, have been contacted.

West Nile fever is a viral infection typically spread by mosquitoes. The incubation period ranges from 3 to 14 days. The infection can lead to serious complications including meningitis and encephalitis. Serious infection can endanger patients' lives.

[2] Second case

A southern Czech hospital in Breclav has confirmed that a man in the hospital has contracted the West Nile fever, hospital spokeswoman Tana Svobodova said on [Mon 1 Oct 2018]. The patient has not stayed abroad recently, and is therefore believed to have contracted the disease in the Czech Republic. The 1st confirmed case of West Nile fever to be contracted in the country was a 72 year old woman who died in the same hospital.

Svobodova said the hospital's transfusion ward has suspended blood collection. She said the patient is staying at the contagious diseases ward, is in a stable condition, and doctors are considering releasing him to home care.

The hospital does not plan to invoke any special measures in connection with the disease. West Nile virus is transferred only by a certain mosquito species. Man-to-man transfer has so far not been proved, said Svobodova. Experts said the virus has been routinely found in mosquitoes, birds and horses in the Czech Republic of late, and that it was a question of time as to when someone would become infected.

[The 1st autochthonous human case of West Nile fever in the Czech Republic was reported from South Moravia in 1997. In 2013, another case of West Nile fever emerged in the Ostrava area [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279065961_West_Nile_virus_transmission_risk_in_the_Czech_Republic].

Between 2011 and 2013, 2349 serum samples collected from healthy unvaccinated adult horses were tested in the Czech Republic; 5 samples were positive for West Nile virus infection (and negative for tickborne encephalitis). The WNV-positive horses were from 5 different administrative regions and had not travelled outside the country (Sedlák K, Zelená H, Křivda V, Šatrán P. Surveillance of West Nile fever in horses in the Czech Republic from 2011 to 2013. Epidemiol Mikrobiol Imunol. 201; 63(4):307-11. [In Czech]). In early June 2018, Czech epidemiologists detected some mosquitoes infected with the deadly West Nile Fever virus in south Moravia region in _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes [http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/20/c_137265889.htm].

Currently, no vaccine against West Nile virus (WNV) infection is available. The best method to reduce the rates of WNV infection is mosquito control at the municipality level, ideally with the full engagement of the community, including business partners that specialise in mosquito control. Possible interventions include the reduction of mosquito populations by controlling the number of breeding sites such as standing pools of water (for example, old tyres, buckets, unused swimming pools). - Mod.UBA
