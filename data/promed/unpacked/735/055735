New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Foglo, Aland
Started: 24 May 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected: [Note: Quantitative data for affected animals was not provided. The disease was diagnosed in a Rainbow trout farm (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_). - Mod.CRD]

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: legal movement of animals

Epidemiological comments: The outbreak resulted from legal movement of live fish from a farm in another EU member state, which was reported IHN positive after the movement. The infected farm is under restrictions and will be emptied as soon as practically possible. The farm is only producing fish for slaughter and has not moved fish to any other farm in Finland or other countries. A 10-km [0.6 mile] restriction zone in accordance with EU legislation has been established around the outbreak, and all other farms in the restriction zone will be tested. The farm is located in a region of Finland (Aland) that is only producing fish for slaughter and cannot move fish to other parts of Finland, because of a different status for VHS.

Control measures at event level:
Domestic control measures applied: traceability; selective killing and disposal; surveillance within infected and/or protection zone; surveillance outside infected and/or protection zone; process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products; movement control inside the country.

Domestic control measures to be applied: zoning; selective killing and disposal; killing for commercial use or own use; disinfection.

[According to the Finnish Food Authority web site (last update 1 Jun 2021): "Infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) was diagnosed in rainbow trout at a fish farm in Aland Islands on [27 May 2021]. The infection came from Danish fish farms, from where fish were shipped for further growing in the Aland Islands this spring. The IHN infection was confirmed from samples submitted to the Finnish Food Authority. The Finnish Food Authority has set up a restricted zone around the site. Fish transfers are restricted in the area. IHN doesn't infect people.

"IHN was found at the Danish facility in week 20. The infection has so far been reported at 2 Danish establishments. No fish have been shipped from these establishments to elsewhere in Finland. The situation of the infection in Denmark is still being clarified. Due to an eradication programme for another fish disease, VHS, movement of live or ungutted fish from Aland Islands to VHS-free areas, as in the other parts of Finland, has been restricted for over 10 years."

Denmark officially reported IHN to the OIE on 20 May 2021; see ProMED posting 20210524.8378265.

"Infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is an infectious viral disease of salmon and trout. It was 1st recognised in the 1950s in sockeye and chinook salmon. The disease has the most economic significance for freshwater farms; however, Pacific and Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar L._) in both fresh and seawater have been severely affected.

"IHN virus spread across North America in the 1970s in rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), apparently originating from fry or egg shipments from a single source. The virus was also introduced to Japan in 1968 by eggs from Alaska and has since spread to continental Europe, although it has never been detected in British waters.

"The causative agent of IHN is a rhabdovirus of the genus novirhabdovirus, known as IHN virus (IHNV). IHNV can be isolated from spawning fish, from the pyloric caeca, intestine, and ovarian/seminal fluid, and is thought to replicate in the endothelial cells of blood vessels, haematopoietic tissues, and nephron cells.

"IHNV can be transmitted through water, by movement of fish, contact with contaminated untreated waste material, and by equipment. In areas where IHN is endemic, the number of cases can be controlled by good hygiene, the use of virus-free water supplies, and the disinfection of eggs from farms with IHNV. Testing of broodstock is important in identifying carriers; where known carriers are present, the disinfection of eggs with iodine products is recommended."
