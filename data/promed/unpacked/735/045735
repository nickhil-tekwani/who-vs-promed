Flu season in the greater Toledo area is starting out with the canine variety. A local outbreak of canine influenza has sickened dozens of area dogs recently, with at least 5 confirmed cases. While the highly contagious virus has been identified previously in other Ohio metropolitan areas and across the country over the last few years, it's now hitting Toledo for the 1st known time.

"We've been seeing at least 5 [cases] a day; it has spread very quickly," said Geanna Beck, hospital director at MedVet Toledo.

As of Tuesday [24 Oct 2017], the emergency veterinary clinic had confirmed 3 cases of the H3N2 strain of canine flu, with tests for other dogs still pending. The clinic has treated at least 50 dogs thus far with the numbers continuing to climb, Ms. Beck said.

The outbreak appears to have stemmed from a Columbus-area dog who arrived on 4 Oct 2017 at the Pups Paradise boarding and daycare facility in Sylvania. The dog showed no signs during its stay but later became ill and was confirmed to have the virus.

Another dog who was in playgroups with the affected canine also spent time at the Pups Paradise location in Perrysburg, subsequently exposing dogs there to the virus as well.

"The following week, we started receiving reports of dogs that were coughing and were being treated for kennel cough," owner Ron Deleeuw said.

Kennel cough, or bordetella, is the canine version of the common cold. Both kennel cough and the canine flu present with similar signs like coughing, a runny nose, lethargy, and lack of appetite. The canine flu often also includes fever, though some kennel cough cases can develop fever as well.

"The signs are very similar, and without a confirmatory test, it's hard to differentiate," said Dr. Gary Thompson of West Suburban Animal Hospital in Sylvania Township.

Dr. Thompson, whose clinic is just down the road from Pups Paradise in Sylvania, said his office confirmed 1 case of H3N2 and has treated about 15 to 20 dogs for the illness. Not all dogs are tested specifically for the virus because it can be expensive, but veterinarians will treat for it if a dog has likely been exposed.

Dogs are contagious for several days before they develop signs and can remain contagious for up to a month. Treatment is limited to supportive care like antibiotics, fluids, and cough suppressants.

Dr. Thompson said the average, healthy dog can successfully fight off the flu with support. But it can become complicated in more severe cases.

"The big concern is if they develop secondary pneumonia," he said.

The outbreak has extended up into Michigan, with Temperance Animal Hospital also having confirmed a case.

Both Pups Paradise locations shut down their operations Saturday [21 Oct 2017] to begin extensive cleaning and multiple rounds of top-to-bottom sanitizing, along with replacing all air filters. The last dog in boarding went home Tuesday [24 Oct 2017].

"It was just a matter of time until it came to the area," Mr. Deleeuw said. "Unfortunately, it came to us first."

Pups Paradise expects to reopen this Saturday [28 Oct 2017] but will now require all clients' dogs be fully vaccinated for the flu before they will be allowed to return.

"We average 150 dogs a day between both locations," Mr. Deleeuw said. "We will do everything we can to safely care for the dogs."

Dr. Thompson said area dog owners should not panic, but use general caution. Those dogs who regularly visit boarding, daycare, or grooming facilities, dog parks, and other places where canines gather should get a bivalent vaccination that covers both the H3N2 strain and the older H3N8 strain of canine flu.

"It spreads just like the flu in people and is super contagious," Dr. Thompson said. "If you're in a population that has that kind of exposure, then the vaccine is recommended."

The vaccine requires an initial dose followed by a booster 2 to 4 weeks later, Dr. Thompson said. Dogs should then receive an annual booster shot.

["Canine influenza [CI] or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the US, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the United States, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain. In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia, specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the US," https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx.

Healthy dogs can be vaccinated and should be if you must board your animal. There is a vaccine for both strains of the flu mentioned above. If the virus is circulating in your area, avoiding canine social activities (dog parks, play dates, interactions in the park, etc.) may help protect your dog.

Canine influenza viruses (H3N2 and H3N8) are not known to infect humans (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/canineflu/keyfacts.htm).
