The following case report from Dr. K. Sing, Internist at Bangkok General
Hospital speaks for itself. The patient died the day after arrival by air
ambulance from Shanghai at the SGH (Shanghai General Hospital). Last week
we (here at Bangkok) had two more cases of rabies. One was a pregnant Thai
lady who was delivered by C-section at Huah Hin Hospital and had a viable
baby. She gave no history of dog bite or any other known exposure. We
advised immune globulin and vaccine for the newborn as there has been
transplacental transmission of rabies reported in mammals and vaccination
with tissue culture vaccine has virtually no risks. We will follow the
antibody titer in the baby if at all possible. Two other cases last week
were among local residents who had not received any PET (Post-Exposure
Treatment).

Regarding rabies case in China, I have some more additional information
from Singapore.
This patient is 40 years old, Australian, male who was bitten by dog about
6 months back. The dog died 2 days later. No vaccinations were taken by the
patient. His initial symptoms developed on 20 May 1999, which included
stomach cramps, agitation, photophobia (sensitivity to light) laryngospasm
(spasms of the larynx) and fever. He was taken by air ambulance to Singapore.
