Mr. Antoni Mateu, Public Health Secretary in Catalonia, declared Wednesday [17 Sep 2014] that some cooling towers may be the origin for the current legionellosis outbreak that has already affected 23 persons within the same area in Sabadell (Barcelona). 2 of these people died, but Mr. Mateu declined to reveal where the aforementioned towers are located until his declaration is confirmed 8-10 days from now.

In a press conference held with Mr. Joan Carles Sanchez, the City Mayor, Mr. Mateu stated that 21 facilities with 38 cooling towers have been analyzed by his team. These towers have been preventatively cleaned and treated, but they have not been deactivated: "Samples have been taken from these towers, and they have been cleaned and an appropriate 'shock' treatment has been carried out."

According to Mr. Mateu, "some few cases may occur" during the following days, because the potential emissions from the towers have been shedding their contents until Tuesday [16 Sep 2014], but corrective actions have been promptly taken, particularly since [15 Sep 2014] when the 1st cases were confirmed.

With respect to affected persons, very early Wednesday [17 Sep 2014], the 23rd case was confirmed, which was reported to "comply with criteria (for case definition)." Until this day, the Ministry of Health had reported 20 sick patients and 2 deceased, and Mr. Mateu denied that there would have been another fatal case.

Out of the 23 affected persons, 20 live in Sabadell, 2 in Barbera del Valles and 1 is from Cerdanyola del Valles (Barcelona).

The remaining affected persons [survivors?] -- female and male subjects in similar proportions, mean age 76 years old, and all of them with underlying conditions -- have been treated with antibacterial agents and they are "in stable condition" without requiring admission in an Intensive Care Unit. Also, 3 patients have already been discharged, and it is expected that 2 other patients will be discharged in the next 24 hours.

As Mr. Mateu has explained, legionellosis is caused by bacteria contaminating different (cooling) facilities; it is transmitted by aerosols; it is not transmitted from one infected person to another; and its clinical features include pneumonia, high fever, and dry cough.

The outbreak (defined as such since there are more than 2 cases reported) started Monday morning [15 Sep 2014], when 6 cases were initially reported, but the figures rapidly increased to 12 cases, and Wednesday [17 Sep 2014] the total number of affected persons was 23. Consequently, Public Health and Municipality technicians started "environmental and epidemiological actions."

In addition to examining nearly 20 facilities, affected persons were interviewed and "their movements have been traced," in order to elaborate a map to be placed together with environmental surveillance, which may aid formulation of a hypothesis.

On the other hand, Mr. Joan Carles Sanchez, the City Mayor, declared that "the situation is under control," since protocols are properly functioning and authorities have the cooperation from the local City Council in order to identify the origin for this outbreak and prevent further dissemination of the disease.

When asked about prior episodes, Mr. Mateu revealed that 8 or 9 outbreaks have already occurred during this year [2014], and 1 fatal case in Sabadell, but he said these occurrences are not related to the current situation: "Legionellosis has been there and it will always be there"; however, during the last few years, the numbers of cases have been reduced since a management protocol was implemented since 2003.

[This outbreak involving 23 cases, including 2 fatalities, of Legionnaires' disease, the more serious, pneumonic form of legionellosis, is occurring in 3 towns north of Barcelona. The news report above does not say how the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was made or what species of _Legionella_ was implicated in the 14 cases.

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by _Legionella_, most often _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, a Gram-negative bacillus that is found in water sources, such as natural aquatic bodies, including rivers, lakes, and thermally polluted waters. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis and Pontiac fever is a less severe, non-pneumonic form. Although healthy individuals can contract this disease, Legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, smokers, alcoholics, or who have an underlying illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons.

A diagnosis of even a single case of Legionnaires' disease implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to have been exposed. It is, therefore, a public health imperative to find that source to prevent further cases. Additional cases, which could have been exposed before remediation of suspected environmental sources, can be expected in the future, as a consequence of the 2-14 day incubation period of the disease.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates may aid in establishing transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because, frequently, the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

Sabadell is the 2nd largest city, with a population of 207 938 people, in the south the comarca of Valles Occidental, in Catalonia, Spain, 20 km (12 miles) north of Barcelona (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell). (A comarca is roughly equivalent to a US "county.") Barbera del Valles is a city of 29 208 people in Valles Occidental, 3 km (1.9 miles) south of Sabadell (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barberà_del_Vallès). Cerdanyola del Valles is a city of 58 747 people in Valles Occidental, 4.4 km (2.7 miles) south of Barbera del Valles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerdanyola_del_Vallès).
