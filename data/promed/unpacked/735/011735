Angola- [Republic of the] Congo: Officials review fight against Marburg virus
---------------------------------------------------
[This report does not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations]
Angolan and Congolese medical officials, as well as representatives of 2 UN
agencies, have reviewed ways to stop the spread of the deadly Marburg virus
across their borders. "As neighbouring countries, we need to continue
working together, exchanging ideas and information in order to overcome
this epidemic," the officials said on Friday at the ROC border town of Masabi.
The officials, who included representatives of the UN Children's Fund and
the UN World Health Organization, discussed a report on the fight against
the haemorrhagic fever, which started in the Angolan province of Uige,
killing at least 200 people. It has spread to 8 other provinces in Angola.
Marburg is an Ebola-like virus transmitted by direct contact with body
fluids. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, haemorrhaging,
vomiting, and diarrhoea, which appear after an incubation period of 2-21
days. There is no known cure or vaccine.
The ROC doctors who participated in the Masabi meeting were from the
capital, Brazzaville and the commercial port city of Pointe-Noire. They
were led by the director-general of health, Dr Damase Bozongo, while the
Angolan delegation was led by Dr Francisco Bungo, the chief representative
of the health services in Angola's 2nd Region. "We made all necessary
provisions in the town of Cabinda [the northern Angola enclave] to stop the
spread of this epidemic to neighbouring towns," Bungo said.
He added that sensitisation campaigns were being done at in the army,
schools, churches and through political parties. Safety measures, including
quarantining and testing, had been put in place at the country's airport
and ports in order to avoid infections in or out of the country, he said.
"When we received the information of a case in Cabinda, we got together
with medical authorities of our neighbouring countries in order to stop the
spread," Bozongo said.
Commenting on the health safety measures so far, the WHO representative in
ROC, Dr Adamou Alzouma Yada, said, "Collaboration between these 2 countries
in fighting the virus was a very good initiative." He added that the spread
of the disease would be "very dangerous and fast" because of cross-border
movement of people. He advised the 2 governments to improve their
communication in order to monitor the virus better.
ROC has deployed teams in Pointe-Noire and in the towns of Banga-Ntaka,
Kimpessi, Kimongo and Dolisie in the south western part of the country to
monitor the situation.

[Severe outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers traditionally
have their endemic hot zone, which has been referred to as the Ebola
Triangle. With the northern tip at Sudan, and Uganda and Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC, formerly Zaire) for the 2 lower corners. The recent
outbreaks of Marburg haemorrhagic fever with an unusually high mortality
rate (about 90 per cent) in northern Angola have taken epidemiologists by
huge surprise. In the meanwhile, both DRC and ROC (Republic of Congo) are
simultaneously suspected of having outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever
(see refs: 20050512.1302 and 20050510.1286). It is indeed worrisome for
everybody. For efficient control of the deadly epidemics, all the
neighboring countries should be working together. Collaboration between the
2 affected countries is a good initiative. - Mod.RY]
