Congenital Chagas disease can be cured. In the last 7 years, since
therapy for this infection became available in Bolivia, 118 children
recovered from Chagas disease, according to the Ministry of Health.

Dr Max Enriquez, Head of the National Chagas Disease Program, pointed
out that the average of positive vertical transmission is 3 per cent,
although it dropped by 50 per cent compared to the number of cases
detected when therapy started. This means that from a 5 per cent rate
detected in 2004, this figure dropped to 2.5 per cent in 2010.

Dr Enriquez emphasized that during these past 7 years 1328 children
with congenital Chagas disease were diagnosed. Only 859 received
therapy, but not all of them concluded their treatment; only 118
children followed therapy as prescribed and were cured.

Dr Jose Santalla, Head of the Parasitology Laboratory at the National
Health Laboratories Institute (INLASA, by its Spanish initials),
reported that in 2010 there were 79 cases (of congenital Chagas
disease) only in La Paz (Bolivia Capital city), and only 15 patients
were cured.

According to specialists, the younger the child is when the diagnosis
is made, the more effective therapy will be. In children less than
one-year-old, efficacy of therapy (cure rate) is 100 per cent.

Dr Enriquez explained that detection of _Trypanosoma cruzi_, (a
parasite, the causative agent for Chagas disease, which is usually
transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected triatomine
("vinchuca" or "chirimacha" in Spanish), begins by performing tests
in pregnant women. These tests will be covered by SUMI (Spanish
initials for Bolivian Mother and Child Health Insurance), and they
are free of charge.

Ms Tatiana Rios, a biochemistry specialist from INLASA Parasitology
Unit, assured that there are some mothers not willing to accept they
have the disease, saying that they never traveled to an endemic area,
but the parasite may have been transmitted from the grandmother to
the mother, and from the mother to the baby, without any knowledge of
their condition. Consequently, it is important that people are
informed about this infectious disease.

Dr Santalla added that, if the result is positive, then women undergo
follow-up studies until delivery. Results from the test do not take
more than 24 hours. On the other hand, Dr Enriquez explained that
there are 2 ways from implementing testing for Chagas disease in
babies. The 1st is during birth, taking a sample from the umbilical
chord. The 2nd is by taking a blood sample from the baby's heel. 2
months after birth, a 2nd test is performed in order to verify the
presence of the parasite. Dr Enriquez also emphasized that therapy is
given free of charge and it is started when the baby is 6 months old.

Additional data
---------------
The active detection of congenital Chagas disease started in 2004,
when 1728 samples were taken, and 28 were found to be positive.
In 2009, 14 946 samples were taken and 300 were reported as positive.
In 2010, 11 334 samples from newborn babies were taken, and 230 of
them were found to be positive.

Endemic areas for Chagas disease are Cochabamba, Chiquisaca, Potosi,
Santa Cruz, La Paz, and Tarija.

[The report above does not mention the specific treatment. Two drugs
are effective against _Trypanosoma cruzi_ causing Chagas disease:
nifurtimox and benznidazole. Treatment is between 60 and 90 days.

According to the report, the incidence of congenital Chagas disease
before screening and treatment was 5 percent and has decreased to 2.5
percent to 3 percent of all newborns in Bolivia, which is still a
very high number. The posting emphasizes that vertically transmitted
Chagas disease is an important source of infection in endemic areas
and also illustrates why people without apparent risk factors in
their history can be infected. - Mod.EP]
