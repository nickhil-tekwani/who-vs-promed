The Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources in Safat,
Kuwait has notified the OIE of 5 outbreaks of foot and mouth disease since
19 Mar 1998.
One outbreak was in Umm Ugdayer and involved 700 susceptible sheep and
goats, of which 14 newborn lambs and kids died. Four outbreaks in cattle,
sheep and goats occurred in Kebd, with no fatalities in 598 susceptible
animals.
The diagnosis was made at the Virology Laboratory of the Animal Health
Department at Al-Rai using ELISA for FMD virus antigen and antibody
detection. Virus isolation in IBRS2 cell line is in process. The causal
agent is identified at FMD virus serotype O.
The source of the infection is not known, but its spread is thought to be
by aerosol transmission and/or fomites.
Infected animals are being treated; non-infected cattle have been
vaccinated. Dairy farmers in Sulaibiya were advised to vaccinate their
animals and to avoid moving animals into the area from Kebd.

[This virus cannot have appeared spontaneously. In that sheep & goats
outbreaks have occurred raises the obvious possibility of spread from
neighbouring countries via nomadic flocks or via local/coastal shipping.
There has been recent evidence of the ineffectiveness of the Iraqi
veterinary services and thus a logical explanation would be for a local and
expected normal spread from outbreaks in southern Iraq. The OIE suggestion
of aerosol spread must raise a red flag. Pigs are an excellent source for
airborne FMDV but this livestock species is noticeably absent in the area.
Obviously, dairy cattle densely housed can form good sources. With the lack
of organised government and veterinary services in Somalia - a traditional
source of livestock to these countries - there is the potential for spread
from Somalia while there are no disease reports from there presently. But in
the absence of FMD reports from Saudi Arabia, a traditional major purchaser
of Somali stock in the region, we might, for the moment, presume that FMD is
in neither. The major Saudi imports are for the haj and there has been
adequate time for such reports. - Mod.MHJ
