The Bluetongue virus [BTV], which primarily affects sheep, is
spreading across France, with a total of 36 recorded cases, and the
area in which the movement of live ruminants is restricted has been
extended to cover 17 regional departments, announced the Ministry of
Agriculture in a statement.
The ministry noted that, since it confirmed a 1st case of BTV on 27
Jul 2007, the situation has worsened in the northeast of the country.
"The latest identified case at a farm in the Pas-de-Calais area has
led the ministry to extend the restricted zone -- in place since the
winter of 2006 -- to incorporate the Eure, Seine-Maritime and Oise
regions, bringing the number of departments affected up to 17," the
ministry said.

The whole territory of the Netherlands has been declared a 20-km
zone. An outbreak has been detected today [22 Aug 2007] in the
Friesian village Dronrijp [About 10 km west of Leeuwarden; see map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?&t=l&map=53.19060,5.64200|14|4&loc=NL:53.19060:5.64200:14#t=l&map=53.1906,5.642|10|4&loc=NL:53.19060:5.64200:14>].
According to Gerda Verburg [Dutch Minister of agriculture], it is
unlikely that the remainder of the North remains unaffected.
The new measure means that, from now on, the movements of ruminants
from one holding to another or to a slaughterhouse, throughout the
country, is not limited.
The outbreak in Dronrijp is the 336th during 2007, manifesting a
quicker spread of the virus than in 2006. According to the ministry,
this could be the result of spread from multiple foci. In addition,
the number of midges seems to be 10-fold compared to last year
[2006]. According to the animal health service, there is higher
morbidity and mortality in the affected farms.
The Central Institute for the Control of Animal Disease [Lelystad]
expects a vaccine to become available at the end of this year [2007].
Discussions with the European Commission and the other affected
countries about an agreed vaccination policy are being carried out.

[There is a clear deterioration of the situation during 2007 in all 5
affected northwestern European countries compared to 2006. According
to unofficial information from a reliable source, farmers in
northwestern Germany are devastated, as the virus is virtually
sweeping the countryside. The situation in the Netherlands and
Belgium is equally grim.
As long as a safe, efficacious BTV-8 vaccine remains unavailable,
there is not much to be done to diminish losses in susceptible sheep.
Symptomatic treatment of sick animals can be attempted; breeders may
be advised to protect BT-infected animals from solar radiation, known
empirically to have adverse clinical effects. - Mod.AS]
