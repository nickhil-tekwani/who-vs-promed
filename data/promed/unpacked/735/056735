[Regarding the report from the Times of India of 21 Jul 2002, posted on
ProMED 30 Jul 2002: Anthrax, livestock - India (Hyderabad) 20020730.4889.
>The department of animal husbandry has sent a 2-member team to Chittoor
district to investigate 28 alleged cases of [livestock] anthrax reported in
a village.<
>...doctors from the district office of the animal husbandry department and
the health department were rushed to the affected villages.<
Mod.MHJ has pointed out that my insertion of the word "livestock" here may
be wrong; otherwise, why would the government have sent physicians as well
as veterinarians? But, of course, physicians may have gone to provide
prevention advice and prophylaxis.
>Reacting to a report published in The Times of India, director of animal
husbandry R Mohana Rao said on Friday that the department had sought a
report on the scare by Monday.<
IÂ´m unable to trace the 21 July 2002 story on the Times of India website,
nor any later follow-up, but the report came to us from a usually reliable
source, and the Times of India website does carry a report of anthrax in
Hyderabad state 2001 (different from this one).
>Talking to The Times of India, Dr Rao said his department had received the
first report on the anthrax-affected sheep in Chittoor district on 5 Jul
2002.<
>The villagers were advised not to slaughter the goats and sell the meat.
But, apparently, after the teams left the villages, the advice was ignored.
Mohana Rao said consumption of the meat of diseased sheep, without properly
cooking it, could infect human beings.<
Is it sheep or goats that were affected, or both? The phrase "could infect
human beings", while true, does not suggest to me that it has actually done
so in this outbreak.
>He said the department had supplied 62 000 doses of [veterinary] anthrax
vaccine to 25 villages to prevent the spread of the anthrax microbe. Dr Rao
said there was no need for panic as 2-lakh [200 000] doses were available
with the state government.<
I inserted "veterinary" here as I find it hard to believe that the state has
stocked 200 000 doses of human anthrax vaccine, still less that it plans to
vaccinate 62 000 people in 25 villages.
If anyone can provide clarification, or a more recent media update on this
outbreak, we would be grateful. - Mod.JW]
