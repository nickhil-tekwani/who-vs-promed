Brazil finds new strain of H1N1 virus
-------------------------------------
Brazilian scientists have identified a new strain of the [2009] H1N1
virus after examining samples from a patient in Sao Paulo, their
institute said Tuesday [16 Jun 2009]. The variant has been called
A/Sao Paulo/1454/H1N1 by the Adolfo Lutz Bacteriological Institute,
which compared it with samples of the A (H1N1) swine flu from
California.

The genetic sequence of the new sub-type of the H1N1 virus was
isolated by a virology team lead by one of its researchers, Terezinha
Maria de Paiva, the institute said in a statement. The mutation
comprised of alterations in the hemagglutinin [HA] protein, which
[may] allow the virus to infect new hosts, it said. It was not yet
known whether the new strain was more aggressive than the current A
(H1N1) virus, which has been declared pandemic by the World Health
Organization.

The genetic make-up of the H1N1 virus and its subvariants are
important for scientists. Pharmaceutical companies are working to
mass produce a vaccine against the current A (H1N1) flu. There are
fears though that it could mutate into a deadly strain, much in the
same way as the 1918 Spanish flu -- also an A (H1N1) virus type --
did when it killed tens of millions around the planet. According to
the WHO, 36 000 people in 76 countries have been infected with the
H1N1 virus, causing 163 deaths.

[It is not clear from this report to what extent the A/Sao
Paulo/1454/H1N1 virus differs from previous isolates of the novel
2009 A (H1N1) influenza virus, or where it sits in the phylogenetic
tree of A (H1N1) isolates sequenced up to the present. So far only
the complete sequence of segment 4, the hemagglutinin gene, has been
submitted to GenBank. This sequence is available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/GQ247724>.
Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]

Swine flu origins revealed
--------------------------
A new analysis of the current swine-origin H1N1 influenza A virus
suggests that transmission to humans occurred several months before
recognition of the existing outbreak. The work, published online in
Nature today [11 Jun 2009], highlights the need for systematic
surveillance of influenza in swine, and provides evidence that new
genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with
pandemic potential in humans.

"Using computational methods, developed over the last 10 years at
Oxford, we were able to reconstruct the origins and timescale of this
new pandemic," said Dr Oliver Pybus of Oxford University's Department
of Zoology, an author of the paper. "Our results show that this
strain has been circulating among pigs, possibly among multiple
continents, for many years prior to its transmission to humans."

Dr Pybus, along with Andrew Rambaut from the University of Edinburgh
and colleagues, used evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale
of the origins and the early development of the epidemic. They
believe that it was derived from several viruses circulating in
swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several
months before recognition of the outbreak.

The team concludes that 'despite widespread influenza surveillance in
humans, the lack of systematic swine surveillance allowed for the
undetected persistence and evolution of this potentially pandemic
strain for many years.'

The team included researchers from Oxford, the University of
Edinburgh, the University of Hong Kong, and the University of Arizona.

"Origins and evolutionary genomics of the 2009 swine-origin H1N1
influenza A epidemic

"Abstract
--------
"In March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1)
virus (S-OIV) emerged in Mexico and the United States. During the 1st
few weeks of surveillance, the virus spread worldwide to 30 countries
(as of 11 May 2009) by human-to-human transmission, causing the World
Heath Organisation to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6 [and
subsequently to 6]. This virus has the potential to develop into the
1st influenza pandemic of the 21st century.

"Here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the
origins and the early development of the S-OIV epidemic. We show that
it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that
the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before
recognition of the outbreak.

"A phylogenetic estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance
indicates a long period of unsampled ancestry before the S-OIV
outbreak, suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have
occurred years before human emergence, and that the multiple genetic
ancestry of S-OIV is not indicative of an artificial origin.
Furthermore, the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the
nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal
little about the immediate origin of the epidemic, despite the fact
that we included a panel of closely related and previously
unpublished swine influenza isolates.

"Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of
influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new
genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with
pandemic potential in humans." - Mod.CP]
