Two elephants died in Coimbatore and Nilgiris districts of Tamil Nadu yesterday [Mon 26 Dec 2016] as an anthrax alert caused the death of 2 other jumbos recently, officials said.

While a 9-year-old male elephant died following a sudden illness in a camp nearby Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in Nilgiris district, an elephant calf was found dead in Sirumugai forest range in Coimbatore district yesterday [26 Dec 2016] morning. This old elephant developed dysentery early in the morning and died in the afternoon, officials said.

Though the real cause of the death of the 2 animals would be known only postmortem, it is suspected the elephant that died in MTR could have been suffering from anthrax, a highly infectious animal disease, prompting forest officials to take steps to shift the 23 elephants to nearby areas.

A 26-year-old female had died in similar circumstances in the same camp last month [November 2016].

As a preventive measure, MTR Field Director Srinivasa Reddy has taken steps to shift the remaining elephants from MTR to camps in Bombax and Foampuravayal, MTR Deputy Director S Saravanan said. Accordingly, 21 elephants would be moved to the camps immediately, and the 2 aged ones would be shifted later after reviewing their condition.

The deaths of these elephants in MTR and Sirumugai are very similar to the deaths of 2 others that died in Madukkarai range in neighboring Coimbatore District after suffering from anthrax. These deaths were confirmed postmortem.

The Coimbatore District administration has already taken steps to administer anti-anthrax vaccination to the cattle in and around Madukkarai area to prevent the spread of the disease.

[The previously reported case appears to have had a 2nd but unreported elephant dying of anthrax; see from 25 Dec 2016 "Anthrax - India (29): (TN) elephant 20161225.4723282." We seem to be witnessing a cluster of elephant cases in this tight corner of Tamil Nadu.

To find the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in Nilgris District, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudumalai_National_Park.

Samples from the 26-year-old elephant found dead in the Sirumgai Forest Range on 27 Nov 2016 were sent for testing at the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS), but in the absence of any reported results, we can, for the moment, assume it was not anthrax. See: http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Female-elephant-found-dead-in-Sirumugai-forest-range-in-Tamil-Nadu/articleshow/55670404.cms.

There appear to have been multiple elephant deaths in Sirumugai recently; see http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2016/nov/04/second-elephant-calf-death-in-tn-forest-since-last-week-1534920.html.

When elephant calves are found dead, it is commonly from starvation following the death of their mothers. - Mod.MHJ
