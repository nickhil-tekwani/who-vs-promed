[West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans and horses causing unapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family _Flaviviridae_. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans.

Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.24_WEST_NILE.pdf.

The previous WNF event in Portugal, was also located in DSVR Do Algarve. The outbreaks (3) were resolved on 31 Dec 2015. See event summary report and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=18585

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), updated 2 Sep 2016, noted that 63 human cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the European Union. 102 cases have been reported in neighboring countries since the beginning of the 2016 transmission season.
