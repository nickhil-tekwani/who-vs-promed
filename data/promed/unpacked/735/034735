A Dawson County [Georgia, USA] woman is receiving treatment after being bitten by a rabid dog Friday [24 Jun 2016].

County officials confirmed the rabies case Wednesday morning [29 Jun 2016], saying the public should not be alarmed as the dog in question has been euthanized.

Two other dogs belonging to the same owner were also put down as a precaution, according to Dawson County Commission Chairman Mike Berg.

"The 2 other dogs came back negative for rabies," he said.

The woman, whose name and age were not released, was bitten by a tan-colored, mixed-breed on Burnt River Road, near Bailey Waters Road, northwest of Dawsonville.

A 15-year-old male that reportedly touched the dog is also being evaluated for symptoms of the virus.

Residents living on Grover Burt, Keith Evans, Robert Gibby, Old Henry Grady, Juno, Ivey, Reece, Mildred Elliott and Davenport roads, as well as Shamrock Lane and Tatum Trail that have outside roaming pets are urged to re-vaccinate immediately if they believe their animals may have been in contact with the rabid dog.

"In such cases, consult with your veterinarian to inquire about a rabies vaccine booster. All unvaccinated animals that have been in contact with this animal should be euthanized, or undergo isolated confinement for a period of 6 months," county officials said in a press release Wednesday afternoon.

Dawson County animal control officers went door to door notifying neighbors within a one-mile radius of the bite that the dog had been confirmed to have rabies.

For more information, or if you notice any domestic, stray or wild animals acting out of the ordinary, avoid contact with animal and confine it, then call 9-1-1 or Dawson County Animal Control.

A woman had a brush with a bat that tested positive for rabies.

The 64-year-old woman was scratched by the bat after she stepped on it while it was lying on the ground on Tuesday [28 Jun 2016], said Red Bluff Police.

Butte County Public Health were able to capture the bat for testing and it showed positive for rabies.

Law enforcement chalks up the bat confrontation as a "rural community public health concern."

Police say to avoid handling any live bats, as it's a good way to avoid exposure to rabies or getting scratched. If anyone comes across a dead bat it's best to place them in a plastic bag and put them in the trash.

Animal Control can be reached to handle any bat encounters.

[Other articles regarding the woman and the bat indicate the bat was on the ground; she did not see it and stepped on it. It was unclear if she had on sandals or was barefoot.

In each of these reports, rabies is clearly circulating in the area. Residents should be reminded to vaccinate their pets (dogs, cats, cattle, horses, goats, and sheep). Rabies can affect any mammal. Vaccination remains a cheap and safe way to protect your animals and to protect yourself. Vaccination of your animals helps to build a barrier between the virus and yourself. - Mod.TG
