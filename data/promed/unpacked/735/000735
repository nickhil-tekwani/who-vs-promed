A bird flu virus has emerged in a poultry flock
for the 1st time in the Czech republic, the State
Veterinary Administration said. The virus was
confirmed in a turkey flock in Usti nad Orlici,
east Bohemia, this afternoon [20 Jun 2007]. Part
of the flock of 6000 birds has died. The results
of control checks expected on Thursday [21 Jun
2007], will confirm what type of virus has
appeared.
The Regional Veterinary Office is preparing
stringent precautions including a ban on any
future transfers of birds from the afflicted
flock and checks of the previous transfers of the
poultry. A 3-km inner protection zone and a 10-km
outer surveillance zone will also soon be in
force.
The security council of the Pardubice region,
east Bohemia, will hold a special meeting, deputy
regional governor, Roman Linek, told CTK (Czech
News Agency) today [20 Jun 2007].
The remaining birds in the afflicted flock in the
village of Tisova will be culled.
The 1st case of bird flu in the Czech Republic was reported in March
2006, when 13 cases of the disease were registered. In all cases, they
were swans that were infected by the H5N1 virus.
