West Nile Virus Update: Two New Human Cases, Including First Reported Death
-------------------------------------
TRENTON: Two more New Jersey residents have tested positive for the
presence of West Nile virus (WNV). The new cases include an 82-year old
Little Falls man who died in mid September, and a 72-year old Bayonne woman
who is home recovering.
The Little Falls man is the first person with WNV to die this year in the
United States. He became ill on 3 Sep 2000, and was admitted to The
Mountainside Hospital 3 days later. He died 14 Sep 2000. The Bayonne
woman was admitted to Bayonne Hospital 1 Sep 2000 and discharged 6 Sep 2000.
Both residents were most likely bitten by infected mosquitoes in mid to late
August. Since then, mosquito control activities and colder weather have
helped reduce the risk of further WNV transmission. To date, 4 people in
New Jersey have been diagnosed with WNV.
Health and Senior Services Commissioner Christine Grant said the 2 new
cases are further evidence that the West Nile virus has firmly established
itself in the Northeast. "Fortunately, most people who are bitten by an
infected mosquito don't get sick and never even know they have been exposed.
Unfortunately, for some, this virus can cause serious illness and death.
It's therefore important that all residents take precautions to reduce their
risk of exposure," said Grant.
West Nile fever, an arboviral disease, is transmitted through the bite
of a mosquito that has picked up the virus by feeding on an infected bird.
WNV is not directly transmitted from birds to humans or from person to
person. WNV infection generally causes no symptoms or just mild, flu-like
symptoms; however, the elderly are at higher risk of more severe disease.
Supplementing personal precautions, Grant noted that federal, state and
local officials have implemented a comprehensive disease surveillance system
and aggressive mosquito control activities. Those activities -- which
include human, bird, mosquito and horse testing and mosquito surveillance
and targeted larvacide and adultacide application -- have won praise from
CDC officials this summer. In Bergen County last week to review state's
surveillance, testing and mosquito control activities, CDC Director Jeffrey
P. Koplan said, "The right things are being done to reduce risk of West Nile
virus transmission here in New Jersey."
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 38 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of WNV. To date, 4 tests
were positive, 15 were negative and 19 are pending. These individuals either
had symptoms or signs that met the established WNV testing criteria or
exhibited most of the symptoms and are from counties where the virus has
been discovered through surveillance activities.
Serum and/or spinal fluid samples from New Jersey's latest human cases
tested positive in the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services
laboratories. The results were verified last night by the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Additional confirmatory test
results from the CDC will be available in the next few weeks.
New Jersey's earlier human cases include a 43-year old Jersey City man and a
54-year old man with dual residency in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cliffside Park,
Bergen County. Human testing for WNV is being conducted at the New Jersey
Department of Health and Senior Services' Public Health and Environmental
Laboratory in Trenton and at public health labs in other states. Testing
results are sent to the CDC for verification.
To date, 838 birds (837 crows and a cockatiel) found in 16 counties have
tested positive for the presence of WNV. Positive birds have been found in
Bergen (179), Burlington (3), Camden (2), Cape May (2), Essex (89),
Gloucester (2), Hudson (60), Hunterdon (3), Mercer (5), Middlesex (162),
Monmouth (129), Morris (26), Ocean (6), Passaic (63), Somerset (13) and
Union (94) Counties. The tests were conducted at the Department of Health
and Senior Services' lab in Trenton. A total of 1527 crows submitted by
local health departments have been accepted for testing this year.
Thirty-four mosquito pools collected in Bergen (19), Essex (1), Middlesex
(2), Monmouth (3), Passaic (7) and Sussex (2) Counties have also tested
positive for the presence of WNV. In total, 13 885 mosquito pools from all
21 counties have been collected by the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control
Unit and tested by the Department of Health and Senior Services and/or the
CDC.
WNV has also been detected in 6 horses from Atlantic (2), Cape May (1),
Ocean (1) and Sussex (2) Counties. The tests were conducted by the New
Jersey Department of Agriculture's animal health laboratory in Trenton and
were confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.
Other surveillance methods, including testing blood samples taken weekly
from sentinel chicken flocks placed in all 21 counties and blood samples
collected from 541 house sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex
County in late July have not detected WNV.
