There has been a significant increase in _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W (MenW) in New Zealand since mid-2017. Between 1 Jan 2017 and 31 Dec 2017, there were 12 cases of MenW reported, including 3 deaths. This number has doubled to date for 2018, with 24 cases reported so far (as of 5 Nov [2018]), including 6 deaths. Prior to 2017, 0 to 6 MenW cases were reported each year. The Northland region has been the most affected in 2018, with 7 of the 24 cases reported in this region, including 4 cases in September and October [2018].

This particular strain of MenW (sequence type ST11) affects all age groups and is associated with a high case-fatality rate. MenW can present with the classical signs of meningococcal disease but also atypically with gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as pneumonia, septic arthritis, endocarditis, or epi/supraglottitis. MenW was previously referred to as W135. Similar increases in MenW have been seen in other countries, including the UK and Australia.

Overall, the annual number of meningococcal disease cases due to all serogroups has been increasing steadily since 2014, when there were 45 cases, to 112 cases in 2017. There [have] been 96 cases to date this year [2018] (as of 5 Nov [2018]). Group B remains the most prevalent serogroup, though this year [2018] the number of group B infections is lower (43 cases) than in 2017 (60 cases) at the same time of the year.

Key messages
-----
- General practitioners and emergency departments should be aware that there has been an increase in meningococcal disease caused by serogroup W in New Zealand over the past 2 years. They should be aware that this strain presents atypically, and they should keep a high level of suspicion for the disease.
- Because of the fulminant nature of meningococcal sepsis, antibiotics should be administered on suspicion of diagnosis before transferring the patient to the hospital.
- GPs do not need to be concerned that administering antibiotics will obscure the diagnosis for hospital clinicians. Overtreatment is acceptable in this case, as failure to treat may be fatal.
- The antibiotics recommended prior to transfer to hospital are as follows:
Adults: Benzyl penicillin: 1.2 g (2 megaunits) IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 1-2 g IV (or IM)
Children: Benzyl penicillin: 25-50 mg/kg IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 50-100 mg/kg IV (or IM)
- Antibiotics given prior to transfer should be clearly noted on the clinical information that accompanies the patient to the hospital.
- Patients with a documented history of anaphylaxis to penicillin and who are suspected of suffering from meningococcal disease should be sent immediately to the hospital without pre-admission antibiotics.
- A blood sample should be taken as soon as possible for laboratory testing but should not delay patient treatment or transfer.
- If you are not sure if it is meningococcal disease, (1) advise parents/caregivers to check the sick person frequently (e.g., every hour). The sick person should not remain alone; (2) make sure the case seeks immediate medical attention if he or she deteriorates; and (3) reassess the case within 6 hours.
- The quadrivalent MCV4-D vaccine (Menactra) protects against MenW and is available in New Zealand. It is recommended for high-risk groups and is funded for some of them (please refer to the meningococcal disease chapter in the immunisation handbook). Please make sure that high-risk patients for whom the vaccine is funded are protected.

[Meningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Six serogroups (A, B, C, W, and Y) cause almost all invasive disease globally. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), based on DNA sequence of 7 housekeeping genes, is used to classify meningococci into lineages (sequence types, ST). Closely related STs are termed "clonal complex."

Prior to 2000, serogroup W was not a very common cause of meningococcal disease. However, in 2000 and 2001, serogroup W ST-11 strains caused an outbreak related to the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The outbreak spread internationally through pilgrims, with cases identified among Hajj pilgrims and their close contacts globally, including countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia, but following mandatory quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination for pilgrims in 2001, W ST-11 cases declined among Hajj pilgrims (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310207).

Nevertheless, both Hajj-related and non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains then continued to circulate, causing disease worldwide. Hajj-related W ST-11 strains have caused outbreaks in the African meningitis belt and South Africa. Non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains emerged in South America, and a descendant of this strain was responsible for the initial increase in invasive W ST-11 disease in the UK (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.24.30259) and other European countries (France, Netherlands, Sweden) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218300201). Other W lineages persist in low numbers in Europe, North America, and the meningitis belt (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26876439).

Patients with serogroup W ST-11 infection may present with more severe disease; unusual clinical presentations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, septic arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, pneumonia, and myopericarditis; and a high case-fatality ratio. Atypical clinical presentations may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment as well as delays in public health notification, contact tracing, and timely administration of antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to close contacts for prevention of secondary invasive meningococcal disease.

In some countries like the UK, the emergence of serogroup W disease has followed the near-elimination of serogroup C disease after the introduction of meningococcal C vaccine into the national childhood vaccine schedule (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - UK: emergence of serogroup W, changed vaccine policy 20150926.3673122). However, in New Zealand, meningococal vaccines are not included in the childhood immunization schedule (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-national-immunisation-schedule-mar18.pdf). The conjugated quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) MCV4-D (Menactra) and the conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine MenCCV (NeisVac-C) are available, but only publicly funded for the following high-risk groups (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-12-meningococcal-disease-mar18-v2.pdf):
• patients pre- or post-splenectomy or with functional asplenia;
• patients with HIV, complement deficiency (acquired, including monoclonal antibody therapy against C5, or inherited) or pre- or post-solid organ transplant;
• HSCT [human stem cell transplant] (bone marrow transplant) patients;
• patients following immunosuppression; and
• close contacts of meningococcal cases (of relevant serotype).

The news report above says that the Northland region has been the most affected by the emergence of serogroup W disease. The Northland is the northernmost of New Zealand's 16 local government regions; a map of these regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_New_Zealand. - Mod.ML
