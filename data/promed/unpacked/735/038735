According to German and Austrian broadcasting news there is an outbreak of
meningitis in Bavaria. There are several cases in the county of Rottal/Inn
that is near the Austrian border and about 150 km east from Munich. One
16-year-old boy died on Friday. Six pupils are in hospital. The authorities
closed all schools and kindergartens and told the parents to keep their
children inside the houses. Today, an expert task-force from the
Robert-Koch-Institute in Berlin has arrived. The source of the infection is
unknown.
