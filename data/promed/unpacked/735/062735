Ontario: Suspected Case of West Nile Virus Infection in 7-year-old Child
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 7-year-old Walpole Island boy is being tested for West Nile virus
infection, the London region's first scare of the year from the
illness. Tests are being conducted, but it could take as long as 2
weeks to confirm whether the boy has the illness, said an official
with the Lambton Health Unit.
"He's not seriously ill," said Joan Beaudet, the unit's supervisor of
environmental, health, and prevention services, last night. "Our
understanding is that the boy has already been discharged from
hospital and is back at home." Beaudet is skeptical whether the boy's
illness is West Nile fever. "This could be a totally false alarm. The
combination of it being early in the season and his age makes me
think it's not West Nile virus infection."
The prospect of West Nile infecting a child is sure to raise
eyebrows, especially with many Southwestern Ontario cities only now
embarking on costly control programs to guard against the
mosquito-borne disease. The elderly are considered most vulnerable to
West Nile virus infection, and most people who come down with it are
adults. It's not yet known how serious the boy's symptoms were.
Beaudet said early test results should be back within 4 days, but a
test to confirm West Nile virus infection will take as long as 2
weeks -- much faster than last year, when test results took months.
The health unit says the virus infected 6 people in the London area
last year, along with 3 probable and 9 suspected cases.
