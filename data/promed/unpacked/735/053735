China reports additional H9N2 avian influenza case for 2021
-----------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up to the number of H9N2 avian influenza cases reported in China in 2021, Hong Kong health officials reported an additional case this past week in a 5-year-old boy from Anhui Province. The patient had onset of disease on [13 Nov 2021].

To date [24 Jan 2022], 24 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported to WHO from China in 2021.

In most human cases of H9N2 avian flu, the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.

[Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk of sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases is increasing. - Mod.UBA]

CHP closely monitors two human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Mainland
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [27 Jan 2022] closely monitoring 2 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) on the Mainland, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The 1st case involves a 68-year-old man living in Langzhong in Sichuan. He developed symptoms on [3 Jan 2022], and was admitted for treatment on [4 Jan 2022]. The patient is in critical condition.

The 2nd case involves a 55-year-old woman living in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, who had exposure to slaughtered poultry before onset. She developed symptoms on [6 Jan 2022], and was admitted for treatment on [9 Jan 2022]. The patient is in critical condition.

From 2014 to date [27 Jan 2022], 65 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.

"All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the CHP said.

Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.

Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.

The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:
- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;
- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms;
- Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately;
- Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;
- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;
- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and
- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

China reports 2 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6)
------------------------------------------------------
The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health reports closely monitoring two human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) in the Mainland.

The 1st case involves a 68-year-old man living in Langzhong in Sichuan. He developed symptoms on [3 Jan 2022], and was admitted for treatment on [4 Jan 2022]. The patient is in critical condition.

The 2nd case involves a 55-year-old woman living in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, who had exposure to slaughtered poultry before onset. She developed symptoms on [6 Jan 2022], and was admitted for treatment on [9 Jan 2022]. The patient is in critical condition.

This is the 2nd and 3rd cases reported in 2022 and since 2014, 65 human cases have been reported in China.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) have also been reported. The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death.

[According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. There has been an increase in the number of human H5N6 cases in 2021; at least 5 cases were confirmed in December 2021, and 3 more in January 2022 based on the information in the reports above.

The identified exposures in nearly all cases are related to handling live poultry, and there appears to be an increase in transmission events. Is there more H5N6 avian influenza virus circulating in poultry and/or more importantly, is the virus now more easily transmissible? High level of vigilance and active surveillance in both animal and human health is required. - Mod.UBA
