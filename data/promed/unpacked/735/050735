Salmonella outbreak affects 47 people in the Bio Bio Region
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Emergency Unit of the Regional Hospital treated 25 people for
foodborne illness, [of which there were] 2 children, a pregnant woman
and 2 adults, one elderly person and a diabetic. 5 people remain
hospitalized at the Guillermo Grant Benavente de Concepcion Hospital
related to a salmonellosis outbreak that affected 47 individuals who
ingested homemade mayonnaise.

"They consumed homemade mayonnaise at a baptism in the Concepcion
municipality. There are 18 cultures [from patient specimens] that
confirmed the illness as salmonellosis and 6 food samples have been
taken, but results of these are still pending," said Andrea Silva,
from the Epidemiology Unit the Health SEREMI [Regional Offices of the
Health Ministry] in Biob√≠o.

[The region of Biobio, in central Chile
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biob%C3%ADo_Region, is bordered on the
west by the Pacific Ocean, on the east by Argentina, on the north by
the Chilean Region of Maule, and on the south by the Chilean Region of
Araucania. The region has been hit by many Chilean earthquakes,
including the most powerful earthquake ever recorded (in 1960) and the
great earthquake of 2010.

Mayonnaise is a stable emulsion of oil, egg yolk and either vinegar
or lemon juice. It is certainly likely that the egg is the source of
the pathogen here. The serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ involved is
not mentioned in the posting. - Mod.LL]
