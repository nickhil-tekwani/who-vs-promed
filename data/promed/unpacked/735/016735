After 5 cases of measles were recently confirmed in Perry County 2
weeks ago, the Pennsylvania Department of Health advised surrounding
counties, including the city of Harrisburg, to be aware of the
outbreak and the very real possibly of it spreading across the
mid-state. The warning released via news reports and the Internet was
aimed at people who visited the Newport Public Library or the Lowe's
store at 4000 Union Deposit Road in Lower Paxton Township about 2
weeks ago. The possible exposure at the library involves people who
attended a book sale in the basement of the library on North Fourth
Street in Newport, Pennsylvania (Perry County).

The 5 reported cases thus far involved members of one family,
reported Dr. Stephen Ostroff, Pennsylvania's acting Physician General,
in a published interview. A 6th person who isn't a member of the
family but had contact with them is also suspected of having measles.
That person, a child, was present at the library and Lowe's store and
could have spread the illness to any number of others.

Most people in the United States are immune to measles, either
because they received the MMR vaccine in childhood or because they
were exposed to measles in the pre-vaccine era, said PA Department of
Health spokeswoman Holli Senior in a published interview. All
confirmed cases of measles involved unvaccinated children, she said.

The MMR vaccine is given to toddlers when they are 12 to 15 months of
age, and a 2nd dose is required for all Pennsylvania school children.
However, individuals who have received only one dose of the vaccine,
instead of the recommended 2 doses, may still be at risk of infection,
according to the Department of Health.

The highly contagious measles virus includes symptoms of runny nose,
watery eyes, cough and high fever, and symptoms begin one to 2 weeks
after exposure. After 4 days, a raised, red rash starts to spread on
the face, down the body and out to the arms and legs. The rash usually
lasts 4-7 days. An individual with measles can spread the virus to
others for 4 days before and 4 days after the rash begins. Needless to
say, the recent measles scare in Perry County has parents, physicians,
school officials, and community leaders on edge.

With today's modern medical technology, measles, thankfully, is not a
killer bug. People who are at high risk can obtain protection through
a dose of immune globulin given within 6 days of exposure, according
to state officials. However, this was not always the case. In roughly
the last 150 years, it has been estimated that measles has killed
about 200 million people worldwide, with several famed outbreaks in
countries like Cuba in the 1520's (which killed roughly 2/3rds of the
native population) and Hawaii in the 1850's (which killed about 1/5th
of the island's indigenous population).

[It would appear that the alert has served its purpose, and spread of
infection has been limited to a single family and another child.
