[Of course, we all hope this is not the global strain of H5N1; if so,
Africa would be brought into play. The numerous backyard production
systems (which exist along with the more modern, intensive systems)
and lack of veterinary infrastructure will mean there is a high
probability the disease would become endemic.
We do not need to allow the establishment of other foci of continuing
circulation of H5N1, just waiting until genetic roulette spins off an
efficient human-to-human spreading strain. Whether or not this does
prove to be H5N1, maximum surveillance efforts should be put into
place as soon as possible. We need good geographically based
information for decision support, and Africa is a likely place for an
AI incursion. Efficient efforts to ramp up early warning and
surveillance systems are particularly warranted in this region. - Mod.PC]
