[This tickborne disease can also be transmitted by contaminated
needles. There has been a rather steady occurrence of serologically
positive animals in the Southwestern United States over the past few
years. This particular newly discovered case was found by
surveillance conducted by private, but government accredited,
veterinarians who are a critical element of the surveillance system
at the farm level and are a critical link in starting the shoe
leather epidemiology so critical in better understanding the pattern
of occurrence of this disease.
