Regarding ... Shigella, altered species prevalence: RFI, the following
Lancet paper came to mind ...
Sack D, Hoque A, Huq A, Etheridge M. Is protection against shigellosis
induced by natural infection with _Plesiomonas shigelloides_? Lancet 1994 Jun
4;343(8910):1413-5.
Abstract [from PubMed ... Shigellosis due to _Shigella sonnei_ is rare
among people growing up and living in developing countries; however,
infections due to _S. sonnei_ becomes more common than those due to _S.
flexneri_ as societies develop economically. The relation between risk of
_S. sonnei_ infection and economic development may be explained by the
exposure of developing-country populations to _Plesiomonas shigelloides_.
_P. shigelloides_ is often found in surface water, and one serotype
(serotype 17) possesses a cell-wall lipopolysaccharide identical to that of
_S. sonnei_. Thus, exposure to _P. shigelloides_ by drinking contaminated
water may immunise populations to _S. sonnei_. As economic development
occurs, water quality improves and populations become susceptible to _S.
sonnei_. Although drinking water has many advantages, immunisation against
_S. sonnei_ may be one benefit of traditional water sources.
No doubt the ecology of _Shigella_ species and their human hosts is subject
to very diverse influences across the globe, but this hypothesis is a
provocative start, and possibly testable. The chapter on shigellosis by
Keusch and Bennish in Evans and Brachman's Bacterial Infections of Humans:
Epidemiology & Control (3rd ed, 1998) provides a good overview [second stop
after Benenson/Chin!

[Very nice response. This sounds like a plausible explanation for
differences in prevalence of _S. sonnei_ in the developed vs.
underdeveloped world, but doesn't seem to speak to the previous
contributors suggestion that there is a virtual disappearance of _S.
dysenteriae_ and _S. flexneri_ in the developed world. - Mod.ES
