Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever under control
---------------------------------------------
All cases of suspected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been discharged from hospital. The suspected cases were admitted at Mulago National hospital [in Kampala] and in Agago at Kalongo hospital temporary isolation facility. Speaking in an interview the assistant Commissioner Health at the Ministry of Health Dr Christopher Oleke said, "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is under control and so far no new cases have been reported."

Recently a 27-year-old woman died of CCHF at Mulago National Referral Hospital. This was the 1st confirmed death since the outbreak was announced on 16 Aug 2013. The deceased was admitted on 16 Aug 2013 with febrile illness, severe anemia, vomiting blood, headaches, and inter-menstrual bleeding.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a zoonotic disease that is caused by a tickborne virus (belonging to the genus _Nairovirus_) of the family _Bunyaviridae_ . This virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, it is highly infectious, and kills about 40 percent of people infected. In Africa it is endemic in livestock such as cattle, goats, and sheep. This virus is transmitted to human beings through bites of infected ticks. The ticks pick up their infection from wild or domestic animals like sheep, cattle, and goats among others.

[According to the report above, the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Uganda is reported to be under control with no human cases admitted in any of the designated isolation facilities in Kampala and Agago districts. However, sustainable prevention of new human cases will rely on initiation of adequate measures for tick control in endemic areas in the country. One-Health approaches prioritizing interventions for minimising human exposure to ticks, viraemic animals, and individuals are therefore highly recommended.

[It would seem that Uganda is currently free of human cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. It is likely that the fatality reported in this press report is the case previously described in the ProMED-mail archived reports listed below who contracted infection from her husband, a trader working out of Sudan. - Mod.CP]
