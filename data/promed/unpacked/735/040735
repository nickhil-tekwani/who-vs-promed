The public health [department] has determined that at least 21
individuals who were treated and released at 2 hospitals suffered from
symptoms related to foodborne illness. Division of Environmental
Health administrator Tom Nadeau says that, based on interviews, the
individuals attended different functions and consumed a variety of
items but the common link was the consumption of cream puffs from
Celebrity Bakery.

Nadeau says samples of the pastry will be sent off-island and it is
too premature to confirm if the cream puffs are the source of the
foodborne illness.

Bakery owner Nelia Pono is anxious for the results as her staff have
been making the local favorite for 20 years and the night before
Thanksgiving [23 Nov 2011], her staff prepared 1500 cream puffs and
sold more than 1000. Pono added that her staff took some home and
tested them and did not get sick.

[Neither the incubation period from ingesting the cream puff nor the
type and duration of symptoms are stated. However, the vehicle itself
and the relatively small number of cases reported suggest
staphylococcal enterotoxin was involved and, likely after purchase,
some of the product was not adequately refrigerated allowing small
numbers of _S. aureus_ to replicate.

The following is extracted from the USA FDA's Bad Bug Book regarding
staphylococcal food poisoning, a disease with an incubation period of
4-8 hours, that generally causes an illness with vomiting and little
fever http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap3.html:

"In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper
interviews with the victims, and the gathering and analyzing of
epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be
collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively
large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial
evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the
linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where
multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food
sample(s).

"In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the
staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic
observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of
serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S.
aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and
detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used
successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may
also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the
incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as
food handlers. A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated
food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin
level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.


"Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food
poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products;
salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery
products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate
eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that
require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at
slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently
involved in staphylococcal food poisoning."
