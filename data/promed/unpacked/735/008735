The health department has confirmed that a resident of Ratan ki Basi village in Lathi area of Jaisalmer district [Rajasthan], who died 4 days ago at Jodhpur's Goyal hospital, was suffering from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF].

After getting information about the death due to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, the scare of the disease has gripped the village.

According to the health department sources, a National Centre for Disease Control team will reach Jaisalmer in a day or 2 and will investigate the death. On the other hand, the teams of health department have started distributing Tamiflu medicine to the villagers.

The officials also collected blood samples of suspected cases. There was information of [CCHF] disease spreading in neighboring Pakistan and looking at the possibility, BSF [Border Security Force] has increased surveillance as the disease spreads through the tick on cattle [and individuals in contact with livestock blood, fresh tissue, and infected people can acquire the infection. - Mod.TY]

Chief medical health officer (CMHO) Jaisalmer Dr NR Nayak said that a 45-year-old man, resident of Ratan ki Bassi of Lathi gram panchayat [local self-government at village or small town level], died 3-4 days ago at Goyal hospital in Jodhpur of [Crimean-]Congo fever.

CMHO said that Dr Gupta, Rekha Verma, Hanuman Vishnoi, Kanchan Vishnoi, Suman Dhaka, and team in-charge Swaroop surveyed the houses at Ratan Ki Basi and took blood slides.

Dr Nayak said a team from National Centre for Disease Control from Delhi will come to Jaisalmer in a day or 2 for intensive investigation of the entire case. There has been information of this [Crimean-]Congo disease spreading in few areas of Pakistan. Looking to this, directions have been given to be alert. Rajasthan frontier DIG [Deputy Inspector General] Ravi Gandhi confirming said that all jawans [junior soldiers] and officers of BSF have been directed to be alert in regard to [Crimean-]Congo disease and seriously take care of camels.

It is to be mentioned that 4 days ago, at Goyal Hospital in Jodhpur, 2 nursing personnel died of [Crimean-]Congo disease, while 2 were ill, whose situation is now said to be out of danger [see ProMED-mail archive no 20150124.3114938].

[Apparently our ProMED speculation that the undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic disease in the 2 nurses were most likely CCHF has proved correct, and the report above indicates that the diagnosis has been confirmed. Although ProMED has not reported CCHF cases in Rajasthan until now, cases have occurred recently in Gujarat state, which is to the immediate south of Rajasthan state. As noted in comments in ProMED-mail archive no 20141124.2986269 and in the report above, CCHF has been an ongoing public health problem in Gujarat state over the past 3 years.

The way in which these CCHF virus infections were acquired in the cases above is not stated. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs, as was the likely situation in these 2 cases of the nurses. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. Since these cases of the nurses turned out to be CCHF virus infections, fatalities among medical staff in the hospitals indicate that barrier nursing and personal protection have not been adequate.

The CDC states, "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_) in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was first characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is found in Eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union, throughout the Mediterranean, in northwestern China, central Asia, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent.

The virus is sensitive in vitro to the antiviral drug ribavirin. It has been used in the treatment of CCHF patients reportedly with some benefit." (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/).
