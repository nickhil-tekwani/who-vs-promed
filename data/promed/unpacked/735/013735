TRYPANOSOMIASIS, TIGERS - PAKISTAN (02)

I saw trypanosomiasis in domestic dogs when I was working for FAO in Kabul
in the late 1970s. We always ascribed it to their being fed buffalo or
camel meat infected with _Trypanosoma evansi_. They did not respond very
well to treatment.
I also saw trypanosomiasis in captive tigers in India in Bangalore zoo in
the early '90s. I had escorted these tigers from Longleat in UK to
Bangalore a couple of years previously. They had been given to Rajiv Gandhi
by Mrs Thatcher! Again we attributed the infection to their being fed
infected meat but there were plenty of biting flies around too.
If I remember rightly, one died but several others responded to treatment
with Diminazene aceturate (Berenil). But there's probably a better drug now.
I see that in my BVA Handbook on Animal Diseases in the Tropics (1962) that
carnivores can be infected with _T. evansi_ by eating meat from
parasitaemic animals. I see also that lions, hyaenas, dogs and cats [have
been] infected with _T. brucei_ in Africa by feeding on the carcasses of
infected animals.
As far as I know there has not been a report of trypanosomiasis in a wild
tiger in the Indian Sub-Continent although there must be opportunities for
infection.

[In West Africa dogs have been infected by the bite of an infective tsetse
fly (_Glossina_ spp.) with _Trypanosoma brucei gambiense_, and may possibly
serve as reservoir hosts for the parasite. Dogs can also be infected with
_T. congolense_ by tsetse fly vectors. Various species of trypanosomes
occur in Asia. For example _T. theileri_ occurs in India and tigers in zoos
have become infected. This parasite is transmitted not by tsetse flies,
which do not occur in India, but by other biting flies such as Tabanids
(horse flies) and possibly by ticks. In South America trypanosomiasis is
caused by _T. cruzi_ transmitted by the bite of the triatomid bugs, such as
_Triatoma infestans_. Transmission also occurs by eating undercooked or raw
meat from infected animals. In Africa there is also evidence of oral
transmission of trypanosomiasis -- carnivores eating uncooked infected
meat. It would be interesting to know more about the transmission of
trypanosomiasis, especially in the Old World. - Mod.MS
ProMED-mail thanks Michael Woodford for his comments and hopes to received
information on the diagnostics which led to the suspicion that the tigers
died of trypanosomiasis. - Mod.EP]
