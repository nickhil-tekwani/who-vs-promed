Highlights
- In the reporting week 20 (13-19 May 2019) 6 new confirmed cases were reported from 3 states: Edo (2), Ebonyi (2), and Ondo (2) states, with one new death from Edo state;

- Since the onset of the 2019 outbreak, there have been 129 deaths in confirmed cases. Case fatality ratio in confirmed cases is 22.4%;
- 21 states (Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Plateau, Taraba, FCT, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Kwara, Benue, Rivers, Kogi, Enugu, Imo, Delta, Oyo, Kebbi, and Cross River) have recorded at least one confirmed case across 82 local government areas [LGAs] - Figure 1;
- 93% of all confirmed cases are from Edo (36%), Ondo (29%), Ebonyi (8%), Bauchi (7%), Taraba (7%), and Plateau (6%) states - Figure 1;
- The predominant age group affected is 21-40 years (range: [greater than] one month to 89 years; median age: 32 years) - Figure 6;
- The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1.2:1 - Figure 6;
- In the reporting week 20, no new healthcare worker was affected. A total of 18 healthcare workers have been infected since the onset of the outbreak in 8 states: Edo (7), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (2), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1), Benue (1), Plateau (1), and Kebbi (1), with 2 deaths in Enugu and Edo states;
- 5 patients are currently being managed at various treatment centres across the country: Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) treatment Centre (1), Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki (2), Federal Medical Centre, Jalingo (1), and Kebbi (1);
- A total of 7446 contacts have been identified from 20 states. Of these, 578 (7.8%) are currently being followed up, 6800 (91.3%) have completed 21 days follow-up, while 8 (0.1%) were lost to follow-up. A total of 119 (1.6%) symptomatic contacts have been identified, of which 60 (0.8%) have tested positive;
- Multi-sectoral one health national rapid response teams (NCDC, NFELTP, and Federal Ministry of Environment) deployed to Kebbi state; and
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

[The 6 new confirmed and 2504 suspected cases (up 2 from 4 confirmed and 2426 suspected cases in the report of week 19 [6-12 May 2019] indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing. Nigeria is still within the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (1 Jan-17 Mar 2019) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2019). There are 129 confirmed deaths, with a 5-case increase from the previous reporting period. Fortunately, there are no new healthcare workers infected during this reporting period, and the total number of infected healthcare workers remains at 18. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 21 states and the number of affected LGAs remaining at 82.

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY

[2] Emergency declared over
Date: Fri 31 May 2019

Following a recent joint epidemiological review by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), WHO Nigeria, and other partners, the federal government on Friday [31 May 2019] declared that the emergency phase of Lassa fever is over.

This is coming after the bodies combated the disease that claimed not less than 129 lives across 21 states in the country. The statement that contained the declaration was co-signed by the NCDC's director general, Chikwe Ihekweazu, and Clement Peter, the officer-in-charge of the World Health Organization, Nigeria, (WHO), Premium Times reports.

The NCDC's boss said that due to an impressive response, the Lassa fever case count has notably dropped, such that the disease in the country has fallen below emergency levels. He said: "This year [2019], there was also a decline in case fatality rate of Lassa fever, from 27% in 2018 to 22% in 2019." However, Ihekweazu said that the deadly disease is not yet over in the country, as there might be few cases of patients with the fever, adding that the agency will work with a multi-sectoral Lassa fever Technical Working Group for co-ordination of efforts. He said: "Given that Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria, it is likely that the country will continue to record cases of Lassa fever. "The group's focus is to continue monitoring cases, as well as improve disease prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, and response activities across all levels in Nigeria.

"However, we have several research strategies to improve our knowledge of the disease. We are also working with states and partners to establish more long-term strategies, such as improved risk communication, infection prevention and control, regular environmental sanitation, enhanced capacity of health workers, and improvement of treatment centres, among others."

On his part, Peter said: "WHO remains committed to working with the government of Nigeria and other partners to sustain and improve Nigeria's capacity to detect, prepare for, and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks, including implementing a Lassa fever research plan and other control strategies."

[Although the emergency phase of this year's (2019's) outbreak has been declared over, new cases continue to occur. As the above comment indicated, there has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 over the past 3 years. Although Nigeria is reaching the end of the usual transmission period of January-June, cases can be expected to occur sporadically for the remainder of this year (2019). Avoidance of contact with reservoir rodents and their excrement will be essential to reduce cases of Lassa fever. Continuing public education will be required to accomplish this goal. That constitutes a daunting effort, considering the wide geographic area in which the virus is endemic. - Mod.TY]
