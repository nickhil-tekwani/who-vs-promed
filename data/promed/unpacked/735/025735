Producers can add yellow vine to the long list of pumpkin diseases
------------------------------------------------------------------
This year [2008], amid a drought and more common disease issues, some
pumpkin producers experienced the impact of a relatively new foe.
Celeste Welty, an Ohio State University Extension entomologist, said
that some of Ohio's pumpkin crop fell victim to yellow vine, a
disease of cucurbits thought to be spread by the squash bug.

Yellow vine disease has been in Ohio since 2003, but only
sporadically. This year [2008], however, was more severe. "Ohio State
specialists believe this may be the worst year yet for yellow vine,"
said Welty. "Because of the nature of how it's spread and the damage
it does to the crops, there's concern that this has the potential to
be a serious disease."

Welty collected samples of pumpkin and squash plants at Waterman Farm
that exhibited symptoms of yellow vine. Half of the samples turned up
positive for the disease. "Diagnosing the disease is tricky because
the yellowing is similar to other diseases and symptoms don't show up
until about 28 days after infection," said Welty. "The key to
managing the disease is controlling the squash bug."

Ohio is one of the nation's top pumpkin-producing states, accounting
for 18 percent of the country's supply in 2007 valued at over USD 33 million.

[Cucurbit yellow vine decline (CYVD) is caused by the phloem-limited
bacterium _Serratia marcescens_. It has been reported to severely
reduce yield in a range of cucurbits such as pumpkin, melons, and
squash, but it does not appear to affect cucumber. Symptoms include
yellowing and wilting of leaves and vines, discolouration of phloem
in lower crown and primary roots, failure to produce fruit, and
plants may collapse and die. The disease is transmitted by squash
bugs (insects of family _Coreidae_ with _Anasa tristis_ a common
species in North America). Squash bugs overwinter as adults. The
bacterium survives within the vector, which spreads it to the new
season's crop. Disease management relies on vector control by crop
rotation, biological, and chemical means. Some genetic resistance in
triploid seedless watermelon has been identified.

_S. marcescens_ is a cosmopolitan microbe with different strains
living in a range of environments including water and soil. Some
strains are non-pathogenic saprophytes while others may affect
vertebrates (including humans) or insects. In plants, some strains
are growth promoting rhizobacteria or potential agricultural
biocontrol agents with anti-fungal properties. The strains involved
in CYVD have been shown to differ significantly from strains isolated
from other ecological niches.
