Cholera Kills at Least 74 in Northern Nigeria
----------------------
The latest outbreak of cholera in Nigeria's northern state of Kano has
claimed at least 74 lives, local radio reported on Wed, 23 Jul 2003.
According to the report, about 500 others have been infected since the
epidemic broke out a week ago in 20 of Kano State's 44 local government
areas, including 2 in the crowded city of Kano itself.
The Kano State government has reportedly allocated 300 000 naira (about
2340 US dollars) for each of the 20 affected local government areas to help
them contain the contagious disease. But the disease has spread to the
neighboring areas and is expected to kill more.

International Organizations concerned about cholera among refugees
----------------------------------------------------
The main concerns expressed today, Fri 25 July 2003, by United Nations
humanitarian aid organizations were the lack of attention given to the
nearly 15 000 refugees from Sierra Leone affected by the conflict in
Liberia, and the close to 2000 cases of cholera that have developed over
the past few weeks.
Ron Redmond, a UNHCR spokesperson, criticized the wealthy nations for not
providing the necessary funds to address the problems of refugees in
Africa. Redmond stated that it is clear that there is a double standard
when implementing measures concerning the refugee population in Africa and
lamented the lack of funds to aid the prisoners from Sierra Leone held in
Liberia.
Approximately 15 000 refugees from Sierra Leone being held in 4 camps close
to Monrovia, the Liberian capital, were forced to flee during the armed
offensive of the rebel group Liberians United for Reconciliation and
Democracy (LURD) whose objective is to depose the government of President
Charles Taylor.
Since then, UNHCR local authorities are trying to organize the repatriation
of these refugees, despite having only 1 vessel that can carry around 300
passengers. Until now, the agency has been able to send back to Sierra
Leone only 1250 refugees. A WHO spokesperson reported that close to 1950
cases of cholera have been registered over the past few weeks in Monrovian
hospitals. More cases are expected. WHO warns of increasing health problems
for the people in central Monrovia, where thousands of people have gathered
out of fear of becoming victims to the armed offensive of the rebel group.
The International Committee of the Red Cross, whose personnel remain in
Monrovia, considers the security conditions in the capital extremely
precarious.
