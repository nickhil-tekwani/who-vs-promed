The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Administration has announced that
there is currently an outbreak of the deadly Lassa Fever within the
FCT and neighbouring Nassarrawa state. The disease has already
claimed 8 lives in 3 weeks, and over 93 cases have been confirmed.

Lassa fever is a very deadly disease that can spread quickly within a
short period of time. It initially has malaria type symptoms and so
is easily mistaken for malaria and under-treated early. It is,
however, very critical to catch it in the very early stages. This is
a highly contagious disease that is transmitted traditionally by rat
urine/feces contamination of food, drink and household items/goods.
It is also transmitted via body fluids and appears to be airborne in
the current form in Abuja.

Symptoms include fever, general fatigue and weakness, headache, sore
throat, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, abdominal
pain, and red spots. In advanced/severe cases, it may lead to a
swollen face, bleeding from orifices (eyes, mouth, nose, genitalia),
low blood pressure, etc.

The good news is that the necessary steps to curb the growing
epidemic are being taken by the FCT Health & Human Services
Secretariat, the Federal Ministry of Health and the World Health
Organization. So there is no need to panic.

Wash all foods; cook all meats thoroughly; store all drink in sealed
containers; keep your house and surroundings as free as possible from
anything that will attract and/or harbor rats. As soon as you suspect
Lassa fever, or if you have persistent fever that does not respond to
standard malaria treatment, report to the nearest FCT Health Centre.
The FCTA is setting up an emergency quarantine facility. You may
reach the FCT Health & Human Services Secretariat at 09-3141098 or
08033138538.

[Concern has been expressed previously about the increase in the
number of Lassa fever cases in Nigeria during the past year. The
figures of 8 deaths and 83 cases within a period of 3 weeks are very
significant, since about 80 percent of human Lassa fever virus
infections are asymptomatic. Those affected suffer multi-system
disease when the virus affects several organs in the body, such as
the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever
ranges from 6-21 days. The current increase in cases of Lassa fever
in some parts of Nigeria may be a consequence of increased abundance
of the vector (the multimammate rat) or some other factor resulting
in increased contact between humans and rodents, promoting the spread
of the disease in the human population.
