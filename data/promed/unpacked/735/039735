TULAREMIA - SPAIN (NORTHERN): VOLE RESERVOIR

Voles have spread tularemia to nearly 100 people and threatened Spain's
food crops in northern areas. This has prompted the authorities to approve
burning fields to destroy the pests.
There are about 70 varieties of voles around the world and usually the
small rodents are not so destructive. But 750 million voles have invaded
fields in Spain's north chomping their way through crops that include
potatoes, beets, barley, lettuce, and vineyards. The increase in disease
and destruction of crops on 988 000 acres (about 340 000 hectares) infested
by the pests has led authorities to approve burning the voles. That was
after authorities had tried and failed to eliminate the rodents by
destroying their burrows and using poison and small controlled burns.
Although authorities say that only about 88 people have the disease,
farmers dispute those figures and say more than 100 have become sick,
Spain's daily El Pais reported on Wed 8 Aug 2007 according to Expatica
magazine. On that day, authorities torched vole-infested area in the
Valladolid area of Castile-Leon region in an effort to protect the potato
and beet crop there, BBC news reported on 9 Aug 2007. Officials will also
soon set fire to fields in Avila, Palencia, and Segovia in an effort to
kill the voles there.
No one, including Castile-Leon's agriculture minister, Silvia Clemente, has
an answer for why there are so many voles this year [2007].

[The manifestations of tularemia in these cases is not stated but it is
likely that aerosolization of the bacteria is occurring (as discussed
below) so that pneumonic manifestations of the disease may be occurring in
addition to ulceroglandular, glandular, and typhoidal, the former 2 related
to direct skin contact). In this way, direct contact with the vole is not
needed. This moderator is unable to discuss the burning method as a way to
address this serious problem.
A number of outbreaks of tularemia have been reported related to rodents
(see information on voles below). One (Reintjes R, Dedushaj I, Ardiana A,
et al. Tularemia Outbreak Investigation in Kosovo: Case Control and
Environmental Studies. Emerg Infect Dis 2002; 8: 59-63) states (with the
citation numbers altered to start at 1:
"A disrupted agricultural environment, deserted homes, and unprotected food
stores in Kosovo in spring 1999 likely resulted in a rapid increase in
rodent populations favorable for epizootic spread of tularemia in rodents
and consequent widespread environmental contamination with _Francisella
tularensis_. Although this organism does not produce spores or multiply
outside animal hosts, it can survive for months in cold, moist conditions.
Large outbreaks of human tularemia in Europe have been described following
contamination of the environment with rodent excrement and carcasses (1-7).
The largest occurred as a result of disrupted agricultural environments
because of warfare on the Eastern Front during World War II (1). These
outbreaks have often been associated with a broad spectrum of tularemia
syndromes, including high proportions of cases with pleuropneumonic and
typhoidal presentations. It is unclear, however, whether these cases arose
from inhalation or ingestion exposures, or both.

The World War II outbreak referred to above has been thought perhaps to be
related to bioterrorism. But an editorial related to the siege of
Stalingrad in Military Medicine 2001; 166(10)
(<http://cns.miis.edu/research/cbw/tula.htm>) stated (again with the
references renumbered to start at 1:
"According to one Soviet retrospective: "Late in the fall of 1942,
epicenters of the tularemia epizootic in the field mouse [lit: vole] were
detected in the basin of the Don-delta.
"Concurrently, cases of tularemia were registered among the local
population. More than 75 per cent of the population was hit by tularemia in
individual locations of the Stalingrad area.... As the health centers were
practically out of order at this time, the entire burden of the treatment
of the infected population was taken up by the military-medical front
service. (1)
"One of these studies reports an even higher rate of pulmonary involvement
in tularemia infections (95.2 per cent) during the battle of Stalingrad
caused by inhaled dust from infected straw. (The production of similar
airborne fomites, as well as the predominance of the inhalation route of
infection among certain populations, is consistent with other outbreaks
that have occurred in Martha's Vineyard (2) in the USA as well as in
Finland (3) and Sweden (4).) According to one Russian Journal article in
1980, the war disturbed normal agricultural activities of the population in
the areas near the front. Crops remained unharvested and the grass uncut.
Thus was created a large source of food for rodents, and in the fall of
1942 large numbers of mice, field mice, forest mice, shrews, and others
appeared in the trenches and dugouts (5). The high prevalence of tularemia
among Red Army soldiers was "associated with the use of hay for bedding in
entrenchments, dig-outs, and trenches" and only got worse as infected
rodents followed the soldiers into their hastily built military
fortifications (6). However, in addition to inhalation exposures, many of
the tularemia infections were also linked to "eating biscuits and other
baked food touched by the rodents, using water from wells, which was
infected by the bodies of the rodents that died as a result of tularemia."

Voles (<http://www.voles.com/>), often called meadow mice or field mice,
occupy a wide variety of habitats, depending on the species. Generally,
voles prefer areas with heavy ground cover of grasses, grass-like plants,
or litter. They are active both day and night and throughout the year.
Voles eat a variety of plants and animals. They frequently forage on
grasses, forbs, roots, bulbs, tubers, bark, snails, and insects. To find
food, voles construct tunnels and surface runways with many burrow
openings. Several adults and young can live in these runway systems. This
intricate network of tunnels and burrows provide voles with excellent
shelter from the weather and protection from predators. Voles store seeds
and other plant matter in underground chambers.
