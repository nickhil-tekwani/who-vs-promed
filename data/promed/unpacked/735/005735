Comforting dying pets through their last days turned out to be dangerous for animal owners who wound up with life-threatening infections from the close contact, a new report finds. A dog owner who licked honey from the dropper she used to feed her pooch, and 2 cat owners who cuddled and kissed their kitties for days were hospitalized with respiratory illnesses linked to common bacteria the pets harbor in their mouths.

The case studies, reported in the latest issue of the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, highlight the rare hazards of animal intimacy in a country where 9 in 10 owners regard pets as members of the family, says the study's lead author.

"I suspect this happens more often than we know," said Dr Joseph Myers, chairman of the department of medicine at Summa Akron City Hospital in Akron, Ohio. "It'll put it on the radar so that doctors will ask about it." Myers believes he's the 1st to report cases of _Pasteurella multocida_ infections associated with palliative care by owners of dying pets. It's rare, of course, but it was striking to encounter 3 such incidents all within a year, he said.

Typically, _ P. multocida_ bacteria live in the mouths of 80 per cent of cats and about 60 per cent of dogs, Myers said. The bacteria lurk in the oral cavities of many wild and domesticated animals. They're usually passed along through bites, scratches or other unfriendly behavior, and are the most common cause of skin infections from such animal-related injuries. It's not clear exactly how many infections occur each year, though health experts at the University of California at Los Angeles note that only about 5 per cent of dog bites and 30 per cent of cat bites become infected.

The infections can occur through normal affectionate interaction with animals, the routine licking or kissing that some pets and owners can't resist, Myers said. Babies, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems are most at risk because their immune systems can't fight infections as well.

In the cases of the 3 pet owners in the study, all women in their 50s or 60s, they were previously healthy, but Myers suspects that the sustained close contact simply increased their chances of infection. The bacteria targeted their respiratory tracts, attacking one woman's epiglottis, another's uvula and the lungs of the third. They showed up at hospital emergency rooms reporting fever, chills, sore and swollen throats and difficulty swallowing and breathing. Quick administration of antibiotics helped, and all recovered within days.

The tricky part was figuring out what caused the unusual bacterial infections. It took careful questioning on the part of doctors to determine that the transmission had come through such close pet care. The pet owners weren't available for interviews, but Myers' study offered details of how they likely became sick. In the case of the dog, "the patient had co-consumed honey with the dog by licking the same dropper used to comfort-feed the dog," the report said. Another patient "continuously held, caressed, hugged and kissed her cat during the last 7 days of its life." The 3rd "had provided palliative care to her dying cat by holding, hugging and kissing the head of the cat and allowing the cat to lick her hands and arms."

That doesn't surprise Anthony J Smith, a veterinarian who runs Rainbow Bridge Vet Services, a pet hospice and palliative services business in Hercules, California. In a country where two-thirds of households have pets and 9 in 10 owners say they regard them as family members, according to a 2011 Harris poll, it makes sense to care for the animals at the end of life. More pet owners -- Smith calls them "pet parents" -- are seeking to make their pets' deaths more comfortable and meaningful, even when they can't prevent them. "There's a general increase in the closeness between people and their pets," said Smith, who treated 1000 pet clients in the past 2 years. "They're wanting the same kind of services that they want for their human family members."

Smith, who helped co-found the International Association of Animal Hospice and Palliative Care, understands the urge to closely care for pets and he doesn't want people to avoid physical contact with their animals. Still, he advises common sense. "When you start licking your cat or dog or you start sharing utensils with your dog, you put yourself at risk for those things," he said. "Those probably weren't the best ideas from a human health perspective."

Myers, the doctor who wrote the study, agreed. "I would not recommend that." But even Myers admitted the cases haven't altered how he cares for his 3 dogs. Would it have changed the behavior of the women who got sick? "I don't think so," Myers said. "These pets are so ingrained into the family."

[_Pasteurella multocida_ is a pathogen that can infect a whole variety of animals including fowl and pigs and as noted is normal oral flora in cats and dogs. The commonest manifestation of _P. multocida_ in humans is usually caused by a cat bite and manifest by a rapidly (often less than 4 hours) developing local soft tissue infection with redness and swelling and purple not discharge at the puncture site. I can personally attest to its short incubation period having been bitten by my daughter's cat Mokie. The Gram stain of the discharge will reveal many white cells and small coccobacilli that can show bipolar staining. The organism is quite sensitive to antimicrobials including penicillin. One easy to note microbiological feature is that the organism does not grow on MacConkey agar.

More invasive infections in humans can be caused by this organism including the ones described here as well as arthritis, meningitis, peritonitis and pneumonia. Close contact, bite or otherwise, with the oral secretions of dogs and especially cats is often associated with the infection but a significant number of cases do not have a clear history of such animal exposure. - Mod.LL]
