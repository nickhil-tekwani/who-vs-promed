ed.html>

President Jacques Chirac urged drastic new precautions against mad cow
disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) and a top health official
predicted more people would die as France's proud culinary tradition took a
hammering.
Chirac called on the government to suspend immediately the use of meat and
bone meal (MBM) in all animal feed amid growing anxiety about the spread of
BSE .
"With the rise in the number of cases of BSE in France, it is highly likely
that we will have dozens of cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(nvCJD). We must prepare for that," Gillot said.
Gillot's comments came as Paris, Bordeaux and other cities stripped beef
from school menus, bringing to over a dozen the number of municipalities
that have taken matters into their own hands.
The latest food scare, when several supermarket chains announced they had
sold beef potentially contaminated with BSE, has shattered consumer
confidence in a country where meat is at the heart of the dining experience.
It has also hit the reputation of French beef abroad, with several eastern
European countries slapping curbs or all-out bans on imports of its meat.
The bans hit all the harder for a country which has refused to lift its own
ban on British beef following an outbreak of BSE across the Channel.
The left-wing government, which has always said public health was
paramount, found itself under the gun following Chirac's call for a ban on
the use of MBM for all animals, not just cattle.
Farm Minister Jean Glavany said the country was losing its senses and there
was no question of banning beef or of banning all use of MBM until the
national food safety agency, AFFSA, had finished analysing the issue.
Chirac said the authorities should not wait the 3 or 4 months it could take
AFSSA to deliver a verdict and should instead act now to protect consumers
from the fatal, brain- wasting disease.
France has started reporting far more cases of BSE since the government
started tests in June to gauge the extent of the illness among its 21
million cattle.
France's farm ministry reported 3 new cases of BSE on Monday, bringing the
total this year to 89, nearly triple the 30 cases reported last year.
Most scientists are convinced eating contaminated beef is the most likely
mode of transmission of the disease from cattle to humans.

Spain has told the European Commission of its ban on imports of French
breeding cattle over fears of BSE but has yet to provide detailed reasons
for the decision, EU officials said.
"We were informed yesterday, but we are still waiting for the scientific
justification," said Commission spokesman Gregor Kreuzhuber. EU member
states are allowed to take such action -- known as a safeguard measure --
only if there is a demonstrable public health risk. Many countries took
such steps in the wake of Belgium"s dioxin food scare last year.
Once Spain has provided scientific reasoning in an official notification,
this will be passed to the EU"s Standing Veterinary Committee for
consideration. If the committee agrees with the reasons, then it may
recommend EU measures. If it sees no justification, Spain could be ordered
to lift the embargo. "The sooner we get the justification, the sooner we
can proceed," Kreuzhuber added.

es/001110/world/afp/Europe_s_ongoing_battle_with_BSE.html>

Europe's battle against "mad cow" disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), is still being fought in a haphazard fashion, with
countries who are on the ball in testing programs at risk of being penalized.
The suspicions of food safety experts fall on whether or not EU precautions
over the spread of BSE are being implemented effectively. Another of their
worries is trying to plug the gaps in Europe's anti-BSE wall when dealing
with non-EU countries. At the center of the EU, "no country is completely
safe, not even in the almost-no-risk category, "said Gerard Pascal,
president of the EU's scientific committee. Testing remains an area with no
uniform approach. The European testing program for BSE will only be imposed
on EU countries in January 2001.
However, Switzerland and then France took the lead in introducing tests and
have consequently found the number of confirmed BSE cases increased. Both
countries are considering a total ban on bone meal in all animal feed, a
precaution already in place in both Britain and Portugal, the worst hit
countries.
By imposing such preventative measures across the board, fraud and mistakes
could be reduced, and new cases avoided. Animal grounds and bonemeal, at
the root of the BSE problem, were banned in Britain in 1988.But the country
continued to export the meal across the rest of Europe. Britain has
destroyed 4.5 million head of cattle since the epidemic broke out in 1986
and reported 177 000 cases of BSE up until the end of October this year.
As a further safety measure, any animals over 30 months old were taken out
of the food chain. The 30 month period allows for a margin of error with
the minimum incubation period for BSE believed to be 5 years. Infected
animals are destroyed along with their calf, but other cattle in the herd
are allowed to pass directly into the food chain. This is unlike the
situation in Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy where the whole
herd is destroyed if a single case of BSE is found.
But the ministry of agriculture justifies the practice, saying that all
risk-affected offal is removed. The country also prides itself on following
the EU's rules on cattle tracing.
The situation in Portugal is still worrying. The country reported 466 cases
of BSE up until September this year. But Portugal's system of tracing and
monitoring both cattle and BSE cases is not considered to be reliable,
according to experts cited. According to Cardoso Sende, lawyer for the
Portuguese order of veterinary surgeons, "In Portugal it is impossible to
trace the history of an animal from where it was farmed to its slaughter".
Ireland, which has reported over 550 cases of BSE since the first in the
country in 1989, has this year reported a resurgence in cases. Italy has
only reported 3 cases of the disease, in 1994, which came from Britain.
Germany, meanwhile, reported 6, again from abroad.
Germany only banned the use of brain in regional specialties destined for
human consumption in October this year. Cattle brain is considered a high
risk part of the body for carrying BSE.
Spain has not reported any BSE cases, but is still preparing its tracking
system to be ready for 1 Jan 2001.
Belgium has seen 18 cases of BSE up until October this year and has a raft
of precautions including a tracking system, and measures for destroying
cattle.
New rules are soon to be imposed to protect Europe from the spread of BSE.
"From 1 Apr 2001, countries importing meat and meat-based products into
Europe must follow rules on food safety which exclude high-risk parts of
cattle," Pascal says.
Seventy countries have filed reports with the EU. Any that are unconvincing
will find themselves having to conform to the highest levels of food safety
which apply to Britain and Portugal, according to Pascal.
"Calculations have shown that a single animal entering a batch of ravioli
for example, will be exposed to 300 000 to 400 000 people, even if is in
very small doses," he says. New variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease
(nvCJD),the human form of BSE has struck 85 people in Britain, 80 of whom
died, as well as 1 person in Ireland and 3 in France.
Distrust of French beef has gained pace recently, with Italy, Germany and
Greece sharply cutting back on imports. Spain has announced a ban on French
beef imports but has not said when it will be imposed. The EU has
criticized the move saying it is not necessary.
Outside the EU, Russia and Bulgaria have announced a reduction on French
imports, while Poland and Hungary have imposed bans. Meanwhile, 2 new cases
of BSE have been reported in France, bringing to 94 the number of cases
registered in the country since the beginning of the year.
