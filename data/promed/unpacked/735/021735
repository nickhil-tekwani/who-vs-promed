A new regulation on plant protection should come into effect on 1 Jul 2001
in Switzerland.
The concerned plant species [include multiplication material [but
excludes seeds and fruits of the following: Fruit trees: _Malus_ (apple),
_Prunus_ (apricot, cherry, peach, plum), _Pyrus_ (pear trees, including
Oriental pear trees); and _Vitis_ (grapevines)
From 1 Apr 2002, plants belonging to the species listed above should have
a 'phytosanitary passport' when marketed. The passport shall certify that:
(1) the plants have been produced by a registered company which has been
allowed to deliver phytosanitary passports; and
(2) the plants come from plots in which no quarantine organism was detected
during the production period.
The passport for imported plants shall be delivered at the border by the
Federal Phytosanitary Service. The passport should be shown during all the
steps of the marketing chain, except when the product is delivered to an
end user who shall use [the plant only for non-professional growing. This
exception shall not be applied in the fire blight protection areas (see
below).
Companies which produce or import plants should [register with the Federal
Phytosanitary Service. Nursery companies should register before 15 Aug
2001, other companies before 31 Dec 2001.
[Passports associated with plant shippings should be kept for at least 3
years by the buyer.
The cantons of Bern, Fribourg/Freiburg, Geneva, Graubunden, Jura,
Neuchatel, Ticino, Vaud and Valais/Wallis are declared 'fire
blight-protected'. From 15 Sep 2001, transport of host plants [infected
with fire blight shall be [subjected to specific regulations.
Introduction of host plants from non-protected areas shall be possible only
if specific requirements are fulfilled.

[Many thanks to Ivan Sache for providing this information. According to
Ivan, fire blight is currently a very "hot" issue in Switzerland. Only a
few species are listed because the original list of plant species included
those that are not monitored by ProMED-Mail. An international workshop on
fire blight is set for later this year (8-12 Oct 2001 -- 9th International
Workshop On Fire Blight, Napier, New Zealand. Contact: C.N. Hale,
