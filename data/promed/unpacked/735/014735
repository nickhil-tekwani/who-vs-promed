The tropical medicine unit in the Carlos III
Hospital has diagnosed the first 7 cases of
chikungunya virus infection. The hospital's
tropical medicine experts explained that these
cases were diagnosed in people who had traveled
to the Mauritius Islands, Equatorial Guinea,
Cameroon and India, where they had been infected
by the bite of infected mosquitoes. This series
of [chikungunya] cases being studied by [medical
personnel] in the hospital is the most extensive ever registered in Spain.
The specialists advise that persons intending to
travel to tropical areas should consult travel
medicine specialists, such as those at the Carlos
III Hospital, at least a month before departure.

[This is the 1st report ProMED has seen this year
[2006] of CHIK infection occurring in West Africa
(Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon). The literature
records that up to 1978 CHIK infection had not
been recorded in West Africa other than Nigeria
and Senegal, Sierra Leone and Liberia (by
serology) -- ref: A W Woodruff, E T Bowen, & G S
Platt 1978 Viral infections in travellers from
tropical Africa. Br Med J. 1978 April 15;
1(6118): 956ï¿½958 (full text accessible
online). A later paper reported CHIK positive
serology in Namibia -- ref: Joubert JJ, et al.
1983 Prevalence of hepatitis virus and some
arbovirus infections in Kavango, northern
SWA/Namibia. S Afr Med J. 1985 Mar
30;67(13):500-2, and a still later one on the
Republic of Guinea.(not to be confused with
Equatorial Guinea) -- ref: Ivanov AP, et
al. Serological investigations of Chikungunya
virus in the Republic of Guinea. Ann Soc Belg
Med Trop. 1992 Mar;72(1):73-4. Anyone with
further information of the current situation in
West Africa is asked to tell us, giving date, name & URL of source. - Mod.JW]
[It is always prudent that travelers be aware of
the health risks they may encounter in foreign
countries and receive appropriate vaccinations in
advance. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine
available against chikungunya virus, although
travelers need to know that they should avoid
being bitten by _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae.
albopictus_ mosquitoes that transmit the
virus. This report from Spain is a compelling
example of importation of a single viral disease
from several widely divergent foreign sources,
making it essential that primary health providers
take adequate travel histories from their
patients and know what diseases are being
actively transmitted abroad. - Mod.TY]
