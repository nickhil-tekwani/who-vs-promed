For the last 2 years Bashkiria has experienced a serious rise in
echinococcosis. During this year [2008] there were 53 cases
identified; that is 1.7 times higher than last year. People who are at
risk are those who are in contact with cattle or other domestic animals

The danger of the disease is that it can be latent for years and then
reveal itself. Preventive measures include: limit contact with dogs,
washing hands after each contact with animals, after work in an
orchard [where cattle have wandered], do not use unwashed greens or
vegetables, and do not drink water from natural [untreated] sources.

[Echinococcosis has been known for more than 2000 years and is a still
an important human health problem. More than 500 cases are registered
in Russia annually. In recent years the number of cases have increased
3 times. Fatal cases are associated with late diagnosis, for example
in 2005 there were 3 fatal cases due to echinococcosis. A high rate of
infection among animals is seen if control measures and dog deworming
are not performed regularly. - Mods.BA,NR.

Infections with _E.granulosus_ are well known in the Southern Urals
(Lukmanova. et al. Identification of the causative agent of
echinococcosis in the population of the South Urals. Med Parazitol
(Mosk). 2007;4:29-31, in Russian). The most probable reason for the
increase in the human population, as suggested here, is an increase in
the number of dogs, especially those used for herding sheep. This
could be the equivalent to the dog-reindeer cycle described in Siberia
(Rausch RL. Cystic echinococcosis in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic.
Parasitology. 2003;127 Suppl:S73-85. Review). - Mod.EP.
