HK government says more H5N1 flu in dead birds found
-----------------------------------------------
The Hong Kong government said on Wednesday [1 Feb 2006] that 2 dead
birds -- a wild crested myna and a domestic chicken smuggled in from
mainland China -- had tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus.
3 people who came into contact with the fowl and ate another chicken
that had also been around the smuggled bird have been put into
isolation at a local hospital for tests.
Preliminary results were expected on Thursday [2 Feb 2006].
The chicken and myna double the number of dead birds that Hong Kong
government tests in the past 2 weeks have shown to have H5N1, a
strain of bird flu that has killed 85 people worldwide since late 2003.
As a precaution, the government will cull all poultry within 5 km
(3.1 miles) of the small holding where the chicken died and also
close the city's walk-in aviaries and a large nature reserve, said
Thomas Sit, Acting Assistant Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation.
It was unclear where the chicken caught the deadly disease, said
Thomas Tsang, Consultant of the Centre for Health Protection of the
Department of Health.
"We do not know whether the chicken was infected in the mainland or
whether it was infected in Hong Kong," he told a news conference. "We
can't really draw any conclusions yet."
The bird was smuggled into Hong Kong on 26 Jan 2006 without symptoms
and became ill on 31 Jan 2006. The typical incubation period for the
disease in birds is 2 to 10 days, he said.
The chicken was brought illegally into Hong Kong ahead of the Lunar
New Year period. Despite bird flu worries, the government increased
the number of chickens shipped into Hong Kong from mainland China
around the 29 Jan 2006 Lunar New Year.
The chicken fell ill and died about half a km (0.3 miles) from the
border with China in an area where the government said on Sunday [29
Jan 2006] that an Oriental Magpie Robin also died of H5N1.
The dead crested myna was found in an urban playground, Tsang said.
Hong Kong farms have strict biosecurity measures in place that keep
poultry from coming into contact with wild birds, but there are many
small, unprotected backyard farms raising small flocks.
The Hong Kong government pledged to cull all the chickens in the
territory in the event of 2 confirmed H5N1 cases in local poultry
farms and suspend the local live poultry trade.
Several Chinese provinces have reported H5N1 outbreaks, but not
Guangdong, which is adjacent to Hong Kong.

Turkish Cypriots cull 1200 poultry to halt bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Turkish Cypriot authorities said on Wednesday [1 Feb 2006] they had
culled about 1200 poultry in a district struck by avian flu in an
attempt to stop the disease from spreading.
The European Commission confirmed last Sunday [29 Jan 2006] the
presence of the deadly H5N1 strain of avian flu in a sample taken
from dead poultry in northern Cyprus, fanning fears that the virus is
advancing towards Europe from Asia.
"We have killed around 1200 poultry within a 10 km (6 mile) radius of
the village where the dead birds were found," Kamil Aktulgali, head
of the Turkish Cypriot government's veterinary service, told Reuters.
He said authorities had stepped up monitoring of poultry around the
enclave and were rounding up and culling stray birds.
Health services have been disinfecting vehicles passing across the
U.N.-patrolled Green Line which divides Cyprus into Greek Cypriot and
Turkish Cypriot zones.
Cyprus is represented in the European Union and other international
bodies by the larger, internationally recognized Greek Cypriot south.
Only Turkey recognizes the breakaway Turkish Cypriot enclave in the
north of the island.
Erhan Ercin, the Turkish Cypriot government's EU coordinator, said EU
experts visiting the island were satisfied with the enclave's efforts
to contain the virus.
"The 2 EU experts who came to northern Cyprus have told us that all
measures taken are adequate," he said.
Both Greek and Turkish Cypriot authorities are anxious to ensure that
bird flu is brought swiftly under control for fear that it might
scare away tourists this year [2006]. Tourism is a mainstay of the
economy on both sides of the Green Line.

Local authorities in northern Iraq have culled half a million birds
in the border areas with Turkey and Iran.
Iraqi Kurdistan has quarantined 14 people suspected of suffering from
bird flu, but officials say that other than the fatality, only one
case is suspected to be the H5N1 deadly strain.
Agriculture Minister Ali al-Bahadli said Monday [30 Jan 2006] that
the government was equipped to confront the crisis.
"We have a lot of capacity to confront the disease and have
antiseptic and medical equipment to prevent people from being
infected by bird flu, and we have sources from where we can obtain
more," he said.
An emergency plan was ready for implementation in any region of Iraq
to avoid the spread of the disease, he said.
Tahseen Nameq, head of the joint Kurdish committee set up to combat
the diseases, said a massive program has been launched to cull birds
in Kurdistan, in border regions north of Sulaimaniyah near Lake
Dukan, in Raniya and also north of Arbil.
"So far we have killed 500 000 birds. In some of these areas we have
killed 50 percent of all birds and in others only 30 percent," Nameq said.
Shamal Abdel Wafa, the head of the Kurdish agriculture department,
said at the press conference that 100 teams began work 3 days ago to
cull all birds in designated areas.
Turkey, which has had 21 cases of the flu, was previously the only
country outside Asia to report fatalities from the virus. 4 people
have died there.
