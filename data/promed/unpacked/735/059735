Health officials in Argentina report that a trichinellosis outbreak reported on April 27 has now affected 119 people in a number of cities and towns in Córdoba province.

According to the information reported by different health centers in the province, the cases include 50 from Toledo, 23 from Lozada [both in Santa María department], 27 from Río Segundo [department], and 19 from the city of Córdoba.

All patients reported the consumption of chacinados (salami) without labeling and they are being treated on an outpatient basis.

Health officials warn about the risks of consuming or buying pork of doubtful origin or without the corresponding sanitary inspection and remarked that the commercialization of meat or its derivatives from unauthorized establishments is totally prohibited.

Trichinellosis is a parasitic disease caused most commonly by the roundworm _Trichinella spiralis_. If someone ingests undercooked or raw meat with the encysted larvae, the stomach acid releases the larvae which mature to adults in the intestine.

After about a week the female starts releasing larvae which enter the bloodstream and find their way to skeletal muscle where they encapsulate.

There can be gastrointestinal symptoms mimicking acute food poisoning when there is activity of the adults in the intestine.

The sudden appearance of fever, muscle soreness, and pain with swelling of parts of the face are early classic signs. This can sometimes be followed by retinal hemorrhages and other ocular signs.

With heavy infections, cardiac, respiratory, and neurological problems may ensue with death by heart failure being most common. The more larvae you ingest, the more serious the disease.

[Argentina, especially Cordoba Province has seen repeated outbreaks of trichinellosis over the past decade (see below). The sources are so-called backyard pigs reared on small private farms and sold without veterinary inspection. - Mod.EP
