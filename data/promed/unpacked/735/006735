Asia
----
Bangladesh
----------
A H5N1 HPAI outbreak in Rajshahi Division (Bogra District) was reported on
20 May 2010.

Indonesia
---------
The Participatory Disease Surveillance & Response (PDSR) programme, through
33 Local Disease Control Centres, covers 70 338 villages in 84 per cent of
Indonesia's 448 districts and municipalities in 29 of its 33 provinces.
During April 2010, PDSR conducted surveillance in 2278 villages (3.2 per
cent). The overall HPAI incidence was 1.0 newly found infected village per
1000 villages in the coverage area, but incidence varied widely between
provinces. The 4 highest provinces for incidence were Yogyakarta (9.1),
Jawa Tengah (3.4), Lampung (2.8), and Kepulauan Bangka Belitung (2.7). The
number of newly infected villages found during April 2010 by island is: 27
in Sumatra, 44 in Java, and 1 in Kalimantan.

Mongolia
--------
A total of 26 whooper swans (_Cygnus cygnus_) and greylag geese (_Anser
anser_) died at Ganga Lake, Dariganga Soum, Sukhbaatar Aimag on 3 May 2010.
On 8 May 2010, H5N1 HPAI was confirmed by the national laboratory by HA,
RT-PCR and RRT-PCR.

Viet Nam
--------
Outbreaks of H5N1 HPAI [which] occurred in Dak Lak Province in May 2010 and
Quang Nam Province in June 2010 were reported on the Government website.
The last outbreak occurred on 2 Jun 2010 in ducks in Duy Thanh Commune Duy

H5N1 HPAI global overview April 2010: worldwide situation
---------------------------------------------------------
[From the said detailed review, we hereby present the conclusions chapter.
- Mod.AS]

Conclusions
-----------
Since 2003, 63 countries/territories have experienced outbreaks of H5N1
HPAI. The last newly infected country was Bhutan in February 2010.
Effective control measures for outbreaks in poultry have been associated
with reduced incidence of human infections in several countries. However,
H5N1 HPAI remains entrenched in poultry in parts of Asia and Africa (Egypt)
and thus the risk of human infection remains.

The number of countries reporting outbreaks was less in 2009, when compared
with 2008, 2007, and 2006. However, the number of affected countries
between January and April 2010 already equals the number of affected
countries for the whole of 2009. The total number of outbreaks reported
shows a similar, but more pronounced, trend, although surprisingly, the
total number of outbreaks between January and April 2010 already surpasses
the number of outbreaks for the whole of 2009, 356 vs. 297. Nevertheless,
the number of reported outbreaks is a more subjective indicator than the
number of affected countries, because it is highly influenced by variables
such as the case definition used, the awareness level, the
intensity/effectiveness of surveillance programmes in countries and the
willingness to report. Although there has been an improvement in disease
awareness, outbreaks/cases of H5N1 HPAI are still likely to be
underestimated and underreported in some regions because of limitations in
the capacity of veterinary services to implement sensitive and
cost-effective disease surveillance, the lack of proper outbreak
investigations in the field, and the absence or weakness of compensation
schemes.

Data from previous years have shown a peak in the number of outbreaks/cases
during the January-March 2010 period in terms of countries affected, number
of reported outbreaks and also human cases. In April 2010, it becomes
evident that we are in the decreasing trend that follows the high activity
season. While February 2010 constituted the peak so far this season in
terms of the number of outbreaks reported, the peak in terms of number of
countries affected was reached in March 2010. Overall, there is a
decreasing trend in the height of the peak as years go by. However, in
terms of number of outbreaks, and against the decreasing trend observed
since 2004, the peak height reached dimensions similar to the peaks of
2006-2007 and 2007- 2008, and considerably higher than the 2008-2009 peak.
This is explained by the higher contribution of Africa (Egypt) to the total
number of outbreaks, because of the implementation of a more intensive
surveillance programme (CAHO), together with the fact that vaccination of
backyard poultry was stopped in July 2009. It may also be related to a
reduction in the efficacy of control programmes (fatigue).

During 2010, H5N1 HPAI has reoccurred in several countries where the
disease was believed to have been eliminated (without vaccination):
Cambodia, Israel, Myanmar, Nepal, Romania, and Bulgaria. In the cases of
Bangladesh and India, that had reported no outbreaks in the 2nd half of
2009, a new wave of cases has been observed since the beginning of 2010.
