Tainted fruit blamed for Bangladesh Nipah outbreaks
---------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: Bangladeshis who fell sick with the new anddangerous Nipah virus
in recent years probably caught it from eating contaminated fruit or from
contact with infected domestic animals, scientists said.

There have been 9 Nipah outbreaks in Bangladesh since 2001, resulting in
the deaths of between 40 and 100 per cent of infected people, said Jahangir
Hossain, of the Dhaka Hospital, at the International Centre for Diarrheal
Disease Research in Bangladesh. "Three outbreaks in Bangladesh were caused
when people ate fresh date palm sap, a local sweet delicacy, which had been
contaminated by bats," Hossain said in a statement issued by the Society
for General Microbiology. "Because both people and animals in Bangladesh
often eat fresh date palm sap and fruits which have been bitten by bats,
contaminated food and domestic animals form an important transmission
pathway for Nipah virus to infect people."

Fruit bats are believed to be a natural reservoir of Nipah virus, which was
first seen when it killed more than 100 people out of 257 infected in
Malaysia in 1999. According to local media reports the virus has killed at
least 89 people in Bangladesh since 2001. Hossain said the first outbreaks
in Malaysia started when pigs on farms ate fruit which had been bitten by
infected bats. The pigs later developed coughs and breathing difficulties,
and the virus soon spread to pig farmers and abattoir workers.

The deadly brain and lung disease is now spreading into rural India and
Bangladesh. In one outbreak in Bangladesh, people became infected after
contact with sick cows, while close contact with pig herds was associated
with another outbreak.

Hossain's team is working with date palm sap collectors to stop bats from
contaminating date palm sap. "If we can identify the fact to be passed from
bats to humans so frequently, we might be able to help intervene and
interfere with the transmission pathways," he said. "Current efforts should
focus on restricting the consumption of fruit bitten by bats, restricting
human contact with sick animals, and protecting date palm sap from
contamination by bat secretions."

[This report confirms the suspected important role of contaminated date
palm juice in the transmission of Nipah virus infection from bats to humans
in east Bengal. Transmission of Nipah virus to humans via sick cattle has
not been described previously (as far as I am aware) and further details
would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
