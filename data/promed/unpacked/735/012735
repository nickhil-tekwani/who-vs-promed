Anthrax outbreak, Etosha National Park
--------------------------------------
We've found 90 dead plains zebra (_Equus quagga_) in the 2 months
since 1 Feb 2010 (when things started picking up). Of 46 tested thus
far, 29 were confirmed positive for _Bacillus anthracis_ by selective
culture at the Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL) in Windhoek. Of the
17 that tested negative, 8 were suspected to have died of anthrax
based on carcass freshness, lack of coagulation, and lack of any sign
of predation. We have also found 18 springbok (_Antidorcas
marsupialis_) carcasses since 1 Feb 2010, of which 6 have been tested
and of those 4 were confirmed positive via selective culture.

For comparison, in all of last year [2009] we found 100 zebra
carcasses of which 58 were confirmed anthrax via culture (at CVL) and
subsequent PCR (by a collaborator at the University of Hohenheim). We
considered last year to be a very big year for anthrax in Etosha. This
year [2010] is even more exceptional.

In Etosha, where anthrax is seasonally endemic, zebra have always
constituted the majority of reported carcasses testing positive for
anthrax. Carcass incidence tends to peak at the end of the rainy
season (March-April) in zebra, while elephant outbreaks occur during
the dry season. So far this year [2010] the carcass count for zebra is
unusually high.

In response to your query regarding tabanid and blow fly transmission
of spores: I am aware of the proposed kudu-blowfly transmission cycle
for Kruger [National Park]. [Kudu are browsers (they feed on bushes &
trees). - Mod.MHJ] We do have blowflies but they preferentially rest
on browse, not grass, and are unlikely to be key in zebra transmission
[which are grazers. - Mod.MHJ]. I do not see any reason why a tabanid
transmission cycle would cause increased incidence this year [2010]
compared to other years, as this year has been an average rainfall
year and carcasses started appearing earlier than usual.

There are also many other factors that must be considered when noting
the rather large incidence. The majority of the Okaukuejo area of
Etosha (where most carcasses are observed) burned this past October
[2009], and it's possible that may have altered some ecological aspect
related to transmission. The burning of these plains occurs rarely
(but has happened twice in the past 5 years) and is strongly
correlated with high grass biomass from the exceptionally rainy wet
season last year (late November 2008 to April 2009) in which we
experienced nearly double the average rainfall. During that wet
season, we believed the high rainfall to be somehow related to the
high anthrax incidence. This wet season (late November 2009 to now)
has seen average rainfall, and so the correlation between high
rainfall and high anthrax incidence generally seen in Etosha has not
held. Also note that zebra are highly mobile animals and herds move
considerable distances daily as well as display seasonal patterns in
movement. As we only see carcasses when they are near roads, movement
of herds to and away from roads will heavily influence carcass records.

In addition to affecting many other ecological factors, rainfall
affects animal movement and may impact carcass incidence simply by
causing animals to move towards or away from areas where surveillance
effort is high. Surveillance effort varies depending on researcher
presence in the park and can also partially account for patterns in
incidence. Despite these and other biases in the data, it appears that
this year [2010] is an exceptionally high year for anthrax in Etosha.

[Patently there is a need for a lot more research in Etosha on the
ecology and epidemiology of this disease and its agent. The only thing
that jumps out at me is that if the thick ground cover got burnt off
last October (2009), the grazing species ***(not zebra)*** will be
grazing nearer the ground and consuming more soil during the graze
regeneration in this wet season, which will have also softened the
soil allowing more roots (and soil) to be pulled up. Many thanks to
Steve. - Mod.MHJ]
