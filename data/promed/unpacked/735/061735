Al-Marj Teaching Hospital in east Libya declared on Tue 19 Apr 2016 a state of emergency following an outbreak of hepatitis C virus at the hospital's hemodialysis department, sources say. The parallel LANA News Agency of the eastern government of Abdullah Al-Thanni said 10 patients have been infected with hepatitis C, but the reasons of the outbreak are still unclear.

The hospital's administration said the reason was due to lack of resources and medical staff. The news agency added that the discovery of the contagious liver disease was based on rapid blood tests and that samples have been sent to authorized labs outside the hospital for confirmation.

Al-Marj is a town some 94 km to the east of Benghazi.

[Hepatitis C is generally transmitted via blood transfusion or blood-contaminated equipment, the latter from inappropriate infection prevention techniques.

It is not clear how many dialysis patients were tested to see what the prevalence is and whether these are new or old infections. Most cases of hepatitis C are only recognized after some time, as the acute infection is rarely associated with jaundice. - Mod.LL
