South Africa: Rabies scare in KwaZulu-Natal
----------------------------------------
Several cases of rabies have appeared in southern KwaZulu-Natal, and the
public are warned to be careful of the deadly disease, health authorities
said on Thu 21 Oct 2004.
One child has died, and another is in hospital with serious rabies
symptoms, the provincial health department said. Both children had been
bitten by a stray puppy at Bhongweni village, Ezinqoleni, and 11 other
people had been bitten by the same dog before a local hunter put it down,
an investigation by the department showed. These people were immediately
given rabies vaccine therapy.
Lindiwe Khuzwayo, spokesperson for the department, urged the public to seek
medical assistance immediately if bitten or scratched by an animal. The
earlier the treatment, the more likely it was the disease could be cured,
Khuzwayo said. She said it took 2-10 weeks to show signs of rabies, but
once these symptoms appeared, no treatment was possible, and the patient
would die. Symptoms include headache, fever, vomiting, anxiety, fear of
water, insomnia, and paralysis. Eventually the person falls into a coma and
dies.
However, if someone received treatment soon after being bitten, they would
not die from the disease, Khuzwayo said. A vaccine for the disease was
available, and all domestic animals should be vaccinated, she said.
In July there was a similar rabies outbreak in the Eastern Cape, and 2
people died.
