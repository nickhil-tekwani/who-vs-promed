Danish Crown's slaughterhouse in Herning has been closed today after a dead pig was found on a truck headed to the abattoir, reports TV2. It is believed it might have had swine fever.

According to Fodevarestyrelsen, the Danish veterinary and food administration, the pigs were taken from livestock in Vejen and Vojens, and these animals will now be inspected before the slaughterhouse can reopen.

Danish Crown has temporarily stopped production and warned supermarkets that their shelves may be emptier tomorrow -- particularly in regards to processed meat products.

The company's 500 employees and trucks were not allowed to leave the slaughterhouse before they were thoroughly washed and disinfected.

There are 2 types of swine fever: Classical and African. Classical swine fever [CSF], which is not known to affect humans, was last recorded in Denmark in 1933, while African swine fever has never been recorded in this country.

Classical swine fever, which should not be confused with swine flu, causes the sudden death of pigs with only a few warning signs and is highly contagious.

In Europe, it was last recorded in 2014 in the eastern part of Latvia.

[CSF, among of the most infectious viral animal diseases, was included in the past in OIE's List-A diseases. The following introductory summary is derived from the chapter "Classical swine fever" 2. 8. 3 of OIE's Manual (updated 2014):

"Classical swine fever (CSF), also known as hog cholera, is a contagious viral disease of pigs, including wild boar. The causative virus is a member of the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae, and is closely related to the viruses of bovine viral diarrhoea and border disease. There is only one serotype of CSF virus (CSFV).

The disease may run an acute, subacute, chronic, late-onset, or inapparent course, depending on a variety of viral and host factors of which the age of the animals, the virulence of the virus and the time of infection (pre- or post-natal) are of greatest importance. Adult pigs usually display less severe signs of disease than young animals and stand a better chance of survival. In pregnant sows, the virus may cross the placental barrier and reach the fetuses. In-utero infection with strains of the virus of moderate or low virulence can result in what is referred to as the 'carrier sow' syndrome followed by prenatal or early post-natal death, the birth of diseased piglets or an apparently healthy but persistently infected litter. An outbreak of CSF in domestic pigs has serious consequences for trade in pigs and pig products.

The highly variable clinical picture of CSF precludes a diagnosis on clinical and pathological grounds alone. Laboratory methods are therefore essential for an unambiguous diagnosis. Detection of virus or viral nucleic acid in anticoagulated whole blood and of antibodies in serum are the methods of choice for diagnosing CSF in live pigs, whereas detection of virus, viral nucleic acid or antigen in organ samples is most suitable when the pig is dead."

The complete chapter, updated 2014, includes also detailed diagnostic methods; it is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.03_CSF.pdf.

Results of the laboratory investigations of the described suspected case in Denmark -- among of the world's major pork exporters -- are anticipated the soonest.
