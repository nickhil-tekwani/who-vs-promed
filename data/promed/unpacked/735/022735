But nowhere is it written that, if a mining related toxin is suspect, it
couldn't be a combination of toxins insofar as in the mining operation
often more than one poison is used in the extraction process. Such a
combination just might result in the symptoms described. Just speculation.
Oh, as an aside, zinc is also used in an extraction process and, if memory
serves, fumes from roasting zinc are also poisonous. I would also remind
other speculators not only are toxic chemical brought into the ore
extraction processes but the ores themselves usually contain elements and
compounds
which can react during the extraction process and these will vary from
deposit to deposit. For example, a formation known as a Gossan Hat may have
a "heavy" proportion of arsenic.

I ran this constallation of clinical and epidemiological features past GIDEON.
Assuming a single infectious disease, the differential diagnosis consists of:
Ebola, Hantavirus, Legionellosis, Leptospirosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever and Marburg.

[So the GIDEON program does not suggest a toxic cause. I wonder if the
cases in this outbreak with negative serology for Marburg virus could be
leptospirosis transmitted from rats in the mines? - Mod.JW
