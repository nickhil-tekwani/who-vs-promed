[Re: ProMED-mail Poliomyelitis, vaccine derived - Madagascar: (TL) RFI 20111020.3128]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[The posting dated 20 Oct 2011], suggested that new cases of
poliomyelitis occurred in Madagascar. In fact, to date, there is no
evidence of any case of acute [flaccid] paralysis (AFP) or
poliomyelitis in Madagascar in 2011. The information attributed by the
source (Linfo Reunion [in French, trans., edited]) to the Ministry of
Health of Madagascar is false.

Recently, in 2 districts of the Toliara province (South-West of
Madagascar), 8 polio vaccine viruses including 3 potentially
pathogenic vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) have been isolated
from asymptomatic children (less than 5 years old) who did not receive
any oral polio vaccine in the 30 days before the samples collection. 2
of these VDPVs had more than 30 mutations in the VP1 region and one
had 6 mutations. Although these 3 viruses present similar genetic
features, they however clearly differ (no genetic link) from those
isolated in 2001-2002 and in 2005 from patients with acute flaccid
paralysis (poliomyelitis cases). The neuro-pathogenicity of these new
VDPVs is under investigation. It is important to mention that these
results were obtained as part of a research project on human
enteroviruses and not from the national surveillance system of the
acute [flaccid] paralysis (AFP) and poliomyelitis. This research
program is carried out by the virology unit at the Institut Pasteur
from Madagascar in partnership with the enterovirus biology unit at
the Institut Pasteur in Paris.

Although no evidence of acute flaccid paralysis linked to these new
VDPVs have been demonstrated, their detection in 3 children and their
genetic characteristics strongly suggest that the vaccine coverage
against poliovirus in the region of Toliara (Atsimo Andrefana) is too
low, favoring the circulation and genetic drift of the polio vaccine
strain. In order to respond to the threat of the emergence of an
epidemic strain in the Malagasy population, it is necessary to ensure
high polio vaccine coverage and to continue the monitoring of the
circulation of these VDPVs within the community. To reach these
objectives, the Ministry of Health has planned a campaign of
vaccination in some districts (Atsimo Andrefana, Androy, Anosy, and
Antananarivo) in December [2011] and January 2012].

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Heraud for the detailed
explanation above of the circumstances surrounding the identification
of circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in Toliara
Madagascar. It is unfortunate that the media presented incorrect
information surrounding these isolates, albeit providing local
incentive to increase vaccination coverages might not be considered a
bad outcome of this error. It will be interesting to learn the results
of the neurovirulence studies on these isolates as this region
(Toliara) has had prior clinical paralytic poliomyelitis cases
associated with cVDPV (in 2001-2002 and 2005).

According to the Polio Eradication Initiative website, as of 6 Nov
2011 there have been cVDPV paralytic poliomyelitis associated cases
identified in Mozambique (2 cases of cVDPV type 1), Nigeria (13 cases
of cVDPV type 2), Yemen (4 cases of cVDPV type 2), Somalia (5 cases of
cVDPV type 2), and Afghanistan (1 case of cVDPV type 2). (See
