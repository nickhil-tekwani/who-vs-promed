Some 3,354 cases of dengue fever recorded in this [Phu Yen northern
province since early this year have resulted in 11 fatalities, a 2.6-fold
increase over the same period last year. The province has spent VND100
million (US$7,692) on activities to prevent the disease. The provincial
health care sector is taking steps such as spraying with insecticides,
distributing medicine, expanding patient treatment centres and coordinating
prevention efforts with the Nha Trang Pasteur Institute.

[Anyone have any doubt that dengue is an emerging disease? Tens of
countries, thousands of cases, hundreds of deaths, and still there is more
talk than action. In addition, the data we post on ProMED-mail doesn't
begin to address attack rates, mortality rates, and other useful
epidemiological parameters, not that these data would help prevent a single
case. It may be enough to have totals, which paint a bleak picture;
however, the accumulated data might prod the right people into taking this
disease seriously. The bottom line is limited resources, of course. I
have sent a message to Dr. Do Quang Ha, asking for additional information
about this epidemic situation. - Mod.CHC
