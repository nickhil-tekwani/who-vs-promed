The Department of Health (DoH) has confirmed 15 new cases of measles
in Metro Manila. Center for Health Development-Metro Manila Regional
Director Eduardo Janairo said the figure was based on the laboratory
results of the testing done on victims with suspected measles. The
areas with confirmed cases are Mandaluyong City, with 2 confirmed
cases, Muntinlupa with one, Paranaque with 3, Quezon City with 5, and
Taguig with 2. The majority of the victims are between one and 5 years
old.

The DoH recently conducted a nationwide Measles-Rubella Supplemental
Immunization Activity. It was learned that 81 percent of the metro
population was unvaccinated, raising concerns about the disease.

"We have to be cautious because this is the season when measles cases
usually increase. Because of the cold weather, pneumonia and colds are
the common complications identified with measles virus infection.
Everyone is advised to take necessary precautions," Janairo said.
Since Metro Manila is a densely populated area, Janario said rapid
transmission can be expected.

The possibility of a measles outbreak at a large Auckland secondary
school has sparked a warning to parents. Auckland Regional Public
Health Service has sent letters to parents of a suspected case at
Westlake Boys High School. The students at Westlake may have been
exposed between 30 Oct and 4 Nov 2011.

Health authorities say measles is spreading throughout the Bay of
Plenty. There have been 10 cases in the region since early October
[2011], with most in Tauranga and Rotorua. Of the more than 400
confirmed cases across the country, at least 70 have required hospital
treatment.

The Public Health Service is following up a number of people who have
been in close contact with recent measles cases in the Bay. People
identified as "contacts" who are not immunised must stay away from
work or school for 14 days. The Medical Officer of Health is urging
people to ensure they are protected from measles.

"Measles immunisation provides effective protection, and the vaccine
is free for children and adults," Neil de Wet says. Babies from 12
months of age can have their 1st dose of the MMR (measles, mumps and
rubella) vaccine from their family doctor or practice nurse. "The 2nd
dose of MMR vaccine can be given 28 days later," Dr de Wet says. "This
also applies to older children, teenagers, and adults if you have
missed your scheduled immunisation or you're not immunised. For
everyone born after 1 Jan 1969, it is important to ensure that you
have received the 2 doses of MMR vaccine. It's never too late to catch
up," de Wet says.

Measles usually begins with a runny nose, fever, cough and sore eyes.
This is followed by a red, blotchy rash that usually starts on the
face and spreads to the rest of the body [There is a very good image
of a measles rash accompanying this report, accessible via the source

quite common. Complications include diarrhoea, ear infections and
pneumonia, and more rarely, brain inflammation," says de Wet.

Three new cases of measles have been notified to health authorities in
Southland, following the visit to Dunedin last month [October 2011] of
a Wellington student who was subsequently found to be infectious.
Southland District Health Board (DHB) says the 3 cases are all young
children who had not been immunised. The children have been isolated
for 14 days.

The Southern DHB is urging parents to have their children fully
vaccinated against the highly infectious disease. The vaccination is
given at 15 months and 4 years.

The DHB says anyone with a high temperature, tiredness, running nose
and inflamed eyes should stay home and phone their doctor.

Unvaccinated pupils at an Upper Hutt college will be excluded from
school for more than a week after a classmate contracted one of 3 new
Wellington measles cases. Health officials are urging people to make
sure they are vaccinated before travelling to Auckland, with all 3 new
cases diagnosed after those infected had visited the city. There have
been more than 200 confirmed cases of measles in Auckland since May
[2011], after an unimmunised child caught it overseas.

Among the latest Wellington measles cases -- the 1st in the region
since 19 Oct 2011 -- is a St Patrick's College Silverstream pupil.
Medical officer of health Margot McLean said the teenager's
classmates, teachers and parents were being followed up to make sure
they were vaccinated. The Year 13 pupils who were not vaccinated would
need to stay home from school until 18 Nov 2011. Before being
diagnosed, the teenager travelled from Auckland to Wellington on
Jetstar flight JQ 269 at 5:50 pm on 30 Oct 2011.

The other cases are a man and a woman, both in their 30s. The man
lives in Kapiti and works in central Wellington. Before he was
diagnosed, he travelled to and from Wellington on the Capital
Connection train on 2, 3 and 4 Nov 2011. He was also at Kilbirnie Pool
between 2 pm and 4 pm on 5 Nov 2011.

The infected woman lives in Wellington and attended the Capital
Gymnastics Club in Newtown on 3 Nov 2011, between 4 pm and 5:30 pm.
Anyone who thought they might have been in contact with the 3 infected
people and either had symptoms or were not immunised should talk to
their doctor or Healthline, Dr McLean said.

Regional Public Health staff were confident the 3 cases were not
related to several cases diagnosed last month [October 2011], as
anyone else infected then would have shown symptoms by late October
2011.
