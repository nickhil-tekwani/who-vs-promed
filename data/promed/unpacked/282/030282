The people must take responsibility to fight against dengue, said Deputy Federal Territories Minister Datuk Dr Loga Bala Mohan.

He said, based on the Health Ministry's statistics, 94 613 dengue cases, including 262 deaths, were recorded nationwide from January till 14 Oct this year [2015].

"Kuala Lumpur recorded 6446 dengue cases with 31 deaths, making it the 4th leading state in the country. Out of this number, we found that 1256 cases occurred in the Lembah Pantai area with 6 deaths," he told reporters after officiating the Lembah Pantai Parliamentary constituency's Gotong-Royong Cleanliness Taskforce programme here today [31 Oct 2015].

The annual programme, which began in June 2013, is aimed at curbing the problem and improving hygiene levels in the Federal Territory, especially in places frequented by the public and tourists.

Loga Bala also said the local community should make concerted efforts to take care of hygiene and to ensure that factors leading to any diseases are avoided.

"I hope all parties can educate and convey the message to all our children to practice self discipline in the management of hygiene," he added.

Hasliana Azrah Ab-Rahman, Pooi-Fong Wong, Hafiz Rahim, Juraina Abd-Jamil, Kim-Kee Tan, Syuhaida Sulaiman, Chai-See Lum, Syarifah-Faridah Syed-Omar, Sazaly AbuBakar. Dengue death with evidence of hemophagocytic syndrome and dengue virus infection in the bone marrow.

Background:
HPS [hemophagocytic syndrome] is characterized by uncontrolled activation of normal T lymphocytes and macrophages, leading to overwhelming production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which can cause hyperinammation. HPS-associated dengue disease was reported as early as 1966, and to date at least 44 case reports of HPS in dengue have been reported in the literature.

Abstract:
Introduction: HPS is a potentially life-threatening histiocytic disorder that has been described in various viral infections including dengue. Its involvement in severe and fatal dengue is probably more common but is presently under recognized.

Case description:
A 38-year-old female was admitted after 5 days of fever. She was deeply jaundiced, leukopenic and thrombocytopenic. Marked elevation of transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia and hypoalbuminemia were observed. She had deranged INR values and prolonged aPTT accompanied with hypobrinogenemia. She also had splenomegaly. She was positive for dengue IgM. Five days later she became polyuric, and CT brain image showed gross generalized cerebral edema. Her condition deteriorated by day 9, and she became confused with GCS of 9/15. Her BMAT showed minimal histiocytes. Her serum ferritin level peaked at 13 670.00 ug/mL and her sCD163 and sCD25 values were markedly elevated at 4750.00 ng/mL and 4191.00 pg/mL, respectively. She succumbed to the disease on day 10, and examination of her tissues showed the presence of dengue virus genome in the bone marrow.

Discussion and evaluation:
Described here is a case of fatal dengue with clinical features of HPS. Though BMAT results did not show the presence of macrophage hemophagocytosis, other laboratory features were consistent with HPS, especially marked elevation of ferritin, sCD163 and sCD25. Detection of dengue virus in the patient's bone marrow 15 days after the onset of fever was also consistent with the suggestion that the HPS is associated with dengue virus infection.

Conclusions:
The findings highlight HPS as a possible complication leading to severe dengue and revealed persistent dengue virus infection of the bone marrow. Detection of HPS markers; ferritin, sCD163 and sCD25, therefore, should be considered for early recognition of HPS-associated dengue.
