The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Division of Public Health has reported 2 cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in Wisconsin this year [2018].

AFM is a serious condition similar to polio which targets the nervous system, causing limb weakness and slower reflexes. It is mostly found in children and does not seem to be communicable from human to human. Causes may include poliovirus or non-polio enteroviruses, West Nile virus, and adenoviruses.

The CDC has seen an uptick in cases since 2014, when it first became a public concern. There are 72 confirmed cases of AFM across 24 states in 2018, with a spike in cases every other year which may be related to EV-D68, a non-polio enterovirus that causes cold-like symptoms. However, the cause is undetermined for most of these cases despite tests and further research is needed.

AFM remains a very rare condition with less than one [in a] million cases each year. Some who are affected are able to recover with therapy, but others continue to have paralysis.

Contact a doctor as soon as possible if you notice in your child: sudden arm or leg weakness, loss of muscle strength and reflexes, facial drooping, difficulty moving eyes, trouble swallowing, slurred speech, and loss of appetite.

Health officials recommend washing hands and staying up-to-date on vaccinations. Further information about AFM can be found on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/about-afm.html.

[2] Link between EV68 and AFM

As the summer of 2014 gave way to fall, Kevin Messacar, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital Colorado, started seeing a wave of children with inexplicable paralysis. The condition looked remarkably like polio, but none of the kids tested positive for poliovirus. Instead, their condition was given a new name: acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM. That year, 120 people, mostly young children, developed the condition across 34 states. The cases peaked in September and then rapidly tailed off.

After just a few dozen new cases the following year [2015], AFM returned in force in 2016, afflicting 149 more people. The next year [2017]: another lull. And in 2018: another spike, with 62 confirmed cases so far and at least 93 more under investigation. Parents have described their children collapsing mid-run like "marionette dolls," or going to bed with a fever and waking up paralyzed from the neck down.

This 3rd wave confirms what many doctors had feared: AFM wasn't a one-off, but likely a new biennial normal. It's still rare, affecting just one in 1 million people, but that's little comfort for the roughly 400 children who've been affected, many of whom are looking at lifelong disability or paralysis. "It's exceptionally frustrating to see it again this year [2018], when we know how much people's lives are overturned," says Priya Duggal from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "We don't really know much more than we knew in 2014 -- but we're trying."

AFM is a new term, but not a new syndrome. Its package of symptoms can be caused by a wide range of factors, including, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes, poliovirus, West Nile virus, environmental toxins, and genetic disorders. The question isn't what causes AFM per se, but what is specifically behind the biennial spikes that have appeared since 2014. (There was a small peak in 2012, too, before the condition came to national attention.)

One particular enterovirus, known as EV-D68, has emerged as the lead suspect. First discovered in 1962, it seemed rare and unexceptional. But in 2014, it caused a huge surge of respiratory illness throughout the United States. That year, "our hospital was the busiest it's ever been," Messacar recalls. "The floors were packed, and we hit capacity." And when paralyzed children started showing up at the same time, he put 2 and 2 together. He and others noted that in 2014 and 2016, EV-D68 was the most commonly identified virus in people with AFM.

But it's not in every patient. So far, the CDC has only found the virus in the spinal fluid of a single child, and in fewer than half of the stool samples or nasal swabs it tested. "I am frustrated that, despite all of our efforts, we haven't been able to identify the cause of this mystery illness," said Nancy Messonnier, who directs the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a recent press briefing. The agency notes on its website that "the cause of most of the AFM cases remains unknown."

There's also compelling evidence from laboratory studies. Last year [2017], Alison Hixon at the University of Colorado School of Medicine showed that EV-D68 strains from the 2014 outbreak can paralyze mice by infecting and killing the movement-controlling neurons in their spine. When Hixon isolated the virus from those neurons and injected it into another group of mice, those rodents also became paralyzed. That fulfills all the traditional criteria for causality. It falls short of a slam-dunk case only because the experiments were done in mice.

Another enterovirus, EV-71, has also been implicated in AFM. It's endemic to East Asia, where it infrequently causes a similar polio-like illness with the same 2-to-3-year periodicity. Messacar's team detected it in Colorado this spring [2018], and they've found it in 11 patients with AFM. Several enteroviruses could be behind the AFM cases.

It's possible, though, that the virus has changed since then. In one experiment, strains from 1962 didn't paralyze mice in the same way that those from 2014 did. This would hardly be the 1st time that long-known viruses suddenly became more dangerous. Zika virus, for example, was thought to be innocuous when it was discovered in the 1940s, but only recently acquired a mutation that seemingly allows it to cause severe neurological problems.

Messacar says, public-health workers should actively search for the virus in the same way they do for the flu. The CDC does have a surveillance program for enteroviruses, but it's a passive system that relies on clinicians sending in samples. A more active program, of the kind that only a few hospitals do, would specifically test for EV-D68 in the nose of any child who gets admitted with respiratory problems.

A month ago, after the 3rd wave of AFM had started, Pardo-Villamizar began convening a nationwide group of colleagues from hospitals that were seeing cases. Their goal is to share as much information as possible on how best to study, diagnose, and treat the illness. "We always depend on the CDC, but they're designed to establish surveillance for diseases, not management and diagnosis," he says. "We, as clinicians and scientists, should be doing that."
