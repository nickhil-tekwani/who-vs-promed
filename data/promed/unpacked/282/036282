According to press-centre of the Territorial Management of
Rospotrebnadzor, 52 cases of suspected Siberian tick typhus,
including 19 cases in children, have been recorded in the Altai
region (for the similar period in 2008, 129 cases, including 37 in
children, were recorded). [In addition] 4 cases of suspected
tick-borne encephalitis were recorded (2 cases were recorded in 2008).

Since the tick season began, 1561 people (in 2008 - 1329 people),
including 554 children (in 2008 - 506 children) with tick bites
presented for medical aid at out-patient departments in the Altai
region. Peak tick activity usually occurs during the 1st 3 weeks of May.

[Tick activity started this year in the Altai region in the 4th week
of March. The 1st case of a tick bite was recorded on 30 Mar 2009 in
Biysk. - Corr.BA]

[Siberian tick typhus is a rickettsiosis, presumably due to
_Rickettsia sibirica_. For a discussion of the tick-borne rickettsial
diseases in Russia, see Dr. Steve Berger's comments in ProMED post
archive number 20040514.1301.

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), also known as Central European
encephalitis or Russian spring-summer encephalitis, is an endemic
disease in rural regions of Russia. Although vaccine preventable, no
TBE vaccines are licensed or available in the United States. There
are 2 equivalent, safe, and effective inactivated TBE vaccines
available in Europe, in adult and pediatric formulations (see
<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/ch4/tickborne.aspx>).

The following on TBE is extracted from Mod.CP's comments in ProMED
post archive number 20081007.3175:

According to the World Health Organisation
(<http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/>) the
endemic area for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) spreads from
Alsace-Lorraine in the west to Vladivostok and northeastern regions
of China in the east, and from Scandinavia to Italy, Greece, and
Crimea in the south. TBE also is endemic in North Japan, where the
virus has repeatedly been isolated from blood samples of sentinel
dogs, ticks, and rodent spleens. TBE is a serious acute central
nervous system infection, which may result in death or long-term
neurological sequelae in 35-58 percent of patients. The fatality rate
associated with clinical infection is 0.5-20 percent. The proportion
of cases involving subclinical infection varies between 70 percent
and 98 percent. Symptomatic infection occurs in all age groups.

The agent is the TBE virus (TBEV), a flavivirus that is transmitted
to humans by the bite of a tick. A total of 8 species of ticks have
been identified that can transmit TBEV. The chief vectors are _Ixodes
ricinus_ in Europe and the western part of the Russian Federation,
and _Ixodes persulcatus_ in the eastern part of the Russian Federation.

Biysk is the 2nd largest city in Altai Krai, which is situated in
southwestern Siberia Federal District. Altai Krai can be found on a map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Krai>. The Siberian Federal
District, one of the 7 federal districts of Russia, is the central of
the 3 Asian districts, and can be located on a map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_Russia_-_Siberian_Federal_District.svg>.
