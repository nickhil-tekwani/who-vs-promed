[ProMED would appreciate learning more details about this case, presumably
a case of bubonic plague. The GIDEON database indicates that plague is
endemic to Uganda's western region, Nebbi District, and northern region,
Arua District. A total of 18 cases were reported in 1954; 153 cases (3
fatal) were reported in 1982; 340 (27 fatal) in 1986; 167 (18 fatal) in
1993 (the latter from the western, Nebbi District). From the Arua District,
49 (16 fatal) cases were reported in 1998. In the intervening years, few
cases were reported. Rodent control is undoubtedly the key to altering the
pattern. - Mod. LL]
