2000/045 Details on citrus tristeza closterovirus in Turkey
-----------------------------------------------------------
Although the purpose of a study carried out in the Eastern Mediterranean
Region of Turkey was to compare immunoprinting to ELISA in detecting citrus
tristeza closterovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest), it also showed that the
virus is present in this region. Positive samples were found in the
Provinces of Hatay and Icel.

[Citrus tristeza disease is already known to be present in Turkey. Are we
to assume that this is the first report of the disease in the two
provinces? If anyone has information on the subject, please let me know.
