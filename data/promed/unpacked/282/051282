As resident veterinarian in the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve (HUP) I am
curious to know how you managed to receive a report that 100% of our lions
are infected with [bovine tubercle bacilli (TB)? Although we have a
problem with TB in HUP we certainly have no idea at this stage as to the
incidence of TB in HUP lions.
TB was first diagnosed in 1986 when a single cape buffalo was culled and
found to have miliary TB lesions. Subsequently, TB has spread through the
buffalo population in HUP with herd incidences [prevalences varying from
<10% to 50%.
The first case of TB in a lion was reported in 1992. Since January 1998 I
have examined 6 lions euthanased due to poor condition, etc. All six were
found to have TB in varying degrees.
Dr Dewald Keet (K.N.P.) has recently tested a number of free-ranging lions
using the comparative intradermal (ID) test (_M. bovis_ and _M. avium_) and
has reported a good correlation between the reaction on the skin test and
post mortem findings. There also appear to be a correlation between the ID
test and ELISA. test.
Some of our HUP lions are reasonably conditioned to "call-ups", and
recently I was able to capture 5 lions, 3 of which were recaptured 72 hours
later. All of these lions came from a pride or cohort from which one or
more individuals had previously been diagnosed with TB on necropsy. All
three lions had very strong "positive" reactions and were clinically in
poor condition. These lions are presently being monitored and a more
intensive surveillance programme is planned for later in the year.
I suggest you contact Dr Keet for more information regarding the test as he
currently has a research project investigating ante-mortem TB tests in
free-ranging lions.

[Our original posting on HUP tubercular lions was taken from an article in
the 17th July edition of The Mail & Guardian (Johannesburg), entitled "The
last lions of Hluhluwe". It is still available on AfricaOnline. I am glad
to hear that the lion situation was overstated though it is clearly serious
and how to control this infection throughout the park is complex. - Mod.MHJ
