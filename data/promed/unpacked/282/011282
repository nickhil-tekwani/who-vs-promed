Farmers in Mukono District are in a pathetic situation following an attack
by a wilt disease in their tomatoes.
7 acres of tomatoes have been destroyed, according to district agricultural
officials. Leaves of tomatoes wilt and dry up within a week when the
disease strikes. Farmers have now uprooted affected plants and transferred
them to other plots where survival appears to be better.
The farmers, under auspices of the Akugoba Horticultural Association, have
appealed to the government for assistance in rescuing their crops.
John Kazibwe, the chairman of the Association, said that they have spent
more than 15 million shillings clearing new land where they want to start
planting disease-free tomatoes. Chemical fungicides are no longer effective
in stopping the disease.
Kibirige Ssebunya, the Minister of State for Agriculture advised the
farmers to uproot the affected tomato plants and burn them. He also said
that they should leave the land attacked by the disease idle for some time.
He promised the farmers he would send scientists from the Ministry of
Agriculture to assess the extent of the problem.
Farmers have complained that heavy rainfall results in rotting of the
tomatoes. Moreover, the market is low. One farmer observed that they get
problems especially during the heavy rains and we fail to get to the market.

[Tomato is the most important vegetable in Uganda and many farmers tend to
plant year-round. Might that be a problem? It looks like this could be a
serious problem for farmers. If any of our readers have information about
this disease, please contact me. - Mod.DH]
