Thailand: 9 year old girl tests positive for avian influenza virus
------------------------------------------------------------------
A 9 year old girl in northern Thailand has tested positive for avian
influenza -- the latest person infected by the virus since it resurfaced in
South East Asia in July 2004 -- a health ministry official said on Sun 3
Oct 2004. The girl, who is in critical condition, is believed to have
contracted the disease from infected birds, said deputy public health
minister Anuthin Chanveerakul. She was admitted to hospital in Phetchabun
province on Thu 30 Sep 2004 with flu-like symptoms, and test results on Sun
3 Oct 2004 showed she has the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A virus, he said.
Thailand went on high alert last week [final week of Sep 2004], after it
reported that an earlier avian influenza victim died after probably
contracting the virus from her daughter. She was the 1st person in this
outbreak believed to have contracted the disease from another human, rather
than from poultry. Typically, people who get bird flu acquire it from
infected birds. But experts fear the bird virus will someday mutate into a
form that spreads easily from one person to another, which could set the
stage for a worldwide outbreak of [subtype H5N1 influenza virus].
10 people have died of bird flu in Thailand, and 20 in Viet Nam, this year
[2004]. More than 100 million chickens and poultry have died or been culled
since the disease spread across large swaths of Asia early this year.

[A preliminary account of this case was included in ProMED-mail post "Avian
influenza - Eastern Asia (120): Thailand 20041003.2731. If confirmed by the
World Health Organization, this case will raise the total number of cases
recorded in Thailand to 16 (with 10 deaths). Taken together with the 27
cases in Viet Nam, the total number of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus cases
in East Asia becomes 43 (with 30 deaths). - Mod.CP]
