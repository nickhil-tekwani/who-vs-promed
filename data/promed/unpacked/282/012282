A major outbreak of the killer disease anthrax -- which affects most mammals and can be especially devastating to livestock herds -- in Keelvenkatapuram village in Nemili block [Vellore district, Tamil Nadu] has killed at least 37 sheep on Thursday and Friday [3-4 Mar 2016].

The government stepped in quickly, dispatching 4 special [veterinary] medical teams from the animal husbandry department to launch a special drive to vaccinate livestock in the area. Department of animal husbandry joint director Dr A Rajasekar said the department received an alert on [Fri 4 Mar 2016] that the sheep of 7 farmers died in clusters on [Thu 3 Mar 2016].

The department acted immediately and sent 4 special [veterinary] medical teams, each comprising a veterinary assistant surgeon, livestock inspector and two other supporting staff. The [veterinary] team with the help of a local body buried the animals in a deep pit and sprinkled a huge quantity of bleaching powder before closing it to prevent spread of the disease.

The officials took blood samples from the dead animals for tests, which proved the animals died of anthrax. Anthrax is a serious and highly contagious infectious disease caused by Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_. Its spores are extraordinarily hardy and are able to survive in harsh conditions for decades in a dormant state. Although it is rare, people can contract anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.

The preliminary investigation into the outbreak of the disease revealed that the owners of the sheep removed the skin after the 1st animal died -- an extremely dangerous thing to do because it causes the disease to spread at a rapid rate. Once symptoms of anthrax started to manifest among the sheep, the sheep rearers also started medicating the animals.

"Removing the skin or cutting the animal will spread the disease. Even postmortem [testing] of the carcasses of the animal is prohibited," an official said. The officials procured medicines from Institute of Veterinary Preventive Medicine at Ranipet [Tamil Nadu] for the vaccination drive. "We are covering villages in the radius of 8 km [about 5 mi] from Keelvenkatapuram village," assistant director of animal husbandry Dr E Udhayakumar said.

[Because of the comparatively low value of sheep, unexpected deaths tend to be ignored until the number of carcasses demands action. This delay only makes it worse. Also sheep anthrax cases tend to be strung out, reflecting the transfer of infection from sheep carcass, to inquisitive blood-tasting sheep, to carcass, to the next inquisitive sheep. In this case the skinning of an initial case and resulting spilling of infective blood moved everything much faster. As villages tend to use common grazing during the day, more than the index flock was affected.

It must have been a large deep pit to take 37 sheep carcasses. Burying deep is ok but one should pile all the earth back on top of the buried sheep. This will make a temporary mound. But as the sheep decompose the soil column will collapse. The last thing you want is a depressed area that will collect rain. As this rain percolates downwards it can float any spores back up to the surface to be grazed at a later date.

Also the authorities would be wise to revaccinate this village's sheep for a further 3 years as the source of the infection that caused this outbreak is still out there. With luck, after 4 years it may be dead, but watch and check. Traditionally, anthrax outbreaks in this state have been downstream of slaughter houses and wool and hide processing plants.
