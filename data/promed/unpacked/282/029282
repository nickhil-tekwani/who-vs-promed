Man Tests Positive For Bubonic Plague In Manhattan
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 53-year-old man tested positive in preliminary tests for bubonic plague
at the Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan Wednesday, 6 Nov 2002. Tests on
his 47-year-old wife, who had complained of the same symptoms, have not
come in yet.
The couple, who are from New Mexico, showed up at the hospital Tuesday [5
Nov 2002] night with flu-like symptoms, according to the Associated Press.
Hospital spokesman Mike Quane told the AP that the couple was placed in
isolation. Health officials had tested for a number of different
respiratory illnesses, including plague. At about 7 PM Wednesday [6 Nov
2002], the husband was said to be in very critical condition; his wife was
in stable condition. It appears that the couple contracted the illness in
their home town in New Mexico. Officials said animals in that area - fleas
and rodents - have been tested and tested positive for the [organism that
causes] bubonic plague. Health officials say there is no cause for concern,
since it looks like the couple did not contract the illness in New York.
The plague is not uncommon in the southwestern USA.
Bubonic plague is caused by the bacteria _Yersinia pestis_and it is
typically spread from wild rodents like ground squirrels and prairie dogs
via infected flea bites. It can be contracted from infected animals or
their infected fleas. The plague, which was called the "Black Plague," is
notorious for its spread through Europe during the 14th century, when it
killed millions of people. Nowadays, it can be treated effectively with
antibiotics.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, initial symptoms of bubonic
plague include a swollen and very tender lymph gland, fever, chills,
headaches, extreme exhaustion. People who develop the plague also tend to
have a history of exposure to infected rodents or fleas. Symptoms appear
about 2 to 7 days after infection. Bubonic plague can be fatal if left
untreated.

[Assuming that there has been a microbiological confirmation, it is highly
likely that the couple acquired plague while at home in New Mexico in the
American Southwest where the disease has been identified in animals as well
as humans (see prior ProMED-mail postings listed below). It is bothersome
that the clinical description available at this time does not specifically
mention the presence of a bubo - the characteristic swollen lymph
gland. If it was truly absent and one or both of the couple had a
pneumonia-like presentation, the diagnosis of pneumonic plague should be
considered. _Yersinia pestis_ (the organism responsible for plague) is a
class A biologic agent. Concern of a possible intentional infection would
be raised if these cases had occurred in a couple that had not had exposure
in a known endemic area.
Although the bubonic form of plague does not spread from person-to-person,
both primary pneumonic plague (spread directly from an aerosol) and
secondary pneumonic plague (spread to the lung via the bloodstream from the
infected lymph node) can be transmitted from person-to-person.
More information on these cases would be appreciated. - Mods.LL/MPP]
