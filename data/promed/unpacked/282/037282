From: Martyn Edelsten <martyne@LAB0.VET.ED.AC.UK>

There have been several comments to ProMED-mail on David Brown's article in
the British Press (Daily Telegraph January 3, 1998)), which was in turn
based on a letter written to the Veterinary Record by Hunter and colleagues
including myself. I would like to point out that the sensational style of
the newspaper report was generated by the journalist and was unsolicited by
the authors of the original letter. This would not be the first time that
opinions from scientists have been amended for better or worse by the daily
press. For those who wish to read the letter, please refer to the
Veterinary Record vol. 142 (1) p. 23.

the relevant issue of the Verinary Record has still to arrive. - Mod.MHJ

Dear Sir,
With respect to the ongoing discussions concerning regulations for imported
animals, we are concerned that virtually all the attention has focused on
rabies. Discontinuation of the quarantine system concerns many health
issues other than rabies, and the general public, policy makers and media
should be alerted to this to ensure it is included in the debate. The
discontinuation of quarantine restrictions in Norway and Sweden in 1994 has
resulted in an increase of animal movements into those countries from the
rest of the European Union, and it can be confidently assumed that a
similar discontinuation in this country will trigger an increase in
movements of animals and disease vectors into Britain from continental
Europe; not least of these will be pets accompanying their owners on
continental holidays.
Continental Europe, especially around the Mediterranean, maintains a number
of canine infections absent from Britain, notably leishmaniosis,
dirofilariosis (heartworm), babesiosis and ehrlichiosis. All are
vector-borne. Leishmaniosis is transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies,
babesiosis and ehrlichiosis by ticks and heartworm by mosquitoes.
Consequently the highest risk of infection is during the summer months,
just when the movement of pets accompanying their owners is likely to be at
its peak. Furthermore, the risk of dogs contracting these infections on
the Continent is no idle threat; for example recent surveys have revealed
sero-prevalences for Leishmania infantum of 48.4%, 34.6% and 19.2% in dogs
in the Athens basin, Axarquia Region of southern Spain and the Italian
Province of Perugia respectively (Sideris and others, 1996; Morillas and
others, 1996; Moretti and others, 1995). Canine heartworm is hyperendemic
in the Po Valley in Northern Italy, 44% being recorded in a recent survey
(Poglayen and others, 1996) and high prevalences have also been recorded in
Spain, e.g. 33% in the Salamanca area (Simon and others, 1996). The risk of
dogs contracting Ehrlichia canis infection in the Mediterranean region has
been highlighted by Sumption and Strachan (1997), and Babesia canis
infection which is widespread in the tropics also occurs in mainland
Europe. A further hazard would arise from the relatively high prevalence of
the zoonotic cestode Echinococcus granulosus in dogs in some EU countries
bordering the Mediterranean and of the related zoonotic parasite
Echinococcus multilocularis in central Europe.
Increased dog movement will also increase the risk of introducing ticks
e.g. the discontinuation of quarantine regulations in Sweden was thought
responsible for the introduction of ticks found on dogs in Jamtland
Province, Italian hunting dogs being identified as the probable source
(Norling, 1995). Closer to home, Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks found on
dogs and people in a household in Hull were believed to have originated in
Brittanny, the ticks having been transported in the car of returning
holiday-makers (Jagger and others, 1996). In this case, the owner had not
even taken his dogs on holiday with him, the ticks probably originating
from his neighbour's dogs in Britanny which also travelled in his car. Such
introductions can only increase when dogs accompany their owners on
continental holidays. _R. sanguineus_ is a vector for the pathogens
causing canine babesiosis and ehrlichiosis, and the risk of infected ticks
being introduced in greater numbers must be given consideration.
Veterinarians currently involved in quarantine work already appreciate the
difficulties of diagnosing and treating conditions such as leishmaniosis
and heartworm when they show up in quarantine. Discontinuation of the
quarantine regulations will result in an increase in pet movement from the
Continent, and many clinicians will encounter these diseases and tick
vectors for the first time. Is the British veterinary profession prepared
for this? CPD will be essential.
