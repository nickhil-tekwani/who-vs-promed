A quarantine has been imposed in Istanbul's Buyukada [island] after the highly infectious glanders disease was discovered in some of the island's horses.

The Provincial Directorate of the Food, Agriculture and Livestock Ministry declared the quarantine in Buyukada, which is the largest of the Princes' Islands [map at https://tinyurl.com/ycxej28g].

Glanders disease, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, usually by ingestion of contaminated feed or water, was initially detected among horses used for phaeton rides last summer.

Some of the infected horses were treated by veterinarians, while those that failed to respond to treatment were killed.

In October [2017], ministry officials visited B端y端kada again to conduct further research, examining 1142 horses, of which 18 horses were infected by glanders. These horses were killed.

Detection of the disease raised concerns among B端y端kada locals, as the disease can also infect humans.

Mayor of the Princes' Islands Atilla Aytac issued a statement concerning the disease.

"Teams of ministry officials have carried out inspections on horses. We are caring for the stray animals on the islands. We declared a quarantine in the islands due to glanders disease last summer," he said.

Ministry officials said they have extended the quarantine in Buyukada until October 2018. Officials will visit the island periodically to conduct examinations.

The formation of nodular lesions in the lungs, together with ulceration of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, are signs of glanders, which occurs primarily in horses, mules and donkeys. The disease can also be contracted by other mammals, including cats, dogs, goats and humans.

[Buyukada (meaning "Big Island" in Turkish) is the largest of the 9 so-called Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara, near Istanbul. It is officially a neighbourhood in the Adalar (Islands) district of Istanbul Province, Turkey.

Motor vehicles are banned on this island, which means that both locals and visitors rely on bicycles and horse-drawn carriages to move around the island's little more than 5 sq km (3 sq miles); see https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/06/turkey-mistreatment-mars-horse-carriage-trade.html. According to the said source, 226 carriages and 1100 horses reportedly worked on the island in June 2016.

It will be interesting to note whether the disease was found to be introduced into Buyukada recently or had possibly been circulating unnoticed there and elsewhere in Turkey. According to the official reports to the OIE, the last occurrence of glanders in Turkey took place in September 2001.

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as "farcy." Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref. 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a bio-risk analysis.

The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent, and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf. A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref. 1.

No vaccine against this disease is available; however, prior use of _B. mallei_ as a biological weapon and its high mortality in inhalation animal studies has affirmed _B. mallei_ as a biodefense concern. This encouraged, in the past, studies addressing the development of a human vaccine (ref. 2).

The international animal-movement aspects of glanders were discussed in ref 3.
