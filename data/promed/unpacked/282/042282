Health authorities in the state [of Guanajuato, Mexico] have reported
the occurrence of 19 cases of hepatitis A [virus infection] in the
towns of Leon and Dolores Hidalgo. The health secretary, Ector Jaime
Ramirez Barba, confirmed the detection of 18 of these cases in the
municipality of Leon. They were recorded in the primary schools, S.
Lira and Emiliano Zapata, in the district of Jacinto Lopez. As a
consequence, the education authorities announced that those children
affected must not return to school for at least 15 days.

Meanwhile, Modesto Vazquez Alvarez, in charge of Sanitary District I,
announced that a single case had been detected in the jail of the
municipality of Dolores Hidalgo.

Both of these officials confirmed that no cases of hepatitis A virus
infection had been identified in Guanajuato, the capital of Guanajuato
state .

Ramirez Barba assured the public that cases of hepatitis A virus
infection are not unusual and everything is being done to control the
outbreak and that the situation is under control. The Health Secretary
emphasized that this type of hepatitis infection is very common and
can be caused by poor personal hygiene and consumption of contaminated
food [and/or water].

[Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person
ingests food or drink contaminated by an infected person's stool. The
disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a lack of
personal hygiene habits, such as hand-washing. An estimated 1.4
million cases of hepatitis A occur annually. Epidemics can be
explosive in growth and cause significant economic losses. Improved
sanitation and hepatitis A vaccine are the most effective ways to
combat the disease. For a detailed account, see the WHO Fact Sheet at:
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/index.html.

The occurrence of cases of hepatitis A virus infection in 2 different
primary schools and a prison suggests that the outbreak in Guanajuato
is mainly a consequence of contamination of food or water supplies. It
is not clear from this report whether hepatitis A vaccine is being
employed to contain this outbreak. Hepatitis A outbreaks in Guanajuato
have been recorded previously (see below). Further information would
be appreciated.
