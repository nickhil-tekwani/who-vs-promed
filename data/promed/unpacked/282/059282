At least 1 young patient and 15 staff members at Children's Hospital
Boston have been diagnosed with whooping cough [pertussis? - Mod.LL],
the hospital and public health authorities reported yesterday, 1 Nov
2006, marking the 2nd time in 2 months that a Massachusetts hospital
has faced an outbreak of the infectious disease.
Sixty other staff members at Children's have symptoms of the
bacterial illness and are undergoing blood tests to determine whether
they have the condition, said Dr. Anita Barry, from the Boston Public
Health Commission. Those workers were sent home until they can finish
a 5-day course of the antibiotic azithromycin, said Dr. Thomas
Sandora, an epidemiologist at Children's.
Letters have been sent to the parents of about 1000 patients who may
have come into contact with potentially infectious staff members,
providing information about the disease and directions on what to do
if symptoms appear, Sandora said.
"Many of those patients probably weren't exposed, but we're taking a
very cautious approach," Sandora said.
It appeared last night that Children's did not follow the law in
alerting local health authorities about the outbreak, which began in
September 2006, in a timely fashion. State law requires that
suspected cases of many infectious diseases, including whooping
cough, be reported to the local board of health within 24 hours of
being identified, a measure designed to contain dangerous outbreaks.
Hospital and city investigators said they believe the outbreak began
after a 19-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital 21 Sep 2006
with a fever, cough, and wheezing. Initially, the child was
diagnosed with a disease called respiratory syncytial virus, but
because of worsening symptoms, he was sent to intensive care and
subsequently diagnosed with whooping cough, also known as
pertussis. From that case, the outbreak radiated outward, infecting
nurses, clinical assistants, and administrative staff members,
Sandora said. The toddler has recovered and none of the hospital
workers became seriously ill, he added.
At St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester (MA), an outbreak in September
2006 infected 30 staff members. Officials said they believe a
gastrointestinal surgeon who is a military reservist contracted the
disease while on duty and unknowingly carried it into the hospital.
Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, medical epidemiologist at the CDC, said one
Canadian study had shown that healthcare workers are 1.7 times more
likely than the general public to suffer from whooping cough, an
increase attributed to their contact with infected
patients. Hospital-based outbreaks, she said, "are fairly common,
and they're quite disruptive when they do occur because of the risk
of transmitting pertussis to vulnerable patients in the hospital."
Whooping cough is a highly infectious bacterial disease transmitted
by coughing and sneezing. Typically, the disease arrives with
symptoms similar to those of the common cold. "But then," Barry said,
"patients move into the coughing phase, with spasms of coughing."
At its worst, a rattling, rib-cracking cough can linger for months
and cause patients to lose sleep and weight. Studies have shown that
62 percent of adults with pertussis are still coughing 3 months after
symptoms appear.
While symptoms can be persistent, the disease rarely kills adults.
But it can be deadly in children under 6 months for 2 pivotal
reasons: they have yet to receive a full course of vaccines against
the disease, and their immature immune systems may not be sufficient
to respond to the infection.
The number of infants dying from the disease, while still small, has
been increasing in recent years, Kretsinger said, with 54 deaths
between 1980 and 1989, but 92 deaths in the first half of this decade.
Children today routinely get a series of 5 vaccinations against
pertussis. The vaccine's effectiveness wanes within 5-10 years,
leaving recipients vulnerable to infection. In 2005, US health
regulators approved the 1st pertussis booster shot for adults and
adolescents, a lower dose than what is given to infants and, thus,
less likely to cause adverse effects.
"If we could just get that shot into everybody, we wouldn't be having
these problems," said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, the state's director of
communicable disease control.

[The most recent CDC statement regarding adult immunization (CDC:
Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule --- United States, October
2006--September 2007 MMWR 2006;55; Q1-Q4)
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5540-Immunizationa1.htm>
states this about the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine in adults:
"Adults with uncertain histories of a complete primary
vaccination series with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid-containing
vaccines should begin or complete a primary vaccination series. A
primary series for adults is 3 doses; administer the first 2 doses at
least 4 weeks apart and the third dose 6-12 months after the second.
Administer a booster dose to adults who have completed a primary
series and if the last vaccination was received greater 10 years
previously. Tdap or tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine may be used;
Tdap should replace a single dose of Td for adults aged less than 65
years who have not previously received a dose of Tdap (either in the
primary series, as a booster, or for wound management).
Only 1 of 2 Tdap products (Adacel [Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater,
Pennsylvania]) is licensed for use in adults. If the person is
pregnant and received the last Td vaccination greater than 10 years
previously, administer Td during the second or third trimester; if
the person received the last Td vaccination in less than 10 years,
administer Tdap during the immediate postpartum period. A 1 time
administration of 1 dose of Tdap with an interval as short as 2 years
from a previous Td vaccination is recommended for postpartum women,
close contacts of infants aged <12 months, and all health-care
workers with direct patient contact. In certain situations, Td can be
deferred during pregnancy and Tdap substituted in the immediate
postpartum period, or Tdap can be given instead of Td to a pregnant
woman after an informed discussion with the woman."
Immunization of adolescents and adults with an acellular pertussis
vaccine booster as part of an adult tetanus/diphtheria vaccination
has been recommended for more than a year. It is unclear how much
adherence to this recommendation is occurring. With an increased
risk of both acquiring pertussis and spreading it to susceptible
infants, would it not be reasonable to require a Tdap booster for
each hospital employee to assure immunity? Similar requirements are
in place for other childhood diseases such as measles and rubella. -
