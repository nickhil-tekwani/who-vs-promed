For a woman in Canada, it all started with a feeling of weakness in her left leg and then in her lower back. Later, a rash on her skin made her feel like small needles were stabbing her.

[She] works for CTV News and she has experienced the pain caused by shingles. She said that she couldn't walk for a few days from the nerve pain: "It was in my back and then traveled down my leg as well, so sitting all day was extremely uncomfortable and I had some trouble sleeping at night."

When she went to visit her doctor, he said that she had shingles. But the disease is less common in young people, and [she] is 36 years old.

Each year in Canada, there are 130 000 people that develop the disease. The Canadian researchers and the US CDC have noticed that in the last few years, the numbers have increased, but they don't know why.

People that had chickenpox [are at risk of developing shingles], because the varicella-zoster virus that caused chickenpox can remain dormant in the body, even if chickenpox cleared. The virus remains until the immunity system wears it off. In some cases, the virus reactivates as shingles, which is a painful rash that looks like a stripe on the body, usually on the trunk. It's a mystery why the virus reactivates only in some people, but the risks increase with age.

Some young people can develop shingles because their immune system is weak or they are under high levels of stress.

It's important to check a medic, says Dr Lynora Saxinger, infectious diseases expert at the University of Alberta Hospital: "If you start treatment for it, you can reduce the severity and reduce the risk of going on to a pain syndrome that can sometimes be prolonged. You can actually improve your chances of healing well by getting therapy early."

There are 10-15 percent of people with shingles that develop severe pain where the rash occurs, with a pain that can go for weeks and months. To shorten the illness and to prevent the pains in the postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), Dr Saxinger said that patients receive antiviral medications.

However, shingles could be triggered by other diseases:

"Shingles in a younger person could be a sign of another underlying health condition. So if you get shingles, it might be worth having a check-up to make sure you don't have another health condition that hasn't been recognized."

[Infection with the varicella-zoster virus leads to chickenpox, or primary varicella. The virus then lies dormant and can later reactivate as shingles, or herpes zoster. it presents as a painful rash that usually develops on one side of the body, often the face or torso. The rash consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7-10 days and clears up within 2-4 weeks. Some people describe the pain as an intense burning sensation. For some people, the pain can last for months or even years after the rash goes away. This long-lasting pain is called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and it is the most common complication of shingles. Your risk of getting shingles and PHN increases as you get older.

A new shingles vaccine called Shingrix was licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. CDC recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get 2 doses of Shingrix, 2-6 months apart. Shingrix provides strong protection against shingles and PHN. Shingrix is the preferred vaccine, over ZostavaxÂ®, a shingles vaccine in use since 2006.

Two doses of Shingrix provide strong protection against shingles and postherpetic neuralgia.
- In adults 50-69 years old who got 2 doses, Shingrix was 97 percent effective in preventing shingles; among adults 70 years and older, Shingrix was 91 percent effective.
- In adults 50-69 years old who got 2 doses, Shingrix was 91 percent effective in preventing PHN; among adults 70 years and older, Shingrix was 89 percent effective.
Shingrix protection remained high (more than 85 percent) in people 70 years and older throughout the 4 years following vaccination. Since your risk of shingles and PHN increases as you get older, it is important to have strong protection against shingles in your older years.

Zostavax [the former vaccine that has been around since 2006] only lowers the odds of getting shingles by 51 percent, and of PHN by 67 percent. It's even less effective in people ages 70 and older. The Zostavax vaccine contains a live but weakened version of varicella zoster -- the virus that causes shingles and chickenpox.

Shingrix [the new vaccine] is a killed version of the zoster virus. It also contains an adjuvant. "It causes your immune system to produce more antibodies to fight shingles than Zostavax produced. So your body has a stronger immune response to the Shingrix vaccine than to the Zostavax vaccine," says Michael Hogue, PharmD, a professor of pharmacy at the Samford University College of Health Sciences.

[As a result,] Shingrix causes more side effects than Zostavax. The main side effects reported in studies were soreness, redness, and swelling where you get the shot. Some people also got headaches or felt tired or achy after the shot. About 1 out of 10 people said the side effects were severe enough to disrupt their daily life. Yet most felt better within 3 to 5 days.

"The side effects of the Shingrix are temporary and usually last 2 to 3 days. While you may experience pain for a few days after getting Shingrix, the pain will be less severe than having shingles and the complications from the disease," the CDC says.
