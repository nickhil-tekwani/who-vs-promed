[A] Covaxin vaccine
Date: Tue 20 Apr 2021
Source: The BMJ [abridged, edited]

Citation: Thiagarajan K. What do we know about India's Covaxin vaccine? BMJ. 2021; 373: n997; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n997.

Who developed Covaxin?
Covaxin [BBV152] was developed by Indian pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research, a government-funded biomedical research institute, and its subsidiary the National Institute of Virology.

How does Covaxin work?
The vaccine is similar to CoronaVac (the Chinese vaccine developed by Sinovac) (3 [see source URL for complete references]) in that it uses a complete infective SARS-CoV-2 viral particle consisting of RNA surrounded by a protein shell, but modified so that it cannot replicate (4). Covaxin comes as a 2-dose regimen, recommended to be taken 28 days apart.

What peer-reviewed data are available for the vaccine?
Covaxin's phase I trial to assess safety and immunogenicity is published (5). All 375 subjects who received the vaccine had notably elevated antibody response (6).

The phase II trial result has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but a preprint has been posted on MedRxiv (7). The provisional data indicate enhanced immune response and tolerable safety outcomes.

Since November [2020], 25 â€‰800 participants have been enrolled in ongoing phase III trials. Bharat Biotech released interim efficacy data on 3 Mar 2021, which showed a clinical efficacy of 81% (8).

Why did India choose to develop its own vaccine?
With the goal of vaccinating 300 million people every quarter, costs are mounting. Doctors say it may take 2 years to vaccinate the entire population (9). The 1st round of immunisations has been subsidised by the government and is free for India's 30 million health workers, older people, and frontline workers (10).

Each dose of Covaxin costs 295 rupees (INR) {GBP 2.93 [USD 4.09] vs GBP 19-28 [USD 26.49-39.04] for the Moderna vaccine (11) and GBP 26.70 [USD 37.23] for the Pfizer/BioNTech (12)}. Moreover, Bharat Biotech is providing the first 1.65 million doses at no cost to the government. This makes the Indian vaccine the cheapest purchased by any country in the world at INR 206 [USD 2.77] per shot for the 5.5 million doses the government currently has on order. The government has capped the price of the vaccine sold in the private market, with private hospitals able to charge up to INR 250 [USD 3.36] (13).

Covaxin does not require storage at sub-zero temperatures, which would be hard to maintain in India's climate and with the frequent power cuts in rural areas. Covaxin is available in multidose vials and is stable at the 2-8 deg C [35.6-46.4 deg F] that ordinary refrigeration can achieve.

Bharat Biotech says it has a stockpile of 20 million doses of Covaxin for India and is in the process of manufacturing 700 million doses at its 4 facilities in 2 cities by the end of the year [2021]. It says it can provide 300 million shots annually.

When was Covaxin approved for public use?
The Central Drugs and Standards Committee (CDSCO), India's top drug regulator, issued an emergency approval for Covaxin on 3 Jan 2021, even though phase III clinical trials are still ongoing and phase II studies are unpublished (14). The regulator cited the need for protection against the potential spread of the UK variant. No peer-reviewed evidence is available to show that the vaccine would be effective against this strain, although a preprint indicates promising results (15).

The vaccine is currently being administered in India to people over 60 and those over 45 with comorbidities, as well as to health workers. At the time of writing, India had administered more than 100 million vaccinations, although it is not clear how many are Covaxin (most are Covishield, India's version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in Pune by the Serum Institute of India).

Which other countries have ordered Covaxin?
Bharat Biotech has signed deals with Ocugen, a US-based biopharmaceutical company, to produce the vaccine for the US market, and Precisa Medicamentos to supply to Brazil, pending regulatory approval there.

How has Covaxin been received by the medical community?
The emergency approval before phase III trials were completed triggered widespread criticism from the scientific community in India (16).

With nearly 14 million coronavirus infections at the time of writing, India has the 2nd highest number of reported cases globally after the USA, but the approval came at a time when cases were dropping.

The CDSCO said the vaccine had been approved for "restricted use in an emergency situation" and that it would be deployed in a "clinical trial mode." This vague terminology, with no official clarification, has left doctors and scientists puzzled, though one doctor The BMJ spoke to said it implied that safety data would be collected.

The All India People's Science Network, which represents numerous scientific organisations, described the approval of Covaxin as "hasty," while the All India Drug Action Network, a group of non-government organisations working to increase access to essential medicines, said it was "shocked" and "baffled" by the decision. In the interest of "public welfare and transparency" the group urged regulators to make the data public.

To compound this anxiety, one participant in the phase III trials died. The hospital at which the trial took place, the People's College of Medical Sciences and Research Centre in Bhopal, has been accused of not following proper procedures while screening candidates for the trials.

However, 45 doctors -- including 2 former directors of the All India Institute of Medical Science -- labelled the criticisms of Covaxin as "irresponsible" (17). They called the vaccine India's "gift to humanity."

Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152: interim results from a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 trial, and 3-month follow-up of a double-blind, randomised phase 1 trial. Lancet Infect Dis. Epub 8 Mar 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00070-0.

Summary
------
Background: BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 mcg or 6 mcg) formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule (IMDG) adsorbed to alum (Algel). We previously reported findings from a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial on the safety and immunogenicity of 3 different formulations of BBV152 (3 mcg with Algel-IMDG, 6 mcg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 mcg with Algel) and one Algel-only control (no antigen), with the 1st dose administered on day 0 and the 2nd dose on day 14. The 3 mcg and 6 mcg with Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for this phase 2 study. Herein, we report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the 1st dose administered on day 0 and the 2nd dose on day 28.

Interpretation: In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 induced high neutralising antibody responses that remained elevated in all participants at 3 months after the 2nd vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial. The 6 mcg with Algel-IMDG formulation has been selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial. - Mod.LK]

Abstract
--------
The drastic rise in the number of cases in Maharashtra, India has created a matter of concern for public health experts. Twelve isolates of VUI lineage B.1.617 were propagated in VeroCCL81 cells and characterized. Convalescent sera of the COVID-19 cases and recipients of BBV152 (Covaxin) were able to neutralize VUI B.1.617.

From the text: Several variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), B.1.1.28 (Brazil P1, P2)] have been reported in India during January to April 2021 (1,2 [see source URL for complete references]). The daily rise in the reported number of SARS-CoV-2 infections has also reached a striking [level] in the country. Among all the affected states, the western State of Maharashtra been hit the hardest during this 2nd wave (3). The drastic rise in the number of cases in Maharashtra has been an enigma and matter of concern to public health experts.

Here, we report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 of new lineage B.1.617 with several spike mutations from Maharashtra state, India. Further, we investigated the neutralization efficiency of convalescent sera (n = 17) and the sera collected from BBV152 (Covaxin) vaccinated individuals (n = 28) against the B1(D614G) and B.1.617 variants.

So far 21 countries have detected the B.1.617 variant, most of which have been reported from India (11). The study's findings suggest the need for continuing genomic surveillance of B.1.617 and other new emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. Assessing the clinical efficacy of BBV152 against such variants is underway. It is also important to link genomic surveillance to appropriate public health interventions for preventing massive transmission of the virus. Further studies are needed to understand the transmissibility and infectivity of the B.1.617 variant. Most importantly the assurance of neutralization of B.1.617 variant with sera of BBV152 vaccinees and recovered COVID-19 cases sera will provide the much-needed boost to the COVID-19 vaccination program in India.

[C] Case update: surge continues
Date: Thu 27 Apr 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/indias-daily-covid-19-cases-break-yet-another-record


The pace of new COVID-19 cases in India hit a new daily world record today [27 Apr 2021], topping 300 000 for the 7th day in a row as its daily deaths topped 3000 for the 1st time. The worst surge of the pandemic has prompted an outpouring of international assistance as more help arrived.

India's health ministry reported 362 757 new cases today [27 Apr 2021], along with 3285 more deaths. Some experts say the case numbers are likely an undercount, owing to a drop in testing, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-india/medical-supplies-flow-into-india-as-covid-19-deaths-near-200000-idUSKBN2CE09Y).

Ventilators and oxygen concentrators from the United Kingdom arrived in New Delhi, where a train hauling 70 tons of oxygen arrived from eastern India. Yesterday [26 Apr 2021], the maker of remdesivir, Gilead Sciences, announced that it took steps to scale up the production of the drug in India and will donate at least 450 000 doses.

The United States is among the countries that has announced urgent assistance for India, and Indian government sources told Reuters that they expect to receive the biggest portion of the 60 million AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine doses that the United States is donating to the global fight against the virus (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-india-vaccine/india-expects-biggest-share-of-u-s-doses-of-astrazeneca-vaccine-government-sources-idUSKBN2CE18S).

Last week [23 Apr 2021], Doctors Without Borders (MSF) announced it had restarted its emergency response in India, which targets case identification, management, and prevention efforts in Mumbai. Part of the nonprofit's work involves working with people who have tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis, some of whom have COVID-19 coinfections.

Also, MSF has expanded its efforts at health centers in overcrowded areas of Mumbai, where living conditions contribute to the spread of the virus, and it is taking steps to staff 2 units at a Mumbai hospital that will add 1000 intensive care unit beds.

Other countries in the region are also battling COVID spikes. Amid worries over oxygen supply, Pakistan's 2 most populous provinces yesterday [26 Apr 2021] announced bans on elective surgeries to preserve oxygen supplies for COVID-19 patients, according to CNN. Pakistan yesterday asked its military to help enforce COVID-19 measures, and the country's president told the nation that he hopes to avoid a lockdown but may have no choice.

Nepal's cases are also climbing, with Kathmandu as one of the country's hot spot, according to a separate CNN report. At least 3 cities in Nepal have ordered lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus.

More global headlines
- Turkey's government yesterday [26 Apr 2021] announced a nationwide lockdown that will begin 29 Apr and last until 17 May [2021], according to Reuters. The country's cases have declined over the past 2 weeks but are still among the world's worst per capita.
- In vaccine developments, Brazil's regulators rejected Russia's Sputnik V vaccine due to lack of data on safety, effectiveness, and quality, though Russia has pushed back on the country's assessment. And Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis said it is scaling up production capacity to make COVID-19 vaccine for Germany-based CureVac, which has developed an mRNA vaccine.
- Brazil's senate has launched an investigation into President Jair Bolsonaro's response to COVID-19, following months of the country's leader downplaying the threat and promoting untested treatments, according to The Guardian. Brazil, where cases recently stabilized at a high level, is among the world's worst-hit countries.
- Canada is sending its army and Red Cross to help with Ontario's surge in COVID hospitalizations, Reuters reported.
- The global total today [27 Apr 2021] topped 148 million cases, rising to 148 160 752, and 3 125 773 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard.

[India keeps reporting increasing numbers of cases and deaths. Other countries are also struggling, including Nepal, Brazil, and Canada (Ontario), but because of its population size, the numbers in India are staggering. At least there is now a global response coming to the country's aid. As stated in a number of my previous comments, response to the pandemic has to be global for so many reasons, including humanitarian, economic, and selfish ones. What impacts one country will in time impact others. - Mod.LK]

[2] USA: CDC outdoor mask policy
Date: Tue 27 Apr 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/cdc-fully-vaccinated-americans-can-go-maskless-outdoors


Today [27 Apr 2021] the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said fully vaccinated Americans no longer need to wear masks during bike rides, runs, small outdoor gatherings with friends, or dining outdoors at restaurants.

Though the agency still recommends mask wearing in large outdoor gatherings, such as sports games and concerts, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said data are clear that being outside poses little threat to fully vaccinated people, meaning those who are 14 days out from their Johnson & Johnson vaccine or received their 2nd dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine 14 or more days ago.

"Most of transmission is happening indoors than outdoors," Walensky said, explaining that less than 10% of documented COVID-19 transmission has occurred outside.

Unvaccinated Americans may also now safely resume exercising outdoors without a mask, the CDC said, and socialize with fully vaccinated friends and family members in small outdoor gatherings. "Today is another day we can take a step back to [the] normalcy of before," Walensky said during a White House press briefing on the guidance change.

Walensky said she was feeling hopeful this week as the 7-day average for new confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths continued to fall. The 7-day average of new daily cases is now 54 000, down 21% from the previous week. Hospitalizations are down 9%, to an average of 5100 per day. And daily fatalities have dropped to an average of 660 per day, a decrease of 6%.

The United States reported 47 430 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [26 Apr 2021] and 479 deaths, according to The New York Times. In total, the country has confirmed 32 152 531 cases, including 573 044 deaths (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).

In brief remarks delivered outside the White House today [27 Apr 2021], President Joe Biden said the drop in fatalities, especially among older Americans, is a sign of the "stunning progress" the country has made via vaccination. About 85% of Americans over age 65 have had at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, Biden said, and the vaccination rate among older White, Black, and Latino Americans is even, a sign vaccine distribution has been equitable.

"July 4th [2021] is the target date to get life back to normal and celebrate our independence from the virus," Biden said.

Andy Slavitt, the White House senior advisor for COVID response, said today [27 Apr 2021] that the federal government plans to send 30 million doses this week to states and territories for continued vaccination efforts. He said now is the time for young adults, like college students, to get vaccinated, and said it was never easier to do so.

Slavitt said the federal response team had confirmed with governors today that college students, who may get a 1st dose of vaccine near their campus and a 2nd dose in either their home state or town, will not be required to show proof of residence if they get vaccinated through the federal pharmacy program.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 297 543 635 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in the United States, and 232 407 669 have been administered, with 96 747 454 Americans fully vaccinated. (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations).

The Navajo Nation has vaccinated more than half its adult population against COVID-19, outpacing the US national rate, National Public Radio (NPR) reports. Last May [2020], the Navajo Nation was home to the nation's highest per-capita infection rate (https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/04/26/990884991/outpacing-the-u-s-hard-hit-navajo-nation-has-vaccinated-more-than-half-of-adults).

Despite the push for vaccination, lawmakers in 40 states have now introduced legislation that would forbid mandates requiring people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, USA Today reports (https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/health/2021/04/27/lawmakers-over-40-states-seek-ban-covid-19-vaccine-requirements/7326506002/).

The bills, which are unlikely to become law, seek to prohibit businesses from requiring employees to be vaccinated or requiring new vaccinations to attend schools and daycares. Several private colleges have already announced that they will require vaccination for on-campus students in the fall.

[Finally, a ray of sunlight peeking through. CDC approval for elimination of masks outdoors with limited exposure to others is a welcome change. However, individuals will have to decide where to draw the line between large and small social gatherings.

It is highly commendable that the Navajo Nation has vaccinated "more than half of its adult population against COVID-19, outpacing the US national rate and marking a significant turnaround for what was once the site of the highest per-capita infection rate in the country."

According to The New York Times, "the country's case numbers are starting to drop again after a month of stagnation. Outbreaks are subsiding in the Upper Midwest. Michigan, Minnesota, and Illinois are all reporting drops in new cases," more good news. - Mod.LK]

[Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of 10 a.m. CET 25 Apr 2021]

Globally, new COVID-19 cases increased for the 9th consecutive week, with nearly 5.7 million new cases reported in the last week, surpassing previous peaks. The number of new deaths increased for the 6th consecutive week, with over 87 000 new deaths reported. In this edition, a special focus update is provided on SARS-CoV-2 variants.

In this edition:
- Global overview
- Special focus: SARS-CoV-2 variants
- WHO regional overviews
- Key weekly updates

Global overview
Globally, new COVID-19 cases increased for the 9th consecutive week, with nearly 5.7 million new cases reported in the last week, surpassing previous peaks (Figure 1 [see source URLs for all figures, tables, supplemental material, and references]). The number of new deaths increased for the 6th consecutive week, with over 87 000 new deaths reported. This week, all regions are reporting decreases in case incidence apart from the South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions. For the 3rd consecutive week, the South-East Asia region reported the highest relative increases in both case and death incidences (Table 1). While a number of countries in the region are reporting upward trends, India accounts for the vast majority of cases from this regional trend and 38% of global cases reported in the past week. Similarly, all but 2 regions, South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean, reported declines in new deaths this week.

Special focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 variants
WHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions and researchers, continues to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest (VOIs) and variants of concern (VOCs), and assess these and other emerging variants based on the risk posed to global public health, including impacts on epidemiology and public health and social measures (PHSM). Here we provide an update on the geographical distribution, and emerging evidence surrounding phenotypic characteristics of designated VOIs and VOCs (Table 2).

As surveillance activities to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants are strengthened at local and national levels, including by strategic genomic sequencing and sharing full genome sequences with publicly available platforms such as GISAID, the number of countries/areas/territories (hereafter countries) reporting VOCs continues to increase.

Since our last update on 20 Apr 2021, VOC 202012/01 has been detected in 3 additional countries, variant 501Y.V2 in 3 additional countries, and variant P.1 in 2 additional countries.

As of 27 Apr 2021, a total 139 countries have reported VOC 202012/01 (Figure 3), 87 countries VOC 501Y.V2 (Figure 4), and 54 countries VOC P.1 (Figure 5) -- see also Annex 2.

These distributions should be interpreted with due consideration of surveillance limitations, including differences in sequencing capacities and prioritization of samples for sequencing between countries.

Available evidence on vaccine performance against VOCs has been highlighted in previous editions of the Weekly Epidemiological Update, most recently 13 Apr 2021, and are summarised in Table 3.

Further to this, there is growing real-world evidence of the effectiveness of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty vaccine against symptomatic disease as well as severe disease in health workers and adults in the United Kingdom and Israel during times when VOC 202012/01 was circulating or dominant, providing support for neutralization and vaccine efficacy (VE) results.

Real-world evidence also points to high effectiveness against asymptomatic infection (3-11). Analysis of nationwide surveillance data in Israel reported a VE of 94.1% (93.5-94.6) against asymptomatic infection 14 days or more post 2nd dose among a large cohort of adults 16 years and older.

A 2nd study reported a 4-fold decrease in the risk of asymptomatic infection 12 days or more post dose 1 among health workers in the United Kingdom.

Two effectiveness studies conducted in the United Kingdom have reported VOC 202012/01-specific VE estimates for 2 doses of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty and found no difference in effectiveness of the vaccine against disease caused by VOC 202012/01 as compared to other variants.

There is also growing real-world evidence showing a single dose of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria is effective against symptomatic disease and infection in VOC 202012/01 settings. Data is currently lacking on the effectiveness of 2 doses of AstraZeneca.

Although moderate to substantial loss was observed with the AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria vaccine, the confidence intervals are broad and caution should be taken interpreting the results, given the limited sample size.

Phase III clinical trial results from South Africa show vaccine efficacy of Janssen-Ad26.COV 2.5 vaccine to be 52% (95% CI: 30.3-67.4) against moderate to severe/critical disease when variant 501Y.V2 made up 95% of sequenced virus.

Efficacy against severe critical disease was 73.1% (40.0-89.4), comparable to that found in the USA.

Although moderate to substantial loss was observed with the AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria vaccine, the confidence intervals are broad and caution should be taken interpreting the results, given the limited sample size.

Variants of interest B.1.617
----------------------------
Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants within Pango lineage B.1.617 were recently reported as a VOI from India and has recently been designated as VOIs by WHO.

As of 27 Apr [2021], over 1200 sequences have been uploaded to GISAID and assigned to lineage B.1.617 (collectively) from at least 17 countries; most sequences were uploaded from India, the United Kingdom, USA, and Singapore.

However, this lineage comprises several sub-lineages, including B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and B.1.617.3, which slightly differ by their characteristic mutations.

Both B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 were first identified in India in December 2020 and have been detected at increasing prevalence concurrent to the major upsurge observed in the country. B.1.617.3 was first detected in India in October 2020, but relatively fewer viruses matching this sub-lineage have been reported to date.

B.1.617 includes several mutations present in other VOIs / VOCs that have been associated with phenotypic impacts.

Three characteristic mutations of this variant include L452R, P681R, and E484Q (the latter observed in sub-lineages B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.3).

L452R has been identified in another VOI, B.1.427/ B.1.429, which has been associated with increased transmissibility, a reduction in neutralization by some (but not all) monoclonal antibody treatments, and a moderate reduction in neutralization in post-vaccination sera in the USA.

P681R is adjacent to the furin cleavage site and (together with other mutations) may enhance binding and subsequent cleavage of the spike protein and enhances systemic infection and membrane fusion; potentially resulting in enhanced transmission.

Laboratory studies suggest that convalescent samples from individuals who had natural infection may have reduced neutralization against variants with an E484Q mutation. Preliminary laboratory studies of a small number of convalescent sera samples of COVID-19 cases (n=17) and recipients of Novavax-Covaxin (n=28) were able to neutralize B.1.617.

In India, heterogeneity in B.1.617 geographic distribution is observed across regions, with co-circulation of other VOCs (including VOC 202012/01 and 501Y.V2) and other variants (e.g., B.1.618), which collectively may be playing a role in the current resurgence in this country.

Indeed, studies have highlighted that the spread of the 2nd wave has been much faster than the 1st.

Preliminary modelling by WHO based on sequences submitted to GISAID suggest that B.1.617 has a higher growth rate than other circulating variants in India, suggesting potential increased transmissibility, with other co-circulating variants also demonstrating increased transmissibility.

Other drivers may include challenges around the implementation and adherence to public health and social measures (PHSM) and social gatherings (including mass gatherings during cultural and religious celebrations, and elections).

Further investigation is needed to understand the relative contribution of these factors.

It remains unclear how generalizable laboratory-based studies of limited sample sizes, as well as studies of other variants with similar key mutations, are to the wider circulating B.1.617 variants.

Further robust studies into the phenotypic impacts of these variants, including impacts on epidemiological characteristics (transmissibility, severity, reinfection risk, etc.) and impact on countermeasures, are urgently needed.

WHO recommendations
-------------------------
Virus evolution is expected, and the more SARS-CoV-2 circulates, the more opportunities it has to mutate. Reducing transmission through established and proven disease control methods such as those outlined in the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, as well as avoiding introductions into animal populations are crucial aspects of the global strategy to reduce the occurrence of mutations that have negative public health implications.

PHSM remain critical to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

Evidence from multiple countries with extensive transmission of VOCs has indicated that the implementation of PHSM and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in health facilities has been effective in reducing COVID-19 case incidence, which has led to a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among COVID-19 patients.

National and local authorities are encouraged to continue strengthening existing PHSM, IPC, and disease control activities.

Authorities are also encouraged to strengthen surveillance and sequencing capacities and apply a systematic approach to provide a representative indication of the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants based on the local context, and to detect unusual events.
