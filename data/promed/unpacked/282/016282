Foot-and-mouth report: "vaccinate in future"
----------------------------------
A Government-appointed inquiry today recommended emergency vaccination
be used
in the event of another outbreak of foot-and-mouth. The Royal Society said
animals on an infected farm should still be culled but suggests healthy
livestock
on neighboring premises be vaccinated as a "major tool of first resort" to
prevent the disease spreading. It says Britain should make a major effort with
other EU states to ensure emergency vaccination could be used by the end of
next
year.
The inquiry rejected, however, routine vaccination of all susceptible
animals in
the UK as long as the risk of disease entering the country remains low. It
goes
on to say the Government should adopt a policy of "vaccinate to live" if
another
outbreak occurs, meaning that the meat from animals given the vaccine
should be
allowed to enter the human food chain.
The report also suggests that contingency plans designed to control future
animal
disease outbreaks be approved in advance by Parliament. It says the plans
should
be rehearsed every year and reviewed every 3 years.
The Royal Society inquiry, under the chairmanship of Professor Sir Brian
Follett,
was asked to review scientific questions relating to the transmission,
prevention, and control of epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases in
livestock
in the Great Britain. It followed last year's devastating foot-and-mouth
crisis,
which led to the slaughter of almost 7 million animals and cost the
taxpayer and
the private sector more than 8 billion pounds.
However, the inquiry was also asked to look wider at other animal diseases
which
pose a threat to livestock in Britain, such as classical and African swine
fever.
Sir Brian said: "Globalization has caused an increased risk of infectious
animal
diseases entering the UK. "The overall objective of the national policy
must be
to minimize the risk of a disease entering the country and reaching a farm.
"If
an outbreak does occur, it must not be allowed to develop into an epidemic,
as it
has happened a number of times in the last century." The report also calls
on the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to approve a
test by
the end of next year which allows officials to distinguish between infected
and
vaccinated animals.

[Reading the Summary & Main Recommendations there is very little one can
disagree
with, and much to agree with. It is a sound document. But there are two points
that have been ignored and they are important:
[1] Every model must undergo validation and verification. While checking the
arguments and scales used is obvious, it is not always done. But I have not
seen
one model tested retrospectively and critically against the reality in the
field.
Predictions are not the same as reality. All that was done was to see if the
curves matched generally. This testing should have been done last year
during the
epidemic and certainly against the modelers' demand for 3kms culling. There
was
sufficient field experience and GIS topographic and detailed agricultural
data to
put it in doubt and certainly to hard test. I have a phrase I use on my
students
and those over-enamored of their computers and models, "Why should I
believe you
when you have a computer pallor and no mud on your shoes?" The truth is in
the
field, not in the computer. When models are checked and rechecked against
reality
they can be fine-tuned and may eventually become useful.
Remember that they all start as merely the mathematical expression of the
model
builder's presumptions and assumptions.
[2] During any emergency, big or small, appropriate data must be collected and
kept securely to allow a critical retrospective post-mortem. This may need a
special forensic team with funding to independently assess what had
happened and
why, using ministry samples and data collected during the epidemic and even
additional data collected subsequently. When all the dust has settled and
honors
awarded, one must be able to sit down and work out, without blame, what went
right, what could have been done better, and play "what-if" if one is to
ever get
it right. Plus the next time will be different. If there are good
databases, they
can be used to model the future and ask new questions. Also these data
should be
readily shared.
Based on my experience, I fear both are hobby horses; I have built my share of
mathematical models. Some fall in love with their models but you should
never marry them. And the truth is in the field. - Mod.MHJ]
