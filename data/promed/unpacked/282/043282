Late blight affects potato production in Yusipang
-------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of late blight, a potato plant disease, is affecting
potato production in the farms of Yusipang in Thimphu.

The disease occurs during monsoon [rainy] season. The blight appears
1st as a light to dark green spot. It usually appears first on the
lower leaves and then affects the potato plant leaves in an upward
direction. During cool, moist weather, the spots spread on the leaves
rapidly into dark or brown color, ultimately killing the plants. The
spots also spread down [leaf] petioles and stems of the plant.

Kezang Tshering, the research officer in the horticulture sector at
Yusipang said farmers are being advised to use chemical spray
containing fungicide to prevent the outbreak of late blight. But he
said farmers do not use the chemical spray in time.

Kezang Tshering said if chemical sprays [reach] the farmers in time
and if farmers use the spray as recommended by the agriculture
workers then production will pick up.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora
infestans_, which can also infect other solanaceous crops such as
tomato & eggplant. The fungus affects leaves as well as tubers and
can cause 100 percent crop loss. It is spread by plant material
(including seed tubers), wind, and water, and solanaceous weeds can
serve as pathogen reservoirs. Other fungi and bacteria often invade
blight-infected tubers resulting in total tuber breakdown. Disease
management includes preventative fungicide treatment of seed tubers
and additional fungicide applications to the crop. Some PLB resistant
potato varieties are available. The pathogen is considered an
increasing threat worldwide because new and even more virulent
strains continue to emerge.

For more information on PLB see links and previous posts below.

A severe form of PLB was responsible for the Irish potato famine in
the late 1840s, which led to mass emigration of Irish to America -
