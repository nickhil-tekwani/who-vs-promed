Sweden: 4 outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis after consumption of
raspberries, June-August 2006
----------------------------------------------------
So far in 2006, in Sweden, there have been 4 outbreaks of norovirus
gastroenteritis where raspberries were the suspected vehicle of
infection. The 1st outbreak occurred at the end of June, the 2nd was
at the beginning of August and the 3rd and 4th at the end of August.
All the outbreaks occurred in the southwestern part of the country.
In total, 43 people became ill and all these people had eaten
raspberries as part of various different dishes.
Outbreak 1
----------
On 23 Jun 2006, a group of 15 people met at a private party, where
they ate homemade cake containing cream and raspberries. One or 2
days after, 12 people fell ill with gastrointestinal symptoms. Stool
samples from 2 patients were tested and found positive for norovirus
by PCR.
Outbreak 2
----------
On 2 Aug 2006, there was a family gathering of 11 people on the west
coast of Sweden. Cheesecake with raspberries was served at the party
and was eaten by all of the guests. The following day, 10 people fell
ill with signs and symptoms typical of norovirus infection. Later, 2
secondary cases were reported. No faecal samples were taken, as the
patients had already recovered by the time the outbreak was notified
to the authorities. During the outbreak investigation it was
determined that the raspberries in the cheesecake were of the same
brand as in the first outbreak and imported from China.
Outbreak 3
----------
On 24 Aug 2006 a school class with about 30 pupils aged 13 prepared
drinks with raspberries. A mother of one of the children reported
that her child had become ill on 26 or 27 Aug 2006. The county
medical officer carried out a cohort study and it was discovered that
12 children had been ill. The incubation period was 24-36 hours, the
symptoms vomiting, fever, diarrhoea and headache. The duration of
disease was 1-3 days. Faecal samples from 2 children tested positive
for norovirus by PCR. Leftovers of raspberries in a plastic bag were
saved for later analysis. These raspberries were the same brand as
the other outbreaks.
Outbreak 4
----------
On 25 Aug 2006, a meeting took place with 9 participants. The guests
ate baguettes with filling from a catering company and a homemade
raspberry parfait for dessert. Following this meeting, all 9 people
fell ill. One stool sample was taken for testing, and this was
positive for norovirus. Raspberries were left over and saved for
testing -- results are pending. These berries were also the same
brand as in the previous outbreaks.
Conclusion
----------
All of the suspected raspberries in these outbreaks were the same
brand, and from the same distributor in Sweden who imported these
from China. Raspberries were left over in 2 outbreaks and results of
further tests on the raspberries are pending. On 23 Aug 2006, 2
batches of raspberries were withdrawn from the market.
Outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus from frozen imported
raspberries have been reported from several European countries in
recent years [1,2,3]. Since 2000 in Sweden, there have been 11
outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus in which the
suspected food has contained raspberries (database at
Smittkyddsinstitutet).

[Soft fruits, raspberries in particular, are a frequent source of
gastroenteritis since such produce is harvested by hand, frozen for
distribution with minimal pre-cleaning, and with minimal preparation
before consumption. The rapidity of onset of illness in the Swedish
outbreaks suggests gross contamination of the fruit. A compounding
factor may be the origin of the fruit, which was imported from China.
It may be that the Swedish population has had little exposure to and
little resistance to the type of norovirus prevalent in China. A risk
inherent in the importation of soft fruits from remote suppliers. -
