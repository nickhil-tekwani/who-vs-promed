Louisiana: wild birds in 3 parishes test positive for West Nile virus
-----------------------------------------------
3 dead birds in Caddo Parish have tested positive for the mosquito-borne
West Nile virus, which is also transmitted by infected mosquitoes to
humans. The Office of Public Health (OPH) in Shreveport also reported on
Thu 29 Apr 2004 that 2 birds in Sabine Parish, and one in Webster Parish,
have tested positive. The birds include sparrows, blue jays and cardinals.
"I think the big message we have is that mosquito season is here. Everyone
needs to be on the alert and take precautions," said Jerre Perry,
administrator for OPH's Region 7, a 9-parish area in Northwest Louisiana.

Tracking infected dead birds generally predicts where the virus will show
up in humans. In 2003, the state recorded 121 human cases and 7 deaths.
Caddo and Bossier parishes together had a total of 51 human cases. These
parishes also had reported the highest number of birds testing positive for
West Nile virus, according to the state Department of Health and Hospitals.

Dan Saxon, chief biologist with Caddo Parish mosquito control, said on Thu
29 Apr that parish-wide spraying will begin on Mon night [3 May 2004], with
8 trucks in action. Until now, the parish has been doing complaint spraying
according to citizen calls, Saxon said. While the mosquito trap that Saxon
regularly checks is showing low numbers, "we're finding mosquitoes
everywhere we go to look," he said, adding that most of the mosquitoes now
are the kind that can fly 20 miles.

[2] Sentinel chickens deployed - Utah

Utah: deployment of sentinel chickens
-----------------------------------------------
For 380 young chickens, once destined for a life in the hen house, Fri [7
May 2004] brought a higher calling. The 16-week-old poults traded in
egg-laying duties for front-line positions in the war against the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Mosquito control officials, gathered at the
Utah County Department of Public Works campus, sent the sentinel chickens
packing to dozens of destinations across Utah. Each chicken will be dropped
into a mosquito-infested area to serve as an early-warning system for
humans. If a West Nile mosquito feeds on one of the hens, the bird will
develop certain antibodies, said Lewis Marrott, head of the Utah County
Division of Mosquito Abatement.

Once embedded in their new homes -- 5 to 10 chickens per location -- the
feathered guardians will receive weekly blood tests. The blood samples will
be sent to a state veterinary lab in Nephi. Sentinel chickens -- which are
also found in many other states -- are just one part of Utah's virus
detection program.

Even before West Nile virus came to the United States in 1999, the state
had been using chickens to find mosquito-borne diseases. State officials
also will watch horses, wild birds, mosquitoes, and humans to track the
disease's progress across Utah. "If we're anything like Colorado was last
year, we could have 1500 cases of West Nile disease and 40 deaths," said
Joseph Miner, director of the Utah County Department of Health. In 2003,
Colorado endured 2947 human cases and 61 deaths, up from 14 cases in 2002.
Colorado seems to follow a recent national trend, in which the number of
human cases soars during 2nd year the virus is present. In 2003, Utah had a
single human case, though the virus was found in mosquitoes or animals in 9
counties.

West Nile virus does not kill or sicken the chickens, which makes them
ideal detection systems, said Ken Minson, head of the South Salt Lake
Valley Mosquito Abatement District.

Michigan: West Vile virus-positive crow found in Saginaw county
-----------------------------------------------
State officials say West Nile virus has made its 1st appearance of the year
in Michigan. Health authorities detected the virus in a dead crow found in
the town of Tittabawassee Township, Saginaw County, last week [early May
2004]. The head of mosquito control in Saginaw County says that it's
unclear whether the discovery is an indicator for a bad season in 2004 for
the potentially fatal virus. Michigan had only 19 reported human cases of
West Nile virus infection in 2003, including 2 deaths. In 2002, the state
had 644 reported cases of the virus and at least 51 deaths.

Colorado: 1st suspected human case of 2004
-----------------------------------------------
Weld County could once again have the 1st human case of West Nile virus
infection in Colorado. The news took Weld health officials by surprise,
even as they are gearing up for another summer full of cases. Mark Wallace,
director of the Weld County Department of Health and Environment, said many
thought the 1st human case wouldn't come for a few weeks.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture, on Mon 10 May 2004, reported the
1st equine West Nile case for the state.

Blood from a Weld County resident tested positive for West Nile virus
infection, Wallace said, although it still needs to be confirmed by the
state health department and the Center for Disease Control. Health
officials said those tests probably won't be available for a week. The
name, age or residence of the Weld County victim was not available. The
person was not hospitalized but had symptoms consistent with West Nile,
leading to the reason for the test, Wallace said.

In 2003, 402 residents were diagnosed with West Nile virus infection, and
of those, 5 died, including the 1st death in the state. Weld County has had
the 1st human cases in the state in the past 2 years.

Usually dead birds are the 1st sign of the disease, followed by equine
cases, and, finally, humans. But in 2004, Wallace said dead birds had been
reported, but he wasn't aware of a bird testing positive for the virus in
2004 by the Weld County health department. Colorado Mosquito Control is
finding mosquitoes in its traps in Weld County, although the numbers are
low. The company, which is contracting with Weld for a USD 450 000 mosquito
control program, started putting larvacide in areas with standing water a
week or two ago. The company won't start spraying until the mosquito
numbers are much higher. Residents who are concerned about high numbers of
mosquitoes in their neighborhoods can call the company for spraying.
Colorado Mosquito Control has more than 800 traps in the Greeley area, and,
for now, at least few of the species of mosquitoes that carry West Nile
have been discovered, said Tony Stilwell, operations manager for Colorado
Mosquito control. Stilwell said some people are mistaking midge flies, and
so-called floodwater mosquitoes, for _Culex tarsalis_ mosquitoes.
Floodwater mosquitoes do not transmit West Nile virus.
