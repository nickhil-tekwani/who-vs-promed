Further to recent press stories concerning Lassa fever in west and central
Africa, I thought you might be interested in the following story. This has
also been sent to relevant UN agencies who have asked us for further
information on the subject.
Richard Allan Medical Advisor for MERLIN (Medical Emergency Relief
International) reports: "Leading up to the military coup in Sierra Leone in
May 1997, there was sporadic fighting in the main Lassa fever region during
April and May. This severely disrupted [the ability of MERLIN's medical
outreach teams to have access to the worst affected areas of Sierra
Leone's Lassa belt. Fighting prevented many critically ill patients with
Lassa fever from reaching the only Lassa fever treatment available in the
country at Kenema Government Hospital".
MERLIN has maintained intensive medical care for those few Lassa patients
that have managed to reach the hospital since the start of renewed
conflict, in which most of the MERLIN-supported health centres in the Lassa
district were destroyed. Richard said "We had to evacuate the Lassa
patients to another site in June when the hospital came under attack, but
we were able to reopen the hospital ward in July. There has been
continuous heavy fighting in the disease epicentres of Panguma and Tongo
Fields since the coup in May and this is preventing any access into or out
of these sites. We have reopened 6 clinics in safer areas of the district
around Kenema town, but are not yet able to get back into the area of the
district where Lassa fever is concentrated. We have about a dozen cases on
the ward but we suspect that many more remain untreated in the district and
are unable to get to the hospital because of the fighting".
MERLIN has been providing emergency medical care to war-affected
populations in the eastern province of Kenema, Sierra Leone, since April
1996. In May 1996, the number of critically ill Lassa fever patients
presenting at the MERLIN-supported hospital in Kenema town rose
dramatically from 28 in the previous month to 73. WHO declared Lassa fever
to be epidemic in May. The case fatality for 1996 was 29% for hospitalised
cases. MERLIN was asked to take over responsibiltiy for controlling the
epidemic and from December 1996 provided full support to controlling the
disease and treating patients. There were a total of 367 cases in 1996.
Richard Allan said "The epidemic escalated in January 1997 to become the
worst epidemic of Lassa fever ever recorded. Working with the national and
local health authorities, MERLIN treated over 328 hospitalised cases of
Lassa fever in the first four months of 1997". MERLIN expanded the Lassa
fever intensive care ward to cope with the caseload and ensured full
barrier nursing techniques to reduce the transmission of the disease
between patients and health staff. The case fatality rate was cut to 14.6%
for the first four months of 1997. "The disease is transmitted by rats
infected with the virus which come into close contact with humans.
Foodstuffs contaminated with [infected rat urine appears to have been the
major [carrier of virus and responsible for initial disease transmission,
but human to human disease transmission is likely to have been responsible
for the majority of cases in this epidemic. Cramped living conditions of
displaced people and families returning to live in villages within the
Lassa belt after years of civil conflict have also contributed to the
problem".
MERLIN established an integrated Lassa fever control programme in response
to this epidemic early in 1997. This programme included: (1) Intensive
care of patients at Kenema Government Hospital. (2) Contact tracing. In
order to increase early disease detection, a team traveled to the home
villages of new patients in order to trace all of the human contacts of
those patients admitted to the Lassa fever ward. (3) Radio installations
at health facilities in the epicentres for Lassa. (4) Lassa ambulance to
collect new patients from key sites after radio notification, resulting in
earlier intensive treatment. (5) Community awareness education to reduce
human-to-rat contact and increase early referrals. (6) Community
sanitation and rubbish management programme to reduce rat breeding sites
established through 4 years of general destruction in the Lassa epicentres.
(7) Rodent control and human education campaign to reduce the number of
infected rats and to ensure the safe handling and disposal of rats.
The emergency team in Kenema is expanding outreach work in the district as
security improves and will restart full Lassa fever patient tracing as soon
as the situation allows full access to the disease epicentres. MERLIN has
established another medical team in Lofa county, Liberia. They have set-up
Lassa fever surveillance in their clinics in Vahun district of Lofa, which
borders Sierra Leone. 11,000 refugees from the eastern provinces of Sierra
Leone have recently crossed into Liberia to escape the ongoing fighting.
