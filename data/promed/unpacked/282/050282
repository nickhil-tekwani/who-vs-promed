officials in Tbilisi said."
On Sunday March 10 1996, the International Herald Tribune wrote on
page 3: "A new pasteurization process could take the risk out of
eating a Gulf Coast delicacy - raw oysters on the half shell. The
Food and Drug Administration says treated oysters do not need a
label warning about the bacterium |Vibrio vulnificus|. The
bacterium need not worry healthy people, but it can make those with
liver disease, immune disorders or other health problems fatally
ill. The AmeriPure treatment - a brief stay in hot water, followed
by an immediate, longer cold water bath - kills the bacteria
without affecting the taste or texture of raw oysters, the company
says."
