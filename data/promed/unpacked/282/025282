Hydranencephaly in calves following the bluetongue serotype 8
epidemic in the Netherlands
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As pathologists of the Animal Health Service (AHS) in the
Netherlands, we have recently observed an increasing number of
submissions of aborted and newborn calves with severe developmental
defects of the brain. In most cases the lesions were confined to the cerebrum.

Cerebral hemispheres consisted of fluctuant fluid-filled sacs bounded
by a rim of parenchyma and leptomeninges. The thickness of the
remaining rim of cortical parenchyma varied but was very thin and
transparent in most cases. The brainstem structures and the
cerebellum were mostly unaffected, except for 2 cases, in which the
cerebellum was absent as well. Histologically, the remnants of
cerebral cortex consisted of loosely arranged glial cells with
scattered calcium deposits and haemosiderin-filled macrophages.

This type of lesion has been described as hydranencephaly and has
been associated with infection with teratogenic viruses such as
Akabane virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Wesselbron virus and
bluetongue virus (BTV) during pregnancy, whereas the most
characteristic teratogenic effect of bovine viral diarrhoea virus
(BVDV) is cerebellar hypoplasia. [For the references, see the
original paper. -Mod.AS]

The use of live attenuated BTV vaccine in pregnant sheep is a known
cause of hydranencephaly in lambs. In cattle, BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8)
was found to be the cause of a field outbreak of hydranencephaly in
newborn calves in northern California in 1968. Hydranencephaly has
been induced by BTV serotype 10 in calves after experimental
infection at 125 days' gestation.

A total of 18 cases of hydranencephaly have been diagnosed at the AHS
so far. The 1st case was submitted on 25 Oct 2007; 2 further cases
were submitted in December 2007, 4 cases were seen in January 2008
and 11 cases in February 2008. Eleven cases were fetuses aborted
between 6 and 8 months' gestation (2 fetuses were almost full term).
Seven cases were liveborn calves; one of these was born 2 weeks
prematurely. These calves survived for between 4 and 28 days before
they were euthanased. Clinical signs were opisthotonos, blindness,
abnormal posture with stretched limbs, uncontrolled gait, circling
and behavioural abnormalities (dummy calves). Some calves did not
drink or were unable to stand. All liveborn calves were submitted
during January and February 2008.

In all cases samples of spleen were taken and investigated by PCR for
the presence of BTV at the Central Veterinary Institute, Lelystad. A
PCR-positive result was seen in 6 aborted fetuses, all other cases
were negative. In their experimental work, MacLachlan and others were
not able to isolate BTV in calves that survived in utero infection.

An antigen ELISA for BVDV on a pooled sample of spleen and lung was
negative in 14 of 14 cases tested. Seven dams of bluetongue
PCR-negative calves could be traced and were blood sampled. All 7
dams had serum antibodies to BTV, and were negative in an antigen
ELISA for BVDV, whereas 5 of 7 dams had antibodies to BVDV.

In addition, the AHS veterinarians of the Department of Ruminant
Health have received an increasing number of telephone calls from
veterinary practitioners mentioning clinical cases of 'dummy' calves
and calves with opisthotonos in the field.

We conclude that there is accumulating evidence that infection with
BTV-8 during pregnancy in cattle may lead to congenital brain
defects, particularly hydranencephaly, in their progeny.

The presentation includes, among others, the following data
pertaining to transplacental BTV-8 transmission in cattle:

1. Increased abortion rate: 68 aborted fetuses tested, of which 28
found RT-PCR positive.
2. Increased neonatal mortality, malformations: 11 out of 109
suspected newborn calves RT-PCR and ELISA positive. -Mod.AS]

[2] Switzerland, vaccination

Bluetongue vaccine ordered
--------------------------
Switzerland has ordered 4 million doses of bluetongue [BT] vaccine.
According to information from the manufacturers, the vaccine will
become available during the first half of June 2008 for the
vaccination of all cattle, sheep and goats in Switzerland. BT does
not infect humans.

Switzerland has ordered the BTV-8 vaccine from 3 manufacturers;
namely Fort Dodge, Intervet and Merial. Combined, they will supply
during the months June and July 4 million doses for the summer
vaccination of all Swiss cattle, sheep and goats. Animals which will
be in June in "summer pastures" (namely on higher latitudes) will get
their initial vaccination when back to the valleys [namely end
summer/fall; see comment below. - Mod. AS]. This, in view of the
knowledge that infection can hardly be expected on the summer
pastures since the midges are mostly active in lower areas.

The campaign is being organised by the cantonal veterinary services
together with the Federal Veterinary Office; the vaccinations will be
carried out by veterinarians. Cattle are to be vaccinated twice
within a month, to obtain protection. Sheep, and probably goats as
well, will be vaccinated once. The vaccination will be financed by
the federal government, the cantons and the agricultural industry.

[According to OIE's data (2006), the cattle population of Switzerland
is 1 557 000, sheep 446 000 and goats 74 000. According to estimates
of other sources, at least 380 000 cattle including 130 000 dairy
cows, as well as 200 000 sheep graze during the summer months on
"high pastures."

The Swiss view about BTV infection to be hardly expected on the
summer pastures "since the midges are mostly active in lower areas"
is in need of clarification. It seems to be certainly valid when the
vector is _Culicoides imicola_. It will be interesting to obtain
updated information on the identity of the culicoides species
involved in the Swiss arena, and their breeding and feeding behaviour
in the prevailing habitats, including higher latitudes. - Mod.AS]
