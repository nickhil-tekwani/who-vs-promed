WHO Warns Against Epidemics in Kosovo
------------------------------------------
In the past few days, one case of suspected polio, 24 cases of suspected
Hepatitis A and one case of hemorrhagic fever have been registered in
Kosovo, Yugoslavia, according to WHO.
"These are the first cases registered in Kosovo" since the end of the NATO
bombing against Yugoslavia, WHO said in a press release.
A 19-year- old woman has been diagnosed as suffering from
hemorrhagic fever, according to WHO.
The World Health Organization ( WHO) warned Wednesday that
there is an urgent need to rebuild public health systems
capable of containing the spread of communicable diseases in
Kosovo.
