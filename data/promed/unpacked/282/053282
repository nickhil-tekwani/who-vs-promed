The moderator's comments are exactly right. Sadly, once again
uninformed speculation takes the place of a sound etiological and
epidemiological investigation, which should be the routine response
to such an incident.
Not only is there no evidence that the currently circulating H5N1
highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) can affect mammals
other than various members of the cat, dog, and mustelid [weasel]
families and, in exceptional circumstances, humans, but the statement
"Pigs are proven carriers ........." is incorrect. Although swine
have been infected with, and are thought to play an epidemiologically
significant role in influenza A virus evolution in general, there is
no convincing evidence that swine have been either infected or
affected by the H5N1 HPAI strain, which is the cause of concern here.
