There is a suspected outbreak of smallpox in Bodo Whea, Rivercess County. A
health worker at the Morweh clinic reported the outbreak of the disease in
the area. He claimed it is smallpox.
Mr. Benjamin Zeon said the disease started last year. He said about fifty
persons have been affected by the disease. Mr. Zeon said the French charity
Medecins du Monde recently sent a mobile team to the area. He said the team
assisted in providing drugs for the patients. Health authorities in
Monrovia could neither deny nor confirm the outbreak. They told STAR radio
that the matter was being investigated.
The WHO in nineteen seventy-nine reported that smallpox had been eradicated
worldwide.

[Smallpox has been eradicated. This is likely to be chickenpox, or
possibly monkeypox, which occurs in the former Zaire & looks very much like
smallpox clinically. Liberia is in a state of turmoil, & investigation is
likely to be difficult. The lack of media follow-up in the 3 weeks since
this report suggests that no investigations on the ground have yet been
made. Does anyone have any contacts in Liberia, or with Medecins du Monde,
to get further info? - Mod.JW
