The EDCC [Equine Disease Communication Center] said the Arizona Department of Agriculture (ADA) reported a case of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form of EHV-1) in a 16-year-old Yavapai County horse that began exhibiting neurologic signs on 22 Mar 2019. The horse was euthanized.

Samples for "lab work (were) collected, and tests are pending," the EDCC said.

Additionally, the ADA reported a case of EHV-1 in an 8-year-old Quarter Horse mare from Maricopa County, the EDCC said. The mare developed clinical signs on 21 Mar 2019.

"The horse was sent to a veterinary hospital for ventricular tachycardia (an irregular and overly rapid heartbeat), limb edema (swelling), and fever and was positive for non-neuropathogenic virus," the EDCC said.

The ADA also noted the horse had attended the Dixie Classic barrel-racing event, which took place at the Washington County Legacy Horse Park in South Hurricane, Utah.

The ADA has quarantined the affected facilities.

EHV 101
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM.

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or the clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

An equine herpesvirus positive [case] at Golden Gate Fields has the California Department of Food and Agriculture setting biosecurity measures at the Northern California track, while a 3-year-old on the Road to the Kentucky Derby is among those impacted by the discovery.

Trainer Blaine Wright, who conditions El Camino Real Derby winner Anothertwistafate, confirmed [Tue 26 Mar 2019] his main barn at Golden Gate is under quarantine after a 3-year-old filly in his care was euthanized on [Sat 23 Mar 2019].

According to a statement from the California Horse Racing Board, the filly developed severe neurological signs and tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 neurotrophic strain (EHV-1N).

"California Department of Food and Agriculture veterinary personnel have inspected the barn and reviewed biosecurity procedures that had been put in place," read the CHRB statement. "One barn of exposed horses has been placed under restricted quarantine with enhanced biosecurity measures and twice daily temperature monitoring. In addition to California Horse Racing Board (CHRB) and Golden Gate Fields management, CDFA personnel will continue to monitor the situation."

According to the CHRB statement, the most common incubation period after EHV-1N exposure is 3-8 days. The statement added there is no indication of additional cases at this time.

A CHRB spokesman said horses have resumed entering and leaving Golden Gate after restrictive measures were in place during the CDFA evaluation Tuesday [26 Mar 2019].

Equine herpesvirus in horses can cause respiratory disease, abortion in mares, neonatal foal death, and neurological disease. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and may be caused by damage to blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord associated with EHV-1 infection. EHM is most often due to the neuropathogenic strain of EHV-1 but may occasionally be caused by the non-neuropathogenic strain of the virus.

Anothertwistafate, who ran 2nd in the [Sun 24 March 2019] Sunland Park Derby (G3), remains at Sunland Park in New Mexico. Wright said the Scat Daddy colt was not stabled in the same barn as the horse testing positive.

"We've got a quarantine on my barn for 14 days, which started 3 days ago when the horse was removed, and we'll be able to train, just not with the other horses," Wright said. "My horses that are in a different barn are not under quarantine, and they'll be able to race and train."

Anothertwistafate will stay at Sunland under the supervision of an assistant trainer for the foreseeable future, Wright said.

"He's doing fine; he's going to remain at Sunland and my assistant is with him," Wright said. "We shouldn't be in trouble with him, but we'll take a wait-and-see approach. We're in no hurry to get him back here. He came out of the race in decent shape, and for now we'll just tread water."

Anothertwistafate made a game bid in the 11/8-mi [1.6 km] Sunland Park Derby but missed by a neck to Cutting Humor. He currently ranks 12th on the Kentucky Derby leaderboard with 30 points and non-restricted stakes earnings of USD 228 960.

"Once we ran 2nd (in the Sunland Park Derby), we started looking at the points standings, and we already started talking about the fact we might need another race," Wright said. "If we could get in the Derby without another race, that's ideal for us, but we're keeping our options open right now because it's looking like a tight race. What we need to happen is for the favorites to win and maintain their position, so the middle doesn't get jammed up more like it currently is."

"Right now, he has a good assistant with him at Sunland, so he'll hang tight and train there for a while and see how things shake loose. We should know more after the [6 Apr 2019] weekend."

Major Road to the Kentucky Derby preps are scheduled coast-to-coast April 2019, including the Wood Memorial Presented by NYRA Bets (G2) at Aqueduct Racetrack, the Toyota Blue Grass Stakes (G2) at Keeneland, and the Santa Anita Derby (G1) at Santa Anita Park.

[The respiratory component of this awful disease does have a vaccine for prevention. Unfortunately, the neurological aspect of the disease does not have a vaccine. Some research articles indicate having the vaccination may lessen the chances or the severity of the neurological form. - Mod.TG
