The Phillipines has reported the country's 1st suspected cases of the ebolavirus. According to the country's health officials, 7 workers who returned to the Philippines from Sierra Leone are showing symptoms similar to those of the tropical virus.

The Minister of Internal Affairs, Mr. Morris Dukuly, has disclosed that a Liberian has died of the deadly Ebola virus in Morocco [He tested negative; it was a heart attack, see in French: http://www.aufaitmaroc.com/maroc/societe/2014/7/31/une-crise--cardiaque-et-non-ebola_220832.html#.U-Du2Gd02Cg, courtesy of ProMED subscriber Giuseppe Michieli. - Mod.JW]

A man who landed at Guarulhos airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil in the morning, was taken to the Emilio Ribas hospital, and is hospitalized in an isolated area. The African, whose name was not revealed, is undergoing tests that may reveal ebolavirus contamination [There is no information on the country of origin nor on the Brazilian lab doing the testing and no report in the mainstream media. It is difficult to know which of the many rumours of cases floating around the internet to post, knowing that many will turn out to be false alarms. But ProMED is an early warning service. - Mod.JW].

[2] Nigeria
Date: 5 Aug 2014
Source: Channels TV [excerpted, edited]
http://www.channelstv.com/2014/08/05/ebola-health-minister-says-doctors-strike-puts-nigeria-at-disadvantage


The Minister of Health, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, has reiterated the government's determination to put an end to the spread of Ebola virus disease [EVD] in Nigeria and protect all its citizens from contracting the disease.

While speaking on the Tuesday [5 Aug 2014] edition of Channels Television's Sunrise Daily, he noted that it would be wrong to speculate on whether there had been more cases of the virus but maintained that some health workers who attended to the late PS had shown fever symptoms, but the tests on them turned out negative, with the exception of the female doctor who had been confirmed to have contracted the ebolavirus. On the general situation of things in the country, he said that 70 people, who had primary contacts with the Liberian, were currently under active surveillance, and having shown suggestive symptoms, about 8 people have been quarantined. He added that the family of the female doctor has also been kept under watch and surveillance; they have been tested and none of them had tested positive yet.

Questions were raised about Nigeria's involvement in the conference of African Health Ministers held in Accra, Ghana and how it has allegedly failed to address the issue of Ebola spread across the continent and into Nigeria, and Prof. Chukwu explained that indeed the conference addressed the issues of Ebola spread.

He explained that the spread of EVD was "just unfortunate," as the late PS, who was the index case, travelled to Nigeria against the warnings of his own country. "How he ended up travelling and not disclosing full information to those who were asking (is unknown). Even on the hospital bed, he was still denying. It's just unfortunate that he brought this into Nigeria, but then it tells you that every country of the world is indeed at risk," he said. He, however, gave assurances that the global community was aware of this risk and that there were efforts to address it. "This week, the WHO is meeting in Geneva to review all strategies that are in place and to see if anything more drastic could be suggested."

Besides the use of electronic media to run jingles, which had started in March 2014, the Health Minister disclosed that the scope of communication had been widened with the launch of a new website: http://www.ebolaalert.org, which is an interactive website that accommodates sharing of suggestions, airing complaints and answering questions from citizens. This is in addition to accounts being opened on the social media platforms Facebook and Twitter. A toll-free telephone line: "0800EBOLAHELP" has also been launched for the public, dedicated to reaching the health agencies and help desks set up to attend to citizens.

Border screening was also mentioned as part of the strategies. This includes temperature screening and data collection of all passengers entering the country. He added that there had been a directive for corpses not to be brought into the country without proper death certificates. He insisted that the responsibility was on the families of the dead persons to prove the cause of death, while the corpses would also be subjected to tests by Nigerian authorities.

Many citizens have expressed the view that the doctors' strike was a blessing in disguise for Nigeria, owing to the view that the Liberian carrier of the ebolavirus would have been taken to a public hospital where there are usually more patients, and this would have led to a possibly uncontrollable spread, but Professor Chukwu believes that while this could be a valid opinion, the country still remained at a disadvantage with the doctors being on strike. Although, according to the Minister, the non-availability of doctors in government hospitals across the country hadn't affected the management of EVD yet, he warned that there were possibilities of more cases of the virus springing up in the coming days, and at this point, more experts would be needed to manage it. He appealed to the striking doctors to get back to work, as most of their requests had been addressed by the Federal Government.

Nigerians have also expressed fear that Nigeria lacked the infrastructural capacity in its health sector to handle the outbreak of EVD. The Health Minister, while admitting that there was dire need for the country to move faster in that aspect, said that work had commenced on providing more isolation facilities across the country and within the hospitals to prevent the spread of the virus. He commended the Lagos State Government for providing the required facilities to quarantine and treat patients. "Given the way Lagos State has been proactive in this matter, I want to commend the authorities of Lagos State. I believe still working with them, they will be able to provide additional spaces," he said.

The Minister also promised to do more on sensitizing young Nigerians on EVD. He revealed that the Ministry had commenced work on collaborating with schools across the country to provide proper information to the students.

On the suspected cause of the virus, Prof Chukwu maintained an earlier plea that Nigerians who consider bats as delicacies should avoid their consumption and that of other bushmeat, as they could have been in contact with bats. He, however, added that those processing the bats and other bushmeat were more in danger of contracting the ebolavirus, as they are the ones who handle the animals in their raw state. He explained that the meat, if well heated up, could be free of the ebolavirus.

[3] Bushmeat in the UK
Date: Sat 2 Aug 2014
Source: Express UK [edited]
http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/494920/Ebola-Black-market-monkey-meat-could-see-virus-hit-UK


The black market demand for monkey meat straight out of Africa could see the deadly ebolavirus hit the UK, experts have warned today [2 Aug 2014]. Eating bush flesh is one of the main ways ebolavirus is transmitted to humans, and 7500 tonnes of illegal meat enter the UK every year. The exotic meats are eaten by some sectors of African immigrants in Britain as a luxury dish, and the trade has been defended on cultural grounds.

A BBC investigation previously discovered the markets at Ridley Road, London sold giant rats among other smuggled meats. It is known as a prime example of an area where black market meats are sold and is replicated all over the country. Dr Yunes Teinaz, a former environmental health official, warned the bushmeat is sold "all over the country" and is a "huge" health risk. This meat is sold everywhere. It's smuggled in vast quantities. "It's supplied all around Britain. It poses a potentially huge risk to public health, yet we are doing nothing to tackle it." The meat is often sold on the black market in the UK to people of African descent and to those who are already familiar with sellers. Speaking to the Daily Mail, one trader said: "Everybody knows where you can get it. Bush meat is like drugs; you can get it everywhere if you know the right people, but you won't see it openly on sale. It's word of mouth and under-the-counter deals."

[4] Guinea: bushmeat, FAO
Date: 4 Aug 2014
Source: Guardian UK [edited]
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/04/ebola-risk-guinea-fruit-bats


Health workers struggle to separate myth from reality about EVD as residents say abandoning tradition is out of the question.

Medical teams struggling to curb EVD in west Africa have been discouraging bush meat consumption, believed to have caused the outbreak, but some rural communities dependent on the meat for protein are determined to continue their traditional hunting practices. While meat from wild animals such as fruit bats, rodents and forest antelopes has largely disappeared from market stalls in main towns such as Gueckedou in southern Guinea -- the epicentre of the disease -- and the capital Conakry, following campaigns to avoid contamination, it is still being eaten in remote villages despite the risks.

"Life is not easy here in the village. They [authorities and aid groups] want to ban our traditions that we have observed for generations. Animal husbandry is not widespread here because bushmeat is easily available. Banning bushmeat means a new way of life, which is unrealistic," said Saa Fela Leno, who lives in Nongoha village in Gueckedou.

Poor knowledge and superstition especially in rural communities, as well as cross-border movement, a poor public health infrastructure and other epidemiological causes have contributed to its spread. The immediate concern is to halt human-to-human transmission. Discouraging bushmeat consumption and introducing livestock as an alternative to hunting are part of long-term solutions against the risks of contracting EVD from the wild, said Juan Lubroth, chief veterinary officer with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in Rome. "We recognise the importance that bushmeat has to quality nutrition that you may not get from only crop-based diets. We do not say that you should stop wild meat ... but can we replace the need to go to the forest and hunt wildlife with having a source of livestock and livelihood that can be safer?" Lubroth said. "Can we have a development agenda where we could have poultry production, sheep, goats, pigs ... so that there is no undue encroachment into the forest for hunting?"

Promoting hygienic practices to avoid contracting EVD is a protracted endeavour. Urging new norms for diet is far harder. Lubroth said: "It becomes very difficult to convey to an individual about a threat that cannot be seen, in this particular case a virus. One of the major aspects is to build trust with communities or villages. The sociology, the anthropology, the communication is so important, not like the veterinary or the wildlife or medical sciences," he told IRIN, explaining that epidemiological facts have to be translated in simple ways for ordinary people to understand, by using local allegories for instance. Yet promoters of health messages, such as Mariame Bayo in Guinea, have been threatened with death in villages where residents strongly oppose aid workers. "In Nongoha, we were told that if we don't leave, we would be cut into pieces and our flesh thrown into the water," she said.

Health minister, Colonel Remy Lamah said: "It is difficult to change a society's way of life, but when it comes to saving lives, I think no effort should be spared. We didn't say that people will no longer eat meat. [Discouraging bush meat] is just an interim measure," he added.

Moustapha Diallo of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, however, said fewer villages across the 3 west African countries remained hostile to aid groups, following public education campaigns. "The main behaviour change needed is at funerals, where a lot of cases are being contracted. That and good protective measures at health structures are the most important targets," said Stephane Doyone, west Africa coordinator of Medecins sans Frontieres [MSF].

Exposure to infected people as families care for sick relatives at home, touching bodies during burials or even hospital-acquired infections continue to account for the high death toll. However, rural communities still hunting for bushmeat risk further spillover of the virus from infected wild animals, according to the FAO. "We will die if we must, but abandoning our traditions is out of the question. It is true that we have lost many relatives. That's fate," said Gueckedou resident Mamadi Diawara. Guinea's communication minister, Alhousseine Makanera Kake, said bringing the outbreak under control is fraught with challenges. "Obstacles will remain until the outbreak is over. It goes without saying that we will not overcome this easily," he said.

It is still unclear why the Ebola virus crossed from its animal hosts this time in west Africa while communities have consumed bushmeat for generations without infection. "We do not know enough about EVD's natural cycle in the jungle. I'm sure it ticks away every year or every season, but it only makes it into the news when we have human mortality," said Lubroth. While warning against consuming bats or handling sick or dead animals, Lubroth said an outright ban on bush meat "will likely see it go underground, and that is actually worse. So we talk more about management than prohibition." Providing alternatives to bushmeat may solve only part of the problem. In the long run, better equipped and resourced public health systems remain crucial to curbing outbreaks.

[5] Europe: risk
Date: 4 Aug 2014
Source: CIDRAP News [edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/08/us-homecoming-ebola-stricken-workers-outbreak-spreads


The surge of new cases in West Africa and spread of the disease to new areas prompted the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to look at the risk again, its 3rd evaluation since the outbreak began in March [2014].

It said that overall, the risk of infection is still low if basic precautions are followed. The ECDC emphasized that EVD required direct contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other body fluids of dead or living infected people or animals. "Unlike influenza, the virus is not transmitted by air or droplets."

Though people infected with EVD may arrived in the EU from outbreak areas, the risk of secondary transmission to direct contacts is still considered very low if infection-prevention measures are followed, the ECDC said. It added that prevention measures can include information for returning travelers and health providers. For tourists, visitors, or residents of countries affected by the outbreak, the risk of infection is still very low if basic precautions are followed, the agency said. Steps include avoiding contact with symptomatic patients or dead bodies and their bodily fluids and avoiding unprotected sexual contact with a patient who has recently recovered from the disease.

***The ECDC emphasized that the highest risk for EU residents and visitors is within the healthcare systems of affected countries.*** [Asterisks added by ProMED].

[6] Other EVD news


CDC: "contaminated air" NOT
---------------------
5 Aug 2014: ProMED expressed concern about a report that CDC had reversed itself and admitted the possibility of airborne transmission of the ebolavirus responsible for the current epidemic; see ProMED archive 20140804.2659805. A reader (Ryan McGinnis) has pointed out that the source quoted is a notorious conspiracy theory website. It now transpires that it was an unfortunate choice of words in CDC's Ebola hospital Factsheet, referring to aerosols generated by certain medical procedures, NOT airborne transmission as occurs with flu viruses http://investmentwatchblog.com/cdc-removed-the-phrase-contaminated-air-from-its-new-ebola-webpage.

[CDC has corrected it; see http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations.html. ProMED regrets adding to the confusion.]


2nd infected American aid worker with EVD has arrived in the USA
---------------------------------------------
5 Aug 2014: The 2nd American aid worker infected with EVD in Liberia arrived in the United States on Tuesday [5 Aug 2014] for treatment. NW, 59, will be treated in an isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, the same hospital that is treating the other American, KB. A specially outfitted plane carrying NW landed just outside Atlanta on Tuesday [5 Aug 2014] morning http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/nancy-writebol-american-ebola-patient-arrives-u-s-n172706.


USA: not turning back flights
--------------------------------
5 Aug 2014: Asserting that there was "no significant risk" to the country from the EVD outbreak in West Africa, the White House has ruled out turning back flights coming to the USA and said there are screening measures in place to ward off threats from the disease.

When asked whether flights coming to the USA would be turned back over Ebola [concerns]: "No, not at this point," the White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, told reporters. "It's important for the public to understand that the reason that it's important to identify the symptoms is you're not contagious unless you exhibit the symptoms of this disease. That's what differentiates it from a common cold or the flu, where, of course, individuals can be contagious before they start exhibiting the symptoms," he added http://www.firstpost.com/world/ebola-outbreak-us-says-will-turn-back-africa-flights-1650169.html.
