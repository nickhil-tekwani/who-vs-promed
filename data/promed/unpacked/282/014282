[In our last update 2 months ago (see ProMED-mail Foot & mouth
disease - Mongolia (05): update, RFI 20100707.2267), it was noted
that the government officials "proposed to vaccinate all 7.1 million
livestock in Khentii, Sukhbaatar, Umnugobi, and Dornogobi provinces.
All are Eastern provinces/Aimags; see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mongolia_aimags_2007.png>".

The fact that FMD is now found in a different species and a different
province, Sukhbaatar, which was supposed to be protected by
vaccination is a cause for concern. Foot-and-mouth disease is a tough
disease to fight. Although it is certainly good that FMD has not been
identified in cattle in Sukhbaatar province yet.

Additionally, as indicated in our previous postings, FMD in Mongolia
has been found in wildlife, that is, gazelles and the role they have
played, if any at all, in the movement of the disease into a 2nd
province and 2nd species should be clarified. Most FMD outbreaks have
not involved wildlife but there is always the potential to do so.
Such an occurrence happened in 1924 when FMD infected wild mule deer
in Stanislaus National Forest in California resulting in the loss of
approximately 22 000 mule deer. It has also been seen more recently
with Mountain Gazelle in Israel in a very nice paper authored by
ProMED-mail moderator AS: Shimshony A, Orgad U, Baharav D, Prudovsky
S, et al: Malignant foot-and-mouth disease in mountain gazelles. Vet
Rec. 1986; 119(8): 175-6. - Mod.PC]
