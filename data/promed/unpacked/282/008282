Avian influenza of high pathogenicity (H5N1, H5N2, and H5N9) and low pathogenicity (H5N2, H5N3) in poultry in France
Ref: VITT/1200 LPAI & HPAI in France
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Disease report
Since the last update [of 7 Dec 2015], several new outbreaks in poultry have now been reported as a result of increased surveillance in South West France [Ministry of Agriculture], France, 2015; see map at the source URL above]; not all outbreaks visible at this scale]. To date [16 Dec 2015] there are 15 outbreaks of HPAI H5 (N1, N2, and N9) and 7 outbreaks of LPAI H5 (N2 and N3) which have been reported to the EU Animal Disease Notification System and in addition there may be a further 15 cases of HPAI reported on the French Surveillance platform.

Several of the outbreaks are linked to one another, according to the disease reports, and the species affected include commercial ducks, geese, and guinea fowl. While ducks and geese are not exhibiting severe clinical signs, the guinea fowl may show severe clinical signs and high levels of mortality as expected for a galliform host infected with HPAI. The developing situation still carries significant uncertainties as the French authorities are using the legislative tools to limit further spread, through the use of restriction zones around each outbreak and enhanced surveillance and restrictions beyond the EU requirements for the Dordogne region as well as several communes in the Landes region, preventing international trade from these areas (hatched area in map). Movements of live birds from any control zone are subject to pre-movement testing, which has led to the detection of more infected flocks, but does provide additional assurance (http://agriculture.gouv.fr/sites/minagri/files/listes_communes_ia_11dec15.pdf)

2. Conclusion
As before, there are still many unknowns and a lot of uncertainty. The risk to the UK as a result of these outbreaks is primarily around pathways which involve lapses in biosecurity or trade routes, rather than through wild birds as these are apparently wholly European origin viruses. However the situation in France simply reinforces what we already knew: that these LPAI viruses circulate in wild birds and cause occasional spill-over outbreaks in poultry that may be difficult to detect in domestic waterfowl species and which may then mutate into HPAI viruses following infection of galliform hosts.

Whilst there is uncertainty over the identity of the index case(s) and the pathways for virus evolution (including the genesis of 3 HPAI subtypes) and the host populations/networks in which these occurred, introduction by other transmission pathways from other undisclosed sources cannot be excluded. However, it would appear based on information available to date and knowledge of the biology of these viruses, that the new cases in France may be related. Detailed genetic analyses of the causative viruses will be critical to understanding these events and defining with greater certainty risk pathways and periods for spread of infection. Whether the index case for the LPAI to HPAI mutation(s) has been found is uncertain.

We will continue to monitor the situation closely. We would like to remind all poultry keepers to maintain high standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant, and report any suspect clinical signs promptly and in addition using the testing to exclude scheme for avian notifiable disease where appropriate for early safeguard. For more information, please see http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla-en/disease-control/nad.

The risk level for the UK remains at low, but heightened.

[You will note the repeated use of the words 'uncertain' and 'unknown' in the report above. We hope we will get some better answers soon.
