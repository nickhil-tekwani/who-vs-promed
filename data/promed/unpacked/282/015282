[Classical swine fever occurs regularly in Central America and in
some places in the Caribbean Basin. In fact, CSF became well enough
established in the island of Hispaniola (i.e., Dominican Republic and
Haiti) to warrant a new multinational effort to eradicate the
disease. For more details of recent outbreaks in Central America,
see my comments on the 2002 Costa Rican outbreak below. - Mod.PC]
