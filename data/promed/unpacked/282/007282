Situation of FMD in the Middle-East
-----------------------------------
[Compilation of information from OIE (official notifications), or
reports to EuFMD/FAO [European Commission for the control of
Foot-and-Mouth Disease/Food & Agriculture Organzization] by countries
or by the FAO/OIE/EC FMD World Reference Laboratory [WRL], Institute
for Animal Health, Pirbright, UK]

Serotype A
----------
In the 1st months of 2009, outbreaks of FMD caused by serotype A have
been detected in several countries in the Middle East. This serotype
is considered endemic in Turkey, Iran and Pakistan, but as a result
of genetic and antigenic drift, sweeping regional epidemics occur at
intervals. The last major type A change in the region was in 2005-6,
when an epidemic of the A Iran 05 strain spread through Iran, Turkey,
Pakistan, reaching the Thrace region of Turkey and as far as Jordan.

In 2008, a new variant of the type A Iran 05 virus replaced the
previous strain in Turkey, and this, and related type A viruses
appear to be on the move in the region.

The current situation gives rise to concern, as type A outbreaks have
been detected in several countries for the 1st time in many years.
Such international spread indicates a high incidence in source
countries, which could lead longer distance spread to free regions, by
various routes. In January and February [2009], more than 130
outbreaks were reported in the central and southern Iraq, involving a
new variant of A Iran 05. An appeal through the FAO/EuFMD Commission
for assistance was answered by the European Union, which provided 500
000 doses of emergency FMD vaccine (A22 Iraq, O and Asia 1).

In this period the same strain of FMD type A was detected in Bahrain,
and then Kuwait, with those identified in Kuwait almost identical to
strains found in Iraq in 2009.

In February [2009], the same strain, with close identity to those in
Iraq/Kuwait/Iran, was identified in samples submitted by Libya to the
FAO World reference laboratory (WRL) at Pirbright. The circumstances
that gave rise to the entry of this virus are unclear, but this event
represents a major jump for this FMDV strain, suggesting movement
through animal trade, as the lack of pigs in Libya [a Moslem country]
makes entry through livestock products unlikely.

This westward movement of infection into the Mediterranean region
should be noted by countries in the European/Mediterranean region.

An intensive collaborative effort (FAO/EuFMD Commission with support
from DG-SANCO [Health & Consumer Protection Directorate General of the
European Commission]; WRL Pirbright; the FMD Institute in Ankara,
Turkey; and the Iran Veterinary Organization) is ongoing to better
understand the spread of strains in the region. The strain involved in
outbreaks in Lebanon [see comment] is under investigation, and it
should be noted that type O is also endemic in most of the region.

Finally cases of FMD type A (observed 26 Jan 2009) have been reported
to the OIE by Egypt, as a result of an FAO TCP [Technical Cooperation
Programme] working with the Egyptian authorities. The strain involved
is similar to that identified in 2006 following incursion from East
Africa (A/EGY/06). The detection in outbreaks in 2009 suggests
establishment of the East African strain in the Mediterranean region.
The above situation, with 2 (or more) antigenically distinct FMDV type
A viruses in the eastern Mediterranean, should be noted by European
countries, and each country is encouraged to review its current risk
management measures.

[The above review, to be presented and discussed during the upcoming 38th
general session of EuFMD (for details, see further) addresses several
issues raised in previous ProMED-mail postings.

1st, the identity of the 2009 FMDV serotype isolate in Egypt, found to
be similar to the 2006 African strain.

2nd, the identification of the same strain in Libya, hitherto neither
published nor reported to the OIE.

On the other hand, the currently evolving FMD virus from Lebanon is
not yet identified. According to information from the Web site of the
WRL (Pirbright), the samples from Lebanon (designated 2009-00013) were
received on 24 Mar 2009.

The above important update "Situation of FMD in the Middle-East," was
included among the documents distributed to participants in the
upcoming 38th session of the European Commission for the Control of
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EUFMD), Rome, Italy, 28-30 Apr 2009 (2 full
days and a half day) .

The documentation also included the following provisional agenda:

1. Global FMD situation: regional trends in FMD risk
2. Progress Reports on FMD control in the European neighbourhood:
A) Progress towards long term FMD control in Turkey and its
immediate neighbours
B) Progress towards long term FMD control in the Trans-Caucasus
C) Progress towards FMD control in Iran and Syria

3. Standards for endorsement which have regulatory significance
across the Member States:
A) Bio-security Standards for FMDV laboratories (Updated Standard
for Adoption)
B) Minimum diagnostic capacity in EuFMD member states (Standard
for Adoption)

4. Report of the EuFMD Executive Committee for past biennium
5. Strategic Plan 2009-2013 (including activities for upcoming biennium)
6. The EuFMD role in development and technical support for a long
term FMD control in "West EurAsia" (West EurAsia Free of Clinical FMD by 2020)
7. "Euro-mediterranean FMD control network": vision and modalities,
and role of the EuFMD Commission
8. Technical items: The new decentralised ("penside") diagnostic
test systems : guidance on use in European situations
9. Training Item: FMD Training Initative and Knowledge Bank to
rebuild European experience in FMD and network training resources
10. Report of the Chairman of the Research Group of the Standing
Technical Committee
11. FMD Antigen and Vaccine banks: survey of national and EC bank holdings
12. Financial matters
13. Election of the Executive Committee and Standing Technical Committee.

Subscribers interested in reports of the previous (37th) general
session (2007), as well as of the last (77th) meeting of EuFMD's
Executive Committee (Vienna, December 2008) and of the most recent
meeting of the EuFMD Standing Technical Committee/ Research Group
(14-17 Oct 2008, Erice, Sicily), are referred to the Web site
