[1] Quarantine alert

40 British children -- some as young as 4 -- were marched off by armed
airport guards as they landed for half-term holidays in Egypt because
they were thought to have swine flu [pandemic [H1N1] 2009 virus
infection]. Horrified parents watched as officials used Draconian
legislation to hold anyone with a temperature of more than 38 C. Some
children were kept apart from their parents for 5 days in a squalid
makeshift hospital even though they had no symptoms of the pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus.

2 parents said they were terrified when their 8-year-old daughter was
grabbed after the family was scanned by hidden thermal imaging cameras
in the terminal at Sharm el Sheikh International. They were forced to
spend 5 days of their GBP 1650 holiday in a "hellhole" hospital,
sharing a urine-stained bed in a mosquito-filled room with about 30
other families. The family, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire,
have complained to their local MP (Member of Parliament) and are now
seeking a refund from their holiday firm, who they say should have
warned them about the situation.

A 4-year-old child from Chesterfield Derbyshire was also quarantined
with swine flu symptoms after arriving at the airport with his family
for a week-long holiday. Overnight tests were carried out, and he was
held for another 4 days after swine flu tests were positive. His
mother was quite distraught about the situation, as she did believe
that he had swine flu, but there was nothing wrong with him. The
child's temperature was back to normal the next morning, but the
parents were told they would be arrested if they took the boy out of
the hospital.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: "There is little we can do as these
measures have been put in place by the Egyptian authorities. If any
traveller's temperature is above normal, they will be quarantined for
up to 5 days. The Egyptian embassy in London said matters were under
control. The travel agency said: "We have no control over these
procedures."

[2] Pandemic H1N1 2009 cases

Egypt has reported the 4th death from influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009
virus infection, according to the Al-Ahram newspaper on Friday [30 Oct
2009]. A 36-year-old woman from Ismailia Governorate died of pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection late on Thursday [29 Oct 2009]. The
newspaper was quoting a Health Ministry spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahine.

Up until now, the Ministry has reported more than 1000 cases of the
novel pandemic influenza virus in this most populous Arab country.
Egypt reported its 1st case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection on
2 Jun 2009, a 12-year-old Egyptian-American girl coming from the
United States via the Netherlands.

As it was hit hard by the fatal bird flu [avian H5N1 influenza virus
infection] in 2006, Egypt decided in late April [2009] to cull all
pigs in the country [as a preventative measure] to stem the highly
infectious pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.

Egypt and can be located on the map at

[The 1st report is posted as a public service notice in order to alert
travelers to Egypt that thermal imaging equipment has been installed
at Sharm el Sheikh International airport and that quarantine measures
are being enforced. It is unclear at this time how long this screening
procedure will be maintained. It is generally regarded that thermal
imaging is a relatively ineffective measure for controlling entry of
influenza virus-infected individuals, and most countries have
abandoned this practice.

The 2nd report indicates that pandemic (H1N1) virus infection is
already prevalent in the north of Egypt and that the attempt to
control the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection by the
culling of the domestic pig population has been ineffective. - Mod.CP]
