An undiagnosed viral disease in 4 subdivisions of Pithoragarh
district, bordering Tibet, has killed more than 200 goats, creating
anguish among sheep [or rather goats? - Mod.AS] rearing farmers.

Chief district veterinary officer D C Gururani today said the disease
was 1st reported from Munsiyari subdivision in the 1st week of the
month [5-9 Jan 2009]. It later spread to Dharchula, Didihat and
Berinag subdivisions. The sudden spread of the contagious disease is
posing a serious threat to the livestock of 145 175 goats and 32 804
sheep in the district, he said.

Livestock department Deputy director (Kumaon region) Bharat Chand
said blood samples were sent to IVRL Laboratory at Mukteswar Nanital
and Veterinary College of GB Pant University at Pant Nagar to be tested.

The monetary loss, so far, has been estimated at Rs 3 lakh [USD 6113].

[In the absence of any clinical and epidemiological details, the
cause for these mortalities remains unknown. It could be infectious
or non-infectious. Among the more plausible possible fatal infectious
goat diseases which should be taken into consideration in this part
of the world, one should include acute PPR (peste des petits
ruminants), caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP, a mycoplasma disease)
and pasteurellosis, though others -- such as anaplasmosis,
babesiosis and helminths and others -- are additional candidates.

Information on clinical and pathological findings, age of affected
animals, duration of illness, haematological data, husbandry methods
and laboratory test results are anticipated.
