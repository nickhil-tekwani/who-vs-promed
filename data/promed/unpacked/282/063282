I am not sure this is appropriate for ProMED-mail but since there is such a
broad range of professional expertise available I thought it worth submitting.
I have responded to this individual that cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis
are two possibilities. Crypto is described as having CNS symptoms, but
histo isn't. I have posed some questions to him regarding being
immunocompromised. I have not yet heard back from him.
I also told him rabies is not a probable cause, hoping that this isn't a
case of a very long incubation period for rabies superimposed over histo.
One case of human rabies occurred in a spelunker about 3 years after his
last entry to a cave. I recommended that he have his physician contact CDC
immediately if rabies is suspected.

I was a healthy 36 year old male and have been plagued by several symptoms
recently which include twitching, muscle spasms, joint paint, sharp chest
pain near the heart, heart palpitations, periodic nausea and a general
uneasiness. In September of 1997 I started renovating a bat-infested attic
in my house and was exposed to a large amount of bat excreta which included
old dusty airborne particles as well as fresh moist clumps. I'm sure I
inhaled much of the airborne particles and probably touched a lot of the
clumps without gloves. There where about 3 bats that escaped through a hole
in the house and one that I destroyed after it attacked me (I don't believe
that it bit me). About two weeks after the start of the renovations I
noticed a dull pain in the upper left quadrant of my chest. The following
week I started feeling tingling sensations over my entire body. The
tingling has now turned into muscle spasms which are now visually
noticeable and often frightening. My left eyelid is starting to spasm and
droop and during sleep, I occasionally feel that I'm having a seizure and
cannot wake up.
I have seen my general practitioner, a neurologist, a psychologist and an
infectious disease specialist and have not been able to come up with a
diagnosis. I have been tested for Lyme [disease] several times over the
last year with negative results. I've had CAT scans MRI's and a multitude
of blood, urine and fecal tests. The only abnormal result of the blood
tests has been an extremely high white blood cell count.
My question is: Is it possible to acquire rabies from exposure to large
quantities of bat excreta (perhaps 5-10 lbs.) that was located in the
ceilings above my head as I tore down the ceilings? And if so, what is the
best method of identifying it's presence. Lastly, would you have any
suggestions of the preferred method of treatment?
Any comments would be greatly appreciated. I honestly feel like I am going
to die if I don't find a diagnosis shortly.
