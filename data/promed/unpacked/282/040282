Ukraine leader orders top vet sacked over bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
President Viktor Yushchenko, angry over delays in reporting a virulent
strain of bird flu, ordered the dismissal on Monday [5 Dec 2005] of
Ukraine's top veterinarian officer. Yushchenko was touring one of several
villages in the Crimea peninsula, where he ordered the imposition of
emergency measures over the weekend following the discovery of a virus that
killed more than 1500 birds within hours.
But villagers have complained that their birds had been dying since
September 2005 with officials taking no action. "In the early stages, the
local and central veterinary services proved unable to cope. As a result of
this trip, I am ordering the dismissal of the chief veterinarian...,"
Yushchenko told reporters in Nekrasovka village. "What happened in these
villages is clearly a professional error of the veterinary service, and it
must accept responsibility."
Yushchenko also said he had asked the local government in the Crimea
peninsula, an autonomous region jutting out into the Black Sea, to dismiss
its top veterinary official.
Ukrainian troops were rounding up and destroying domestic fowl in 5
villages near Lake Sivash in Crimea, a major stopping point on migratory
flight routes, after experts detected a bird flu strain identified so far
as H5.
Chief veterinarian Petro Verbytsky, speaking over the weekend [3-4 Dec
2005], said the strain was unlikely to harm humans, but samples have been
sent to Britain for further tests.
The deadly H5N1 strain of avian flu has been found in birds in neighboring
Romania and Russia. H5N1 is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia, where it
has killed almost 70 people.
Experts fear the virus could mutate into a form transmitted easily from
person to person, sparking a pandemic in which millions of people could die.
Verbytsky had offered to resign a month ago after being accused of inaction
in keeping Ukraine free of bird flu. [Does this mean the authorities were
aware of cases in November 2005? - Mod.AS]
Russia on Monday [5 Dec 2005] banned poultry imports from Ukraine. The
European Union's Executive Commission said the 25-nation trading bloc was
likely to impose a temporary ban on feather imports, its only
poultry-related import from the ex-Soviet state.
Yushchenko ordered the imposition of 3-km (2 mile) exclusion zones around
the villages, patrolled by Interior Ministry troops, while the birds were
incinerated with napalm left from the Soviet era and dumped in hastily dug
pits.
Further 10-km monitoring zones were imposed around affected areas. The sale
of privately-raised poultry was banned in Crimea, tough checks were ordered
on farms and restrictions placed on the movement of livestock.
Residents received cash compensation for handing over birds. Doctors were
vaccinating villagers against seasonal flu.
"Today [5 Dec 2005], the issue is totally under control. All the birds are
being destroyed, and, by 12 Dec 2005, all residents of these villages will
be vaccinated," Yushchenko, accompanied by 5 members of the cabinet, told
reporters.
"It can therefore be said that Ukraine dealt with [the] problem in a very
organized fashion."

[In today's (5 Dec 2005) alert message to the OIE, the Ukrainian
authorities report the confirmation of H5 infection in chickens and geese
in 5 villages, situated in 3 separate districts (Dzhankoyskiy,
Nizhnegorskiy and Sovetskiy districts) within the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea. According to the message, the outbreaks started on 25 Nov 2005 and
were confirmed on 2 Dec 2005.
Russia's top government epidemiologist, Gennady Onischenko, warned in
August 2005 that migrating birds could, in autumn 2005, spread avian flu to
Russia's major agricultural region and on to the Middle East and
Mediterranean Sea.
"An analysis of bird migration routes has shown that the contagious A
(H5N1) virus may spread from western Siberia to the Caspian and Black Sea
areas this fall (2005)," said Onischenko, as quoted by an RIA Novosti
report today (15 Aug 2005). "Some birds nesting in the affected regions
(the Novosibirsk and Altai territory) migrate to the above-mentioned areas
for winter or stop there on their way to Africa or Europe."
He added that bird migration routes run through Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq,
Georgia, Ukraine, and Mediterranean countries, raising a risk of outbreaks
there as well. Onischenko made the statements in a letter to regional
directors of the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection
and Welfare. (See item 2 in 20050816.2400).
Bird migration routes were extensively studied in the Soviet Union. Most
publications are in Russian; data from Russian/Ukrainian colleagues would
be helpful. The Crimean peninsula and Azov Sea are situated on a main
flyway of migratory birds on their route to the Balkans and the Near East.
The urgent need for intensification of the epidemiological surveillance in
wild birds was among the recommendations of FAO/OIE/WHO/World bank's global
avian influenza meeting in Geneva, 8-10 Nov 2005. - Mod.AS]

Romania discovers new suspect avian flu cases
-----------------------------------------------
Romania has discovered new suspect cases of avian flu in birds in 2
villages in the Danube delta, the area where the deadly strain of the virus
was 1st detected, the Agriculture Ministry said on Monday [5 Dec 2005].
Avian flu has been found in about a dozen villages in Romania since October
2005, including several places outside the delta, which lies on a key
migratory route for wild birds.
3 outbreaks have been confirmed as the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain [avian
influenza] which has killed 69 people in Asia. Samples from other outbreaks
are being sent to Britain for testing.
"A few samples from the villages Agighiol and Crisan from Tulcea county
came out positive in the quick diagnosis test," the ministry said in a
statement. "The actual virus hasn't been isolated yet."
Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur said the 2 villages had been
quarantined and domestic birds would be culled.
Samples from a virus detected in 4 outbreaks in Braila county outside the
delta last week will be subject to further tests in Britain. However,
officials said on Sunday [4 Dec 2005] the birds had likely contracted the
H5N1 strain.
Disinfection checkpoints were installed on all roads leading out of
[Braila] county. Around 5000 birds in Ciocile, where bird flu was
discovered on Saturday [3 Dec 2005], have already been culled.
Officials have told people to keep domestic birds isolated so they do not
come into contact with wild birds, saying high temperatures for this time
of the year mean the peak migration period would be longer, raising
contamination risks.
The Danube delta, near the Black Sea, is Europe's largest wetlands and lies
on the migratory route of millions of wild birds towards warmer winter
climes in North Africa.
Neighboring Ukraine began destroying birds over the weekend [3-4 Dec 2005]
after finding avian flu in the Crimea peninsula.
Scientists fear H5N1 risks sparking a pandemic in which millions could die
if it mutates into a form that passes easily among humans. But so far,
there is no sign the virus has changed in this way.

Viet Nam spots bird flu outbreaks in area near China
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam said on Monday [5 Dec 2005] that 4 bird flu outbreaks have killed
more than 900 ducks and chickens in a northern province on the border with
China.
Health workers slaughtered another 3717 birds in Cao Bang province, after
the outbreaks were reported in 4 communes last Friday [2 Dec 2005], the
Agriculture Ministry's Animal Health Department said.
"The test results showed the birds were positive with the H5 virus," it
said in a report on its Web site,
<http://www.mard.gov.vn/dah>.
The poultry infections in Cao Bang, 270 km (170 miles) north of Hanoi,
bordering the Chinese southern province of Guangxi, followed 6 outbreaks
last week in Viet Nam's north.
Bird flu has killed or resulted in the slaughter of 2.39 million poultry
since the virus returned in early October 2005 and has now spread to 17 of
Viet Nam's 64 provinces, most in the north, as winter arrives.
The H5N1 virus, which thrives best in cooler temperatures, has infected 133
people in Asia since late 2003 and killed almost 70 people. Viet Nam has 93
human infections, 42 of them fatal.
