Dengue - Pacific area (update) 970426163938]
In response to the Moderator's question as to the Pacific DEN-2 virus
outbreak: "Are some intervention methods being applied?" --
Yes, there have been some interventions. In the Torres Strait, the interiors
of houses, including outside laundry area and rubbish piles in the yard, were
ULV [ultra-low volume] fogged with residual pyrethroid on three islands. Two
of these islands were small (pop. <500) and the majority >90% of premises
were fogged. The key to achieving this level of cooperation was by having a
public meeting involving the local council. About 60 premises were fogged on
each island using a portable Hurricane ULV machine. This requires 220 volt
access, so we used teams of two, one to fog and one to handle the extension
cord. Fogging was concentrated under beds and tables, in wardrobes and dark
corners. It took ca. 5 hours to complete fogging. Dengue cases ceased
within a fortnight of fogging. Due to time constraints, no entomological
surveys were conducted.
The third island fogged was Thursday Island, pop. ca. 3500. Fogging was
begun in February, centering on areas with recent cases. Although
transmission did not stop as on the small islands, a gradual decline in
cases, with no more reported by late April, occurred. It should also be
noted that house-to-house source reduction, including treating water tanks
with methoprene briquets, was conducted on these islands, and undoubtedly
played a role in reducing transmission.
So despite the seeming endless stream of monitoring, interventions are being
done. Perhaps we were all to busy to notify.

[Many thanks for this additional information. Now, what about interventions
elsewhere in the epidemic zone? When time permits, perhaps Scott or others
involved in these efforts might comment as to whether any islands where
dengue was occurring were not treated and whether the disease there persisted
or declined coincident with spraying elsewhere. Scott: Go to "Charlie's",
have dinner, send me the bill. -- Mod CHC]
