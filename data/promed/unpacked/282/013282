Comment on isolation and identification of _Aspergillus_ spp. from humans.

The vast majority of _Aspergillus_ infections are caused by _A. fumigatus_. Over the recent years it has been recognised, however, that moulds identified by classical techniques as _A. fumigatus_ (macro and micromorphology) cover a range of closely related species including several with intrinsic resistance to one or several antifungal compounds, and therefore that the term _A. fumigatus_ complex is more appropriate.

Whilst reliable species identification of these cryptic species requires molecular techniques, separation of _A. fumigatus_ from the other species is possible simply by taking advantage of the unique thermo-tolerance of _A. fumigatus_. That is, _A. fumigatus_, but not the others, is able to grow at high temperatures in the range of 48-50 deg C [118.4-122 deg F] or higher. At SSI [Statens Serum Institut] this is systematically done for all _A. fumigatus_ complex isolates and if not confirmed as _A. fumigatus_ sensu stricto by this procedure, molecular identification is adopted. Following this procedure no _A. felis_ has been detected so far suggesting it is currently a rare pathogen. If this procedure may misidentify some isolates when 48 deg C [118.4 deg F] rather than 50 deg C [122 deg F] is used (and which is the current standard at many reference laboratories in Europe) is however not evident from the current PLoS ONE publication [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0064871], where the ability of _A. felis_ to grow at 45 deg C [113 deg F] and 50 deg C [12 deg F], respectively, is investigated but not at 48 deg C [122 deg F].

Azole resistance in _A. fumigatus_ is a growing challenge even in azole naive patients. 2 molecular resistance mechanisms have been characterised in environmental _A. fumigatus_ isolates and found in almost all European countries, Kuwait, Iran, India, and China. Additionally, the number of cryptic species with intrinsic resistance, including the one reported in the PLoS ONE paper is rising. Finally, azole resistance due to long term treatment of particularly the chronic forms of aspergillosis is well known. Therefore, it is of outmost importance that all _A. fumigatus_ complex isolates are tested for azole resistance.
