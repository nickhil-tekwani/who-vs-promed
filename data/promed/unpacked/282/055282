In a follow-up to a report from 2 weeks ago, the number of suspected diphtheria cases in the outbreak primarily affecting displaced Rohingya population is significantly increased from numbers released last week, showing a total of 2526 cases suspected with diphtheria, including 27 deaths.

The current outbreak is mainly occurring within the displaced Rohingya population living in the Balukali makeshift and extension camps. Cases are also being reported from the Kutupalong extension, Thangkhali, Jamtoli, and Nyapara camps. This population is also affected by malnutrition, low routine immunization coverage, and poor access to clean water and sanitation facilities.

During the first week of December 2017, we got the first warning of the possibility of a major public health issue with diphtheria. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that diphtheria is rapidly spreading among Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh at a time when 110 suspected cases were reported. WHO representative to Bangladesh, Dr Navaratnasamy Paranietharan said at the time, "These cases could be just the tip of the iceberg. This is an extremely vulnerable population with low vaccination coverage".

Of the case total, 75 per cent of cases are in children 15 years and younger. As of [26 Dec 2017], 109 487 children 6 weeks to under 7 years were vaccinated with Penta [a pentavalent vaccine that provides protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and _Haemophilus influenza_ type B], PCV [pneumococcal conjugate vaccine], and bOPV [bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine provides protection against polio types 1 and 3] and 102 383 children aged 7-15 years were vaccinated with Td [tetanus and diphtheria] vaccine. [See WHO Diphtheria Outbreak response update, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Update num.2, 27 Dec 2017 at http://www.searo.who.int/bangladesh/bancxbdiphtheriaresponseupdate2271217.pdf?ua=1. - Mod.ML]

New diphtheria treatment and isolation centers opened recently to increase capacity for treating patients suspected with diphtheria.

[Rohingya refugees from Myanmar arrived in Cox's Bazar district of Chittagong division in Bangladesh, joining an existing refugee population, some of whom have been in the camps for years, others displaced more recently; as of late September 2017, Bangladesh was said to be sheltering 800 000 displaced Rohingya (https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/unicef-ramps-relief-myanmar-refugees/32834).
