[1] Syria, new case - Raqqah, media report

The discovery of another Syrian child paralyzed by polio vaccine viruses in rebel-held Raqqa has the World Health Organization and UNICEF in talks with the Syrian government over whether an emergency vaccination effort can be mounted there.

The new case is the 2nd to be documented in Raqqa, part of a larger polio outbreak in Syria that totals 24 cases of paralysis caused by vaccine viruses. The other cases are in Mayadeen district in the Deir-Ez-Zor governorate of eastern Syria.

The new case, however, suggests the outbreak may be spreading in Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State, said Michel Zaffran, director of the WHO's polio program.

Officials acknowledge that carrying out an emergency vaccination effort there could be exceedingly complicated.

"It is still under discussion due to military activity in the area," Zaffran told STAT in an email.

If it goes ahead, the outbreak response in Raqqa would attempt to vaccinate 120 000 children under the age of 5 with a special formulation of oral polio vaccine [OPV]. Health officials would also try to vaccinate 44 000 children with injectable polio vaccine [IPV], the type used in the United States and other affluent countries.

An emergency vaccination program for Deir-Ez-Zor and in the southern part of Shadadi district in Hasaka governorate is set to begin Saturday [8 Jul 2017]. Vaccine for that effort is already in Damascus, Zaffran said.

The 1st round of vaccinations will target 328 000 children in the 2 governorates. Already, 355 vaccination teams and 61 supervisors are on standby to begin the work. Teams will go house to house in some areas and operate from a fixed position in others.

That, at least, is the plan. But the agencies behind the response know that the shifting winds of war in Syria could pose serious challenges for their work. Vaccine refusal has also been a problem in Deir-Ez-Zor in the past, with some parents reluctant to allow their children to be vaccinated, according to an update released Tuesday [4 Jul 2017] by the WHO.

The Syrian cases are caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses, viruses from the oral polio vaccine used in some developing countries. The U.S. discontinued use of the oral vaccine in 2000.

Oral polio vaccine is made using live but weakened viruses. The original version contained components to protect against all 3 polioviruses, types 1 through 3. Type 2 polioviruses stopped circulating nearly 20 years ago and last year [2016], that component was removed from the oral vaccine.

The oral vaccine is highly effective, but it has some rare and serious side effects. The weakened viruses can spread from a vaccinated child to other children with whom he or she is in contact.

If the viruses continue to spread -- because children in the area where they develop haven't been fully immunized against polio -- they can mutate to become virulent again. If they spread long enough, they can regain the power to cripple.

The outbreak in Syria is caused by type 2 vaccine viruses.

The oral vaccine that will be used to try to extinguish the outbreak is a single-strain oral vaccine that protects against those viruses.

[It is unfortunate that another case of the cVDPV2 has been identified in Raqqah. A 1st case had been confirmed approximately 2 weeks ago (see Poliomyelitis update (13): Syria (DY, RA), global 20170622.5124548 and Poliomyelitis update (12): Syria (DY, RA), susp. cases 20170621.5122019 for more details on the 1st case). At the time of confirmation of the 1st case, it was unclear whether there had been contact with individuals in Deir-al-Zour or travel there to explain the case. With the confirmation of a 2nd case in Raqqah, it confirms there is local transmission of the cVDPV2 virus in Raqqah. Unfortunately, Raqqah is an area with extremely difficult access given the civil unrest in Syria, making vaccination activities challenged.

Note that the initial vaccination activities planned to begin this coming Saturday (8 Jul 2017) are planned for Deir-al-Zour governorate and the southern district of Al Hasaka governorate, which borders Deir-al-Zour to the north.

[2] Pakistan, violence against vaccinator - media report

A polio worker has been gunned down by 2 unidentified men in a northwestern province of Pakistan where the crippling disease remains endemic. More than 100 people have been killed in such attacks since December 2012.

A technician of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) was shot on Saturday [1 Jul 2017] by motorbike riders armed with assault rifles while he was returning to his base from an outreach campaign in Swabi district, police said on Sunday [2 Jul 2017].

The attackers managed to flee after committing the crime, The Express Tribune reported. The technician was posted by the health department in Narnji village, which borders Buner district of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Police reached the scene, cordoned it off, and took the body into custody, it said. A search operation was conducted, but no arrests have been made so far.

Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack, but Taliban militants have attacked polio workers in the past. Pakistan is one of only 3 countries where the crippling disease remains endemic.

Islamist militants consider anti-polio vaccines to be a Western conspiracy to sterilise Muslims. The Islamists' opposition to all forms of immunisation grew after the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) organised a fake vaccination drive to help track down Al Qaeda's former leader Osama bin Laden in the Pakistani garrison town of Abbottabad. He was killed there by US forces in 2011.

[As noted in the above media report, this is not the 1st time there has been violence directed at healthcare workers responsible for vaccination activities. The Northwestern region of Pakistan, now called Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and the FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Authorities) are areas that have been undergoing civil unrest for years. As in the situation in Syria, extremist factions have been blocking vaccination activities, and in the case of Pakistan (and in Northern Nigeria), vaccinators have been subjected to violence and death at the hands of extremists.

This has created growing pockets of unvaccinated individuals, which leave an opening for transmission of the wild poliovirus as well as the circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses that have reverted their neuro-virulence and cause paralytic polio as well, a very serious obstacle to the goal of polio eradication (and measles elimination as well). The use of children as pawns in these political fights, ignoring science, is a very sad situation globally.
