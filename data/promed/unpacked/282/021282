[Frankly I would be more at ease if the official news release had had details of the vaccination of the livestock in the village of Molokanovsky Ilmensky rural settlement, and of a field investigation team searching for any other animal cases in that village and its neighbouring villages, and to expand the vaccination accordingly. Over the years I have learnt that nature is singularly unconcerned by bureaucratic statements. It is not that she is illiterate but merely reads them for amusement.
