Abstract: Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus has historically caused
widespread and extensive outbreaks of severe human and livestock
disease throughout Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula.
Following unusually heavy rainfall during the late autumn of 2006,
reports of human and animal illness consistent with RVF virus
infection emerged across semi-arid regions of Garissa District of
northeastern Kenya and southern Somalia. Following initial RVF virus
laboratory confirmation, a high throughput RVF diagnostic facility
was established at the Kenyan Central Veterinary Laboratories in
Kabete, Kenya, to support real-time identification of infected
livestock and to facilitate outbreak response and control activities.

A total of 3250 specimens from a variety of animal species including
domesticated livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) and
wildlife collected from a total of 55 of 71 Kenyan administrative
districts were tested by molecular and serologic assays. Evidence of
RVF infection was found in 9.2 percent of animals tested, and across
23 districts of Kenya, reflecting the large number of affected
livestock and geographic extent of the outbreak.

The complete S, M, and/or L genome segment sequence [Rift Valley
fever virus is a tripartite genome negative strand RNA virus,
belonging to the genus _Phlebovirus_ in the family _Bunyaviridae_. -
Mod.CP] was obtained from a total of 31 RVF virus specimens spanning
the entire known outbreak period (December 2006-May 2007) and
geographic areas affected by RVF virus activity. Extensive genomic
analyses demonstrated the concurrent circulation of multiple virus
lineages, gene segment reassortment, and common ancestry of the
2006-2007 outbreak viruses with those from the 1997-1998 east-African
RVF outbreak.

Evidence of recent increases in genomic diversity and effective
population size 2 to 4 years prior to the 2006-2007 outbreak was also
found, indicating ongoing RVF virus activity and evolution during the
inter-epizootic/epidemic period. These findings have implications for
further studies of basic RVF virus ecology, the design of future
surveillance/diagnostic activities and highlight the critical need
for safe and effective vaccines and antiviral compounds to combat
this significant veterinary and public health threat.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects
animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can
cause severe disease in both animals and humans, leading to high
rates of disease and death. The disease also results in significant
economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected
livestock. The virus was first identified in 1931 during an
investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift
Valley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in
sub-Saharan and North Africa. In 1997-1998, a major outbreak occurred
in Kenya, Somalia, and Tanzania and in September 2000, RVF cases were
confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect
contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can
be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting
veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.
There is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF
by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.
Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected
mosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF
virus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible. To
date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented.

For a comprehensive account of Rift Valley fever disease in animals
and humans, the World Health Organisation (WHO) overview of the
disease can be accessed at
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/>.

Previously Bird et al. published an analysis of the complete genome
sequences of 33 ecologically and biologically diverse Rift Valley
fever virus strains isolated from humans and animals in Africa (J
Virol. 2007; 81(6): 2805-16; <http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/81/6/2805>).

Several distinct virus genetic lineages were determined, which
approximately correlated with geographic origin, but several
exceptions indicative of long-distance virus movement were found.
Virus genetic diversity was low and primarily involved accumulation
of mutations at an average of 2.9 x 10(-4) substitutions/site/year,
although some evidence of genome subunit reassortment was found.

The current publication describes an in-depth analysis of viruses
isolated during the course of the extensive outbreak that occurred in
the Garissa district of Kenya and Somalia in 2006-2007. Continuity
with earlier outbreaks and with viruses isolated during the
inter-epidemic period was observed. Several distinct virus lineages
were circulating during the 2006-2007 outbreak and diversity was
increased by genetic reassortment during the course of the outbreak.
It is evident from this analysis that the genomic diversity of Rift
Valley fever virus is increasing and that the virus is continuing to
evolve both within and between epidemic periods.
