A 30-year-old tourist from Germany presented in the Mid West Regional Hospital earlier this year with renal failure and respiratory symptoms. He was managed with supportive therapy and made a good recovery. He was discharged and returned to Germany. Subsequently, he was found to be IgM positive for [a] hantavirus [infection] and this diagnosis was confirmed by Porton Down in early June [2012].

[A] human hantavirus infection has not previously been diagnosed in Ireland. However, there were an exceptional number of cases reported in Germany and in other countries in Europe during the winter of 2011 and spring of 2012. Given the amount of travel between the continent and Ireland, it is not surprising that we would eventually see a case of this infection here. This is the 1st ever case confirmation that has been reported in this country [Ireland] and, as an unusual event, it merits further consideration.

Background
----------
In May 2012, Health Protection colleagues in Germany reported a significant rise in the number of cases of human hantavirus infection notified there between October 2011 and April 2012. In total 852 cases had been reported, 68 per cent of cases in the Baden-Württemberg region alone, the region that the tourist was from. The tourist also reported that his partner had had hantavirus infection in Germany last year [2011]. It was concluded, therefore, that the case confirmed in Ireland was linked to the German outbreak. This highlights the importance of continuous vigilance and of awareness of infectious diseases that are prevalent in other countries.

Epidemiology
------------
Hantaviruses are RNA viruses, a genus of the Bunyaviridae family, and the only genus without an arthropod vector. There are more than 25 antigenically distinguishable hantaviral species, each associated primarily with a single rodent species. Several species are known to infect humans. In particular, Seoul virus is found worldwide, Puumala virus in Europe, Hantaan virus principally in Asia and less often in Europe, and Dobrava virus in Serbia and Montenegro. Human to human transmission does not occur.

The vector

Bank voles (_Clethrionomys [now _Myodes_] glareolus_) are the reservoir-vectors of Puumula virus, which is the cause of a mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal symptoms (HFRS) known as nephropathica epidemica. These small rodents are found in forests and agricultural hedgerows, have a highly fluctuating population, and disperse into rural and suburban gardens and dwellings in the autumns and winters, when their population peaks. Bank voles are not native to Ireland; they are an introduced species, first documented in 1964. They are to be found in the south and west of the country.

Transmission to humans

In the case of Puumala virus, transmission is via aerosolised dust from the excreta of infected rodents.

[This report does not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for the above case, but Puumala virus is most likely the infecting agent. As the above report indicates, common international travel make make it difficult to determine where the infection was acquired. Travel histories of these traveling patients and knowledge of pathogens active in the country of origin thus become critical in establishing which etiological agent is involved. Although bank voles have been introduced into Ireland and established there, there are no reports of Puumala virus in the Irish vole populations.

A published report from Germany suggested that abundant food for the voles (beach mast crop) led to increased vole population densities with increased Puumala virus transmission in the Baden-Wurttemberg area.
