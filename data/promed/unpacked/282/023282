Prevention and Control of Influenza with Vaccines: ACIP Recommendations -- United States, 2012-13 Influenza Season
------
In 2010, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 1st recommended annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged equal to or greater than 6 months in the United States (1). Annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged equal to or greater than 6 months continues to be recommended. This document 1) describes influenza vaccine virus strains included in the U.S. seasonal influenza vaccine for 2012-13; 2) provides guidance for the use of influenza vaccines during the 2012-13 season, including an updated vaccination schedule for children aged 6 months through 8 years and a description of available vaccine products and indications; 3) discusses febrile seizures associated with administration of influenza and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV-13) vaccines; 4) provides vaccination recommendations for persons with a history of egg allergy; and 5) discusses the development of quadrivalent influenza vaccines for use in future influenza seasons. Information regarding issues related to influenza vaccination that are not addressed in this update is available in CDC's Prevention and Control of Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2010 and associated updates (1,2).

Vaccine Strains for the 2012-13 Influenza Season
-----------------------------------------
U.S. influenza vaccines for 2012-13 will contain: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like, and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like (Yamagata lineage) antigens.

The influenza A(H3N2) and B antigens differ from the respective 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasonal vaccine antigens (3). The influenza A(H1N1) vaccine virus strain is derived from an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2009[H1N1]) virus and was included in the 2009(H1N1) monovalent pandemic vaccine as well as the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasonal vaccines.

Recommendations for Vaccination
-----------------------------
Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged equal to or greater than 6 months. To permit time for production of protective antibody levels (4,5), vaccination optimally should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. Therefore, vaccination providers should offer vaccination as soon as vaccine is available. Vaccination should be offered throughout the influenza season (i.e., as long as influenza viruses are circulating in the community).

Vaccine Dose Considerations for Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years
---------------------------------------------------------------
Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine (administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart) during their 1st season of vaccination to optimize immune response. In a study of children aged 5 through 8 years receiving trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) for the 1st time, the proportion of children with protective antibody responses was significantly higher after 2 doses compared with a single dose (6). Several studies have indicated that the time interval between 2 initial doses (from 4 weeks up to 1 year) of the same antigen might not be critical (7-9). However, because of the antigenic novelty of the 2009(H1N1) pandemic virus, which is anticipated to continue circulating during 2012-13, exposure history to this antigen also must be considered. Children who last received seasonal (trivalent) influenza vaccine before the 2010-11 season but did not receive a vaccine containing 2009(H1N1) antigen (either seasonal vaccine since July 2010 or monovalent 2009[H1N1] vaccine) will not have received this antigen. These children are recommended to receive 2 doses this season, even if 2 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine were received before the 2010-11 season. This is illustrated in 2 approaches for determining the number of doses required for children aged 6 months through 8 years, both of which are acceptable.

1. The 1st approach takes into consideration only doses of seasonal influenza vaccine received since 1 Jul 2010. This recommendation is harmonized with that of the American Academy of Pediatrics (10). This approach has the advantage of simplicity, particularly in settings in which ascertaining vaccination history before the 2010-11 season is difficult. Using this approach, children aged 6 months through 8 years need only 1 dose of vaccine in 2012-13 if they received a total of 2 or more doses of seasonal vaccine since 1 Jul 2010. Children who did not receive a total of 2 or more doses of seasonal vaccine since 1 Jul 2010, require 2 doses in 2012-13.

2. In settings where adequate vaccination history from before the 2010-11 season is available, the 2nd approach may be used. By this approach, if a child aged 6 months through 8 years is known to have received at least 2 seasonal influenza vaccines during any previous season, and at least one dose of a 2009(H1N1)-containing vaccine (i.e., either 2010-11 or 2011-12 seasonal vaccine or the monovalent 2009[H1N1] vaccine), then the child needs only one dose for 2012-13. Using this approach, children aged 6 months through 8 years need only one dose of vaccine in 2012-13 if they have received any of the following:
- 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 1 Jul 2010; or
- 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine before 1 Jul 2010, and 1 or more doses of monovalent 2009(H1N1) vaccine; or
- 1 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine before 1 Jul 2010, and 1 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 1 Jul 2010.
Children for whom one of these conditions is not met require 2 doses in 2012-13

Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines
---------------------------
All currently available influenza vaccines are trivalent and contain A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B viral antigens. There are 2 antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses referred to as Victoria and Yamagata lineages (24). Immunization against B virus strains of one lineage provides limited cross-protection against strains in the other lineage (25). Because of this and the difficulty of predicting which B virus lineage will predominate during a given season, inclusion of a 2nd influenza B vaccine virus strain in seasonal influenza vaccines has been proposed. A recent analysis indicates that the impact of such a quadrivalent vaccine could result in a modest reduction in influenza-associated outcomes, depending upon adequate vaccine supply, coverage, effectiveness, and incidence of influenza associated with the 2 B lineages (26).

In February 2012, FDA approved a new seasonal quadrivalent LAIV, FluMist Quadrivalent (MedImmune). This vaccine currently is not anticipated to be available until the 2013-14 influenza season, at which time it is expected to replace the currently available seasonal trivalent FluMist formulation. Inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccines currently are in development. These vaccines will be addressed in the ACIP influenza statement as they are approved and become available commercially.
