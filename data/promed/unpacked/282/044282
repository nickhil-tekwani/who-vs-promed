Leishmaniasis disease on rise in Khyber Agency
----------------------------------------------
The increasing number of leishmaniasis patients in areas of Khyber Agency negates the claims of the Fata Health Department in taking measures to eradicate the disease. Currently there are around 400 to 500 locals and Afghan refugees who are suffering from the disease in the Khyber Agency areas near Pak-Afghan border.

Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites that belong to the genus Leishmania and is transmitted by the bite of certain species of sand fly. It is a contiguous disease and according to the experts mostly Afghan refugees bring the disease with them when they enter the Pakistani border. Locals showing concern over the spread of the disease said the alarming number of leishmaniasis patients was due to the arrival of Afghan refugees in different areas of Khyber Agency.

Perwaiz Khan of Landikotal Tehsil was of the view that lack of awareness among people regarding the disease not only kept patients away from the hospitals but also created problems for the health department to contact the patients. He flayed Fata Secretariat and health department for not devising plan to eliminate the disease. He remarked that awareness programme at local levels should be initiated and it would help root out the disease from the area. The children all the day long are playing in a stagnant water in which the lethal mosquitoes exist and resultantly they are attacked by mosquitoes, Perwaiz reasoned.

On the other hand the Medical Officer in Torkham BHU Ilyas Afridi when contacted said more than 350 registered patients of leishmaniasis received free medicine and treatment and 80 percent of the patients among them were recovered. Children who are working as laborers are immensely affected because of leishmaniasis illness.

Coordinator of EDWS for Khyber Agency, Dr Shams ur Rehman said all the reported leishmaniasis patients were equipped with medicine and were properly recovered. He went on to say that they had handed over the required medicines and injections to each BHUs and civil dispensaries. Their team is responsible for visiting the spot and facilitating the suffered patients by giving him free medicine even if the case happened anywhere in Khyber Agency; Shams said and adding moving into Bara Tehsil sometimes create impediments in their work.

[Leishmaniasis, especially cutaneous leishmaniasis, was highly endemic in Afghanistan during the Taliban regime. The high number of leishmaniasis (cutaneous we presume) among refugees from Afghanistan underline the fact that the disease is not under control in Afghanistan and that treatment facilities are inadequate. - Mod.EP
