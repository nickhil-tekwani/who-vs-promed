Migratory flyways in Asia, Eurasia and Africa and the spread of HP H5N1
-----------------------------------------------
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/conference/documents/hagemeijer-mundkur.pdf>
W. Hagemeijer & T. Mundkur.
Many species of waterbirds connect the land masses of the northern
and southern hemispheres through their annual migrations. They visit
traditional areas on their way between breeding and non-breeding
sites and stage en route. Flyways are spatial generalizations of the
total of these areas. Flyways can be defined at the level of an
individual, population, species or of a grouping of species and can
vary considerably in size. Major global flyways include the
African-Eurasian, Central Asian, East Asian-Australasian and American
flyways. Migration is a complex phenomenon. There is considerable
variation at the individual and other levels, and flyways are but a
summary of the spatial behavior.
Wetlands International, in partnership with EURING, undertook a
preliminary assessment of ornithological data relevant to the spread
of avian influenza for the European Union, including a process of
ranking of species based on a number of ecological and habitat
preference characteristics. Count, ringing and other ornithological
data were mobilized for these species and analyzed. From the
literature, 50 percent of the selected higher risk species were found
to have been infected with HP H5N1 (against less than 10 percent for
non-selected species), suggesting that this analysis has provided a
valuable scientific basis for identification of higher risk species
as a 1st step towards the development of an early warning system for
HP H5N1. The need to undertake such analyses in the other flyways to
inform risk assessments is an urgent priority. This requires long
term and sizable investments to determine migratory routes of
waterbird species and to identify and study higher risk species, work
that will also require building human capacity in the different
countries in these flyways.

HPAI spread from western Siberia to eastern Mediterranean and beyond

Wild birds are considered as the natural reservoir of influenza
viruses, and with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infections
by H5N1 reported in a wide diversity of bird families, it has been
assumed that the intercontinental flyways of migratory birds
delineate the areas at risk of spread of the ongoing epidemic.
Previous works have shown that the natural history of low pathogenic
avian influenza viruses is primarily linked to populations of
_Anatidae_ (Ducks, Geese and Swans) and more specifically _Anatinae_.
By overlaying the known migratory population flyways of _Anatidae_
species and by matching population-weighted flyway overlays against
the traveling wave of frost, we discuss how the pattern of spread of
HPAI H5N1 virus along the Western Palaearctic in the 2nd half of 2005
may be consistent in space and time with the hypothesis that some
_Anatidae_ seeded the virus over long distances along their migrations.

Remote sensing, ecological variables and bird migration
-----------------------------------------------
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/conference/documents/xiao.pdf>
Xiangming Xiao, Marius Gilbert, Fumin Lei, Stephen Boles, Zhongwei
Guo, Jan Slingenbergh
Since late 2003, several East and Southeast Asia countries have
experienced outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI,
H5N1 subtype), or bird flu. By 6 Apr 2006, HPAI outbreaks had been
reported in 45 countries over Asia, Europe and Africa, resulting in a
total of 109 human death cases. It is known that the H5N1 virus has
now established an ecological niche or reservoir in domestic poultry.
Domestic free-ranging ducks play an important role in the persistence
and spread of HPAI, as the ducks can remain relatively healthy whilst
excreting sufficient amounts of H5N1 virus to sustain transmission.
However, it is not clear what role wild birds and their migration
play in the spatial spread and temporal dynamics of the HPAI epidemic
over 2003-2006.
Migration timing and flyways of wild birds are affected by a number
of biological and environmental factors, including habitat, condition
of breeding, molting, stop-over and wintering sites, and weather.
Agricultural expansion has resulted in substantial losses of natural
wetlands; however, agricultural intensification (double or triple
cropping, irrigation), aquaculture (fish and shrimp ponds) and
post-harvest management of paddy rice fields have generated complex
farming landscapes that are now used by wild birds, in particular
during the wintering period. In those closely interwoven farming and
natural ecosystems landscapes, wild birds and domestic ducks are
likely to mix and interact.
We are at the era of satellite earth system observations, and the
emerging Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), with 61
country participants, offers an unprecedented opportunity to help
understand the ecology of avian influenza, particularly in relation
to wild birds, agriculture, domestic poultry, and biophysical and
biochemical environments.
Here, we present our effort in using satellite remote sensing (1) to
quantify key ecological variables that affect migration timing and
flyways of waterfowl and (2) to catalogue farming landscapes,
ecosystems and interactions between these 2 forms of land cover. We
present case studies in Asia to illustrate improved geospatial
datasets of HPAI-relevant ecological factors, including agricultural
systems (cropping intensity, crop calendar, and irrigation),
seasonality of wetlands, and biophysical variables (e.g., land
surface temperature, snow cover). These geospatial datasets can be
used for better understanding the relationship between HPAI outbreaks
and ecological variables and for identifying potentially hot-spots
(location-varying risks) and hot-periods (time-varying risk) of HPAI,
which could substantially help targeted surveillance of wild birds
and domestic poultry, risk assessment and early warning and response
strategies.

Incursion of H5N1 Asian lineage virus into Europe: source of introduction?
-----------------------------------------------
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/conference/documents/I.Brown.pdf>
I.H. Brown, B.Z. Londt, W. Shell, R.J. Manvell, J. Banks, R. Gardner,
L. Outtrim, S.C. Essen, M. Sabirovic, M. Slomka, D.J. Alexander
In October 2005, the 1st reported outbreak of H5N1 high pathogenic
avian influenza of Asian lineage occurred in a turkey flock in
Turkey. Although this outbreak, located in eastern Turkey, was dealt
with swiftly using movement restrictions and depopulation, it
heralded the detection of this virus in at least 25 European
countries between October 2005 and May 2006 (at the time of writing).
The majority of these reports involved the detection or isolation of
virus from wild birds that were found dead. In addition, there were a
number of incursions into poultry populations.
Molecular epidemiology based on sequence analyses of the
hemagglutinin gene revealed high homogeneity amongst all these
viruses, which were also very closely related to the viruses present
in eastern and central Asia (i.e. Siberia, Mongolia and Qinghai
lake). One mechanism of virus spread to Europe was by migratory wild
birds that were found positive in many countries, with no associated
outbreaks in poultry. Some, but not all of these reports may relate
to movement of birds due to adverse weather in eastern Europe.
Further infection of wild birds through exposure to infected backyard
poultry in eastern Europe appears probable. Conventional spread and
introduction resulting from the movement, legal or illegal, of
poultry and poultry products would also appear to be a key factor. An
up to date analysis of the epidemic in Europe will be presented.

_Mustela lutreola_. - Mod.MHJ]
