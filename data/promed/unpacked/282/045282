The paddy crop, already reeling under water scarcity in the River Cauvery delta region, is facing yet another crisis in the form [of] bacterial leaf blight disease. The malaise has hit several thousand acres, and the Department of Agriculture, along with farmers, are racing against time to stem the rot.

Water scarcity had resulted in delayed cropping. Farmers also were forced to resort to direct sowing. The current climatic condition is best suitable for the onset of the disease.

A farmer in Tiruvarur district [said]: "The disease appeared suddenly and spread to the entire land. Even the cattle are hesitant to graze the affected crop, and productivity has been lost to the disease."

Another farmer noted that, in many instances, they could not initially distinguish the onset of the bacterial leaf blight from regular drying of paddy leaves due to water scarcity. Once the initial period is lost without proper treatment, it will be difficult to salvage anything.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_. In Asia, millions of hectares of rice paddies are severely affected every year, with reported yield losses of up to 60 per cent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves and wilting of seedlings. Blight lesions caused by severe strains elongate over the entire length of the flag leaf, giving a striped appearance. Severe strains may also affect panicles. Mild strains cause only small leaf lesions and may not lead to any detectable yield loss. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing to the damage. Field patches infested with bacterial blight have a whitish, ragged appearance.

BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water and warm temperatures. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material (such as rice stubble or ratoons) and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting seedlings or by high insect activity).

Disease management usually includes phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers) and use of resistant crop varieties. Control of insect populations by insecticides may help reduce the unspecific spread of bacteria via their scratching and sucking wounds. Antibacterial sprays containing antibiotics are rarely used because they often provide little benefit, and agricultural application of antibiotics is strictly regulated in most countries.

An outbreak of BLB has also been reported recently from neighbouring Bangladesh (ProMED-mail post 20161101.4598659).

The related _X. oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice.
