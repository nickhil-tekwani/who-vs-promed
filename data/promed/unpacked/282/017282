[1] Cholera - Cuba (Cienfuegos Province)
Date: Sat 23 Nov 2013

A cholera alarm went out this week in Cumanayagua (Cienfuegos Province). This is the 2nd outbreak in the province so far in 2013.

Up to the morning of 21 Nov 2013, 64 cases positive for a cholera rapid test, including 1 death, had been reported, an undetermined number of patients is in critical condition, and more than 100 persons affected by profuse diarrhea are awaiting the results of the tests.

The health crisis has prompted the visit of senior officials from the Ministry of Health. Similarly, this has led to the mobilization of government officials at different levels, business managers, and health workers as well as the concentration of logistical resources in the hardest hit areas of the province.

Health brigades in vehicles with loudspeakers travelled through streets and avenues, informing people about the sanitary measures to implement, that is, the purchase of hypochlorite from the network of pharmacies and disinfectants sold in some state-run stores.

At the moment nobody dares to predict the time it would take to eliminate the epidemic, as it is far from being controlled.

[2] Cholera - Mexico (Veracruz, Hidalgo)

The Ministry of Health in Mexico has reported an additional 4 cases of infection with _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa. Of these, 3 are from the state of Veracruz and 1 from the state of Hidalgo.

Since the beginning of this outbreak in September 2013 to date, a total of 184 confirmed cases, including 1 death, of cholera has been reported in the country. Of these, 160 cases are from the state of Hidalgo, 11 from the state of Veracruz, 9 from the state of Mexico, 2 from the Federal District, and 2 from the state of San Luis Potosi.

An antimicrobial susceptibility test for the strain was conducted by the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnostics and Reference (InDRE) which demonstrated that the bacterium was susceptible to doxycycline and chloramphenicol, with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

This is the 1st local transmission of cholera recorded since 2001 in Mexico. The genetic profile of the bacterium obtained from patients in Mexico presents high similarity (95 percent) with the strain that is currently circulating in 3 Caribbean countries (Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Cuba), and is different from the strain that had been circulating in Mexico during 1991-2001.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Mexico with respect to this event.
