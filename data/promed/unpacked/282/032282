In recent years, the problems affecting mango fruits in Paraguay have increased. The National University of Asunci√≥n, in conjunction with the Federal University of Vicosa (Brazil), began research to diagnose the cause of this. Preliminary results indicate that the disease is canker (or black spot), which is caused by a bacterium in the genus _Xanthomonas_. The cankers with open wounds also make the tree more susceptible to other pathogens, such as fungi.

Mango canker is one of the most important diseases of the crop in tropical and subtropical regions and could worsen over time also in Brazil. More research is needed on biology and ecology of the pathogen, selection for tolerance or resistance in mango cultivars, as well as pathogen genetic diversity and its impact on the epidemiology and management of the disease.

[Bacterial black spot (BBS, also called bacterial canker) of mango is caused by _Xanthomonas citri_ (Xc) pv. _mangiferaeindicae_ (Xcm). It was first described from Africa but is now known to occur also in the Asian-Pacific region and South America. It is an economically important disease with up to 90% yield losses reported. The pathogen can infect leaves, stems, and fruit, with fruit symptoms being the most economically damaging. Symptoms include small, irregular, or star-shaped, water-soaked lesions on fruit that soon become raised; they may crack open releasing bacterial ooze. Stem lesions appear as blackened cankers, which may crack lengthwise. Leaves show water-soaked lesions that may coalesce to form large necrotic patches. Their appearance is characteristic and can be used to distinguish BBS from fungal anthracnose (_Glomerella_ or _Colletotrichum_ species). Severe infections cause defoliation and/or premature fruit drop.

The bacteria live as epiphytes but occur in high concentrations in leaf and stem lesions. They are essentially wound pathogens but can also infect through natural openings. Incidence is increased by micro-wound development and may therefore be severe in windy areas without windbreaks, when insect populations are high, or in trees that lack vigour. BBS can be prevalent in both low- and high-rainfall tropical and subtropical areas.

The disease is spread by wind-driven rain, splashing water, and mechanical means (including insect and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices, phytosanitary measures, use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as bactericidal sprays. Infected nursery trees have been a major source of BBS in new orchards. Susceptibility to BBS varies between mango cultivars, but no completely resistant varieties are known.

Other pathovars of Xc cause, for example, citrus canker; other species in the genus cause important diseases in a range of crops, for example, banana xanthomonas wilt (see previous ProMED posts in the archives). Genome sequencing of species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ is providing information on mechanisms of bacterial virulence.
