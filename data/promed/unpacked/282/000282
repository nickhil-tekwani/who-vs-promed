Cape health officials are seeing increases in tick-borne disease this summer [2014], and it's not just Lyme disease anymore. Cases of the newly emerging illnesses anaplasmosis and babesiosis continue to rise, while a recently discovered disease also transmitted by the bite of a deer tick [_Ixodes scapularis_] -- [relapsing fever-like illness due to] _Borrelia miyamotoi_ -- has been detected in more than a dozen Cape Codders.

Dr. Laurel Miller, medical director of infectious disease services for Cape Cod Healthcare, said a Norwood laboratory that has developed a test for [_B.] miyamotoi_ has diagnosed 13 -14 people from the Cape with the tick-borne illness this summer [2014]. "We're starting to see miyamotoi. It's not huge numbers," Miller said. The disease was 1st documented in U.S. residents in early 2013.

An equal number of anaplasmosis cases also has been detected in Cape patients this summer [2014], she said. Lyme cases continue to outnumber other tick-borne diseases, Miller said. A couple of weeks ago, Cape Cod Hospital admitted 5 people with Lyme disease, babesiosis and a combination of both illnesses, she said.

Anaplasmosis and babesiosis can both be deadly, especially in elderly people or people with compromised immune systems. In rare cases, Lyme has been known to cause fatal heart problems. Cape Cod Healthcare officials said a patient who died at Cape Cod Hospital this summer [2014] was infected with anaplasmosis, but the illness was not the cause of death.

Though fewer in number than Lyme disease cases, the number of anaplasmosis and babesiosis diagnoses have almost quadrupled over the past 5 years in Massachusetts, said Dr. Catherine Brown, state public health veterinarian. "We know there's a lot of tick-borne illness in Massachusetts," she said.

In 2013, the most recent year for which the state Department of Public Health has numbers, there were 151 cases of babesiosis on the Cape and Islands and 37 cases of anaplasmosis. There were also 387 confirmed or probable cases of Lyme disease in Barnstable, Dukes and Nantucket counties, which came to more than 5 percent of the total number in the state, 5665.

The Cape and Islands region is ground zero for babesiosis, with the highest incidence rate in the state, and it's 2nd only to Berkshire County for the incidence of anaplasmosis.

Nancy Ross of Hyannis knows the likelihood of getting tick-borne disease is higher on the Cape than other parts of the state, so she usually wears long pants when working in her garden. A few weeks ago -- on one of the few hot days of this summer [2014] -- she wore shorts to trim the shrubs and ended up finding a tick and what looked like five bites on her ankles and knees. Ross rapidly developed hot red rashes and a host of symptoms including a painful eye, shortness of breath, high blood pressure, a sore left arm and swollen knee. Her doctor immediately put her on doxycycline, which cleared up the symptoms, Ross said. "He thought it was tick-related" and plans to test her this week to see which pathogen carried by the deer tick most likely made her ill, she said.

Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and miyamotoi all respond to doxycycline, but babesiosis, which has been likened to a malarial-type illness, requires another type of treatment.

Dr. Timothy Biliouris of Cape Cod Medical Center in South Dennis said in an email that while Lyme disease is still the most prevalent tick-borne illness presented by his patients, cases of babesiosis are growing at a faster pace. Last summer [2013], there were 8 cases of suspected, probable and confirmed babesiosis in Barnstable, Barnstable Town Health Agent Thomas McKean said. During the same time period this year [1 Jun-22 Aug 2014], there have been 12 cases.

Anaplasmosis cases also are on the rise in Barnstable. Last summer [2013], there was one case, and this summer, there have been 4 confirmed, 4 suspected, and one probable case, McKean said. He said the town public health nurse will review lab reports and talk to physicians and patients about the probable and suspected cases before deciding whether to report them to the state DPH.

At Cape Cod Healthcare, doctors -- including emergency department physicians -- are being advised to test for all 4 known diseases carried by deer ticks -- Lyme, babesiosis, anaplasmosis and miyamotoi -- this summer [2014], Miller said. She said the miyamotoi test is new. "There's more awareness," Miller said. "There's more testing going on."

Although miyamotoi has not been known to be fatal in the U.S., health officials are eager to keep tabs on the newly identified illness.

Larry Dapsis, deer tick program coordinator and entomologist with the Cape Cod Cooperative Extension, said the organization received USD 20 000 in funding to have researchers examine the DNA of 400 ticks from the Cape and Islands on file at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for miyamotoi. "It's probably been here for a while," Dapsis said. "But we haven't looked for it." UMass microbiologist Stephen Rich should have the results in a couple of weeks, Dapsis said.

The snowy winter and relatively rainy summer weather might have played a role in tick cases by keeping ticks, which dry up in low humidity, alive, Dapsis said. "Anything that can help maintain high humidity is beneficial to ticks," he said. "Typically, things dry out and get really hot in July," said Sam R. Telford III, infectious disease expert and professor at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University. The dry weather kills the ticks in their nymphal stage, a point in which they are particularly dangerous because their tiny poppy-seed size makes them hard to spot. But "we have had very cool and wet weather in July [2014], so the nymphs have persisted longer than they usually do," Telford wrote in an email. He said this could translate into more reports of Lyme disease later into the summer season than usual.

The adult ticks emerging now are easier to see but more likely to carry Lyme disease than the nymphs, said Brenda Boleyn, co-chairwoman of the Barnstable County Lyme/Tick-borne Diseases Task Force. "Be careful with your tick checks," she said. Consider using DEET-based repellents on bare skin and permethrin-based repellents on clothing, Brown said. She suggested wearing light clothing outdoors so the ticks stand out.

Cape Cod juts out into the Atlantic Ocean in the easternmost portion of the state of Massachusetts, in the Northeastern United States. Barnstable County consists of Cape Cod and some associated islands (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod#Region_of_Cape_Cod_and_the_Islands). Dukes County consists of the island of Martha's Vineyard, Chappaquiddick Island, and some smaller islands south of the Cape. Nantucket County consists Nantucket Island and some smaller islands south of the Cape. - Mod.ML
