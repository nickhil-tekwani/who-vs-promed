The District Governorship of Princes' Islands has announced that 81 horses the Buyukada island were killed by officials following a glanders outbreak.

After some horses were diagnosed with glanders during routine checks, tests have been conducted on horses throughout the island and 81 horses have been diagnosed with glanders so far, according to the statement.

There is no treatment or vaccine for glanders, therefore the horses were killed in accordance with the regulations, the governor's office said.

It also banned the entrance and exit of animals to the Princes' Islands.

2 large holes have been reportedly dug to bury the killed horses.

[Buyukada (meaning "Big Island" in Turkish) is the largest of the 9 so-called Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara, near Istanbul. It is officially a neighbourhood in the Adalar (Islands) district of Istanbul Province, Turkey.

Motor vehicles are banned on this island, which means that both locals and visitors rely on bicycles and horse-drawn carriages to move around the island's little more than 5 sq km (3 sq miles); see http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/activists-hold-protest-against-horse-drawn-carriages-144292 (published 18 Jun 2019). According to the said source, there are 275 coaches registered at the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Directorate of Transport Coordination (UKOME), and about 1200 coach horses live on the Princes' Islands. A previous report on glanders affecting horses on the island was covered in 20171206.5487492. No case of glanders has been included among the zoonotic diseases reported by Turkey since the introduction, since 2005, of OIE's WAHIS interface (World Animal Health Information System).

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as "farcy." Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref. 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a bio-risk analysis.

The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent, and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf. A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref. 1.

No vaccine against this disease is available; however, prior use of _B. mallei_ as a biological weapon and its high mortality in inhalation animal studies has affirmed _B. mallei_ as a biodefense concern. This encouraged, in the past, studies addressing the development of a human vaccine (ref. 2).

The international animal-movement aspects of glanders were discussed in ref 3.
