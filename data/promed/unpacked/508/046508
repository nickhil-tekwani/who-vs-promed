China: test for simultaneous subtype siagnosis developed
--------------------------------------------------------
A multiple real-time fluorescent test reagent kit has been successfully
developed for testing H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of avian influenza virus in
Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong province, according to the appraisal team
for the new test approach. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) test, the reagent kit is able to test for 3
[haemagglutinin antigen] subtypes of avian influenza virus simultaneously,
instead of only one subtype at a time, said Tian Bo, head of the appraisal
team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Experts from the appraisal team
held that the test reagent kit is efficient and easy to use. It is suitable
for use in poultry quarantine, human disease control, and epidemiological
investigation.
Avian influenza, or bird flu, is an infectious disease of waterfowl and
poultry that has jumped to humans. It can cause severe disease and death in
people because human immune systems have little experience of it and thus
no defense against it. [In fact, transmission to humans of avian influenza
viruses has been an extremely rare event, with only 34 cases confirmed in
the current East Asian outbreak. - Mod.CP]. Blessed with a dense water
network, Shenzhen is a transient home to migrant birds and a major supplier
of live poultry for the adjacent Hong Kong.
As early as in August 2002, the local quarantine bureau began to employ the
fluorescent RT-PCR test approach to examine poultry to be supplied to Hong
Kong, and it took about 4 hours to get the test result. To lower the test
cost and raise test efficiency, researchers from the bureau have worked
with their fellows from the Shenzhen Taitai Gene Co, Ltd for 3 months to
develop a new-type fluorescent RT-PCP reagent kit. The scientific outcome,
with independent patent, has met the world standards, according to Liu
Shengli, head of the local entry and exit quarantine bureau.

[This test may prove useful in monitoring avian influenza virus infection
in the current epidemiological situation in East Asia, provided that the
test is authenticated by external evaluation and its production, testing,
and use are subject to strict regulation and quality control by a relevant
governmental agency. The test is designed to discriminate the 3
haemagglutinin subtypes exhibited by highly pathogenic strains of avian
influenza virus. It does not identify any other of the 15 haemagglutinin
subtypes of avian influenza virus currently recognized, which potentially
could initiate disease outbreaks in domestic poultry either directly or as
a consequence of genetic reassortment. Nor does the test identify any of
the 9 recognized neuraminidase antigenic subtypes, which can be relevant in
distinguishing epidemic strains (such as H5N1 and H5N2).
Consequently, although the test is an undoubted advance, it has restricted
application in its present formulation. In principle, however, it should be
possible to extend its range by inclusion of additional subtypes, or if
this is not possible to assemble a battery of analogous triple tests to
cover a wider range of viruses. - Mod.CP]
