A 67-year-old male national from Dakhlia Governorate developed fever and cough on [18 Nov 2016], and was admitted to a hospital on [20 Nov 2016]. A chest X- ray performed on the same day showed lobar pneumonia. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on [22 Nov 2016] and tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR (UpE and Orf1a genes) at Central Public Health Laboratories. The patient has type 2 Diabetes Mellitus as a comorbid condition. He has a history of exposure to animals (camels, goats and cows) in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient is in stable condition and was discharged from the hospital on [26 Nov 2016].

The 67-year-old Omani male did not have a history of any travel in the 14 days prior to the onset of illness but did have a history of taking care of animals (camels, cattle and goats) during this period. All family contacts, healthcare workers and other patients in the ward where he was admitted are being followed up. A total of 2 of the family members have minor respiratory symptoms and. 40 samples collected from close contacts. Results are awaited.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Seif Al-Abri for his very rapid and thorough response to the request for information on results of epidemiologic studies on this most recent case of MERS-CoV reported by Oman. We'd also like to thank the other EpiCore surveillance Project member who provided additional information on contact tracing surrounding this case.

As a reminder, In Oman, suspicion of MERS-CoV infection leads to immediate isolation of the suspected case. (see prior ProMED-mail reports on MERS-CoV in Oman earlier this past year).
