All six of the lion-tailed macaques at the Mesker Park Zoo & Botanic Garden
have tested positive for herpes B virus. The zoo will try to place the
macaques at the National Center for Retired Research Primates in Helotes,
Texas
The family of the bitten child, who crossed a barrier and stuck a finger
into the exhibit [on 3 Oct 1999, was notified of the results Tuesday.
The monkeys had been tested 17 times since 1990, but a random test of two
monkeys conducted about two weeks ago, as well as the follow-up test on all
six monkeys conducted 20 Oct 1999, were the only positive tests the zoo has
ever received, said the zoo's director, who also said that the virus can
remain dormant for 20 years or more.
