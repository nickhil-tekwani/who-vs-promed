A Middleboro resident is the 1st person to test positive for the eastern equine encephalitis virus this year [2020] in Massachusetts.

Town Manager Robert G Nunes said the Massachusetts Department of Public Health [DPH] informed the town of a human case on Monday afternoon [3 Aug 2020].

"We just received notice from the MASS DPH that a human case of EEE/West Nile has been reported in Middleboro," he wrote in a Facebook post.

The Department of Public Health on Monday afternoon [3 Aug 2020] announced that a Plymouth County resident between the ages of 11 and 20 tested positive for the eastern equine encephalitis virus and is presenting meningoencephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain caused by an infection.

The state health department, by practice, doesn't identify victims by name or give the specific city or town they live in.

Nunes said Middleboro has banned all outdoor activities on town property from dusk to dawn.

State health officials raised the risk level for the eastern equine encephalitis virus to high in Middleboro and Carver last Wednesday [29 Jul 2020] due to several mosquitoes carrying the disease [virus] being detected in the towns.

In Massachusetts this year [2020], 29 mosquitoes have tested positive for the eastern equine encephalitis virus and 20 for the West Nile virus.

In Middleboro, 6 mosquitoes with the eastern equine encephalitis virus have been trapped.

[The human case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) appeared about 3 weeks after the virus was found in mosquitoes for the 1st time this year (2020). EEE virus has been detected in Plymouth (where the human case occurred) and Franklin Counties for the 1st time this year and for the 3rd time in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health announced Wednesday (15 Jul 2020). Last year (2019) was an unusually active year for EEEV transmission in the eastern USA, with cases in humans and horses, including in Massachusetts. As mentioned in many previous ProMED-mail posts, horse owners in eastern and upper midwestern USA states should vaccinate their animals now if they have not done so already. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure to take.

Additional information on EEE is available on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/. - Mod.TY
