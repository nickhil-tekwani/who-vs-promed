The levels of bovine TB [tuberculosis] occurring across County Wicklow are having a devastating effect on the farming community, with many dairy and beef farmers suffering drastic losses in income when infected animals have to be put down.

According to Aughrim-based farmer and President of Wicklow ICMSA [Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association] Shane O'Loughlin, 'TB is rife' in Wicklow at present.

'At the moment we are looking at TB levels at 3.5 times the national average per 1000 population. This is a huge concern for farmers who have had herds devastated by the disease. We are not just hearing of 1 or 2 reactors in a herd but sometimes in the dozens,' said Shane.

Once a reactor is detected in a herd, it is removed and the remaining cattle must pass 2 tests at 60 and 120 days post reactor before they are deemed fit for sale.

'You cannot sell stock without this clearance and during this time the farmer's income is gone or vastly diminished. They have no way of making an income and the bills keep coming in.'

Shane explained that, in the past, cattle to cattle and badger to cattle transfer of TB were the main causes for concern but today, rising levels of deer is the suspected reason for the increase.

'I see deer tracks in my yard almost every morning. At our AGM [Annual General Meeting] we had farmers in Castletown, 2 miles [3.2 km] outside of Arklow, who saw deer on land where they never were before. We have no idea of the numbers of deer out there.'

As a result of the increasing bovine TB levels, Shane said that Wicklow farmers are seeking a deer cull to get the matter under control.

'A cull is most definitely required and the farming community is getting very frustrated by the lack of progress. It's not good for the cattle or the deer. If the disease is rampant amongst the deer then they are dying a slow and painful death. We want to see a healthy, sustainable deer stock as well.'

[Bovine tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ has one of the widest host ranges of all the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (MTC) and can readily spill over into a variety of domestic and wild mammals, including humans.

It is surprising that the call for culling is only based on perceived deer abundance. Even if there are good estimates of deer population dynamics, a culling effort should at least be based on surveys that provide data on the prevalence in deer, a careful analysis of how much culling would be needed to have the expected result, and whether such efforts are feasible.

Surveillance efforts in deer and other susceptible wildlife species can provide an early warning of risk of transmission to livestock and also to produce crucial data to better understand the eco-epidemiology of the disease.
