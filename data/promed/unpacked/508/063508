SARS - WORLDWIDE (44): UK TRANSMISSION SUSPECTED

[ProMED-mail is posting this as a separate posting rather than waiting to
include this in the daily SARS update later on. We are very grateful to
Dr. Nicoll for this submission, and recognize this as an important public
health announcement to advise other countries of the possibility of SARS
transmission in the UK as a result of this possible close contact case of
SARS having occurred in the Heathrow airport and vicinity. While this is
still preliminary information, it is important to disseminate rapidly as
many countries use definitions for suspected and probable cases of SARS
that have as part of the definition, history of travel to an area with
known SARS transmission, which according to WHO includes Canada
(Toronto), China (Beijing, Guangdong province, Shanxi province), Taiwan,
Hong Kong SAR, VietNam (Hanoi) and Singapore. - Mod.MPP]

Possible Transmission of SARS in the UK
The 6th probable case of SARS to be diagnosed in the UK was reported
yesterday (11 Apr 2003) following an illness that started on 7 Apr 2003.
That patient is moderately unwell and isolated in hospital. His contacts
are being followed up. Laboratory investigations are underway at the
Central Public Health Laboratory (Dr Maria Zambon). The patient had not
been abroad and was diagnosed following an alert from Hong Kong about SARS
in a Hong Kong national who travelled around Europe (Germany, UK and Spain)
between 30 Mar 2003 and 4 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong man was unwell with what
turned out to be SARS from 31 Mar 2003 onwards. The Hong Kong man met with
the UK 6th case for a 2 hour face to face meeting in a Hotel at Heathrow
airport (The Heathrow Marriott) on 3 Apr 2003. There are no other relevant
contacts for the UK case and therefore if his diagnosis is confirmed as
SARS transmission has almost certainly occurred in the UK. This information
is being made public today.Investigations has not found any indication that
the Hong Kong man had other close contacts in the 24 hours he was in the UK
and no related suspect or probable cases of SARS have come to light. There
is no ill-health among the hotel staff who had any direct contact with him
or went into the man's room. Thorough cleaning was undertaken of the man's
room on departure.
To date there have been no reports of ill health among other visitors to
the hotel therefore this transmission does not seem analagous to the
outbreak of SARS cases in a hotel in Hong Kong. It seems unlikely that
there will have been any further transmission associated with the Hong Kong
man in the UK. However if any national authorities become aware of a SARS
diagnosis being made in a person who has been in the UK in the 10 days
before developing disease they should immediately contact the CDSC duty
doctor (+44 208 200 6868 or e-mail respcdsc@phls.org.uk ) including details
of the cases time and contacts in the UK, for example details of any hotel
stay.
It should be borne in mind that close contact transmission has already
taken place in the US
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5214a1.htm> and
Canada <http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/NEJMoa030634v1> as
well as in the Far East though we understand the chains of transmission in
North America to date are limited.
The UK authorities understand from WHO - Europe, and direct contact with
German authorities, that investigations to identify contacts in German and
Spain are underway.
