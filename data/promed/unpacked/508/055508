DOH updates list of HFMD cases
------------------------------
Health Secretary Enrique T. Ona today confirmed the second case of EV-71 (Enterovirus-71)-associated HFMD (Human [sic, actually Hand] Foot & Mouth Disease) in a 5-year old boy from Benguet province. "The patient presented with fever and rashes in the hands, feet, and mouth and is presently recovering at home as no hospitalization was required. Just like the first confirmed case he had no history of travel to Cambodia. A DOH team is now conducting contact tracing to determine the spread [source] of infection," Ona revealed.

The Department of Health's National Epidemiology Center reported 43 suspected HFMD cases as of 21 Jul 2012. Laboratory results were available for 42 of these cases. Twenty-one cases (21), which screened positive for a human enterovirus [infection] were classified as confirmed HFMD cases; 2 of these cases further tested positive for EV-71 while 19 were negative [for EV-71].

Of the confirmed HFMD cases, 14 were males and age ranged from 6 months to 23 years; 12 were less than 5 years old. Most of the cases were reported from Southern Luzon (13) and Davao (4). No deaths were reported.

An interim guideline for surveillance of HFMD and severe enteroviruses is now available. All suspected cases of HFMD are now required to be immediately reported to the DOH within 24 hours of detection. Laboratory screening and confirmation of human enteroviruses are done at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

"The public is reminded to observe strict personal hygiene and hand washing," Ona reminded. He adding that shared toys or teaching tools in daycare should be cleaned, washed and disinfected as they easily become contaminated.

As of today, there are no travel restrictions to and from HFMD-affected countries. "Quarantine officers continue to screen arriving passengers as part of international precautions to prevent the international spread of diseases," the health chief concluded.

[This report indicates that human enterovirus 71 is present in the Philippines and responsible for a small proportion of cases of HFMD. The identities of the other human enteroviruses found by this surveillance operation are not revealed. It is apparent, however, that human enterovirus 71 infection has not been associated with cases of sever disease, such as was observed in Cambodia. These observations suggest that factors other than the enterovirus type were responsible for the severity of the disease observed in some patients there.
