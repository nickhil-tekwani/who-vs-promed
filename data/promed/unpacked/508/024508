----------------------------------------------------------------------
To my knowledge, until now nobody with a naive immune system survived
classical rabies virus disease. In the girl 9 years ago rabies virus
never was proven -- the hints for rabies being the cause for disease
were a bat bite and a (significant) increase in rabies antibodies.
(All? of) the others surviving a probable contact with classical
rabies virus had received at least one rabies shot before the contact,
which might have conferred partial immunity (as was in the one and
only survivor of organ transplant recipients from a rabies positive
donor a few years ago in Germany).

So not to raise unjustified hope that one might survive infection
with classical rabies virus when treatment is started after onset of
symptoms, I would strongly recommend exact wording (such as, using
"rabies-like disease" instead). And in this report, it is also not
indicated whether classical rabies virus was isolated from the girl's
body (just saying: "doctors determined that she had contracted
rabies").

Nevertheless, it is so good to hear that she obviously is improving
-- so let us hope for the best and congratulations to the colleagues
treating the child in this life-threatening situation.
