[1] Russia ex Austria

Laboratory tests performed on blood samples collected from 224 head of Austrian cattle imported into Abansky district of the Krasnoyarsk region revealed the presence of antibodies against the Schmallenberg virus [SBV]. This indicates that the animals had been infected by the virus previously, Rosselkhoznadzor reported. Currently, the animals are being examined for the presence of the live virus.

Rosselkhoznadzor notified cattle importers of cattle from the EU that such imports may be related to added risk in case live virus is detected. This may lead to the requirement of the destruction of the animals or their re-exportation; the latter is not always possible, for technical reasons.

In addition, Rosselkhoznadzor informed importers that in the near future, a decision may be taken to discontinue the imports of breeding cattle from countries where the SBV disease has spread in view of the fact that guarantees provided to Rosselkhoznadzor by national veterinary services of the EU concerning the SBV health status of such animals have not always been satisfactory.

The Schmallenberg virus has now been confirmed in 11 herds by the Department of Agriculture. In addition to these confirmed cases, blood samples taken from herds in Cork and Wexford have tested positive for virus antibodies, which means that the animals were bitten by an infected midge in recent months.

The virus was 1st confirmed on 30 Oct 2012 from a bovine foetus that was submitted for post mortem in east Cork. In general, the virus causes mild disease in adult cattle, whilst it is not seen to cause any clinical signs in adult sheep or goats. The clinical signs include fever, a drop in milk production, and sometimes diarrhoea. When infection occurs in animals that are not pregnant, the impact is very limited. However, if ruminant animals are infected during the early stages of pregnancy, they may subsequently abort or give birth to malformed offspring.

Recent French SBV data and map, as of 27 Nov 2012, are available at http://www.survepi.org/cerepi/images/documents/surveillance%20sbv%20congnital_traitement%201.pdf. Interestingly, some sheep flocks have reportedly suffered a disease event with short duration which resembled the earlier observations in cattle, namely fever, diarrhea, and milk production drop.

The possibility of SBV spread by internationally traded breeding cattle, underlined by Russia's Rosselkhoznadzor (item 1), deserves to be studied and addressed.

With declining temperatures, the vector season, accompanied by new infections, is expected to be terminated during the coming weeks. - Mod.AS
