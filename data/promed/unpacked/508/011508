and the (below) reported decline in water-borne _S. sonnei_ with improved
water treatment, is it known if _S. sonnei_ is more tolerant of 'adverse'
environmental
conditions than either _S. dysenteriae_ and _S. flexneri_ and therefore
more likely to be spread by food or fomites (hands)?

The prevalence of _S. sonnei_ in developing countries has also caught our
attention. We have worked extensively with all four _Shigella_ species in
the lab. In growing isolates of all four species for making chromosomal
DNA, we have had several lab acquired infections over a period of 15 years.
In all cases infection was due to _S. sonnei_. The second time this
happened we were intrigued enough to conduct some simple experiments to
look at the differential survival of _Shigella_ species in the lab
environment. These experiments suggest that _S. sonnei_ is a hardier
organism than the other three _Shigella_ species. It is more resistant to
desiccation and survives considerably longer on the surface of a lab bench
than other _Shigella_ species. It also can be recovered from petri plates
both a room temperature and 37 degrees C for a much longer time than _S.
flexneri_. This greater hardiness may lead to better survival in the
environment. Thus, even in the presence of good sanitary systems, the
organism may be able to survive under circumstances which would be lethal
for _S. flexneri_.
The _Shigelloides_ hypothesis is also an interesting one. It is likely
though that several factors play a role in the changing epidemiology of
_Shigella_ infections. Are there any examples where there has been a shift
back to _S. flexneri_ after _S. sonnei_ had become established in the
population? Of particular interest would be situations where there has
not been a lapse in good sanitation.

The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), part of the
national (U.S.) Emerging Infections Program, conducts active surveillance
for _Shigella_ spp. in 7 sites (CA, CT, GA, MD, MN, NY, and OR). The
predominant species (>97%) in these sites are _S. sonnei_ and _S.
flexneri_. Among all _Shigella_ species reported from 1996 to 1998, where
serotype was indicated, 75.1% were _S. sonnei_ and 22.4% were _S. flexneri_
with no trend by year. There was substantial regional variation, with _S.
flexneri_ representing about 40% of the cases in CA, MD and OR, about 20%
of the cases in CT, MN and NY, and 9% of the cases in GA. These data
suggest that _S. flexneri_ has not disappeared in the western world, or at
least not in some locations, among individuals ill enough to be tested.
Additional FoodNet data can be found at the recently expanded FoodNet site
at: <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/foodnet/default.htm>.
