Alabama rot, also known as cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV), is a disease that affects dogs. It damages the blood vessels in the skin and kidneys, causing visible sores on the skin, leading to severe organ dysfunction and kidney failure.

Public Protection Partnership (PPP), a service delivering environmental health, licensing, and trading standards across Bracknell Forest, West Berkshire, and Wokingham Borough councils, confirmed there are 2 cases of Alabama rot in the area. The service stated on its website: "We have been made aware of 2 cases of Alabama rot in the Wokingham area; however, we want to reassure the public it is still a very rare disease."

Owners have been advised to wash off any mud off their dog after every walk and keep an eye on them when they're outside. If anyone has any concerns, they should speak to their vet as soon as possible.

How to spot the signs of Alabama rot:
1. Owners should look out for skin sores, visible swelling, red patch or skin defects not caused by a known injury. These will normally appear below the knee or elbow, and occasionally on the face or at the bottom of the chest or abdomen.
2. A change in appetite should also be monitored. This includes not eating much, drinking more, vomiting, and lethargy.

[The clinico-pathological features of CRGV, a seasonal disease of dogs, as observed in the UK between 2012 - 2019, have been summarised, analysed, and presented in the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
-------
- Background: 178 dogs with cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV) were evaluated to further the understanding of the natural course of CRGV. CRGV, a form of thrombotic microangiopathy, can cause skin lesions and potentially acute kidney injury (AKI) with a high mortality rate.
- Methods: Cases were submitted from multiple practices from 2012 until June 2019. Clinical histories and laboratory data were reviewed to describe the features of CRGV.
- Results: Most cases (91%) occurred between November and May. 15 dogs (8.4%) with CRGV were in contact with another dog that developed skin lesions/AKI. Limb lesions were present on 144 dogs (80.9%) at presentation. Median time from appearance of a lesion to AKI was 3 days (range around 4-45 days). Neurological signs occurred in 33 dogs (18.6%) including at presentation in 2 (1.1%). Systemic signs were present in 13 dogs prior to a skin lesion (7.3%). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed prior to AKI identification in 92 of 170 dogs (54.1%). Thrombocytopenia was present in 115 of 137 (83.9%) of dogs.
- Conclusion: The timeframe over which AKI may develop is longer than previously reported, neurological signs can be identified at presentation or during hospitalisation, and thrombocytopenia is even more common than previously reported."

"Conclusion
----------
CRGV remains a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) of unknown aetiology, which imparts a grave prognosis when clinically significant azotaemia develops. It is unclear why there has been a yearly variation in case numbers, and further epidemiological study is required. This updated report provides clarification on the expected features of the disease in the UK and helps guide clinicians as to when to suspect CRGV as a major differential. The report highlights that neurological signs may be a feature of the disease including at initial presentation, identifies a greater range in time from skin lesions to development of AKI, and identified that NSAID use is prevalent at initial presentation which may be concerning given the potential nephrotoxicity of these medications. It is likely that some cases of CRGV in the UK remain non-azotaemic, and it is possible that there are more surviving cases than the authors are aware of. Further research into the underlying aetiology of CRGV is required to help identify triggers, define prognostic indicators and to determine optimal management."

According to the Alabama Rot Research Fund (ARRF), a registered charity, as of 27 Jan 2022 there have been 281 confirmed cases in the UK, with 2 cases in 2022. The recent cases were from Ashstead (Surrey) and Wokingham (Berkshire). - Mod.AS
