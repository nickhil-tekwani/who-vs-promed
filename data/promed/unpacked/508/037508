As of noon today [20 Jun 2016], there have been a total of:
1416 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
594 deaths [reported case fatality rate 41.9%],
790 recoveries, and
32 currently active cases [including 20 asymptomatic cases].

In the past 24 hours, there have been
3 newly confirmed cases [2 asymptomatic],
1 newly reported fatality,
0 newly reported recoveries.

Information on newly confirmed cases:
1- A 58-year-old Saudi male from Taif, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. Classified as a primary case, history of contact with camel currently under investigation.

2- A 31-year-old expat female from Riyadh, healthcare worker, currently asymptomatic. Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired infection in a healthcare worker.

3- A 34-year-old expat female from Riyadh, healthcare worker, currently asymptomatic. Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired infection in a healthcare worker.

Information on newly reported fatality:
- A 49-year-old Saudi female from Riyadh, non-healthcare worker with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 15 Jun 2016, at which time she was noted to be in critical condition. She was classified as a primary case but no history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. - Mod.MPP].

[Asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections in the healthcare environment in Riyadh continue to be confirmed. There are now 20 asymptomatic infections that have been identified related to an index case. Of these 20 asymptomatic cases, 13 are in healthcare workers, 4 are in household contacts and 3 are in patients admitted to the hospital for other medical reasons.

The one newly confirmed symptomatic case is a 58-year-old Saudi male from Taif. This is the 2nd primary case reported from Taif in the past few days (the preceding case was reported on 17 Jun 2016). Both cases were classified as primary cases with camel exposure under investigation at the time of confirmation. Taif is located in Makkah (Mecca) province, at an elevation of 6165 feet (1879 meters) and is considered the unofficial summer capital of Saudi Arabia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%27if). One can't help but wonder whether there may be a connection between the cases reported by Taif and the current outbreak in Riyadh.

The newly reported case is one of the 2 primary cases reported from Riyadh prior to the identification of the early asymptomatic infections and may well have been the index case in this outbreak. Again, trying to connect the transmission dots for cases that are classified as primary cases but do not have a history of known contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, this woman was from Buraidah City, where there had been nosocomial transmission of the MERS-CoV back in March 2016. The question that comes to mind is whether there may have been silent transmission ongoing.

Results of epidemiologic investigations into these cases would be of interest when available.
