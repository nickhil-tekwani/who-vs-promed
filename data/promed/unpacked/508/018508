For the 1st time since testing began several years ago, feral pigs in North Carolina have tested positive for _Brucella suis_, important and harmful bacteria that can be transmitted to domestic pigs and people.

The results surfaced in a North Carolina State University study conducted to test the state's feral pig populations for several types of bacteria and viruses. Researchers found that about 9 percent of feral pigs studied in Johnston County and less than one percent surveyed randomly at 13 other sites across the state showed exposure to _B. suis_.

Suzanne Kennedy-Stoskopf, a North Carolina State research professor of wildlife infectious diseases, says that testing positive for antibodies to _B. suis_ means the feral pigs have been exposed to and mounted an immune response against the bacteria. Antibodies do not eliminate _B. suis_ from pigs, so the animals are considered infected and capable of transmitting the bacteria to other pigs and people. The United States has long had a swine brucellosis control and eradication program, which by the late 1990s eliminated the disease from all commercial pig populations.

For the domestic swine herd, the risk is that the bacteria can spread beyond feral hogs and cause abortions in affected swine. Kennedy-Stoskopf says that _B.suis_ can be transmitted when pigs ingest infected tissue or fluids. Also, direct contact with infected pigs or ingestion of contaminated food and water could cause currently uninfected pig populations to become infected.

Biosecurity protocols in place to prevent herd exposure to other pathogens are important in preventing the spread of _B.suis_ into a domestic herd. "Spillover from infected feral pigs to commercial pigs is an economic and a public-health concern," Kennedy-Stoskopf said. "The biggest public-health risk is to pork processors and hunters who field dress feral pigs."

The study"s co-author, Chris DePerno, associate professor of forestry and environmental resources at North Carolina State, points out the bacteria are transmitted to humans by unsafe butchering and consumption of undercooked meat. "Now that exposure to _B. suis_ has been found in North Carolina's feral pig populations, people need to take care when hunting, butchering and cooking feral pigs," he said. "That means wearing gloves when field dressing feral pigs and cooking the meat to the proper temperature."

Kennedy-Stoskopf emphasizes that although cases of brucellosis are rare in the United States, people need to understand the clinical signs, which mimic the flu and feature intermittent fevers and persistent headaches. "Because clinical signs are so non-specific, it's important to tell your physician if you have had any exposure to feral swine carcasses and meat," she added.

Feral pig populations are exploding across the country, and are in nearly every state. Efforts to control them often meet with controversy. "Control of feral pig populations is difficult at best," DePerno says. "Research indicates that about 70 percent of the population will need to be removed each year to keep a wild population stable. Regarding feral pigs, hunting usually removes from 8-50 percent of a given wild population."

DePerno hopes that more research on how far feral pigs travel -- and increased scrutiny of hunters who move feral pigs from place to place -- will help keep feral populations from spreading.

The North Carolina State research is published in Journal of Wildlife Diseases.

The rapid growth of the feral swine population in the USA raises concern and entails health risks for humans, domestic animals and the whole ecosystem. _Brucella suis_ is a pathogen that can be transmitted to humans, and spillover into the domestic swine population can adversely impact profits. Enhancing feral swine control measures is crucial to avoiding the emergence or re-emergence of this and other infectious diseases in humans, domestic swine, and even native wildlife species.

[The human cases in Pennsylvania & South Carolina (reported in the 2009 ProMED archives below) were in people who had hunted feral swine in Florida in December 2007. Since then, the infection has moved north, and should be looked for in Virginia & Maryland. - Mod.JW]
