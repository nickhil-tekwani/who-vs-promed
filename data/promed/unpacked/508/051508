Researchers investigated 79 cases of pet-associated _Pasteurella multocida_ infection that occurred over a 30-month period and found that 34 were not associated with a bite from a dog or cat, the usual mode of transmission, according to findings presented at ASM Microbe.

Novel modes of transmission identified by the researchers included wound infection by pet saliva and sharing food with a dog.

"What prompted this was that [within the last year and a half] a man with diabetes was admitted with chills and shaking and high fever," Don Walter Kannangara, MD, PhD, DTM&H, MRCP, an infectious disease specialist at St Luke's University Health Network in Pennsylvania, told Infectious Disease News. "He had previous wound cultures with _Acinetobacter baumannii_ and various other organisms. He had been treated for that and that's what we thought was causing the infection, but the blood cultures grew _P. multocida_. Then he remembered that there was a tiny wound on his big toe that was licked by a dog."

In the following months, Kannangara saw 2 more cases of _P. multocida_ caused by non-bite transmission (NBT). Pet associated _P. multocida_ infections not transmitted through bites have resulted in life-threatening infections. "I got permission from the institutional review board to look for more. Our network has 10 hospitals and when we checked the electronic health care records for the previous 30 months, there were 79 cases," he said.

Kannangara and colleagues reviewed the charts of the 79 patients with culture-positive _P. multocida_, as well as previous _P. multocida_ studies. According to the findings, 63.1% of patients were aged 50 to 80 years. There were 45 infections associated with a bite -- 29 from cats and 16 from dogs -- and 34 cases that were not associated with a bite.

Among the NBT group, novel modes of transmission included:
- stepping on dog drool and contaminating a foot ulcer;
- contamination of a wound by socks covered with cat hairs and dander;
- falling down when drunk and contaminating abrasions with dog saliva; and
- epiglottitis after eating peanut butter and crackers that had been half-eaten by a dog.

The researchers reported that non-bite infections cause by _P. multocida_ were associated with more life-threatening infections. They said pet owners should protect open wounds, and individuals with certain underlying diseases should avoid pet exposure completely.

"When you get bitten, you know you were bitten. You can see the bite and usually they see a doctor, or clean the wound, or do something about it," Kannangara said. "But when the dog comes and licks your toe, they don't do anything about it so the infection can easily spread."

[_Pasteurella multocida_, a Gram-negative coccobacillus that resembles _Haemophilus influenzae_, is a commensal in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract of many livestock, poultry, and domestic pet species, especially cats and dogs. _P. multocida_ infection in humans is often associated with contact with animals, usually through animal bites, scratches, licks on skin abrasions, or contact with mucous secretions, but _P. multocida_ infection may occur even without a history of animal contact (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3958989/, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627630/pdf/9284394.pdf).

Although _P. multocida_ infection following animal bites is often confined to more superficial soft tissues, deeper soft tissue can also be affected, particularly following cat bites because of cat's small, sharp, deeply penetrating teeth. Non-bite animal contact in patients with _P. multocida_ infection has previously been reported to occur more commonly in patients with serious co-morbidities (such as, cirrhosis, malignancy, renal insufficiency, autoimmune disease, and diabetes), which have been associated with more severe forms of _P. multocida_ infection (such as, bacteremia, sepsis, meningitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, arthritis, osteomyelitis, and peritonitis) and higher case fatality rates than infections in patients with animal bite-associated infection (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4616664/). These findings are similar to those reported above.

St Luke's University Health Network (SLUHN) is a not-for-profit system affiliated with Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine; it includes 11 hospitals and over 300 outpatient sites that are located in 8 counties (Lehigh, Northampton, Berks, Bucks, Carbon, Montgomery, Monroe, and Schuylkill counties) in the US state of Pennsylvania and 2 counties (Warren and Hunterdon counties) in the US state of New Jersey. The 11 hospitals include: St Luke's University Hospital (city of Bethlehem); St Luke's Allentown Campus; St Luke's Anderson Campus (Bethlehem Township); St Luke's Miners Campus (Coaldale); St Luke's Monroe Campus (Stroudsburg); St Luke's Quakertown Campus; St Luke's Warren Campus; St Luke's Palmerton Campus; St Luke's Gnaden Huetten Campus; St Luke's Sacred Heart Campus; and Geisinger St Luke's Hospital Campus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Luke%27s_University_Health_Network ). - Mod.ML

It would be interesting to note which serotype(s) of the causative agent were identified in the patients and in the corresponding animals. _P. multocida_ resides mostly as a commensal in the nasopharynx of animals; however some serotypes may present high pathogenicity, selectively in different animal species. For example, the Asian serotype B:2 and the African serotype E:2 (Carter and Heddleston system), corresponding to 6:B and 6:E (Namioka-carter system), are mainly responsible for Hemorrhagic Septicaemia, a fatal, OIE-listed disease in cattle and water-buffaloes in some areas of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and southern Europe. Confirmation requires the isolation and characterisation of the pathogen using conventional and molecular techniques. Notably, there are no confirmed reports of human infections with _P. multocida_ B2 and E2; however, other serotypes do cause human infections and precautions should be taken to avoid exposure. - Mod.AS
