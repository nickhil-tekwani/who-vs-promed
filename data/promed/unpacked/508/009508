A disease that causes strange malformations is showing up in greater
concentrations in this year's [2007] canola crop. The disease is
called "aster yellows," and it is caused by something called a
phytoplasma. Penny Pearse, the Provincial Plant Disease Specialist
with Saskatchewan Agriculture and Food, says, for the past 6 years,
the incidence of aster yellows has been at trace levels of less than
one percent, but the number will be much higher this year, with some
crops experiencing up to 10 percent infection.

"We have received more reports of aster yellows in canola from both
growers and agronomists, and it appears to be quite wide-spread
across the province," she noted. "What makes this disease look so
unique is that it causes malformations in the plant, so the plants
are often taller, discoloured, and have malformed pods and flowers.
The infection may look worse than it actually is, since the symptoms
are so dramatic, so we recommend that growers do a count of infected
and healthy plants to determine the actual incidence value."

Pearse says the phytoplasma causes the disease, but it needs a
helping hand. "A phytoplasma will not survive on its own, so it gets
transferred from plant to plant by an insect vector. In this case,
the most common vector is the aster leafhopper," she stated. "When an
insect feeds on an infected plant, it will pick up this pathogen and
transfer it to healthy plants. So, in a year when we have more
leafhoppers, we tend to see more aster yellows."

The damage done by aster yellows is complete and irreversible, with
the yield loss dependent on the number of plants affected. "Most of
the diseases we have in Saskatchewan are caused by fungi, which can
be controlled through the use of a fungicide. Whereas something like
aster yellows, once it is in the plant, there is nothing you can
do... the damage is done," Pearse said.

"We don't know a lot about this disease," she said. "Leafhoppers have
been found to overwinter in Saskatchewan and can keep the phytoplasma
alive from one season to the next. In addition, some of the perennial
crops that we grow here -- meaning crops with root systems that
overwinter -- offer a way for the pathogen to over-winter. Crops like
echinacea and caraway are also at risk," Pearse stated.

A survey of canola fields was conducted this summer [2007] to look at
aster yellows and other canola diseases. Aster yellows was present in
all surveyed fields, ranging from trace levels to as high as 15
percent infection. The overall average infection level in 2007 is
approximately 2 percent, which is similar to 2000's levels. It is
likely that this summer's heat amplified the aster yellows symptoms.
In addition, the phytoplasma multiplies more quickly in the plant
under hot conditions.

[Phytoplasmas are bacteria living as intracellular parasites of
plants. They are members of the group of mycoplasma-like organisms
(MLOs), which cannot be cultured in vitro. There are still
uncertainties in phytoplasma taxonomy reflected in the genus name
_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma. _C._ P. asteris, a novel phytoplasma taxon,
has been associated with aster yellows and related diseases.

Aster yellows can infect over 300 host species including a wide
variety of crops such as canola, lucerne, flax, sunflower, echinacea,
caraway, coriander, lettuce, carrots, beets, onions, pea, ornamental
plants, weeds and, to a lesser extent, cereals. Symptoms on canola
are stunted growth, malformed flowers, and distorted pods. Infected
plants typically do not produce seed. Flowers are replaced by
sterile, green leaf-like structures ('phyllody'), and pods are
replaced by round or oval blue-green hollow, flattened structures.

Aster yellows can overwinter in the living crowns of perennial crops
and weeds. It can be transmitted by grafting, but not in soil, or by
seed. The primary vector is the aster leafhopper (_Macrosteles
quadrilineatus_). After acquiring the pathogen, insects remain
infective for life.

The pathogen is often found at very low levels of less than one
percent, however a higher incidence may have a significant impact on
yield. The pathogen level can increase under favourable conditions
(for example high rainfall) resulting in an outbreak with serious
crop losses. Disease management in field crops may include vector
control and removal of weed reservoir species. No canola varieties
with resistance to aster yellows are available.
