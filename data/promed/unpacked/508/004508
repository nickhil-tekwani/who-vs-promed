The Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Cambodia is conducting active investigation into the cause of a recent undiagnosed syndrome that has caused illness and deaths among children in the country.

Preliminary findings of the investigation identified a total of 74 cases who were hospitalised from April to 5 Jul 2012. Of these, 57 cases (including 56 deaths), presented a common syndrome of fever, respiratory, and neurological signs, which is now the focus of the investigation.

The majority of the identified cases to date were under 3 years old. Most of them were from the southern and central parts of the country and received treatment at Kantha Bopha Children's hospital, which is a reference paediatric hospital. Despite all efforts, many of the children died within 24 hours of admission.

Available samples have been tested at the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia. Although a causative agent remains to be formally identified, all these samples were found negative for H5N1 and other influenza viruses, SARS, and Nipah [virus].

The Ministry of Health was 1st alerted to this by Kantha Bopha Children's Hospital in Phnom Penh, where the majority of the cases were hospitalised.

The Ministry of Health notified WHO about this event through the IHR [International Health Regulations] notification mechanism as it met the criteria for notification of any event where the underlying agent or disease or mode of transmission is not formally identified.

WHO and partners are assisting the Ministry of Health with this event which focuses on hospitalised cases, early warning surveillance data, laboratory data, and field investigations.

While this event is being actively investigated, the government is also looking at other diseases occurring in the country, including dengue, hand, foot and mouth disease, and chikungunya [virus infections].

Parents have been advised to take their children to hospital if they identify any signs of unusual illness. The government is also reinforcing awareness of good hygiene practices to the public, which includes frequent washing of hands.

[It is interesting to note that H5N1 and other influenza viruses, SARS, and Nipah virus infections have been ruled out as the etiological agent involved in these cases. This WHO report makes no mention of testing for Japanese encephalitis virus or Banna virus infections. As mentioned in the moderator comment in the initial report (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120704.1190037), Banna virus (a Seadornavirus in the Reovirus family) has caused cases of human encephalitis in China and the virus has been isolated from _Culex_ mosquitoes in Viet Nam and Indonesia, hence likely occurs in Cambodia as well. One hopes that appropriate samples from these cases are being sent to a WHO reference laboratory for diagnosis. Severe pulmonary disease is not reported in the earlier reports in the published literature of Banna virus infection, however. ProMED-mail awaits further reports of this outbreak with interest. - Mod.TY
