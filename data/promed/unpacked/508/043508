[CCHF is endemic in some countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region of WHO including Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and Oman. Generally cases are reported between May and November in most countries with surges around Eid-ul-Adha resulting from the mass movement and handling of sacrificial animals during the celebrations. Overall, in 2022 a total of 115 suspected and 34 confirmed cases have been reported from 22 provinces. - Mod.UBA]

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever cases have been detected in Kazakhstan. 33 cases have been registered. Four people have died.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever usually transmitted by ticks. It can also be contracted through contact with viraemic animal tissues during and immediately post-slaughter of animals. CCHF has a high case fatality ratio (10-40%), potentially results in hospital and health facility outbreaks, and is difficult to prevent and treat. CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and in Asia.

Kyrgyzstan has not registered Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever cases, the Disease Prevention, Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance Department said.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tickborne acute febrile viral illness characterized by haemorrhagic manifestations. The disease is associated with a case fatality rate (CFR) ranging between 10% and 40%. Hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. Human-to-human transmission generally results from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

In 2019, ProMED first reported a case of CCHF infection in Kyrgyzstan, imported to Kazakhstan. In 2020, no cases of CCHF were registered in this country (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221011930).

The high-risk groups for contracting CCHF include animal herders, livestock workers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Health care workers are also at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids while caring for patients. There is no vaccine available either for humans or animals.

Preventive measures are crucial to limit morbidity and mortality. The use of protective gear should be promoted for animal handlers while dealing with infected animals and healthcare workers while dealing with suspected cases. Community awareness and risk communication through sessions, and electronic and print media are important to prevent the virus/infection spread, together with implementing infection prevention and control measures by healthcare facilities managing CCHF cases. - Mod.UBA
