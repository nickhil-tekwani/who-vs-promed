Four elderly people from a retirement home in Lugo [Galicia] remain in the Lucus Augusti hospital (HULA) in the provincial capital [Lugo], affected by legionellosis; one of them is in a serious condition.

According to sources from the Xunta [government of Galicia], the 1st case was detected earlier this month [November 2014], and consequently disease research and control protocols were initiated. Investigators determined that the outbreak of legionellosis originated in a water circuit in the As Gandaras retirement home in Lugo, where the 4 affected people live.

The Department of Health has started to disinfect the area in order to control the spread of the disease.

[This outbreak of legionellosis presumably involves legionnaires' disease, the more serious, pneumonic form of legionellosis, rather than Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form of legionellosis.

People with weakened immune systems, the elderly, and smokers are particularly at risk for severe disease. Inhalation of infectious aerosols of _Legionella_ species generated from legionella-contaminated water is commonly thought to be the mode of transmission of legionnaires' disease. However, aspiration of legionella-contaminated tap water may be the source for legionella pneumonia in elderly people, who are prone to aspirate (http://legionella.org/media/14950/cab.pdf). Aspiration may also be the mode of transmission in neonates born in legionella-contaminated birthing pools (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/alert-after-legionnaires-disease-case-in-baby).

For a discussion of legionnaires' disease, see my comments in ProMED-mail posts Legionellosis - Spain: (CT) 20130901.1916014 and Legionellosis - Portugal: (LI) fatal 20141109.2941607.

Lugo, with a population of 99 241 in 2013, is capital of the province of Lugo in north western Spain in the autonomous community of Galicia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugo). Lugo is the only city in the world to be surrounded by completely intact Roman walls, with 71 towers and 10 gates. - Mod.ML
