The health secretary of Araucania Region in Chile, reported that a
case of a bat positive for rabies virus had just been confirmed by the
Public Health Institute.

The animal was captured by the owner of a house in Padre Las Casas
community, and later it was transported by local policemen to the
Zoonoses and Vector unit of the Regional Health Ministry Office, which
finally sent the bat to the Public Health Institute for special
studies to be performed.

Having learned of the occurrence, local health authorities in
Araucania Region defined a surrounding area in order to immunize every
cat and dog in the neighborhood as a preventive measure, declared Dr
Waldo Armstrong, head of the Sanitary Action Department.

Personnel from the local Health Region together with personnel from
the Environmental Health Program of Padre Las Casas Municipality will
immunize pets. Personalized educational activities will be performed
for people living in the aforementioned area, emphasizing rabies
prevention, declared Dr Armstrong.

The following recommendations have been issued for the population:
If you see a bat during daytime, flitting around, flying with no
defined direction, or hitting the walls, or just walking around, do
not try to catch the animal and call the nearest health center or your
local municipality.

If you find your pet playing or biting a bat, take your pet to the
veterinary office as soon as possible and report the occurrence to
local health authorities. If you are bitten by any animal, thoroughly
wash the wound with water and soap and get to the nearest health
center as soon as possible so preventive therapy may be started.

in Spanish).
English summary: "A retrospective epidemiological study about
epidemiology of rabies in Chile between years 1989 and 2005 was done.
A database of 39 793 national registries of rabies samples was
analyzed by means of statistical packages. Out of 39 793 analyzed
cases, 719 bats, 7 dogs, 7 cats, 1 bovine, and 1 human were positive
to rabies throughout the 17 years of this study. The statistical
analysis established a significant increase in the proportions of
positivity in bats, with predominance of variant 4 between the
reservoirs. Given the complexity of the wild cycle of the rabies in
Chile, it is necessary to maintain a program control of rabies,
directed to educate people for a responsible possession of domestic
animals, due to the risk of rabies transmission from bat to the
susceptible species." - Mod JG

Not included in the English summary of the reference above, (trans. &
summ. Mod.TY): Of the 17 081 bats tested, the species _Tadarida
brasiliensis_ had the most (rabies) positive individuals (672
individuals) in comparison with other bat species including _Histiotus
macrotus_ (13), _Lasiurus sp._ (27), and _Myotis chiloensis_ (7).

Normally, ProMED-mail would not report the occurrence of a single
rabies-infected bat in the Americas, since rabies in bats
(insectivorous bats throughout the Americas, vampire bats in the
American tropics and subtropics) occurs in every country there.
However, reports of rabies in Chile have been very infrequent, and
this report is a good reminder that rabies in bats is widely
distributed geographically, and the current observations may be of
interest to ProMED subscribers. The species of bat reported above is
not specified. However, the reference above suggests that the bat was
most likely an insectivorous species.
