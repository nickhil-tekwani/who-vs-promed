Brucellosis, an infectious disease that occurs in humans through contact with animals, has been listed in Taiwan as a notifiable communicable disease, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on Tue 7 Feb 2012. Brucellosis has been put on CDC's list of 60-plus transmittable diseases that must be reported in order to lower the risk of its spread, said Chou Jih-haw, its deputy director-general.

Taiwan had been free of brucellosis for 3 decades, but there were 5 imported cases last year between May and October 2011, Chou said, explaining why CDC has taken the decision to list brucellosis as a notifiable disease. The 5 confirmed cases were Taiwan nationals who had contracted the disease during overseas travel, one in North Africa, 3 in Malaysia, and the 5th in China, Chou said.

He urged doctors to be vigilant in checking patients for symptoms of the disease, which include fever, abdominal pain, excessive sweating, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, fatigue and depression. Brucellosis is caused by a bacteria that can infect cattle, goats, camels, dogs and pigs. The bacteria can spread to humans if they come in contact with infected meat or the placenta of infected animals, or if they eat or drink unpasteurized milk or cheese.

People visiting countries at risk, those in Africa, the Middle East, and South East Asia, should avoid close contact with animals and should not consume raw meat, unpasteurized milk, or cheese during their trip, CDC advised.
