The Prime Minister Dr. Pierre Damien Habumuremyi has directed immediate action against livestock diseases following an assessment that revealed the presence of a foot and mouth disease [FMD] outbreak in Eastern province.

FMD is affecting different programs, especially "One-Cow-per Poor Family."

Eastern province has been plagued by livestock diseases, which essentially affect milk production and cause meat scarcity. The premier has asked for an immediate solution to the existing problem.

[The following comment is copied verbatim from the previous report on FMD in the same province, published 15 Nov 2012:

"The FMD epizootic in Rwanda's Eastern Province was reported earlier this year [2012] (see ProMED-mail post 20120625.1179577). It was suspected to have been introduced from neighbouring Uganda.

According to the Rwanda page of the WRLFMD, FMDV-O was reported in Rwanda in 1960, 1998, and 2004; FMDV-SAT2 was recorded in 1992, 1996-1997, 2000-2001, and 2004. According to the site, FMDV-A has never been reported in Rwanda (see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/rwa.htm).

An official confirmation of the epizootic, details on the FMD virus serotype involved and on the vaccine strains applied are anticipated."

No response has been obtained so far; the above questions are thus repeated. - Mod.AS
