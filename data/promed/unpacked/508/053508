In a follow-up on the norovirus outbreak linked to 2 El Toro Restaurants in the Tacoma, [Washington] area, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department has identified new cases of norovirus, bringing the total number from the outbreak to 434. The Tacoma location, 5716 N 26th St, has 423 cases. The restaurant in University Place, 3820 Bridgeport Way W, has 11. Both restaurants closed for a thorough cleaning and sanitizing, a Health Department requirement for outbreaks like this. They have since reopened. Reports from people who say they got sick after dining at the restaurants have slowed down.

"Norovirus is highly contagious and is more common in cold weather months," said Katie Lott, food and community safety program manager. "The best thing people can do to protect themselves and keep the virus from spreading is wash their hands frequently and stay home when they're sick," she said.

The outbreak started at the restaurant in Tacoma's Westgate neighborhood. The Health Department closed the restaurant 8 Jan 2018 after receiving the 1st reports of illness. The Department worked with the restaurant to ensure it was thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before it reopened 9 Jan 2018. On 11 Jan 2018, the Department received confirmation from the state's Public Health Laboratories that a customer who ate at the Tacoma restaurant during the onset period tested positive for norovirus. On 10 Jan 2018, the Health Department received illness reports from diners who ate at the El Toro Restaurant in University Place. The restaurant followed the same protocol and closed for cleaning and sanitizing. It reopened on 11 Jan 2018. 2 staff members at the Tacoma location worked while ill during the time customers dined and later got sick. It is still unclear if the outbreaks at the 2 locations are connected.

"Because of the nature of norovirus outbreaks, we may never know the exact affected items that caused illness," Lott said. "All the cases have dining at the El Toro Restaurants in common," she said.

[It should be noted that the prototypic norovirus, Norwalk virus, was originally isolated in Norwalk, Ohio, obviously the state where an outbreak popped up at the Republican National Convention in 2016. Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler, winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. This may be because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season, but may also be associated with the birth rate. Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks. New norovirus strains emerge about every 2 to 4 years. Often, but not always, these new strains lead to an increase in outbreaks worldwide. - Mod.LL
