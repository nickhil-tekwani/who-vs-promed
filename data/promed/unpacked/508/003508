Austrian woman reports otter attack in Wisconsin
------------------------------------------------
An Austrian woman on vacation in Wisconsin is getting rabies shots after
she said she was bitten by otters while swimming in a lake. The 51 year old
woman told the Duluth News Tribune that she was swimming on Lake Owen near
Drummond last Wednesday [3 Aug 2009] when 3 otters suddenly appeared.
Feeling concerned, she swam to shore. Just as she got there, she said,
"there they were -- one on the right leg and one on the left leg." She said
they swam off when she shook her legs, but not before biting her 8 or 9
times. Although the victim says the bites didn't hurt much, she did go to a
hospital, where doctors started a series of rabies shots.

The visitor lives in Altach, Austria. Her husband is from Duluth
[Minnesota], and they visit Lake Owen each summer.

[Otters, like the majority of mammals, are susceptible to rabies virus
infection, but attacks on humans are rare although not unknown. The
ProMED-mail archive records attacks on humans in Florida and Vermont in
recent years (see below).

Wisconsin in the north-central part of the US can be located on the
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/r/00Gb>.
Lake Owen, a popular tourist area, near Drummond, Wisconsin, can be located
in the map of the area at
<http://www.city-data.com/city/Drummond-Wisconsin.html> (click on the 'MSN
Map' tab).

Visitors to Lake Owen should be made aware of the hazard [though it should
be noted that the infectious status of the otter(s) remain(s) unconfirmed.
