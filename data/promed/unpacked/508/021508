[We'd like to thank Dr. Leopold Blanc based in the WHO Regional office in
Manila for the following message. - YS]
I am a little surprised about the statement that an epidemic of leprosy is
feared in Bougainville. Leprosy, unlike measles and influenza, is a chronic
disease with a very long incubation period (most commonly 2 to 5 years but
can be 20 years) and is acquired through prolonged exposure and only a
small proportion of the population develops the disease.
It is therefore exceptional that an epidemic [may have] occurred (epidemic
in that case should be defined as an unexpected high number of new or
recent cases in a defined area or population). What has probably happened
in Bougainville is that because of security problems, many new cases did
not seek care and accumulated over years. As a result many cases have to
be treated today. If it is the case it is not an outbreak (or an epidemic)
but rather an accumulation of cases from previous years seeking care today
because security is restored. Another possibility is that cured leprosy
patients have been diagnosed as leprosy cases because they have
disabilities.
As a reminder, leprosy is due to _Mycobacterium leprae_, a bacterium which
is killed by antibiotics. The bacteria develop in skin and nerves. When the
bacteria multiply for a long time in the nerve (peroneal or ulnar for
example), this one is damaged and paralysis and loss of sensation in feet
or hands appear. When the nerve is damaged, there is very little chance
that it recovers, thus paralysis and loss of sensation with all the
complications will persist after the bacteria have been killed. This is why
a leprosy patient can be cured but can still show disabilities and is still
considered by many as a "leper". Treatment of leprosy is now extremely
effective, curing cases with less than one relapse per 100 patient years
after 9 years of follow-up. Very few treatments or preventions can give
such a high performance. The treatment regimen used is a combination of
Rifampicin+Dapsone+Clofazimin for the most infectious cases (multibacillary
or MB) and Rifampicin+Dapsone for the less infectious ones (paucibacillary
or PB). Treatments are standard using a blister pack for 28 days, with one
dose supervised by the health worker and the remaining daily dose
self-administered by the patient. Duration of treatment is 6 months for PB
cases and 12 to 24 months for MB cases. Recently (June 1997) the 7th WHO
expert committee on leprosy has recommended the use of single
Rifampicin+Ofloxacin+Minocycline dose for patients showing only one lesion
diagnosed as leprosy (single lesion leprosy). BCG vaccination is providing
a good protection against leprosy. Several studies indicate a 50%
protection. Results of different studies are fairly consistent.
In conclusion, it is important that more information be collected from
Bougainville on the number and type of cases detected and the size of the
population they are living in. It would be useful to have a sample of the
reported cases being reassessed by health worker or doctor experienced in
Leprosy diagnosis to assess validity of data. There is definitely no risk
for the disease to spread unless a very large number of untreated
infectious patients moved to live many years in areas previously free of
leprosy.
