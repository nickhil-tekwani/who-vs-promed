A 14-year-old teenager has died from rabies. The death occurred last
Thursday [7 Feb 2008] and is the 1st case reported this year [2008]
in Ceara. The Secretary of Health of the state [Ceara] stated that
the youth arrived for medical care at the Sao Jose Hospital, which
specializes in contagious-infectious diseases, and is located in
Fortaleza. He had been bitten by a tamarin (soim - sagui), in his
house in the Pedra Branca district in Camocim (West Coast).

Professionals from the organization [state health department]
admitted that this would be the 1st case of the disease reported this
year [2008] in Brazil. A final diagnosis is awaited, but all of the
symptoms are pointing to rabies. The Secretary of Health considers
this serious because vaccination campaigns do not include this animal
as a transmitter because it is wild and therefore, not [present] in
urban areas [where vaccination is recommended.]

Rabies is usually contracted by humans by contact with wild or
domestic carnivores, or from bats. But many animals are susceptible
to infection by rabies virus although they rarely transmit the virus
to other animals. The transmission of rabies to man from wild
primates is unusual and alarming as it is indicative of an animal
reservoir, which will be relatively difficult to control or eliminate
by conventional vaccination programmes. The fate of the tamarin and
the origin if its infection are unknown. If the virus has been
isolated, genome sequencing may give a clue to the origin of the virus.

The tamarins are any of the squirrel-sized New World monkeys from the
family _Cebidae_, classified as the genus _Saguinus_. Tamarin
habitats range from southern Central America (Costa Rica) through
middle South America (Amazon basin and north Bolivia, however not in
the mountainous parts). The various species of tamarins differ
considerably according to their appearance, ranging from nearly all
black through mixtures of black, brown, and white. Many species
typically have mustache-like facial hairs. Their body size ranges
from 18 to 30 cm (7-12 in) -- plus a 25 to 44 cm long tail (10-17 in)
-- and they weigh from 220 to 900 grams (0.5-2 lb). Tamarins differ
from marmosets primarily in the fact that the lower canine teeth are
clearly longer than the incisors.

Tamarins are inhabitants of tropical rain forests and open forest
areas. They are diurnal and arboreal, and run and jump quickly
through the trees. Tamarins live together in groups of up to 40
members consisting of one or more families. More frequently, though,
groups are composed of just 3 to 9 members. Tamarins are omnivores,
eating fruits and other plant parts as well as spiders, insects,
small vertebrates and bird eggs. Gestation is typically 140 days, and
births are normally twins. The father primarily cares for the young,
bringing them to their mother to nurse. After approximately one month
the young begin to eat solid food, although they aren't fully weaned
for another 2 to 3 months. They reach full maturity in their 2nd year
and may live to the age of 18. Further information and a photograph
