Pythium sp. infecting hydroponically grown lettuce in South Africa. N
Labuschagne, C Gull, FC Wehner, Department of Microbiology and Plant
Pathology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa; WJ Botha,
Agricultural Research Council, Plant Protection Research Institute,
Pretoria, South Africa. Plant Dis 2002; 86: 1175, published online as
D-2002-0812-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication 2 Aug 2002.
Root rot and wilting of lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_ L. var. _capitata_ L.)
commonly occur in hydroponic systems in South Africa. Plants showing
stunted growth, wilt, and root rot were collected at 2 commercial
hydroponic systems in Gauteng Province, and root segments were plated on a
_Pythium_- selective medium (1). _P. irregulare_ (Pi) and 3 species groups
without oogonia (F, HS, and T) were identified (2). _Pythium_ groups F, HS,
and T, and Pi were represented by 63, 6, 5, and 26 per cent of the
isolates, respectively.
Koch's postulates were confirmed in 2 greenhouse experiments by inoculating
4 week old lettuce cv. Lutetia seedlings grown in aerated nutrient solution
at 21 degrees Celsius. Two V8 juice agar cultures of an isolate of each
species or species group were blended in 500 mL of sterile water, and 166
mL of suspension was added to the nutrient solution in each of 3 5-liter
receptacles containing 4 lettuce seedlings. Control plants received sterile
V8 juice agar suspension.
After 4 weeks, all _Pythium_ isolates caused root rot and reduced fresh
plant weight significantly, although no wilting occurred. Symptoms were
more severe with Pi and _Pythium_ group HS than with groups F and T.
Compared with the control, Pi reduced fresh root and shoot weight of plants
by 51 and 38 per cent, _Pythium_ group HS by 41 and 33 per cent, _Pythium_
group T by 29 and 26 per cent, and _Pythium_ group F by 30 and 24 per cent,
respectively.

[Pythium species are involved in damping-off and root rot in many plant
species. In addition to Pi, other significant pathogens are _P. ultimum_
and _P. aphanidermatum_. The fresh weight losses in roots and shoots in
this disease report are significant, and are a good example of the kind of
crop damage that these pathogens can induce in infected plants. A useful
