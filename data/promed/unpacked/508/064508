Thailand: suspected human case of avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
Health authorities are monitoring a patient suspected of having
contracted avian influenza in Phitsanulok to see whether this is the
1st human case of the year [2005] after the re-emergence of the virus
among chickens.
Tawatchai Kamoltham, Phitsanulok provincial public health chief, said
yesterday [Tue 8 Feb 2005] that a 7-year-old boy had been treated at
Phra Buddha Chinarat Hospital since Monday [7 Feb 2005] for high
fever and infected lungs. The boy was reported to have touched dead
chickens in his village. A preliminary medical examination found the
boy had contracted influenza A virus infection, but the results of a
lab test to see whether he had contracted [H5N1 avian influenza
virus] would be known later in the week, he said. 5 people have been
put on the Public Health Ministry's list of suspected avian influenza
cases since 1 Jan 2005, but none have been [confirmed by laboratory
tests].
Dr. Tawatchai said the boy, a resident of tambon Matoom, Phrom Phiram
district, fell ill after touching dead chickens in a neighborhood
area last Saturday [5 Feb 2005]. He was sent to the hospital a day
later suffering from a high fever. He was treated for the fever and
quarantined in the hospital's infection-control room, while doctors
awaited the results of lab tests.
4 provinces -- Rayong, Nakhon Pathom, Phetchabun and Phitsanulok --
have been put under close surveillance due to the outbreak among
chickens earlier this year [2005]. Avian influenza became endemic in
Phitsanulok last year. The provincial public health chief said
epidemiologists and livestock officials were heading to the district
to check on the spread of the virus. Thousands of volunteers have
gone door to door in villages to warn people of the risk of another
outbreak and [the need to] protect themselves with rubber gloves and
masks before touching fowl. The authorities had to conduct the strict
surveillance to ensure the virus would not be transmitted to humans
after the recent outbreak in Viet Nam, he said.
Meanwhile, avian influenza has also been confirmed in Suphan Buri and
Phichit, said Dr. Nirundorn Aungtragoolsuk, director of the Livestock
Development Department's Bureau of Disease Control and Veterinary
Services. In Suphan Buri, avian influenza was confirmed in chickens
in Song Phi Nong and Muang districts. In Phichit, it was confirmed in
the Sak Lek subdistrict, while in Phitsanulok, it was confirmed in
the districts of Bang Krathum, Phrom Phiram, Wang Thong, and Wat Bot.
Dr. Nirundorn suspected that officials in Phitsanulok may have
relaxed control measures by not culling all chickens suspected of
having avian influenza.
