Since November 2007, an increase in the number of reported hepatitis
A cases has been observed in Latvia. The aim of this report is to
provide an update on the descriptive epidemiology of hepatitis A in
Latvia and suggest some possible explanations of the recent increase
in incidence.

Methods
-------
Hepatitis A is a disease under mandatory notification in Latvia.
Cases of hepatitis A are notified by health care practitioners
including general practitioners and clinicians working in hospitals
as well as by laboratories. A probable case is defined as any person
with a discrete onset of symptoms (e.g. fatigue, abdominal pain, loss
of appetite, intermittent nausea and vomiting) and at least one of
the following 3: fever, jaundice, elevated serum aminotransferase
levels, and with an epidemiological link with a confirmed case. A
confirmed case is defined as any person meeting the clinical and the
laboratory criteria: detection of IgM antibodies against hepatitis A
virus (IgM anti-HAV positive). The case definitions used are based on
the European Union case definitions [1].

All notified hepatitis A cases are subject to epidemiological
investigation. Epidemiologists of local branches of the Latvian
Public Health Agency (PHA) interview patients or their relatives and
visit places of work or study of the patients (kindergartens,
schools, food enterprises, etc.) to collect epidemiological
information and organise control measures. Epidemiologists also
perform investigation in any other place if 2 or more hepatitis A
cases are epidemiologically linked to it.

Results
------
From 1990 to 2007, the incidence of hepatitis A in Latvia had been
declining (illustrated by a figure in the original text). The last
community wide outbreak of hepatitis A in Latvia was registered in
1988-1990 with almost 20 000 cases reported during 3 years. Since
then, the number of hepatitis A cases steadily declined over the next
8 years and remained at a very low level between 2000 and 2007 (mean
87, range 15-237). The decrease of incidence of hepatitis A can be
explained primarily by the overall improvement in hygiene.

In 2007, only 15 cases were registered (22 cases according to the
date of onset); 8 of them imported. However, since October 2007, an
increase in hepatitis A cases has been observed. Between 1 Jan and 24
Sep 2008, a total of 759 confirmed cases of hepatitis A have been
notified in Latvia. Additionally, 5 cases were exported to Estonia,
one to Lithuania, one to Germany and one to Denmark.

The incidence of hepatitis A increased especially intensely at the
end of August through beginning of September 2008 and continues to
grow. Just on 24 Sep 2008 alone, 285 suspected cases of hepatitis A
were under investigation. Of the 759 confirmed cases reported in
2008, 706 (93 percent) were treated in hospitals; 5 cases were
fatal, all in women (age range 25-45 years, average 35). All fatal
cases occurred in patients with underlying diseases.

The highest incidence of hepatitis A was observed in the age group
18-29 years. During the 1st 7 months of 2008, the majority of
hepatitis A cases occurred in males (65 percent of all cases), while
in August 2008 the numbers of cases among males and females were
equal. Among 639 confirmed cases in adults, 287 (45 percent) were in
patients who were unemployed or pensioners.

The majority of the cases reported in 2008 were registered in the
capital city of Riga (598 cases) and in the Riga region (73 cases).
Since December 2007, 108 cases of hepatitis A were registered among
intravenous drug users (IDUs). From December 2007 till March 2008,
IDUs constituted about 1/3rd of all hepatitis A cases; however, a
decrease in the proportion of hepatitis A cases among IDUs has been
observed in recent months because of the overall increase of cases.

In April 2008, an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with a
restaurant in Riga was reported involving 47 cases [1]. An analysis
of 420 cases of hepatitis A registered in Riga during the 1st 8
months of 2008 yielded the following results: 11 cases were connected
to schools (2 clusters with 4 and 7 cases, respectively); at least 47
cases were linked to the restaurant outbreak [2]; one cluster with 9
cases was registered in prison; at least 93 cases were linked to
households in the community, including 26 clusters with 2 cases, 5
clusters with 3 cases, 4 clusters with 4 cases, and 2 clusters with 5
cases. In the remaining 260 cases, no clear epidemiological link
could be established.

No epidemiological links were identified between different
clusters/outbreaks either, but there were secondary cases, including
family members of IDUs. Genotyping has not been performed yet but is
planned.

Discussion and conclusion
--------------------------
The following possible causes for the ongoing community-wide outbreak
of hepatitis A cases in Latvia in 2008 have been suggested:
- a large number of susceptible individuals (young people) as a
result of rapidly decreased exposure to hepatitis A virus;
- the initial spread of hepatitis A virus among IDUs: during the 1st
4 months of the outbreak, up to 35 percent of cases occurred in drug
users;
- a large outbreak (at least 47 cases with clinical forms of
hepatitis A) associated with a restaurant;
- a considerable proportion of unemployed persons among adult cases
(45 percent), implying low income and possibly bad living conditions;
clusters of cases registered in dwelling-places of low-income
inhabitants (apartment houses).

To sum up, the most likely reason for the large and still increasing
number of hepatitis A cases in Latvia in 2007 [2008?] is the
increased susceptibility of the population, especially among young
people, and the increased virus circulation in the community, which,
because of different routes of transmission, led to community-wide
spread of infection and outbreaks in different groups.

Control measures and recommendations
------------------------------------
In Latvia, vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended but not
refunded within the public health system. Immunoglobulin as
post-exposure prophylaxis has not been used for many years. To
prevent further spread of infection, control measures are put in
place in institutions at risk: educational establishments, food
enterprises, social care institutions, etc.

Information on preventive measures against hepatitis A is regularly
disseminated via the mass media. Recommendations for inhabitants,
food handlers, and staff of educational establishments have been
prepared, distributed and also are available on the PHA website
<http://www.sva.gov.lv>.

Communication with school boards, Health Inspectorate, Food and
Veterinary Service and other services is taking place to disseminate
information and recommendations on prevention of hepatitis A.
Seminars on hepatitis A prevention for healthcare workers including
medical staff of educational establishments were organised.
Additional control measures such as medical observation and
quarantine are implemented in places at risk, including child
groups in kindergartens or school classes where hepatitis A cases
were registered.

It is important to further strengthen prevention through
communication with the public and to continue surveillance and
control measures as well as to perform genotyping of HAV isolates.
Exchange of information on the international level is also necessary.
To date, 8 cases of hepatitis A linked to Latvia have been registered
in other European countries. We, therefore, consider that there
exists a risk for international spread, especially among travelers
with risk behavior.

[Update of the situation as of 2 Oct 2008: Since 24 Sep 2008
(analyzed in the article), the number of confirmed cases of hepatitis
A has increased by 257, reaching a total of 1016 confirmed cases. A
further 265 suspected cases are under investigation. - Mod.CP]

[The epidemiology of the hepatitis A outbreak in Latvia has many
features in common with the contemporaneous outbreak in the Czech
Republic (see references below), although there has been no
established linkage. As noted in the article: "However, to date, 8
cases of hepatitis A linked to Latvia have been registered in other
European countries. The authors consider, therefore, that there
exists a risk for international spread, especially among travelers
with risk behavior."
