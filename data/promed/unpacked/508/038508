WHO: EVD Response Roadmap Update 22 Sep 2014
---------------------------------------------------
An overview of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where a separate, unrelated outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) is occurring, is also provided (see Annex 1).

1. Countries with widespread and intense transmission
5843 (probable, confirmed and suspected; see Annex 2) cases and 2803 deaths have been reported in the current outbreak of EVD as of 20 Sep 2014 by the Ministry of Health of Guinea, as of 17 Sep 2014 by the Ministry of Health of Liberia, and as of 19 Sep 2014 by the Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone (table 1).

Table 1: Cases of Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone
Country
Case definition / Cases / Deaths

Guinea
Confirmed 818 / 465
Probable 162 / 162
Suspected 28 / 5
All 1008 / 632

Liberia
Confirmed 863 / 670
Probable 1342 / 544
Suspected 817 / 364
All 3022 / 1578

Sierra Leone
Confirmed 1640 / 545
Probable 37 / 37
Suspected 136 / 11
All 1813 / 593

Total 5843 / 2803

These numbers are subject to change due to on-going reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results.

Figure 1 shows the location of cases throughout the 3 countries with widespread and intense transmission. The cumulative numbers of cases of EVD in each area are shown (grey circles).

In Guinea, one confirmed case of EVD was reported in Kindia district; the 1st time an EVD case has been reported from the area.

[There have been 3321 lab confirmed EVD cases (57 percent of the total, not all of which had specimens submitted), which is a very good effort by the few hot labs in the region. It is anyone's guess how many of the remaining 2522 suspected and probable cases would have tested positive; the number of deaths in each category may give a clue.

These totals show 508 new cases (including unconfirmed) and 181 deaths in West Africa in the 3 days to a week (depending on the country's report date) since WHO Sitrep No. 4 with figures as of 14 Sep 2014. Note that the figures for Liberia are from before the lockdown, which has turned up 92 more cases at 1st count [see [2] below].

WHO released on 22 Sep 2014 a statement on the 2nd [virtual] meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the 2014 EVD outbreak in west Africa http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-2nd-ihr-meeting/en. - Mod.JW]

[2] Sierra Leone: lockdown
Date: Sun 21 Sep 2014
Source: Sky News [edited]
http://news.sky.com/story/1339751/ebola-lockdown-92-bodies-found-in-sierra-leone


During a nationwide EVD lockdown 92 bodies and at least 56 new infections have been discovered in Sierra Leone. The 3-day lockdown came into effect on Fri [19 Sep 2014] and is aimed at stemming the worst EVD epidemic on record. The country's 6 million residents have been ordered to stay indoors as volunteers circulate to educate people about the outbreak and isolate the sick.

Stephen Gaojia, head of the Emergency Operations Centre which leads the EVD response, said "There is a very strong possibility it will be extended. "Even though the exercise has been a huge success so far, it has not been concluded in some metropolitan cities like Freetown and Kenema."

Some 123 people have contacted authorities during the lockdown so far, believing they might be infected. Of these, 56 have tested positive for EVD, 31 tested negative, and 36 were still awaiting their results, he said. Residents have largely complied with the plan, and the streets have remained mostly deserted, except for ambulances and police vehicles.

[3] Aerosol transmission?
Date: Sun 21 Sep 2014
From: Shaheen Mehtar <smehtar@sun.ac.za> [edited]


I am rather concerned that we have lost perspective of the mode of transmission in this EVD outbreak. To my knowledge it is not aerosol borne so I am at a loss to understand why there is so much emphasis on this route of transmission when clearly the need is to reduce splash and droplets in the 40-50 percent of cases where respiratory bleeding is found.

[We agree with Professor Mehtar. The reason for the emphasis is because some have raised the issue of the possibility of aerosol transmission, and this would be a serious event. However, the prepoderance of evidence and expert opinion is that it is not aerosol transmitted, nor is the virus likely to mutate to one that is aerosol transmitted. If it were already being aerosol transmitted face-to-face in crowded places such as markets and public transport, there would be massively greater numbers of cases in Monrovia. We have never heard of sneezing blood as a symptom in either Ebola or influenza, and there are no reports of a concurrent epidemic of influenza in Liberia. - Mods.JW/DK]

[4] Respirators: correction
Date: Sun 21 Sep 2014
From: Mark Liao <markliaohk@gmail.com> [edited]


I refer to the editor's comments in the ProMED-mail post, Ebola virus disease - West Africa (171): lockdown, serum, aerosol, team killed 20140920.2789476; "[3] Commentary: Health workers need optimal respiratory protection for Ebola."

Please note that the 2 pictures attached to the post are not images of N95 respirators. These are pictures of surgical masks (procedure facemasks), and can be identified due to the use of ear-loops or ties -- as noted in the posting, these facemasks do not provide sufficient protection for aerosols. N95 respirators can generally be identified by the presence of 2 elastic bands that go over the head rather than around the ears -- there are no NIOSH certified N95 respirators that use ear-loops or ties to my knowledge. Additionally I am unaware of any NIOSH [National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health] certified N95 respirators that have an integrated eye shield -- additional safety goggles, glasses or visors must be donned for eye protection. The 3rd image posted is a correct image of a PAPR [http://www.ojmedical.com/img/prods/large/amd2321_20_n95_respirator_mask_niosh_a_sp.jpg.

[5] USA: aid shipment
Date: Sat 20 Sep 2014
Source: Bloomberg News [edited]
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-20/747-filled-with-supplies-helps-on-ebola-but-only-so-much.html


Aid organization Direct Relief had 100 tons of gloves, masks, medicines, and gowns stockpiled in a California warehouse. Doctors fighting EVD were calling from West Africa desperate for supplies. Getting it there was the challenge. With airlines halting flights and borders closing to stop the disease from spreading, the nonprofit took matters into its own hands, chartering a Boeing 747 that's leaving New York today [20 Sep 2014] for Sierra Leone and Liberia. It'll figure out how to pay the USD 500 000 bill later. "Sometimes we need to do the work, then hope the financial support follows," Chief Executive Officer Thomas Tighe said.

The shipment of gloves, masks, medicines, and gowns, the 11th one Direct Relief has sent to West African nations, is part of newly urgent efforts by agencies and governments to accelerate aid as estimates of the potential spread of the Ebola epidemic grow exponentially...

"Our health workers have been on the front lines and they've been dropping dead because of the lack of equipment," Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan, Liberia's minister of foreign affairs, said today at John F Kennedy Airport as the plane was being loaded. "The more the health workers have confidence, the more patients will have confidence to go to the hospital."

Direct Relief is sending 2.8 million gloves donated by Australian manufacturer Ansell Ltd; generic drugs donated from Israel drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd., (TEVA) including azithromycin for bacterial infections. The supplies also include enough rehydration solution to supply 2 EVD wards for a year. The 370 pallets packing USD 6 million worth of supplies crossed the US in 7 53-foot trailers, then were loaded onto the 747 at Kennedy Airport. Other companies donating supplies include Merck & Co., Covidien Plc (COV), and Baxter International Inc. It is a "significant contribution" given the scope of the outbreak, said Darius Mans, president of aid organization Africare, whose 100-person staff in Liberia will help unload the supplies. "This will not be the last one. It can't be." -- more

[I do not want to play down the importance of the US contribution, but must point out that Laurie Garrett told National Public Radio (NPR) on 20 Sep 2014: "Even the US military, which is the fastest mobilizing operation I know of, tells me directly in my meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff that it's going to take 50 to 100 days to mobilize the different elements that they've promised to commit."

[7] Prevention, false alarms

Australia: false alarm
----------------------
21 Sep 2014 (The Age): Last [Fri 19 Sep 2014] a young child was suspected of having [Ebola virus] disease which activated the state's response plan for EVD. Tests at the Royal Children's Hospital [Melbourne] proved negative. A one-year-old child from West Africa, who had returned to Australia early last week, was tested for EVD at the Children's hospital after being initially treated at Frankston Hospital with diarrhoea-like symptoms on Friday night [19 Sep 2014]. The hospital's chief medical officer Dr Peter McDougall said the system, including placing the child into isolation and ensuring staff were well protected, worked well... -- more

Ghana: false alarms
-------------------
20 Sep 2104: (CitiFM Online): Tests conducted on blood samples of a suspected EVD patient who visited the Achimota Hospital [Ghana] have proved negative. The suspected EVD patient, who is a Nigerian, sought medical attention at the health facility on 14 Sep 2014 with symptoms of hemorrhagic fever. The situation compelled hospital authorities to isolate the patient for further examination of any EVD infection. The patient's blood samples were subsequently taken to the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research for testing.

Confirming the status of the patient to Citi News, the Administrator of the Achimota Hospital, Atindaana Nsobilla said the patient has been treated and discharged. He said the hospital received the results "before 2 pm on [Mon 15 Sep 2014] and the results were negative for the ebolavirus." According to him, before the results were in, the patient had improved tremendously. "Just after we received the results and it was negative, we discharged him to continue treatment so we believe that he should be doing very well wherever he is by now." Ghana has so far, investigated 38 suspected EVD cases which have all tested negative.

Netherlands: evacuated Dutch doctor actually has malaria
--------------------------------------------------------
21 Sep 2014 (Dutch News): One of the 2 doctors brought back to the Netherlands after coming into [unprotected] contact with EVD patients in Sierra Leone actually has malaria, a spokesman for the public health institute RIVM [National Institute for Public Health and the Environment] said on [Sun 21 Sep 2014]. "The doctor was admitted to hospital with a temperature on Saturday evening [20 Sep 2014] -- which is a sign of both EVD and malaria," the spokesman said. "Tests have shown he has malaria." The 2 doctors worked for the Lion Heart Foundation at a hospital in Sierra Leone. They arrived back in the Netherlands a week ago. However, the incubation period for EVD is 3 weeks, so the doctors cannot yet be given the all clear.
