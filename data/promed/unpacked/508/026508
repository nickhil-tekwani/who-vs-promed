A comment on: 'Hepatitis C and increasing incidence'
----------------------------------------------------
I want to query your subject line: Hepatitis B & C - Australia: increasing incidence. The content of the ProMED-mail post entitled "Hepatitis B & C - Australia: increasing incidence" archive number 20131110.2048183 was largely concerned with estimations of the number of people with viral hepatitis who remain undiagnosed and, perhaps, the rising incidence of deaths from primary liver cancer, to which viral hepatitis is a major contributor. As far as I can see, however, the HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmissible infections in Australia Annual Surveillance Report 2013 does not really indicate increasing incidence of hepatitis B and C. The following are excerpted from the report summary (p. 7):

- The per capita rate of diagnosis of hepatitis B infection in Australia in 2008 to 2012 was stable at around 31 per 100 000 population. The rate of diagnosis of newly acquired hepatitis B infection steadily declined in Australia from 1.2 in 2008 to 0.8 per 100 000 population in 2012.

- The per capita rate of diagnosis of hepatitis C infection declined from 52.5 in 2008 to 44.2 per 100 000 population in 2012.

One increasing statistic related to the number of newly acquired hepatitis C notifications is this:

- The reported annual number of diagnoses of newly acquired hepatitis C infection increased from 365 to 466 in 2008 to 2012 and accounted for 4.6 percent of new hepatitis C diagnoses in 2012.

This statistic may vary, however, according to the level of scrutiny applied to new notifications to identify newly acquired cases. And unlike HIV, we don't have the number of specimens tested for viral hepatitis, to give an indication of how testing rates might be affecting diagnosis rates. Then, to counter the interpretation that the increase in newly acquired cases identified indicates rising incidence of transmission:

The proportion of people seen at needle and syringe programs [NSPs] who reported having injected drugs for 5 years or less was stable in 2008 to 2012 at around 10 percent. Within this group, hepatitis C prevalence declined from 28 percent in 2008 to 17 percent in 2012.

Given the strong association of viral hepatitis transmission with injecting drug use, I would also draw attention to the attached article by Iversen et al. 2013 (Reduction in HCV incidence among injection drug users attending needle and syringe programs in Australia: a linkage study) published in the American Journal of Public Health [Am J Public Health. 2013 Aug; 103(8): 1436-44. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2012.301206. Epub 2013 Jun 13], which found that:

Hepatitis C "incidence density declined, from a high of 30.8 per 100 person-years (95 percent CI [confidence interval] = 21.3, 44.6) in 2003 to a low of 4.0 (95 percent CI = 1.3, 12.3) in 2009" and concluded that:

"A decline in HCV incidence among Australian IDUs [injection drug users] attending NSPs coincided with considerable expansion of harm reduction programs and a likely reduction in the number of IDUs, associated with significant changes in drug markets."

[ProMED-mail apologises to Roland Jauernig for the delay in posting his comment regarding the use of the phrase 'increasing incidence' in ProMED-mail post entitled: "Hepatitis B & C - Australia: increasing incidence" (and subsequently some other posts relating to hepatitis C incidence elsewhere). The delay was a the result of some unique problems encountered in the transmission of data within ProMED-mail.

We appreciate his providing detailed data regarding hepatitis in Australia. Furthermore we accept that the use of the heading 'increasing incidence' applied to this and other reports dealing with hepatitis C epidemiology is misleading. Future headings will be restricted to 'incidence'. - Mod.CP]
