We now have 4 premises in Saskatchewan for which the CFIA laboratory
in Lethbridge has confirmed anthrax.
Premises 1, 1st mortality on 31 Jan 2007
Premises 2, 1st mortality on 4 Feb 2007
Premises 3, 1st mortality on 22 Feb 2007
Premises 4, 1st mortality on 15 Mar 2007
The 1st 3 cases occurred in the northeast grain belt in the same area
as the summer of 2006 outbreak [see ProMED refs. below]. All 3 herds
had been vaccinated the previous summer. Two of the 3 premises had
animals die from anthrax the previous summer. All cases are believed
to be related to feed contaminated with anthrax spores (very heavy
snow cover in this area at the time of the outbreaks). The 3 herds
were re-vaccinated.
The 4th premises is located in the southwest corner of Saskatchewan
(west and south of the 2 cases of anthrax diagnosed in the south part
of the province in 2006). This area of the province was very dry
during the summer of 2006. Feed is believed to be the source of the
anthrax spores, as the animals are not on pasture. The 1st animal on
this premises died on 15 Mar 2007, with subsequent deaths on 16 and
17 Mar 2007. The herd was treated with antibiotics and the
"offending" feed removed. Vaccination of the herd was done 8 days
following the antibiotic treatment (in accordance with CFIA policy).
Kim Knight-Pickets will be covering the anthrax file for Les Kumor
for the next year. There will also be a new Disease Control
Specialist in Saskatchewan who will be taking over the anthrax file
(hopefully by June 2007, just in time for the summer anthrax season!).
The latest map [can be accessed at the URL below]; the green circles
are the 2007 cases; the red triangles are the 2006 cases.

A new case of anthrax has been reported on a farm in southwestern
Saskatchewan, a Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) veterinarian
reported Friday [30 Mar 2007].
"We have had a case confirmed on a Shaunavon area farm on 22 Mar
2007. We have had 3 confirmed (livestock) deaths," said Dr. Sandra
Stephens, a Saskatoon-based veterinary program specialist with
CFIA. "This is our 4th winter case of anthrax. We have had 3 cases
in the northeast corner in late February and early March [2007]."
Livestock can come in contact with the anthrax spores by grazing on
grass with spores or from hay bales from an outbreak area. Livestock
producers and feeders should know where their hay supply comes from,
Stephens said.
Last summer [2006], Saskatchewan experienced the largest outbreak of
anthrax in the province's history. The 1st case of anthrax was
diagnosed at the end of June 2006 north of Melfort, and over the next
2 months, cases were identified in 43 municipalities in northeast and
east central Saskatchewan. The total loss reported to CFIA was 806
livestock on 153 farms.
Anthrax is not a new disease in Canada. Stephens says the
Saskatchewan veterinary laboratory has reports dating back to 1912,
and the disease was reported in almost every decade during the last
century. In the past 10 years, there have been 8 outbreaks of anthrax
in Western Canada. CFIA is recommending vaccination for livestock
that will be grazed in outbreak areas for the next 3 years. Livestock
producers should consult their local veterinarians about vaccination
for the disease.
