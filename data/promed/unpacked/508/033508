[This is a very interesting report, as the last positive report of
anthrax in cattle to OIE was in 1996. However, they maintain greater
than 100 percent vaccination of all species other than swine, all the
while having human cases. To take only recent years, in 2003 there
were 5 cases; 2001 (3); and 2000 (3). I suspect there is more going
on than Baku knows or is willing to report. - Mod.MHJ]
