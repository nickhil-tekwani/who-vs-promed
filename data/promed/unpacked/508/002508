Australia: pacific cruise affected by suspected norovirus outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Cruise ship operator P and O blamed poor personal hygiene, among some
passengers, for a virus outbreak that forced one of its ships to return to
Sydney from a Pacific cruise over the weekend. The company's Pacific Sky
luxury liner returned to Sydney on Sat 9 May 2004 after 140 passengers
became sick, suffering attacks of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea during the
11-night cruise.

But, the ship was given the all-clear and left port the same night carrying
a new load of passengers, after a team of cleaners, supervised by health
officials, scrubbed down the ship. It was the 2nd time the ship had been
affected by illness in recent months, with a similar gastrointestinal virus
outbreak attacking 200 passengers in Dec 2003.

On Sun 9 May, disgruntled passengers were reported to be demanding refunds,
but the cruise company denied responsibility, saying a passenger probably
brought the virus -- a norovirus -- on board, and spread it by personal
contact [as a consequence of] poor personal hygiene. "Some passengers, when
they're on holidays, are not as vigilant as we would like in terms of
personal hygiene," P and O Cruises spokesman Gavin Smith said. The company
said it would consider refunds, or credits, for future cruises on a case by
case basis.

[Outbreaks of norovirus infection have occurred frequently on board cruise
ships operating in the northern hemisphere. This report reveals that the
same problem can affect cruise ships based in the southern hemisphere. It
would be interesting to know the country of origin of the suspected index
case and whether the strain of norovirus virus responsible for this
outbreak resembles any of the strains associated previously with outbreaks
in the northern hemisphere (e.g. see; Norwalk-like virus, cruise ship - USA
(FL) (15) 20021212.6049, and Norovirus activity 2002 - USA 20030123.0206.
