ProMED-mail reports since 14 Sep [2019] of a Tanzanian woman who died in Dar es Salaam on 8 Sep [2019] and was declared negative for Ebola by Tanzanian officials raises the question of what did cause her death. Given her travel to Uganda in August [2019], perhaps bat-associated Sosuga virus could be tested for if stored specimens exist. Similar to this young woman from Tanzania, the initial patient from the USA working in Uganda in 2012 in whom Sosuga virus was discovered had [experienced] fever, headache, rash, and diarrhea (EID 2014; 20: 211-216). This virus was found from fruit bats in Uganda in 3 locations approximately 130 km [about 81 mi] apart (J Wildl Dis 2015; 51:774-779). An IgM and IgG test was developed at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and antiviral compounds active against this virus were reported in 2018.

[The fatal case of a young Tanzanian woman studying in Uganda who died after traveling back to Tanzania for her field studies, as reported in ProMED-mail post 20190914.6674377, continues to elude an etiologic diagnosis. The initial concern for Ebola infection has since effectively been ruled out (see 20190914.6674377), but outside observers have called for greater transparency and information sharing given widespread rumors surrounding this case and its potential public health implications for neighboring countries as well as Tanzania itself (see 20190918.6680252).

As discussed by Mod.LK, the Ebola-like symptoms manifested in this case can be caused by other viral hemorrhagic fevers and a variety of other pathogens (see 20190914.6674377). ProMED thanks Dr. Lucey for raising the intriguing possibility of Sosuga virus in his letter. We continue to seek any additional information about this case, as well as alternative etiologic diagnoses and how they could be tested for.
