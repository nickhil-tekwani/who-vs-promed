Public health officials say a Rhode Island man has tested positive for the potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus eastern equine encephalitis [EEE].

The state health department said Friday [30 Aug 2019] the case was confirmed in a man over 50 from West Warwick. It's the 1st human case in Rhode Island since 2010.

State environmental officials said Thursday [29 Aug 2019] a 6-month-old horse tested positive for the virus in Westerly. Mosquitoes carrying the disease have been found in Westerly and Central Falls.

Ana Novais, the health department's deputy director, says there's a high risk for transmission of the disease to humans through mosquito bites. She recommends taking extra precautions to prevent bites.

In neighboring Massachusetts, there have been 4 confirmed human cases of the virus this year [2019], one of them fatal.

The virus can cause brain infections.

[The above report is yet another human case of EEE, this time in Rhode Island, with mention of an equine case in the state as well.

This summer [2019], the EEE virus transmission season continues to be an active one in the USA. Although most reported cases of EEE this year [2019] have occurred in horses, there have been several recent human cases as well. Individuals living in areas where human or equine EEE cases have occurred should heed the above recommendations to prevent mosquito bites. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. Fortunately, horses can be vaccinated, but there is no vaccine available for humans.

The risk of EEE virus infection for humans and horses will continue in Rhode Island and the other affected states until the 1st killing frosts occur, likely in October (2019). - Mod.TY
