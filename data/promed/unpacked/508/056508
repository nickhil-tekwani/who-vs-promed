Sarawak preparing to face HFMD outbreak
------------------------------------------------------
Sarawak is bracing for a major outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease
(HFMD) next year [2009], said the state Environment and Public Health
Minister Datuk Seri Wong Soon Koh. This, he said, was based on the
cycle of HFMD outbreaks, which have occurred every 3 years in the
state [Sarawak]. "Monitoring of HFMD is ongoing and will be
intensified in anticipation of the outbreak in 2009," he said in
reply to Chiew Chiu Sing (DAP [Democratic Action Party] Kidurong) in
the state assembly.

In addition, Wong said the Sarawak Health Department had intensified
visits to child-care centres and kindergartens to raise awareness of
HFMD and to implement measures to control it. A programme by the
Sarawak Health Department and the Institute of Health and Community
Medicine at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak discovered outbreaks of HFMD
every 3 years in 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006.

The outbreak in 1997 was due to EV71 [enterovirus 71], which killed
30 children aged below 5 years. It was the 1st time that EV71 was
recognised in Malaysia. Wong said that, from [30 Dec 2007] to [18 Oct
2008], 6666 cases were reported compared to 6332 for the
corresponding period last year [2007-08]. "Kuching recorded the
highest number with 2417 cases followed by Miri (1027), Bintulu
(828), and Sibu (761)," he said, adding that one death had been
reported in Sibu.

As of 24 Oct [2008], a total of 52 kindergartens, child-care centres,
and pre-schools had been served with closure orders or closed
voluntarily. Wong advised parents and child-care centres to practise
good hygiene and observe cleanliness to prevent the disease from spreading.

[HFMD is a common viral illness of infants and children. The disease
causes fever and blister-like eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin
rash. Individual cases and outbreaks of HFMD occur worldwide. In
temperate climates, cases occur more often in summer and early
autumn. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus
_Enterovirus_, which includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses,
echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 has been the most
common cause of HFMD, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated
with the illness. Since 1997, outbreaks of HFMD caused by enterovirus
71 have been reported throughout Asia and in Australia.

Whereas HFMD caused by coxsackievirus A16 infection is a mild
disease, with nearly all patients recovering in 7 to 10 days without
medical treatment, HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 has shown a higher
incidence of neurologic involvement. Fatal cases of encephalitis
caused by enterovirus 71 have occurred during outbreaks.

HFMD occurs mainly in children under 10 years of age but can also
occur in adults. Children are more likely to be at risk of infection
and illness because they lack protective antibodies. Infection
provides in immunity to the specific virus causing the disease, but a
2nd infection may occur following exposure to a different enterovirus.

Prevention depends on strict attention to hygiene. Vaccines are under
development, particularly to control enterovirus 71 infection, but
none is currently available.

Sarawak is one of 2 Malaysian states on the island of Borneo. It is
situated on the northwest of the island and is the largest state in
Malaysia. Malaysia and the state of Sarawak can be located using the
