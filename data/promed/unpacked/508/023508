[Different types of melons seem to be involved in this outbreak. Many of the outbreaks associated with melons that grow on the ground, such as watermelon and cantaloupe, are related to contamination of the rind while growing and subsequent contamination of the edible part by cutting through the rind. That the same strain of _S._ Adelaide has been linked to different melons suggests, -- unless the melons were initially contaminated by the same source of soiled irrigation water or only one of the melon types in the mix was the contaminant --, that transfer of the pathogen to the edible part of the melon occurred after harvesting. - Mod.LL
