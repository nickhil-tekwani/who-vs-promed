----------------------------------------------------------------------
In a plantain farm in Manabi [province] the occurrence of wilted plants with necrosis in vascular tissue of rhizomes and pseudostem was observed. Fruits were observed to ripen prematurely and exhibited an internal dry rot. Reddish necrotic spots were also noted on the rachis [stem] of the diseased bunches. Symptoms resembled those described for Moko disease.

A whitish ooze exuded from the vascular vessels of affected fruits when suspended in clean water. [From] infected tissue from rhizome and fruits, isolates of bacteria were [obtained]. Pathogenicity tests were conducted [and] necrotic symptoms were observed at the infection point after 8 days. Yellowing was observed after 3 weeks. Re-isolation confirmed Koch's postulates.

Molecular detection was carried out [by PCR and] all bacterial isolates tested rendered the expected fragments for _Ralstonia solanacearum_. Based on the bacterial characteristics, pathogenicity test on banana and PCR, we concluded that _R. solanacearum_ race 2 caused the wilt of plantain plants observed.

The bacteria probably arrived at this location on planting material brought from Colombia [see ProMED-mail post 20121207.1441296] where the pathogen had been recognised since the 1960s. This is the 1st report of the occurrence of the _R. solanacearum_ [presumably referring to race 2 only - Mod.DHA] in the coastal area of Ecuador in this crop. Further work is necessary for more refined categorisation of the pathogen in terms of biochemical profile or nucleotide sequence.

[Moko, as well as the other bacterial wilts of banana and plantain known as blood disease and bugtok, are caused by members of the _R. solanacearum_ (Rs) species complex (see link below). Within the complex, strains causing moko and bugtok are closely related causing similar symptoms (including wilting, fruit rot, blackening of suckers, bacterial ooze), but the blood disease bacterium is more distantly related with characteristic red internal discolouration ("blood") of fruits and pseudostems. Moko is one of the most serious banana diseases, with reported yield losses of over 70 percent, but all 3 diseases cause severe yield losses and eventually death of the plants.

The bacteria are spread by water, wind, infected plant material or soil, and mechanical means (including human activities, animals, insects). Ornamentals and weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Infection can occur via roots or flowers depending on the host cultivar and pathogen strain. The primary means of control is exclusion from areas that are disease-free and eradication of infected plants where the pathogens are present. Disease management may also include cultural, chemical (for example soil treatments) and biocontrol (antagonistic microorganisms) measures or combinations of these. Certified clean planting material is essential. No resistant banana or plantain cultivars are known.

_R. solanacearum_ affects more than 200 plant species including many important crops (also causing, for example, brown rot of potato). The various races and biovars are active under different climatic conditions and affect different hosts.
