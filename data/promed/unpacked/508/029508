Health officials say Taiwan has recorded its 34th confirmed case of
German measles [rubella] this year [2011], a new 12 year high.
However, they note most of the cases were contracted abroad, not
locally.

Officials with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) here said that
of the 34 cases, a total of 25 were contracted overseas. Of those, the
majority were from Viet Nam ... including 6 tourists. One CDC official
said the weather in Viet Nam has not been normal this year [2011] ...
and that the German measles season has started early. He noted that
Viet Nam already has in excess of 1000 cases.

The official is urging people traveling throughout Southeast Asia to
make sure they are vaccinated if they haven't previously caught the
disease. He said the government is also going to strictly enforce
regulations passed in 2009 ... mandating that foreign laborers and
exchange students must show immunization certificates before coming to
Taiwan.

[Previously, it was reported in ProMED-mail (see: Rubella, adult -
Taiwan 20110113.0152) that, according to surveillance data compiled by
Taiwan CDC over recent years, about 20 to 50 rubella cases are
reported each year, and several rubella outbreaks have occurred in
factories and at schools due to imported cases.

The incubation period of rubella is 14 days, with a range of 12 to 23
days. Symptoms are often mild, and up to 50 percent of infections may
be subclinical or unapparent. In children, rash is usually the 1st
manifestation, and a prodrome is rare. In older children and adults,
there is often a 1-5 day prodrome with low-grade fever, malaise,
lymphadenopathy, and upper respiratory symptoms preceding the rash.

The rash of rubella is maculopapular and occurs 14 to 17 days after
exposure. Arthralgia and arthritis occur frequently in adults and are
considered to be an integral part of the illness rather than a
complication. Other symptoms of rubella include conjunctivitis,
testalgia, or orchitis. Infection of the mother by rubella virus
during pregnancy can be serious. If the mother is infected within the
1st 20 weeks of pregnancy, the child may be born with congenital
rubella syndrome, which entails a range of serious incurable
illnesses, and spontaneous abortion occurs in up to 20 percent of
cases.

Rubella is spread from person to person via airborne transmission or
droplets shed from the respiratory secretions of infected persons.
Rubella may be transmitted by persons with subclinical or asymptomatic
cases (up to 50 percent of all rubella virus infections). The
preceding report suggests that rubella infection is seasonal in
Southeast Asia.

Rubella vaccine is generally available combined with measles and
mumps vaccine (MMR vaccine). The rubella component of MMR vaccine is a
live attenuated virus. Vaccine virus is not communicable except in the
setting of breastfeeding. For further information, see:
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/rubella.pdf.

The increasing incidence of rubella cases in Taiwan, although in part
due to infections acquired abroad, is indicative also of less than
optimal MMR vaccine coverage in the indigenous population.
