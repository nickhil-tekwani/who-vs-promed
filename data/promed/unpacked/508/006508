Sick south east Alaska seal indicates disease is spreading
----------------------------------------------------------
Federal wildlife officials say a sick ringed seal that was captured in south east Alaska last week appears to be afflicted by the same clinical signs suffered last year by ringed seals and Pacific walrus along northern coastlines.

The National Marine Fisheries Service says the Yakutat seal was taken to Anchorage and euthanized because it was so ill.

The seal's blubber thickness indicated it was in good body shape, but veterinary pathologist Kathy Burek-Huntington says it had almost total hair loss and nodular, scabbed skin sores consistent with the disease seen on the North Slope and along the Bering Strait.

More than 60 dead and 75 sick seals were reported in Alaska starting in July, and most were ringed seals.

The headline about disease spreading refers to geographic expansion. â€“ Mod.TG

This mysterious syndrome appeared several months ago and continues to be unsolved. It is indeed quite puzzling. The only affected group are pinnipeds, but according to the photographs and reports I have seen the lesions seem to be somehow different between seals and walruses. I suspect this disease remains unsolved because it may be multifactorial - Mod.PMB]
