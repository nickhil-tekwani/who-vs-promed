A 28 year-old English woman admitted to Coppetts Wood Hospital on 20 April
1997 had been unwell for about three weeks with intermittent fever and
diarrhoea. _Plasmodium falciparum_ infection with 30% parasitemia was
diagnosed. She was treated with intravenous quinine, blood transfusion, and
prostacyclin and she made a full recovery. She had been traveling in
Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe during March and had take proguanil and
chloroquine prophylaxis, but had stopped shortly after leaving Africa.
She [had flown] to Italy on 25 March and was seen in a hospital in Sicily on
16 April. She was given intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but no specific
diagnosis was made and she was not admitted. She was still ill when she
returned to England on 19 April. The doctor who saw her in Sicily suffered a
needlestick injury with the needle used to set her drip. He subsequently
developed falciparum malaria and died on 6 May. He had apparently not been
exposed in a malarious area and the diagnosis was made at necropsy.

[If I have this straight: She traveled in southern Africa in early March,
went to Italy in late March (from southern Africa?), was hospitalized in
Sicily on 16 April, returned to England on 19 April, and was hospitalized
there on 20 April. The Italian physician, therefore, was infected between 16
and 19 April and died on 6 May, 17-20 days later. Comments anyone? I
believe the word "malaria" is Sicilian for "bad air".-- Mod CHC]
