Extension of range of West Nile Virus: Diseased crow Found in Rhode Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARWICK, R.I.: [On Monday 14 Aug 2000 environmental officials announced
plans to spray insecticide in a two-mile radius from the place where
researchers found a dead crow [infected with West Nile virus (WNV}. [This
is the first occasion that WNV has been detected in Rhode Island. Four
trucks will spray more than 200 miles of streets in Warwick and Cranston
starting Tuesday night at the earliest. State environmental officials said
they [had expected to find the virus in Rhode Island because it [had
previously been detected in Connecticut and Massachusetts. It has also
been found this year in New Jersey and Maryland.
No one in Rhode Island has been infected. Three New York City residents
[have contracted the illness this summer and [are now recovering. The
virus is commonly carried by bloodsucking mosquitoes, which transmit the
virus through bites. Infection may result in encephalitis, an inflammation
of the brain, or meningitis, an inflammation of the brain's lining and the
spinal cord. Last summer, during the first known appearance of the West
Nile virus in the Western Hemisphere, 7 people died and 62 others were
infected in the New York metropolitan area.
