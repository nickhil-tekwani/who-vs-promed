[These are not official data. They are derived from the above-mentioned
source, which seems to be updated meticulously. The data from some
countries may include exceptional imported cases or exclude exported cases
which were found positive in the countries of destination. For additional
information, including accumulated and recent BSE testing data in the
various countries, the reader is referred to the source and to the OIE
table, last updated on 6 Nov 2003:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en_esbmonde.htm> Most countries show decreased
incidence of recorded BSE cases, compared to 2002. The exceptions are
Portugal, Spain (with a relatively high number of cases), as well as Japan,
Poland, and the Czech Republic. - Mod.AS]

Czechs confirm 7th mad cow case in domestic cattle
--------------------------------------------------
A control test has confirmed the 7th Czech case of a domestic cow with mad
cow disease, a brain-wasting disease that can prove deadly to humans,
veterinarians said on Monday [27 Oct 2003]. The illness, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), was confirmed in a 4-year-old cow from Lomnice nad
Popelkou, a town about 90km (56 miles) northeast of Prague, a spokesman at
the State Veterinary Authority (SVS) told Reuters.
This is the first case diagnosed in an animal born after 1997. All the
previous 6 Czech cases were in cows born between 1995 and 1997, which
suggested the infection entered the food chain in the 2nd half of the
1990's, either through milk substitutes or in feed mixing plants.
BSE, believed to originate from cattle feed, has also been found in
neighbouring EU accession states Poland and Slovakia. The Czechs have
tested more than 450 000 cattle for the disease.

BSE accusations
----------------
Japan is trying to blame its latest case of mad cow disease on Italy. In
October, researchers in Italy reported finding 2 BSE-infected cows, whose
test results revealed a slightly unusual balance of the different forms of
the prion protein that causes the disease. Japan's 8th and latest case also
gave an unusual test result.
The finding prompted Takashi Onodera of the University of Tokyo, head of
the Japanese government's BSE panel, to tell journalists that meat and
bonemeal imported from Italy might have caused the Japanese case. His
claims have been widely reported.
But some experts say there is a slight problem with this theory: the
published results show the tests were abnormal in different ways. Markus
Moser of Prionics, a Swiss company that makes BSE tests like those used in
Italy and Japan, says they clearly show that the Italian cases had low
levels of the "di-glycosylated" form of the prion protein that causes BSE,
while the Japanese case was light on the "mono-glycosylated" form. What's
more, both results might just be accidental artefacts rather than
representing real differences in the prions, Moser says.

Mad cow science under microscope after young Japanese bulls fail test
--------------------------------------------------
Canada's top veterinarian says Japanese authorities should allow global
experts access to tissue samples from 2 young bulls that recently tested
positive for mad cow disease.
Dr. Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency says rapid test
results from the bulls were not confirmed by the standard method used to
establish bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and the world needs to
know what it really means.
"Despite repeated requests from the international community for Japan to
share material with world reference labs, Japan has indicated at this time
they are not prepared to do that," said Evans, who has spent months
reassuring the United States and other countries of the safety of Canadian
beef following the 20 May 2003 discovery of BSE in an Alberta breeder cow.
"It makes it very difficult to understand whether we are dealing with a
diagnostic issue in Japan . . . or whether we are dealing with a new strain
of BSE or something previously not seen."
It's been almost 6 months since live cattle from Canada were banned from
international markets, including Japan.
Ann Veneman, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, recently announced that the
United States was seeking feedback on a proposal that would lift the ban on
animals under 30 months, noting a review of scientific evidence has shown
the public health risk of Canadian beef is extremely low. Experts have
stressed that those animals are at lower risk of contracting the
brain-wasting disease. But in the last 6 weeks, Japanese bulls aged 23 and
21 months have tested positive for BSE.
Protectionist interests in the U.S. have seized upon the Japanese cases as
proof that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is moving too fast.
Bill Bullard of the Ranchers-Cattleman Action Legal Fund is assembling a
panel of veterinarians from within its membership to examine BSE science
and create a report that would be presented to the USDA by 29 Dec 2003.
"We still have a long way to go in effective risk communication, in
continuing to educate policy makers, politicians, and the public as the
science evolves," he said.
Evans has been meeting with Canada's veterinary schools to ensure they are
part of an expanded surveillance network to test for BSE, ensuring testing
centres near slaughterhouses and deadstock yards in all provinces. He said:
"We'll continue to increase that to address some of the concerns being
addressed by countries who say Canada needs to do more testing and
demonstrate over time that we've looked under every rock and that the true
prevalence of BSE is either extremely low or non-existent".

[Readers are referred to the Japanese website, where the western blots and
histochemistry of the first "atypical" case are displayed:
<http://www.mhlw.go.jp/houdou/2003/10/h1006-2.html> for further details,
see posting 20031007.25110.
At present, 5 rapid BSE tests are approved by the European Commission for
use in brain material collected from dead animals: Prionics Check Western,
Bio-Rad TeSeE (previously Bio-Rad Platelia), Enfer, Prionics Check LIA and
InPro CDI-5. All 5 have gone through laboratory evaluation and field tests
prior to their approval. They are designed to detect BSE in brain material
collected from animals at the slaughterhouse or those that have died on the
farm. So far, tests designed to detect BSE in live animals have not been
evaluated. Reportedly, the BSE rapid test applied within the national
surveillance in Japan is the Bio-Rad TeSeE test.
Japan is the only country where tests are not limited to bovines older than
24 (or 30) months, but include all animals arriving at slaughterhouses.-
