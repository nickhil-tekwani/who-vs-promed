With the effect of cold spells, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and piglet diarrheal diseases are relatively severe in Hebei area this year [2016]. Mortality in piglets from diarrheal diseases is relatively high (about 20 percent). Although the outbreak area of FMD is relatively large, the casualty rate is rather low (about 5 percent). This FMD outbreak is type A FMD. The government's vaccine is type O, which caused the outbreak to be somewhat worse.

With the effect of cold spells, the situation of FMD and piglet diarrheal diseases in Shandong area is the worst of the recent few years. With the mortality rate of FMD reaching 10 percent, combined with diarrheal diseases, the overall mortality of piglets in Shandong area this winter has reached 20 percent. Large-scale hog farms have had relatively low occurrence rates due to effective temperature insulation measures. This outbreak of FMD is type A. The government's vaccine is type O, which caused the outbreak to be somewhat worse.

[The 3 provinces mentioned above in the local economical media sources, namely Hebei, Shandong and Henan, are situated in mid-east northern China and share common borders with each other. Hebei borders, on its north, the Inner Mongolia autonomous region (map at http://www.lahistoriaconmapas.com/atlas/china-map/eastern-china-map.htm).

FMD is regarded to be endemic in China. According to the People's Republic of China page on the WRLFMD [World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease] website, last updated in 2015, the following serotypes have been recorded there throughout the years:
FMDV-O: 1958, 1986, 1999-2001, 2003, 2005, 2010-2014
FMDV-A: 1951, 1958, 1960, 1962, 1964, 2009-2010, 2013-2014
FMDV-C: 0000
FMDV-Asia 1: 1958, 2005-2009
FMDV-SAT 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 2: 0000
FMDV-SAT 3: 0000

China's annual reports to the OIE since 2010 mention 2 circulating serotypes: O and A. According to the 2013 genotyping results, as presented in the WRLFMD website, the FMDV-A strain circulating in China is a topotype ASIA, lineage Sea-97 strain; for details, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLMEG-2013-00009%20A%20PR%20China%202013.pdf.

The above situation, namely the circulation of FMDV serotypes O and A, seems to have continued during 2015, though the circulation of serotype O may have been reduced (as indicated in 2 of the above reports) by the apparent efficacy of the vaccine applied in pigs, reportedly a monovalent (serotype O) vaccine.

According to the stipulations of OIE's International Animal Health Code, immediate notifications are prescribed if/when there is a significant change in the epidemiology of an endemic disease or following the appearance of a new or exotic strain. Otherwise, all FMD outbreaks and the relevant statistics and applied measures are to be reported twice yearly in the semi-annual reports, which are meant to include the information for each province, specifying the serotype involved. - Mod.AS
