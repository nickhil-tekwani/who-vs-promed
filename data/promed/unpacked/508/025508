[1] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Harare)

A cholera outbreak has killed 10 people in Zimbabwe's capital Harare after they drank contaminated water, a city health official said on Sunday [9 Sep 2018]. Harare city council has struggled to supply water to some suburbs for more than a decade, forcing residents to rely on water from open wells and community boreholes.

Clemence Duri, Harare city's health director, said more than 300 people had been hospitalized after contracting the waterborne disease, which causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. The outbreak was 1st reported on Friday [7 Sep 2018]. "The death toll has risen to 10. We have established that the outbreak was caused by a burst sewer pipe that contaminated borehole water," Duri said, adding that the pipe had been replaced.

Zimbabwe suffered its biggest cholera outbreak in 2008 at the height of an economic crisis when more than 4000 people died and another 40 000 became sick.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Sunday [9 Sep 2018] that 680 cases of suspected cholera were recorded in 8 local government areas (LGAs) of Borno State, out of which 18 victims had died. The UN agency said it was coordinating medical aid to the affected communities alongside the Borno State Ministry of Health, noting that the 1st suspected cases of cholera were recorded on Sun 19 Aug 2018.

The UNOCHA, in a statement by its National Information Officer, Abiodun Banire, said a 100-bed cholera treatment centre had been opened in Dala and in the Magumeri LGA. He noted that additional ambulances had also been deployed in the affected LGAs to transport those seeking treatment.

The UN gave the breakdown of the epidemic in the LGAs as follow: Jere, 218, including 2 deaths; Magumeri, 156, including 4 deaths; Maiduguri Metropolitan Council, 141, including 5 deaths; Chibok, 85, including 3 deaths; Konduga, 38, including 3 deaths; Kaga, 28, including one death; Damboa, 8 cases; and Shani, 6 cases.

The UN, in the statement, said, "A cholera outbreak was declared in Borno State on Wed 5 Sep 2018 by the state ministry of health. A total of 680 cases of suspected cholera have been recorded, including 18 deaths, as of Fri 7 Sep 2018. This represents a fatality rate of 2.6 percent.

"The ministry of health, with the support of humanitarian partners, is coordinating the response through the Emergency Operation Centre. Coordination meetings are currently held twice a week at the EOC and daily at the LGAs."

[3] Cholera - Ethiopia (Tigray Region)
Date: Sat 8 Sep 2018
Source: News24 [edited]
https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/holy-water-blamed-for-cholera-outbreak-in-ethiopia-report-20180908


A cholera outbreak in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region has reportedly been blamed on holy water after at least 10 people died over the past 2 weeks, while more than 1200 people have contracted the disease. According to BBC, authorities have blamed the spread of the acute water diarrhea to poor hygiene and the drinking of unsafe water.

The authorities have also identified contaminated holy water in some of the region's monasteries as being behind the outbreak. It was believed that the water is being taken from rivers that carry the disease.

Interfering in religious affairs is a very sensitive matter in the region, but the local government is working with religious leaders to temporarily stop the use of holy water, said the report. The authorities say that the disease is under control, but efforts to contain it need to continue until it disappears altogether.

[4] Cholera - Cameroon
Date: Tue 4 Sep 2018

Seventeen people have died of cholera in Cameroon's center and northern regions since the outbreak was declared in mid-July 2018, the country's public-health ministry said Mon 3 Sep 2018. In the same regions, where the cholera case fatality rate is 1.6 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively, 235 suspected cases were reported, of which 23 were confirmed, while 5 other regions are considered at "high risk."

Faced with growing risks, Cameroonian authorities, with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), say they are updating the linear list, continuing prevention, surveillance, investigations and sanitation operations, and strengthening the capacities of medical staff. However, the authorities have expressed concerns related to the supply of inputs, the follow-up of contacts in the country's 10 regions, and the launch of an immunization campaign in the Minawao refugee camp, opened in July 2013 to respond to the massive influx of Nigerian refugees fleeing Boko Haram.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al, (1) it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
