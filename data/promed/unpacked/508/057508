ANTHRAX, LION - PAKISTAN: (SINDH) ZOO, CORRECTION
*************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

[This is a correction of ProMED-mail Anthrax, lion - India: (AP) zoo
20100424.1323. The posting erroneously identified the location of the
zoo where anthrax was detected in a lion as Hyderabad, Andra Pradesh
state, India. The correct location is Hyderabad, Sindh province, Pakistan.

ProMED-mail apologizes for this mistake.]

[The Rani Bagh, (previously Das Garden) of Hyderabad City is the lone
Zoological garden, which caters for the people of the entire interior
Sindh province. Rani Bagh is spread over 57 acres of land, divided
into 4 parts, including Eidgah, the Abbas Bhai Park, zoo and lawns,
children parks, jogging tracks, and parking area (see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rani_Bagh,_Hyderabad>).

Feeding locally obtained dead animals to feed to carnivores in
zoological gardens is a regular occurrence around the world, and
careless purchases result in deaths. And it would seem that this
lioness was already in a very poor condition. This is not one of the
leading zoological gardens in the world and I suspect that there have
been other such cases here previously. Pakistan is at best an erratic
reporter of this disease to OIE, Paris.

To find Hyderabad, go to
