PARASITE IN POOL INFECTS 51 PEOPLE AT SUMMER PARTY
27 Sep 1998
Oregon Live
David Austin
An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Sellwood, Oregon has afflicted 51
people after attending a swimming party at Sellwood Pool, and a number of
them remain ill from the incident.
The story says that no one was hospitalized from the outbreak,
and because summer is over the pool has closed. Four
victims sought medical treatment from doctors right away, and many of those
who attended the event still are hampered by diarrhea, vomiting and stomach
cramps, fever and flulike symptoms.
According to state health statistics, the outbreak eclipses the largest
number of cryptosporidiosis cases ever recorded in one year in Oregon,
which was the 33 in 1997.
Dr. Gary Oxman, director of Multnomah County's Health Department, was cited
as suspecting that someone who was carrying the parasite might have
relieved himself in the pool, and that chlorine, the common agent used in
swimming pools to kill bacteria, isn't strong enough to neutralize the
parasite.
The story adds that about 65 people attended the 30 Aug pool party that
was sponsored by the Parent Teacher Association at Edwards School in
Southeast Portland.
School officials said that at least two students have been absent because
of the illness and that several adults still are dealing with its effects.
