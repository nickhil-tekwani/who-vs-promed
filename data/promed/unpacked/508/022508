[This case refers to a rabid fox killed by a (domestic) dog. Details on the measures undertaken/fate of the involved (most probably, unvaccinated) dog have not been included. According to the report, animal rabies vaccination is not applied in Greece.

Since the start of the current rabies outbreak in Northern Greece, after its absence for 25 years, 4 rabid animals have already been reported, -- 2 in western Macedonia (a red fox on 15 Oct 2012 and a dog on 10 Nov 2012) and 2 (red foxes) in Central Macedonia (29 Nov and 6 Dec 2012) --. The 2 affected provinces border Albania on the west and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the north, both known to be rabies-endemic territories.

It will be interesting to note if wildlife oral vaccination is considered by the Greek authorities. - Mod.AS
