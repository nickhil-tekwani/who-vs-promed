A nursery in Auckland has stopped cucumber propagation due to an unknown disease. For the past few years, the company has struggled with the problem that randomly affects a small percentage of young plants at the early stage of growth. Samples had been sent previously to a number of international laboratories, but no known pathogens could be identified within the range of these diagnostic services.

The nursery would be grateful for any insights or suggestions via the contact details on their website (https://www.grower2grower.co.nz/) or via ProMED-plant.

[A large number of pathogens can affect cucurbit crops, which include cucumber and melons (_Cucumis_ spp.); watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_); and squashes, gourds, and pumpkins (_Cucurbita_ spp.).

The symptoms in the photos above supplied by the nursery resemble those of some cucurbit viruses, as does the information on distribution and sporadic occurrences. No information is provided whether seeds or plantlets are brought to the glasshouse for propagation as possible sources of any contamination. An involvement of environmental factors in the problem cannot be excluded with the available information, either as causes or as facilitators of any infectious processes. A combination of infectious pathogens and/or abiotic stresses would be another potential scenario.

It appears unclear whether the condition is infectious within the glasshouse. Even if common cucurbit viruses have apparently so far not been detected by the diagnostic services used, commercial diagnostics are not usually exhaustive searches for all known and any possible new viruses of the crops. Additional investigation of this group of pathogens would, therefore, still seem worthwhile. A priority would be to clarify the presence of a possible infectious component by testing for transmissibility of symptoms between individual plants (according to Koch's postulates; e.g., see ProMED post 20210316.8249744).
