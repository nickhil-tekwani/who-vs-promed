Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Katinovac, Katinovac, Topusko, Sisacko-Moslavacka
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Oct 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 29 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 5

Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 10.34% / 0% / 0% / 17.24%
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Brucellosis is confirmed in one bovine herd with 29 animals. Suspicion was raised during regular annual herd testing in the framework of surveillance programme for bovine brucellosis. All animals older than 12 months were tested on [3 Oct 2018]. In total, 18 bovine animals were tested; 10 bovine animals revealed positive results in serological testing. Additional brucelin skin test was performed on all bovine animals older than 12 months, out of which 5 animals were positive. Those bovine animals were slaughtered, and samples were taken for confirmation purposes. _Brucella melitensis_ was isolated from the samples (supramamary limph nodes) originating from 3 bovines. According to the results of bacteriological testing, the whole herd is considered as infected. The herd is placed under the official supervision, and no movement is allowed. Eradication measures will be implemented, and all animals from the herd will be slaughtered. In addition, all bovines, sheep, and goats in the 3 km [1.9 mi] range from the infected holding will be tested for brucellosis. Epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: slaughter, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Croatian Veterinary Institute, Zagreb (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) / 12 Oct 2018 / positive

Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 28 Nov 2018 / positive
Cattle / rose bengal test (RBT) / 12 Oct 2018 / positive
Cattle / complement fixation test (CFT) / 12 Oct 2018 / positive

Future reporting

["Infection with Brucella in cattle is usually caused by biovars (bv.) of _Brucella abortus_. In some countries, particularly in southern Europe, Africa, and western Asia, where cattle are kept in close association with sheep or goats, infection can also be caused by _B. melitensis_. Occasionally, _B. suis_ may cause a chronic infection of the mammary gland of cattle, but it has not been reported to cause abortion or spread to other animals. Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is widespread globally, but several countries in northern and central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand are believed to be free from both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_.

The disease is usually asymptomatic in young animals and non-pregnant females. Following infection with _B. abortus_ or _B. melitensis_, pregnant adult females develop a placentitis usually resulting in abortion between the 5th and 9th month of pregnancy. Even in the absence of abortion, profuse excretion of the organism occurs in the placenta, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharges. The mammary gland and associated lymph nodes may also be infected, and organisms may be excreted in the milk. Subsequent pregnancies are usually carried to term, but uterine and mammary infection recurs, with reduced numbers of organisms in afterbirth products and milk. In acute infections, the organism is present in most major body lymph nodes. Adult male cattle may develop orchitis/epididymitis, and brucellosis may be a cause of infertility in both sexes. Hygromas, usually involving leg joints, are a common manifestation of brucellosis in some tropical countries and may be the only obvious indicator of infection; the hygroma fluid is often infected with _Brucella_.

_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and potentially contaminated tissues, cultures, and materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions."
