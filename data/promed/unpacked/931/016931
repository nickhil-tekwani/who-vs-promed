ANTHRAX, BOVINE - USA (MINNESOTA) (07)

Since the last BAH update which included a news release, 2 additional
premises were confirmed as having anthrax mortality. One of these
premises was just over the Kittson county line in Marshall County,
the other premises in northeastern Polk County. These locations are
the 1st confirmed cases of anthrax to occur in their respective
counties in 2006.
The last report of mortality attributed to anthrax was in a beef cow
on 25 Jul 2006. My understanding from Dr. Lindemann is that no
additional mortality has been attributed to anthrax since that
time. A total of 83 animals have died on [25] premises with confirmed anthrax.
