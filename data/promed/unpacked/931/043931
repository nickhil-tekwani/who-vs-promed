Following the detection of an avian influenza outbreak caused by the highly pathogenic H5N9 virus strain in a guinea fowl rearing establishment located in the municipality of Labastide Gabausse in the Tarn, the prefect decided immediately to deploy protective measures to prevent the risk of spreading the disease from that farm.

Poultry breeding in this farm will be stopped; all guinea fowl will be killed, and the buildings will be cleaned and disinfected. A regulated perimeter is set up, consisting of a protection zone of 3 km around the outbreak (including the municipalities of Blaye-les-Mines, Combefa, Gabausse Labastide-Saint-Benoît de Carmaux, Taïx), and a 10 km surveillance zone around the outbreak, including the commons Almayrac, Cagnac-les-Mines Carmaux, Castanet, Le Garric, Lescure of Albigensian Livers-Cazelle, Mailhoc, Milhavet, Monestiés, Rosières, Sainte-Gemme, Venues, The Segur, Trévien, Valderiès, Villeneuve-sur-Vere, Virac and Sainte-Croix.

Poultry farms will be identified and will be subject to veterinary visits (clinical monitoring or conducting analysis).

Biosecurity measures must be strictly implemented. All movement of poultry within, to or from the regulated perimeter is subject to restrictions. Similarly, fairs, markets, and shows including captive birds are prohibited in this area.

Moreover, the Tarn Prefect has issued a warning to farmers and other holders of captive birds to watch out for a drop in productivity; an abnormal mortality; and/or respiratory or digestive or nervous symptom problems in their poultry. In case such symptoms appear, they should immediately contact their veterinarian.

According to the National Health Security Agency for Food, Environment and Labour (ANSES), the identified strains are of European origin and not pathogenic for humans. Given the non-transferable nature of the virus to humans, there is no reason for consumers to change their eating habits.

[Follow-up No. 10, including an interactive map showing the location of the new outbreak, has been submitted to the OIE on 19 Apr 2016; see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=19936.

The report includes the following description of the affected population: "The death of 350 guinea fowl within 5 days led to the declaration of clinical suspicion on 13 Apr 2016. The National Reference Laboratory identified a highly pathogenic H5N9 strain on 18 Apr 2016. The farm site also had 2800 free-range chickens, which did not present clinical signs. All of the animals will be destroyed on 20 Apr 2016. Moreover, before the onset of the symptoms in guinea fowl, the site hosted a batch of 1000 ducks on gavage [forced feeding using a tube. - Mod.SH] without abnormal mortality during the gavage process; the batch left the site for slaughtering on 6 Apr 2016."

The summary of this HPAI H5N9 event (a strain recorded for the 1st time in France) since its start on 18 Nov 2015 in south west France, published in OIE's WAHID archive as of 19 Apr 2016, is as follows:

Total outbreaks = 25 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 101 815 / 1609 / 2044 / 83 425 / 0
