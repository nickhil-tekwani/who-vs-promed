Rates of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFM) in Singapore exceed those of all other reporting countries in Asia. In fact, HFM is at least as common as varicella in Singapore [1,2]. See graph [3]: http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/HFM.png.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is due to an infection that usually causes a typical illness, including a typical rash. It is most commonly caused by Coxsackie A16 or human enterovirus 71. Epidemics are caused by different, not closely related viruses, which vary with time and geographically. Consequently, without direct identification of the infectious agents, it is difficult to make useful comparisons of epidemics affecting different societies. - Mod.CP
