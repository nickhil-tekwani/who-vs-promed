New highly contagious strains of potato virus Y
-----------------------------------------------
The potato virus Y (PVY) is transmitted by several species of aphids and
causes significant losses in yield and quality. Numerous new isolates of
this virus have emerged in recent years in Swiss potato crops. Experiments
at Agroscope Changins-Waedenswil (ACW) show that the epidemiology of the
PVY strains and the sensitivity of potato varieties have changed completely.

The seed potatoes imported into Switzerland are from different regions of
Europe. This exchange promotes the dissemination of various genotypes of
PVY. The 1st symptoms of tuber necrosis were observed at the beginning of
the 1990s and were caused by so-called NTN strains of the virus. One of the
new strains was imported from Germany in planting material. The spread of
the new isolates in Switzerland made the cultivation of certain very
susceptible varieties difficult. At the beginning of the 2000s virologists
at ACW discovered Wilga-types of the virus in Swiss crops. These strains
can also cause significant damage.

ACW investigated the spread of different PVY strains under field
conditions. The experiment showed that the variety Lady Christl has
surprisingly good resistance to different isolates of the virus. The new
strains are spreading faster and more effectively than the older strains of
PVY. This new situation calls for more consistency and attention from seed
potato producers. In the future, the sensitivity to these new PVY strains
should be taken into account when choosing varieties, and the most
sensitive varieties should be avoided.

[_Potato Virus Y_ (PVY; type member of genus _Potyvirus_) is one of the
most damaging potato viruses affecting crop yields and tuber quality. PVY
can also affect tomato, capsicum, and some other related species. It is
transmitted by aphid vectors in a non-persistent manner, with _Myzus
persicae_ being the most efficient vector. PVY can also be spread by
mechanical means, plant-to-plant contact, or with infected planting
material such as seed tubers. Disease management of PVY and other potato
viruses relies largely on clean planting material and use of resistant crop
varieties, but reduction of available virus reservoirs and vector numbers
may also be useful.

The PVY isolates reported so far have been classified in 3 main strains,
PVY-N, PVY-O, and PVY-C, according to leaf symptoms induced on the
experimental host _Nicotiana tabacum_. PVY-N isolates have been divided
into 2 groups, one causing mild mosaic in most potato cultivars, while the
other induces "potato tuber necrotic ring disease" and severe chlorotic
mosaic of leaves. It is referred to as PVY-NTN (necrotic group [N] and
inducing tuber necrosis [TN]) and is the most virulent strain of PVY. It
has been suggested that PVY-NTN isolates may have resulted from natural
combination of local strains of PVY-N with PVY-O or PVY-C.

PVY-O isolates induce severe symptoms on potato leaves, such as crinkling,
leaf drop, or severe necrotic mosaic. PVY-C isolates causes stipple streak
on potato cultivars carrying the Nc resistance gene. Some isolates
determined serologically as PVY-O and inducing less severe symptoms in
potato than the PVY-N isolates have been called PVY-N-Wilga isolates.

A build up of PVY due to farm-saved seed potatoes has also been reported
from the UK earlier this year (2009; see ProMED-mail post 20090212.0628).
Around 40 viruses have been reported to affect potato, and since the crop
is vegetatively propagated, many of them may be disseminated in tubers. If
virus-infected seed tubers are used, virus populations and numbers of
co-infecting species and strains will build up with every crop cycle. This
invariably leads to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in
yield. Even more severe problems may result if viruses in infected seed
tubers are moved to a different area where they may combine with local
pathogen populations and/or encounter lack of host resistance, as suggested
above for Switzerland. The important role that tubers play in virus and
viroid spread is recognised by the strict requirements for certified seed
potato production in many countries worldwide.
