--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contrary to the attention grabbing headlines recently, there were not 125 people with syphilis and/or HIV in the social network investigated last year [2017] by staff at the City of Milwaukee Health Department.

Buried in the most recent reports are the accurate numbers showing that of 127 people identified in the social network by disease intervention specialists, 76 had positive tests for syphilis and/or HIV
(https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2018/03/13/free-confidential-testing-offered-milwaukee-leaders-address-hiv-syphilis-cluster/420398002/).

127 people linked in a social network investigation conducted in 2017.
25 of the 127 tested negative for both HIV and syphilis
76 of these 127 tested positive for HIV and/or syphilis
19 of these 76 tested positive for syphilis and negative for HIV
24 of these 76 tested positive both syphilis and HIV
33 of these 76 tested positive for HIV and negative for syphilis
26 of the 127 were not tested because they refused testing or could not be located

[ProMED-mail thanks the submitter that wants to remain anonymous, for the data.

The following is extracted from the news report referenced in the above submission (https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2018/03/13/free-confidential-testing-offered-milwaukee-leaders-address-hiv-syphilis-cluster/420398002/). However, the referenced news report does not give the numerical data supplied in the submission above:

"The Journal Sentinel first reported last week[*] that there was a social network of at least 125 people -- including a few high school students -- that had been identified, many of whom had contracted HIV, syphilis or both in one of the largest STI clusters ever discovered in Milwaukee. As many as 3 local babies were also born with syphilis last year.

"Those facing the greatest risk from the cluster include men who have sex with men (MSM); minorities; those who inject drugs; and human trafficking victims. 'Some of our most vulnerable communities are the communities that are affected by this,' Common Council President Ashanti Hamilton said. He and other city leaders urged people to use protection, get tested, know their status and communicate with their sexual partners. They also urged people to fight the stigma around the issue. 'Much of this is about the intersection of racism and homophobia that continue to be pervasive in our community,' said Kofi Short of Diverse & Resilient."

*This prior Journal Sentinel Online article
(https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2018/03/06/hiv-syphilis-clusters-affecting-least-125-people-including-high-school-students-discovered-milwaukee/397534002) also did not give the numerical data supplied in the submission above.

We now learn that of the 127 individuals in Milwaukee social network, 57 (45 percent) were HIV positive; 76 of the 101 tested were positive for HIV and/or syphilis. The cluster is said to involve men who have sex with men; minorities; those who inject drugs; and human trafficking victims, but numerical data is missing. Also missing is data on the genetic relatedness of the HIV strains causing the Milwaukee outbreak, as well as race/ethnicity or use of cell phone apps, such as Grindr, "party drugs", PrEP, etc. Knowing this type of information may help pinpoint prevention efforts. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Milwaukee on Lake Michigan's western shore, with an estimated population of 600 155 residents in 2015, is the largest city in the U.S. state of Wisconsin and is also the second most densely populated metropolitan area in the Midwest, surpassed only by Chicago (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee#2010_Census). The median income for a household in the city is $32 216, and 21.3 percent of the population and 17.4 percent of families are below the poverty line (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee#2010_Census). A total of 37 percent of the population was non-Hispanic white, 17.3 percent Hispanic (of any race); 40 percent was Black or African American, 0.8 percent American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.5 percent Asian, 3.4 percent from 2 or more races (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee#2010_Census).
