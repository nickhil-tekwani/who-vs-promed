Congo fever has infected over 200 people across Iraq since the start of the year [2022], an official from the country's health ministry told Rudaw on Thursday [23 Jun 2022].

Saif al-Badr, the spokesperson for the Iraqi health ministry, said that 207 cases of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever have been recorded in 2022 so far, with the infection count increasing despite Iraqi authorities taking measures to combat the virus.

The health official added that 35 people have thus far lost their lives due to the fever.

Iraq is suffering from an outbreak of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, also known as Congo fever. It is tick-borne which causes severe hemorrhaging. It has been endemic to Iraq since 1979 and reappeared again last year [2021] sparking fear among locals, especially in Iraq's southern provinces.

Last month [May 2022], Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi allocated 1 billion Iraqi dinars [USD 0.686 million] to combat the fever, with the money used to purchase pesticides and raise awareness about its effects.

People are often infected after coming into contact with the blood of infected animals, often after slaughtering livestock.

WHO has placed the fatality rate of the disease at up to 40%, and no vaccine is available for either people or animals.

[Iraq is one of the eastern Mediterranean countries where CCHF is endemic. CCHF has been reported in Iraq since 1979 when the disease was first diagnosed in 10 patients. Since then, 6 cases were reported between 1989 and 2009; 11 cases in 2010; 3 fatal cases were reported in 2018; more recently 33 confirmed cases including 13 deaths (CFR 39%) were reported in 2021.

According to a WHO Update (https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON386), between 1 Jan to 22 May 2022, the health authorities of the Republic of Iraq notified WHO of 212 cases of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), of which 115 (54%) were suspected and 97 (46%) laboratory-confirmed; there were 27 deaths, 14 in suspected cases and 13 in laboratory confirmed cases. The number of cases reported in the 1st 5 months of 2022 is much higher than that reported in 2021, when 33 laboratory confirmed cases were recorded. Cases have been reported in several areas (governorates) in Iraq and the outbreak may pose additional pressure to an already over-stretched health care system.

Iraq has issued stricter hygiene standards for livestock slaughterhouses, which ban the slaughter of livestock outside the designated places. - Mod.UBA]

The public relations arm of the Veterinary Medicine Services in Iran has announced the formation of the National Committee to Combat Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, given the importance of combating this disease and reducing the number of infected people.

The Veterinary Services stressed that its priorities are to inform the Iranian people and spread the culture of benefiting from healthy meat and special issues to prevent this dangerous disease.

The Veterinary Services indicated that the citizens' commitment to the instructions issued by the [country's] veterinary organization would prevent the disease from causing any danger to their lives, calling on them to take care of the following:

1. Spray disinfectants in places where there are livestock and sterilize them.
2. Refrain from touching the splatters and blood of animals.
3. Refraining from slaughtering sheep in unlicensed areas.
4. Buying meat from places that are subject to the supervision of the Veterinary Services and refrain from buying it from individuals on the roads.
5. Keeping the meat of livestock that has been slaughtered for 24 hours in the refrigerator.
6. Using long clothes, special shoes, masks and glasses during slaughter.
7. Not eating raw or semi-cooked liver.
8. The disease-causing virus is very sensitive to heat, so cooking meat leads to its elimination.
9. In the event that a person sustains any wound to the body or skin during slaughter and signs of disease appear, the injured should immediately go to a health center.

The Ministry of Health announced that 30 people have been infected with this disease, while 2 people have died so far.

It is worth noting that Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is the most common viral disease transmitted by ticks among humans. Infection with the causative agent of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae) is transmitted mainly by camel and cattle ticks. Human-to-human transmission can occur, usually in a health care setting, as a result of direct contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other body fluids of infected individuals.

The disease begins with a sudden onset of flu-like symptoms and may progress to severe bleeding and can be fatal if left untreated (the current case fatality rate is 10-40%).

An Iranian health official warns that 30 people have been diagnosed with the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the country, advising those in contact with the livestock to take precautions against the viral disease.

Amin Assadi, a senior official with the Iran Veterinary Services, said on Saturday [25 Jun 2022] that 2 out of the 30 individuals who contracted the virus had lost their lives so far.

The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons or animals. Farmers and those who work in slaughterhouses face a higher risk of the infection.

The Iranian official urged livestock breeders to get rid of ticks by spraying pesticides on their farms, among other methods of disinfection.

Symptoms of CCHF may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. Complications may include liver failure.

In those who survive, recovery generally occurs around 2 weeks after onset.

Congo Virus has taken yet another life in the country as a man admitted at Peshawar's Hayatabad Medical Complex breathed his last on Friday [24 Jun 2022].

The medical complex spokesman said that presently 3 patients of the virus were under treatment at the hospital while one patient was discharged following his recovery.

As many as 7 days back, on 17 Jun 2022, a private news channel reported that a serious threat of Congo Virus loomed over Rahim Yar Khan as 3 suspected patients had been admitted to the city's Sheikh Zayed Hospital (SZH); all of whom were butchers by profession.

The administration of the SZH had admitted all these 3 patients to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patients were identified as [FH], 22, from Mohalla Sadat, 22-year-old [M] and 17-year-old [H], both residents of Mohalla Qamarabad in Rahim Yar Khan.

Cases of Congo fever are on the rise in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as 1 of the 4 patients admitted to Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) Peshawar died of the disease.

The health department has asked the relevant officials in all the districts of the province to send specimens from the suspected patients to the public health reference laboratory at Khyber Medical University.

Health experts have warned the people against coming into close contact with animals at cattle markets or during sacrificial rituals on Eidul Azha. They have asked for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests at the district hospitals for immediate diagnosis as health facilities have started receiving patients infected with Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF).

"CCHF is usually transmitted by ticks and through contact with infected animal via blood. Last year [2021], a Class-IV employee died when he came into contact with an infected patient at one of the medical teaching institutions. Bites by ticks cause the infection," said a senior physician.

The doctors at Hayatabad Medical Complex admitted 4 Congo fever patients. Two of the patients were confirmed while the others were being investigated when one of them breathed his last.

"The cases of Congo virus are on the rise as currently 4 patients are under-treatment at one of the medical wards only. Two of the patients could afford the Congo PCR from Aga Khan University and Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre that charge Rs15 000 and Rs13 000 [USD 73.53 and 63.73], respectively, for the tests," a physician told Dawn a few hours ago the death of one of the patients.

On Wednesday [22 Jun 2022], the staffers of the hospital were collecting contributions to conduct PCR tests of the other 2 patients but a team from the directorate-general of health services (DGHS), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, visited the hospital and informed them that the investigations could be conducted free of cost at public health reference laboratory of Khyber Medical University.

"We are also issuing a circular to ask all the hospitals throughout the province to dispatch specimens from the suspected patients to the KMU," a senior official at DGHS told Dawn.

The KMU laboratory is also conducting PCR tests to diagnose not only Congo but also cholera, typhoid, dengue and COVID-19. "The PHRL is receiving 4 to 5 samples per day. We have informed the medical superintendents of district headquarters hospitals and directors of the medical teaching institutions to send samples to PHRL," said the official.

Physicians at the hospitals want the health department to ensure that the tests are conducted at the district level hospitals. "During COVID-19, the health department established 17 PCR laboratories in as many districts, therefore, those should be used for Congo tests also. It will take much longer for the districts to send samples to Peshawar and wait for results," a senior physician said.

Officials, however, said that it required specialised staff, currently available only in PHRL, to conduct Congo PCR tests.

The physician said that each medical teaching institution had the machine to conduct PCR tests for COVID-19. He added that KMU only needed to purchase the probe to make that possible.

"If we cannot control the disease, it least we can help those, who suffer from it, by offering to them a test, which is beyond affordability of people in the current economic hardship. The disease can transmit from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids. The patients require supportive medication, anti-viral drugs and maintenance of fluids level in their bodies," he said.

The health expert said that government needed to direct the relevant department to ensure that the people did not come into contact with animals and stay safe from the disease, which had about 40% mortality.

On normal days, only the professional people, such as butchers and cleaners at the slaughter house risk the Congo fever but now the risk is high as people are visiting cattle markets to buy sacrificial animals for Eidul Azha.

"People are used to roaming with sacrificial animals before Eid in the streets and on Eid day. It is considered a religious obligation to touch the animal, which endangers their lives," said the physician.

Russian scientists have uncovered a new strain of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), the press service of the Sechenov University told TASS on Tuesday [28 Jun 2022].

"A new strain of the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been discovered in the south of Russia," the report said.

The study was conducted by the staff of the Sechenov University, the Stavropol Research Anti-Plague Institute, the Pasteur Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology and the Central Research Institute of Epidemiology.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this virus is transmitted to humans mainly by ticks and livestock. It can be transmitted from person to person by contact with blood, secretions or other bodily fluids.

The Sechenov University noted that the main and most dangerous symptom of the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever is internal bleeding, also known as internal hemorrhaging. "The disease itself develops rapidly; in severe cases, sudden liver or lung failure can occur after 5 days of the illness. Death occurs in about 30% of cases, as early as in the 2nd week of the illness. Different versions of the virus cause various severities of the disease," the press service added.

The university noted that the epidemiological situation with the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever in Russia is difficult. According to scientists, outbreaks are regularly recorded in the Stavropol Region, Rostov, the Astrakhan and Volgograd Regions, Kalmykia, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino Balkaria. The virus is widespread in a number of countries in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and some Asian states. However, there is no vaccine to protect humans or animals against the virus. Treatment is limited to supportive symptomatic therapy.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

Sheep and cattle husbandry is very common in Iraq. Studies have shown that these animals are regularly infested with tick species, mainly _Hylomma_ species, the principal vector of CCHF.

Human cases of CCHF are mainly treated with general supportive care. The antiviral drug ribavirin, both oral and intravenous formulations, has been used to treat CCHF infection. However, no evidence from randomized clinical trials has demonstrated the effectiveness of ribavirin for treating CCHF. There is currently no vaccine available for either people or animals. - Mod.UBA
