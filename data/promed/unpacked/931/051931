Iowa
------
Two boys from central Iowa are recovering from [hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome]. The 12- and 13-year-old boys reportedly caught the virus when
they picked up a mouse while playing on some railroad tracks near their
hometown of Gilman. The two boys are expected to make a full recovery.
[These are the first cases reported from Iowa this year, as of 28
May 1999 there have been a total of 3 cases of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome from Iowa according to the CDC website:

Washington State
----------------------
Health oficials confirmed last week's [hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome = HPS] case Monday morning, June 7. Officials notified
the Klickitat County Public Health Department that a woman in the
Goldenadle area had been hospitalized with [HPS]. Analysis was completed
Monday using two methods, both tests were positive. Testing was done in
Seattle using a method that was developed in New Mexico during the Four
Corners epidemic in 1993 while the other test, completed in Portland by an
Oregon State lab, used a method developed by the Centers for Disease
Control.
According to Matt Schanz, Environmental Health Specialist for Klickitat
County, the county Health Department is giving away literature regarding
deer mice and [hantaviruses] to anyone in the community concerned
about the disease.
The deer mouse is the most common mammal in Klickitat County [as it is in
most of North America]. Considering the number of mice and the people that
interact with them, it proves how rare the disease is considering that it
is the 19th case in the State of Washington [at least the second case in
Klickitat County], Schanz said [nice sentence - CHC].

Arizona
----------
A 45-year-old Apache County woman has died after being infected with the
hantavirus. There have been 27 cases of hantavirus reported in Arizona in
the past six years.
[This is the same case reported earlier. Onset was in early May. She
ied early 4 weeks later from post HPS complications. There has been
one other confirmed case in Arizona in 1999, a 71 year old man from
Coconino County; onset of his illnes was in late May. - Mod CHC]

Colorado
------------
A 47-year-old Loveland man who contracted [HPS] last week
remains in critical condition in a Greeley hospital. Doctors say
his case is the first among Front Range residents this year.
[Not only the first this year among residents of the Front Range (what we
here call the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado) but the
first HPS case ever diagnosed in a Front Range resident. Loveland is about
10 miles south of Fort Collins, so we have a heightened awareness of the
risks. There also was an HPS case near Durango (see news story below)
in southwestern Colorado where prevalence [in wild rodents] of antibody
to Sin Nombre virus, the ostensible etiologic agent of all these infections,
has hovered about 40% for many weeks. As so many have predicted,
this could be a year in which serious numbers of HPS cases occur in the
United States, particularly in the Four Corners states (Colorado, Utah,
Arizona, and New Mexico). - Mod CHC]

Colorado
------------
Health officials confirm that a 19-year-old La Plata County [Durango] man
came down with a mild case of [HPS] last week. The man tested positive for
the virus but has not developed the severe symptoms typically associated
with the disease. He was released from a Denver hospital after [he was
tested].
[By "tested positive for the virus", I believe means "has antibody to Sin
Nombre virus at a titer sufficiently high as to make a *presumptive*
serodiagnosis". I wonder how many HPS cases can be considered
"confirmed", rather than "presumptive". - Mod CHC]
