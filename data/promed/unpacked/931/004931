The hunting tick _Hyalomma marginatum_ has been found on a mammal in Norway. Experts ask people to be observant if they find ticks that differ from Norwegian tick species.

The hunting tick _Hyalomma marginatum_ was detected this autumn [2021] on a horse in Vestby municipality [Viken County]. This is a hunting tick, a species that seeks out host animals, says biologist Yvonne Kerlefsen at the tick center to NTB [the Norwegian news agency].

While ordinary Norwegian forest ticks sit still in bushes and on grass and bite into passing host animals, the hunting tick is 3 times as large and runs after its prey. As if that were not enough, the giant tick can carry hemorrhagic fever -- Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. The virus can cause serious illness in humans and has a mortality rate of around 30%. The disease is widespread in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Some cases have been seen in southern Europe, but fortunately this is not a disease we have in Norway, says Kerlefsen. Hemorrhagic fever refers to several different viral infections, including Ebola. The diseases are usually not related. They cause characteristic symptoms with heavy bleeding and high mortality, and have occurred especially in tropical and subtropical countries.

The person who sent in the tick must have been stunned by the appearance. This tick species is easy to distinguish from our common forest tick due to its size, color, and the fact that it has white rings on its legs. Reports from Europe indicate that hunting ticks are spreading northwards. It is commonest in Asia and the Middle East, but has also established itself in parts of south eastern Europe. In recent years, it has been found sporadically in northern Europe.

"I was 90% sure when I saw the picture of the tick, but to be sure it was sent to a veterinarian who identified it under a microscope," Kerlefsen says. No one knows how the horse in Vestby municipality got the tick. The tick species is mainly transported to new areas with mammals or migratory birds, and has so far only been observed sporadically on migratory birds. Like insects and spiders, ticks can also be imported in cargo and luggage. The horse has not been abroad, says Kerlefsen.

If you discover unusual ticks, people are encouraged to take a picture of the tick, take care of it if possible, and contact the Tick Center.

"We do not think it is about to establish itself in Norway, but there may be some underreporting," says Kerlefsen. Climate change, which in particular leads to hot summers, may lead to new tick species, including the hunting tick, being able to establish themselves in the long run.

Reporting and submission of unusual tick species can contribute to a better overview and can be done at the Tick Center, Folkehelsa [Norwegian Institute of Public Health] or NMBU [Norwegian University of Life Sciences] Veterinary College.

This tick is unlike temperate zone forest ticks in that it is larger and can pursue its hosts over distances of several meters. This tick can be transported on migratory passerine birds and that may be the way it came to Norway. Apparently, just a single tick was found on the horse. As the above report mentions, it is unlikely that this tick species has become established in Norway. This tick has become established in southern Europe and carried Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) there. Continued surveillance in Norway and testing of any of these ticks for CCHFV would be prudent. - Mod.TY
