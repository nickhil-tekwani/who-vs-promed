Calgary teens eat bad food
--------------------------
Health officials believe more than a dozen teens, who developed symptoms of
_Escherichia coli_ poisoning, all ate at the same place. Calgary Health
Region spokesman Leanne Niblock said a provincial lab confirmed, late Fri
17 Sep 2004, that at least 12 teens were infected with the bacteria. None
of the teens was admitted to hospital.
"We're confident that we have it pinpointed to a source, because it seems
that most of the teens ate at the same establishment," Niblock said. She
also said the main symptom associated with the bacteria is bloody diarrhea,
often of sudden onset.
The health authority did not release the name of the establishment at which
it believed the teens came into contact with the bacteria. The Canadian
Food Inspection Agency is assisting with the investigation, Niblock said.
"We are conducting an investigation, and we have inspectors at the
establishment," she said.

undercooked ground beef, perhaps even related to the multiprovince recall
