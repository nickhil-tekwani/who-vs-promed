[Re: ProMED-mail Bluetongue, ovine - Australia: (WA) 20140826.2722447]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The title of the article is misleading, as the article is referring to a routine change to the bluetongue zone as a result of surveillance conducted in sentinel cattle herds though the Australian National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP).

There has been no change to Australia's current bluetongue status. Australia remains free from clinical bluetongue disease in all ruminant species (cattle, sheep, goats, and others). Bluetongue virus type 8 (BTV 8), that has caused disease both in cattle and sheep in Europe, has not been detected in Australia.

The Australian government established the NAMP over 30 years ago because some countries with which Australia trades are concerned about bluetongue virus. In far northern Australia a small number of types of bluetongue virus isolated from healthy cattle have shown to cause clinical disease experimentally in sheep. These types of bluetongue are confined to the far north of Australia and have not been found in other areas of Australia despite 30 years of surveillance under the NAMP program. Sheep are generally not raised in far northern Australia because the climatic conditions are not suitable for the major commercial breeds of sheep used in Australia. Clinical disease has never been observed in the Australian commercial sheep flock.

The NAMP is a long running, sophisticated, Australia wide surveillance program primarily designed to demonstrate to Australian trading partners the distribution of bluetongue viruses in Australia. The system can be accessed through the web address http://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/programs/disease-surveillance/national-arbovirus-monitoring-program/. This site publishes a map of distribution of bluetongue viruses in Australia that is updated in "real time" as results of bluetongue surveillance are received. The changes to the bluetongue zones in Australia are related to changes in vector distribution that is linked to normal seasonal variations in climatic conditions. The zone boundary is extended immediately the results of testing are received, but contracts only after 2 years of negative surveillance.

During 2014, the NAMP has identified a seasonal change to the bluetongue virus zone though routine surveillance in sentinel cattle herds. This has resulted in Australian animal health authorities adjusting the bluetongue virus affected zones. As a result, some pastoral properties like the ones referred to in the ProMED article, have become ineligible to be identified as free from bluetongue virus. This affects the eligibility of cattle to be exported to some trading partners which have specific market access requirements relating to bluetongue virus. By taking this action, trading partners can be assured that Australian animal health authorities are rigorously enforcing their market access requirements and adjusting the Australian bluetongue zone to reflect seasonal changes in the distribution of bluetongue viruses in Australia.

Australia works closely with trading partners to ensure that live animals exported from Australia meet their import requirements. Australia is committed to safe trade in live animals. Australia is also a committed member of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and meets all it disease reporting commitments through this organisation.
