Sri Lanka health officials have reported an increase in the number cases of the bacterial disease, leptospirosis during the 1st 5 months of 2018. From January-May 2017, authorities reported 1022 cases; however, for the same period in 2018, 1525 cases were reported. The districts seeing the most leptospirosis cases year-to-date include Kalutara [Western province], Ratnapura [Sabaragamuwa province], Monaragala [Uva province], and Gampaha [Western province]. For Colombo district in the 1st 5 months of 2017, 47 cases were reported. This has been nearly doubled in 2018 with 91 cases.

The ColomboPage reports the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) Director and Epidemiologist Dr Paba Palihawadana has warned the public to take precautions to protect themselves leptospirosis due to the current rainy weather. Persons at greatest risk of contracting leptospirosis are farmers and agricultural workers, sanitation workers and sewer workers. However, anyone exposed to rat contaminated water and soil is also at risk of contracting the disease.

[Leptospirosis occurs worldwide and is endemic in Sri Lanka. Leptospirosis frequently occurs after flooding during 2 monsoon seasons in Sri Lanka, which bring rain to the west and southwest coasts from May to September; and the east coast and northern region between October and February (https://www.selectiveasia.com/sri-lanka-holidays/weather). The news report above says that districts seeing the most leptospirosis cases year-to-date include Kalutara, Ratnapura, Moneragala, and Gampaha, as well as the city of Colombo.

The city of Colombo, the commercial capital and largest city of Sri Lanka, is located on the west coast of the island nation. Colombo, Kalutara, and Gampaha are districts within the Western province. Monaragala district is located in Uva province and Ratnapura district is located in Sabaragamuwa Province. A map of Sri Lanka provinces can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Sri_Lanka.

Leptospirosis has also occurred in Sri Lanka during periods of severe drought, when it has been attributed to exposure to _Leptospira_-contaminated water in a network of thousands of man-made reservoirs, known locally as 'tanks,' that are used for preserving the rainfall primarily for agriculture and drinking water, but also for sacred bathing (see ProMED-mail Leptospirosis, fatal - Sri Lanka (02): (NW) 20110913.2785).

How the diagnosis of leptospirosis was made is not mentioned in the news release. Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of the disease, the diagnosis of leptospirosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. Consequently, leptospirosis is probably under-diagnosed.

Reported rates of leptospirosis have increased dramatically since 2006 in Sri Lanka, where 20.3 percent of cattle and 17.5 percent of rodents are infected. People at greatest risk for acquiring the disease in Sri Lanka are reported to be paddy farmers and sugar cane plantation workers (see ProMED-mail Leptospirosis, fatal - Sri Lanka (03): (NW) background 20110913.2794.) - Mod.ML
