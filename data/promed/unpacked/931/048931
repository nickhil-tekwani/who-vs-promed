Humanitarian agencies are warning of a major cholera outbreak in Gao in eastern Mali due to lack of access to clean drinking water. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says that over 60 per cent of Gao's population of 70 000 people have no access to clean drinking water.

Already, 22 cases of cholera have been reported in Gao with 2 fatalities. Jens Laerke from OCHA says although no new cases have been reported in the past 5 days, the risk of cholera remains high: "Some neighborhoods in Gao do not have water at all due to dysfunctional pumps and lack of electricity. Outside of the city, the situation is even worse because the Niger River is the only source of water, and there are concerns about cholera outbreaks. There is food distribution ongoing to about 1/3rd of the population in Gao, but that covers only part of the needs, according to the mission participants."

[2] Cholera, Malian refugees - Niger (Tillaberi region)

The United Nations refugee agency said that they are working to contain a cholera outbreak in Niger in a refugee camp for people fleeing the conflict in Mali. Melissa Fleming, the chief spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement on Tue 21 May 2013 that a total of 7 people have died from cholera in recent weeks. They include 2 refugees who died in the Mangaize camp, currently housing 15 000 refugees in the Tillaberi region of Niger, located close to the Malian border.

On 11 May 2012, the government of Niger declared a cholera epidemic. In 2012, a total of 110 people died throughout Niger.

This year's [2013] epidemic could be worse because of the concentration of refugees. Niger is currently housing some 50 000 Malian refugees, said the statement.

[3] Cholera, Malian refugees - Niger (Tillaberi region)

A cholera epidemic declared by the Niger government on 11 May 2013 has left 7 people dead in the west of the country, including 2 Malian refugees. The 2 refugees are a 45 year old man who died on 13 May 2013, and a 3 year old boy who passed away on 19 May 2013, after arriving at the health center at a late stage of the disease. Both were refugees in the Mangaize camp, which hosts 15 000 in the Tillaberi region.

To date, 248 cases have been registered in the Tillaberi region, including 31 cases among refugees in Mangaize and Tabareybarey camps.

In 2012, a cholera epidemic affected 5287 people and killed 110 throughout Niger. The region of Tillaberi was the most affected with 4792 cases and 87 deaths. No refugee died at that time.

Cholera outbreaks are recurrent in Niger, one of the poorest countries in the world. Niger is currently hosting some 50 000 Malian refugees, including 31 000 in 3 camps in the Tillaberi region. They fled a conflict in the North of their country which started in early 2012.

[4] Cholera - Uganda (Nebbi District)
Date: Wed 29 May 2013

Four people have been confirmed dead and 39 others admitted following a fresh cholera outbreak in Panyimur sub-county, Nebbi district. This brings to 54 the number of people killed by cholera and over 1900 cases registered since the 1st outbreak was reported in the district in March 2012.

Henry Kimu, in charge of the Dei Health Centre III in Panyimur sub-county, said 3 of the dead are Congolese nationals. Kimu said on Wed 29 May 2013 that the 1st case was reported at the health center on 24 May 2013 after a resident of Dei Village was admitted at the health centre showing clinical signs and symptoms similar to the disease.

"The challenge is that we are out of IV fluids and ORS, which are the core medicines for cholera treatment, and it seems they are equally out of stock in the district," Kimu said.

The latest revelation also came just less than months of yet another outbreak that left one person dead and over 20 cases infected by the disease in April 2013.

At least 260 people were killed between January and May 2013 by a cholera outbreak in Minova City, South Kivu, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, said the Ministry of Health.

According to an official, 350 cases of cholera have been diagnosed since January 2013 in the area, of which 260 were fatal.

In a statement to the station Congolese Radio Okapi, the chief doctor of Minova health district, Chito Bagula, stressed the need to resume chlorination of water in the area to prevent the spread of the disease.

[A case fatality rate of 260/350 or 72 per cent is more than 10 times larger than what generally occurs with cholera. If these cases are indeed cholera, over 10 times more overall cases likely occurred.
