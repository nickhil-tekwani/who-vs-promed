Epidemiological comments: On [29 Mar 2021], district livestock officer (DLO) was notified by a farmer on severe skin disease and abscesses in a beef cattle farm. The clinical appearance in some of the animals included several skin nodules (2-5 cm [0.8-2 in] in diameter), high fever, inappetite, and lymph node enlargement. The initial diagnosis after the clinical examination was bacterial infection and external parasite. However, after treatment with antibiotics and ivermectin for approximately one week, the clinical signs did not improve, and the skin nodules started to develop to severe ulcer. Therefore, DLO immediately notified the Provincial Livestock officer for further sample collection according to the lumpy skin disease clinical surveillance guideline provided by the Department of Livestock Development (DLD) earlier. The collected samples were whole blood in EDTA, scab and skin lesions, which were submitted to the National Institute of Animal Health for confirmation.

Control measures applied in domestic: zoning, surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone, screening, quarantine, movement control inside the country, disinfection, control of vectors, stamping out
