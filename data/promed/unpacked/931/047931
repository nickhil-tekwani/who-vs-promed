A serologic analysis suggests that a group of arenaviruses found in
North American wood rats can infect humans, according to a new report
from Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID).

Studies since the 1990s have shown that North American Tacaribe
serocomplex viruses, a group that includes the Whitewater Arroyo virus
(WWAV) and 7 others, are widely distributed in wood rats in the United
States and Mexico, says the report by authors from the University of
Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). They analyzed serum and other samples that were
collected from 1185 US patients who had neurologic or undifferentiated
febrile diseases from 1989 through 2000. Antibodies against an
arenavirus were found in samples from 41 (3.5 percent) of the
patients.

The apparent corresponding virus in 10 patients was WWAV and in
another 24 patients was lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; the
pathogen in 7 patients was indeterminate. In 2 patients in particular,
an increase in WWAV antibody titer between early and later samples
suggested that the virus caused the illness. The findings "strengthen
the notion that Tacaribe serocomplex viruses enzootic in North America
are infectious in humans," the report says. The authors call for
studies to define the clinical spectrum of diseases caused by these
viruses, saying the illnesses may include aseptic meningitis,
encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis.

[The arenaviruses are divided into 2 groups, the Old-World LCMV/Lassa
complex, associated with the murid subfamily _Murinae_, and the
New-World Tacaribe Complex associated with the murid subfamily
_Sigmodontinae_. Previously, the Tacaribe serocomplex viruses had not
been associated with human illness. The above report presents evidence
for the involvement of Tacaribe complex viruses in human disease, but
numerically the evidence is not strong and the associated disease
pattern not clearly defined. Indeed, the evidence was strongest for
involvement of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is an
arenavirus classified in the disease-associated Old world complex of
arenaviruses, not in the Tacaribe Complex. Nonetheless, these findings
deserve to be pursued. - Mod.CP]
