The mumps outbreak that started in August 2006 in Navarra affected
more than 800 people, and new cases are still being reported, between
70 and 100 every week. A vaccine advisory committee will gather next
Monday, and they will propose that young people between 18 and 20
years old should be immunized again. According to what the committee
decides, immunization may start in 7-8 days in health care facilities.
Measles are still prevalent in Navarra, in young people between 18
and 20 years old, and it is a disease transmitted though particle
inhalation. The Public Health Institute is studying the current
situation in this group, who had the lowest vaccine coverage when
they were 15 months old. New vaccine doses will be administered if
persons had received the triple viral vaccine only once, or if they
had never been immunized.
Mumps vaccine used to be administered at 15 months of age, and a
booster dose was given at 11 years of age. The currently affected
group was immunized with the Rubini strain, which was proven to be
less efficacious when administered in the 2nd dose. Those who have
already had the disease do not need any additional immunization against mumps.
The data indicating there are 3600 vulnerable young people is a 1st
estimate with respect to those who may possibly receive the vaccine.
