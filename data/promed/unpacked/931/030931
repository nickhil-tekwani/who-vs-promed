The following background information on dengue in Australia was extracted
from the GIDEON software program.
Dengue is commonly reported from North Queensland and the Torres Strait
islands. Outbreaks probably begin with introduced cases. The vector (_Aedes
aegypti_) is common throughout north Queensland.

An epidemic in 1921 affected 560,000 in the Queensland-New South Wales
areas. Epidemics were reported from Townsville (Queensland) during 1954 to
1955 (15,000 cases). Additional epidemics occurred in Townsville and Cairns
during 1981 to 1983 (over 450
cases reported, with true number estimated at 3,000. [There were no cases
of DHF or fatalities. In 1990 to 1991 [there were 46 cases, 43 of these
from Queensland), and [in 1992 to 1993, 421 cases.
Epidemics were also reported in the Torres Straits in 1981, 1990 to 1991,
and March 1992 to February 1993 (652 cases). One hundred and eight cases
were reported in 1996. Two hundred and one cases were reported, and 109
confirmed in Torres Strait during December 1996 to June 1997. Seven cases
were confirmed in Cairns during April to June 1997. Fifteen cases of dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) were reported in 1979, none fatal. Seventeen [cases
of dengue were reported in 1994, and 34 in 1995.
