The politicization of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic may be increasing vaccine hesitancy for other vaccinations once considered routine, particularly inoculations for preventable childhood diseases. This hesitancy has exacerbated a measles outbreak in central Ohio, health officials said.

Mysheika Roberts, the health commissioner of Columbus, Ohio, said during a media briefing by the Big Cities Health Coalition (BCHC) that of the approximately 106 cases of measles in the United States in 2022, "as of this morning (20 Dec [2022]) we have 81 confirmed cases here in central Ohio."

Dr Roberts, the board chair of BCHC, which comprises the public health officials in 35 of the nation's largest metropolitan areas, serving a population of 61 million -- or one in 5 Americans -- said, "Coming off the heels of this worldwide pandemic, communities are now facing a tripledemic of disease. Health systems all across the country are being overrun with cases of RSV [respiratory syncytial virus], COVID-19, and now the flu.

"We are also faced with a 'new,' and yes, preventable, disease outbreak, and that disease is measles," she added. She said central Ohio is experiencing the largest outbreak of measles in the United States since 2019.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the 106 cases of measles are occurring in 5 jurisdictions (https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html). Of the 81 cases in central Ohio, 29 patients have been hospitalized, according to Dr Roberts. Reasons for the hospitalizations range from dehydration to pneumonia, as well as neurologic conditions with some patients requiring intensive care.

CDC estimates that hospitalization rates for measles are usually 20% to 25%, but "our hospitalization rate is much higher". Dr Roberts attributed the rate to the cases' young ages. With measles, young children can easily become dehydrated, she said, and are more likely to require hospitalization.

"Seventy-six of these 81 cases are unvaccinated, most by choice, while 22 cases are under the age of 12 months, so they're too young to be vaccinated. The remaining cases are old enough to have at least one MMR [measles-mumps-rubella] vaccine; 23 cases are old enough for 2 of the MMR vaccines as recommended," Dr Roberts said. Of the 81 cases, 76 are 5 years old and under, she said.

"Our investigation, thus far, has shown that parents chose not to have their children vaccinated due to a persistent and incorrect belief that the MMR vaccine causes autism," Dr. Roberts said. "While we continue to address this outbreak and the causes of it, we know that it is indicative of what's to come if current vaccine attitudes persist in the United States."

"Over the winter holidays, the nation's public health officials, such as our BCHC members, are working to marshal still-scarce resources to fight these emerging and ongoing health threats," said Chrissie Juliano, the BCHC executive director. "At the same time, they're confronting a public that is increasingly skeptical of vaccines. Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have to save lives and avoid severe disease."

Ms Juliano cited a poll released 16 Dec [2022] by the Kaiser Family Foundation (https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/press-release/more-than-4-in-10-republicans-and-a-third-of-parents-now-oppose-schools-requiring-children-to-get-vaccinated-for-measles-and-other-illness-up-since-the-covid-19-pandemic-began/) that found that "overall, nearly 3 in 10 adults (28%) nationally now say that parents should be able to decide not to vaccinate their children for measles, mumps, and rubella rather than those vaccinations being required to attend public schools, up from 16% in a 2019 Pew Research Center poll conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic."

Opposition to childhood vaccination among parents is about 35%, up from 23% in 2019, according to Ms Juliano. "This is an increase since the beginning of the COVID pandemic," Ms Juliano said. "I want to stress that this skepticism is about routine vaccination requirements that have been in place for years and are not specific to COVID. Data show that these attitudes are starting to affect behavior. More children are missing their MMR vaccine since the pandemic began. This trend has real consequences." She called the measles outbreak in Ohio "a dangerous step backwards."

Dr Roberts warned that as vaccines are politicized, "combined with the ongoing and persistent mis- and disinformation on vaccines, which have been nearly impossible to counter even with current data, we are faced with a situation ripe for resurgence of even more vaccine-preventable diseases, much more so than just what we're seeing with measles. Our fear is that if we see more vaccine reluctance or hesitancy moving forward, we are going to see a resurgence of other diseases like hepatitis A or hepatitis B" as well as other preventable diseases like mumps, rubella, and pertussis.

Dr Roberts also noted that while public health officials can isolate confirmed cases of measles, the Ohio state legislature now prohibits quarantining people who were exposed to measles but do not have a confirmed case, even though they have a 90% chance of contracting measles. "That's a perfect example of how we're going backward, and we're not able to use our public health authority for the good of the community," she said. "They can continue to go about their daily lives, go to parties, go to malls, go to the grocery store and expose other people to measles, particularly those who are unvaccinated."

She noted that "these challenges and resulting outbreaks are being met by beleaguered local public health departments like mine, which face chronic underfunding, staff that has burned out from the last several years, and growing mistrust from the public hampering our efforts to protect the health and safety of our communities that we serve." Although there are no quick and easy answers, Dr Roberts said her department is committed to making sure "our communities do not undo all the progress we've made with vaccine-preventable diseases over the last several decades. We are at a very critical point," and this outbreak, as well as the tripledemic, further "illustrates why our work is so important and so crucial."

["37% of the infected children in the current Ohio outbreak have been hospitalized so far, which underscores the fact that we don't have effective treatments. There is no modern medical anti-viral triumph that cures this disease. There is supportive care and correcting vitamin A deficiency, which has been linked to increased risk of death. The modern medical triumph was the vaccine.

"All of the 73 children infected with measles in Ohio, at least through last week, were not fully vaccinated against the disease, with 67 of them having not received any doses; 17 of the infected children were too young to have received their 1st dose. So for most of these kids, their caregivers made a choice to avoid the vaccine." (https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/more-covid-more-measles/) - Mod.LK

Measles outbreak South Africa for 8 Oct - 17 Dec 2022: 277 cases

In total, 227 cases of laboratory-confirmed measles outbreak cases have been reported in South Africa for specimens collected from epidemiological week 40 (ending 8 Oct 2022) to epidemiological week 50 (ending 17 Dec 2022) across all provinces (Table 1 [See URL for figures and tables.]).

From epidemiological week 40-50, 2022, a total of 216 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported from 5 provinces with a declared measles outbreak, namely Limpopo (110 cases), Mpumalanga (64 cases), North West (27 cases), Gauteng (10 cases), and Free State (5 cases) (Table 1). The geographical distribution of cases across South Africa from week 40 until week 50 is shown in Figure 1. The number of cases continues to increase daily as blood and throat swabs are submitted to the NICD for measles serology and PCR testing.

The age of laboratory-confirmed cases across the country ranges from 2 months to 42 years (Table 2). The majority of cases (92, (43%)) were in the 5-9-year age group, followed by 64 (30%) in the 1-4-year age group and 31 (14%) in the 10-14-year age group. Of the 216 cases, the vaccination status of 58 (27%) was known, of whom 22 (38%) were vaccinated (Table 3).

An overview of the outbreak in the Limpopo Province
-----------------------------------------------
In total, 110 cases of laboratory-confirmed measles were reported between epidemiological weeks 40-50, 2022, with the majority of the measles cases reported in the Greater Sekhukhune, Mopani, and Waterberg districts. An outbreak of measles was declared in Limpopo on 11 Oct 2022 (epidemiological week 41, 2022). Figure 3 displays an epidemiological curve from week 40 of 2022 in Limpopo province. Greater Sekhukhune and Mopani reported 30 and 38 cases, respectively, while Waterberg district reported 34 cases.

The age of measles cases across Limpopo ranged from 4 months to 42 years. Measles virus infection affected mostly the age group 5-9 years (Table 2). Of the 110 measles cases, 88 (80%) had an unknown vaccination status, 10 (9%) were vaccinated, and 12 (11%) were unvaccinated (Table 3). In the Waterberg district, 21 cases of 34 have been reported from Witpoort Hospital in Lephalale.

https://www.livemint.com/news/india/measles-mumbai-cases-rise-to-514-tally-in-maharashtra-at-1162-11671931515062.html


Mumbai has reported 2 new cases of measles, taking the total infection tally to 514 while the death toll remains unchanged. Meanwhile, measles cases in Maharashtra stood at 1162 on Friday [23 Dec 2022], while the death toll was 20. Of the 335 beds earmarked for the treatment of measles, only 114 were occupied.

A release by the state government says that 77 827 of the 260 739 children in the 9 month to 5 year age group in 78 health posts have received additional doses of the measles-rubella vaccine. Also, of the 5293 children aged 6-9 months in 21 health posts where the number of cases in the sub-9-month group exceeds 10% of lab-confirmed cases, 1940 were given a "zero dose" of MR vaccine.

The state health department has started a special initiative from 15 Dec [2022] to administer additional doses of measles and rubella vaccines to children aged 9 months to 5 years over a 28-day period.

Measles is a highly infectious virus originating in the nose and throat of an infected child or adult, but it is almost entirely preventable through vaccination. However, it requires 95% vaccine coverage to prevent outbreaks among populations. The commonest symptoms of measles include high fever, tiredness, severe cough, red or bloodshot eyes, and a runny nose. It can also cause red rashes on the body, which start at the head and then spread to various other body parts. Currently, there is no cure for measles, and once a person contracts the virus, it is advisable to get plenty of rest, as the body needs time to recover. Usually, a person recovers from the infection within 10-15 days.
