The secretary of health in the state of San Luis Potosi, Francisco Javier Posadas Robledo, has revealed the confirmation of a 2nd case of cholera in the Huasteca Potosina region, also in an adult, and that there are suspected cases in the capital [San Luis Potosi] but none are confirmed as cholera.

He mentioned that about 3 per cent of all diarrheal episodes were sampled and "we have tested around 2000 samples in the past 2 months and apart from these 2 cases, none produced a positive result for cholera". He added that it is important to strengthen the preventive measures.

[Maps of Cuba can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/8Vk7 and http://cuba.pordescubrir.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nuevas_provincias.jpg. Quivican is a town and municipality in Mayabeque Province of Cuba. It is located in the south west of the province, bordering the Gulf of Batabano. Administratively, Cuba (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Cuba) is divided into 15 provinces and one special municipality not included in any province. The last modification was approved in August 2010 by the Cuban National Assembly, splitting Havana province into 2 new provinces: Artemisa (which incorporates the 3 eastern municipalities of the neighbor Pinar del Rio) and Mayabeque. The new provinces started functioning from 1 Jan 2011. Havana City Province (Ciudad de La Habana) recovered its original name: La Habana (Havana in English). - Mod.LL]

Current status of cholera in the region
---------------------------------------
In Cuba, no new cases have been reported since 23 Aug 2013 [the reported cases in a prison in Mayabeque province have not be officially recognized. - Mod.LL] Between epidemiological week (EW) 27 of 2012 to EW 34 of 2013 [1 Jul 2012-24 Aug 2013], there have been 678 confirmed cholera cases in total, including 3 deaths. The cases have been registered in the provinces of Camaguey, Granma, Guantanamo, Havana, and Santiago de Cuba, as well as in other towns associated with these provinces.

In the Dominican Republic, since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) through EW 40 of 2013 [week ending 5 Oct 2013], the total number of suspected cholera cases reported was 31 070 of which 458 died. In 2013, an increase of cases has been recorded in 2 periods, first between EW 1 to EW 9 [30 Dec 2012-2 Mar 2013] and subsequently between EW 32 and EW 40 [4 Aug-5 Oct 2013] (see Figure 1 - for figures, see source URL above - Mod.LL]. The provinces of Puerto Plata, San Juan, Santiago, and Santo Domingo account for 64 per cent of the suspected cases registered in the last 4 epidemiological weeks. The case fatality rate in 2013, of 2.1 per cent, remains higher than that of 2011, reaching 1.7 per cent and of 2012, with 0.8 per cent. The health authorities are investigating and implementing corresponding response measures.

In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) to 10 Oct 2013, the total number of cholera cases reached 682 573, of which 379 870 were hospitalized (55.6 per cent) and 8330 died. The global case fatality rate has been 1.2 per cent since November 2011, however, with variations between 4.3 per cent in the department of Sud Est to 0.6 per cent in Port-au-Prince. Since the 12 Oct 2013 Epidemiological Update on cholera 2936 new cases and 83 deaths have been registered; all 10 departments of Haiti have registered new cases.

In Mexico, from 9 Sep 2013 to 18 Oct 2013, the Mexico International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) has reported 171 confirmed cases, including 1 death, of infection with toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa. Since the 12 Oct 2013 Epidemiological Update on cholera, there have been 12 new cases, all in the state of Hidalgo. [The 2 reported cases in San Luis Potosi state have not be officially recognized. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]

Of the confirmed cases, 2 (1.2 per cent) are residents of the Federal District, 157 (91.8 per cent are from the state of Hidalgo, 9 (5.3 per cent) are from the state of Mexico, 1 (0.6 per cent) is from the state of San Luis Potosi [and now at least 1 more as reported above - Mod.LL], and 2 (1.2 per cent) are from the state of Veracruz. In total, 86 (50.2 per cent) are female and 85 (49.8 per cent) are male with ages ranging from 3 months old to 88 years old. 39 (23 per cent) of the cases were hospitalized. In the state of Hidalgo the investigation indicated that the river water is the source of contamination.

The health authorities of Mexico continue to: strengthen epidemiological activities at the national level; ensure the availability of inputs and quality of care in medical units; implement actions to ensure access to drinking water and basic sanitation at the community level; and monitor and check the chlorine levels of drinking water.

Health professionals at different levels of the health care system are being trained in cholera prevention, treatment, and control. Public awareness campaigns on water and food safety are being carried out in Spanish and indigenous languages (Nahuatl and Otomi), including national radio messages on the prevention of diarrheal disease. Authorities in the state of Mexico are distributing flyers for public awareness.

This is the 1st local transmission of cholera recorded since the 1991-2001 cholera epidemic in Mexico. The genetic profile of the strain isolated from patients in Mexico presents high similarity (greater than 95 per cent) with the strain that is currently circulating in 3 Caribbean countries (Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Cuba), and is different from the strain that had been circulating in Mexico during more than a decade ago.

Recommendations
---------------
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Mexico with respect to this event. PAHO/WHO reiterates that the recommendations of the Epidemiological Alert on cholera published on 2 Nov 2012 continue to be applicable.

[How the Caribbean strain was introduced into Mexico, presumably in Hildalgo state with contamination of river water, remains unclear.

[The following (from CNN http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/16/health/cholera-fast-facts/) is an overview of cholera:

Facts
-----
- About 200 000 cases are reported to WHO every year. However, WHO believes the true number of cases annually is between 3-5 million, with 100 000 to 120 000 deaths.
- Cholera is contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the fecal bacteria _Vibrio cholerae_.
- The symptoms are usually mild, but about 20 per cent of cases include symptoms of watery diarrhea.
- Dehydration from rapid loss of body fluids is the reason the disease can be so deadly within hours if the patient is not treated.
- Most cases can be treated with oral hydration salts.
- There are 2 2-dose oral vaccines available, Dukoral and ShanChol, but it may take weeks for an individual to have full protection.
- Cholera is rare in industrialized nations.
- People who live in areas with poor or inadequate water treatment, sanitation, and hygiene practices are more likely to get the disease.
- The world is currently experiencing its seventh cholera pandemic, which began in Indonesia in 1961.
