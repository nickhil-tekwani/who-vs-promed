Fever on bioterrorism watch list showing up in Colorado
-------------------------------------------------------
A disease called Q fever, which is on bioterrorism watch lists along with
things like smallpox and anthrax, has shown up in an unusual number of cases
this summer in Colorado, health officials say. The source is probably
diseased livestock such as sheep or goats, health officials said.
The state health department has confirmed 13 human cases in the state in 2005,
including 6 in Weld County. In 2004, there were 3 confirmed cases throughout
Colorado, said John Pape, a state health department epidemiologist.
Q fever, or "query" fever, is caused by a bacterium called _Coxiella
burnetii_. It builds up in [livestock] placental tissues, putting
veterinarians and farmers at high risk, though it is treatable with
antibiotics and is rarely fatal. Symptoms include a high fever and headache,
and may include profuse sweating and hallucinations.
"Most people, even untreated, get better in 2 to 3 weeks," said Dr. Daniel
Mogyoros, an infectious disease specialist with Kaiser Permanente. "Most
doctors go through their training and most of their career without ever seeing
this disease."
Weld County health officials have investigated 6 more possible cases but have
not yet confirmed them, said Jill Burch, a county public health nurse.

[The following is adapted from the CDC site on Q fever (a Category B
bioterrorism disease)
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/qfever/index.htm#Significance%20for%
20Bioterrorism>.
Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, a species of
bacterium that is distributed globally. In 1999, Q fever became a notifiable
disease in the USA, but reporting is not required in many other countries.
Because the disease is underreported, scientists cannot reliably assess how
many cases of Q fever have actually occurred worldwide. Many human infections
are inapparent.
Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other
species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually
cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep
has been linked to infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and
feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are
shed in high numbers in the amniotic fluids and the placenta. The organisms
are resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features
enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Infection
of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that
contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material,
birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very
susceptible to the disease, and only very few organisms may be required to
cause infection.
Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of
the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of
transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission,
are rare.
Only about one-half of all people infected with _C. burnetii_ show signs of
clinical illness. Most acute cases of Q fever begin with sudden onset of one
or more of the following: high fevers (up to 104-105 degrees F), severe
headache, general malaise, myalgia, confusion, sore throat, chills, sweats,
non-productive cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and chest
pain. Fever usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks. Weight loss can occur and persist
for some time. 30 to 50 percent of patients with a symptomatic infection will
develop pneumonia. Additionally, a majority of patients have abnormal results
on liver function tests and some will develop hepatitis. In general, most
patients will recover to good health within several months without any
treatment. Only 1-2 percent of people with acute Q fever die of the disease.
Chronic Q fever, characterized by infection that persists for more than 6
months, is uncommon but is a much more serious disease. Patients who have had
acute Q fever may develop the chronic form as soon as 1 year or as long as 20
years after initial infection. A serious complication of chronic Q fever is
endocarditis, generally involving the aortic heart valves, less commonly the
mitral valve. Most patients who develop chronic Q fever have pre-existing
valvular heart disease or have a history of vascular graft. Transplant
recipients, patients with cancer, and those with chronic kidney disease are
also at risk of developing chronic Q fever. As many as 65 percent of persons
with chronic Q fever may die of the disease.�
Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for acute Q fever. Antibiotic treatment
is most effective when initiated within the first 3 days of illness. A dose of
100 mg of doxycycline taken orally twice daily for 15-21 days is a frequently
prescribed therapy. Quinolone antibiotics have demonstrated good in vitro
activity against _C. burnetii_ and may be considered by the physician. Therapy
should be started again if the disease relapses. Chronic Q fever endocarditis
is much more difficult to treat effectively and often requires the use of
multiple drugs.
Since _Coxiella burnetii_ is a highly infectious agent that is rather
resistant to heat and drying, it is considered relevant in bioterrorism. It
can become airborne and inhaled by humans. A single _C. burnetii_ organism may
cause disease in a susceptible person. This agent could be developed for use
in biological warfare and is considered a potential terrorist threat. - Mod.LL]
