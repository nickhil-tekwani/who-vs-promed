Turkey confirms bird flu
------------------------
Anatolia, quoting officials, said that on Friday [7 Oct 2005], it was
confirmed that the birds in Turkey died of the H5 type of bird flu.
Turkey's agriculture minister confirmed the country's 1st cases of
bird flu, and officials ordered all winged animals and street dogs in
the village where it was detected destroyed as a precaution against
the disease spreading, the Anatolia news agency said.
Military police have also set up roadblocks at the entrance to the
village near Balikesir in western Turkey and are checking all
vehicles entering and exiting, Anatolia said on Saturday [8 Oct 2005].
[Belikesir is situated in the southwestern, Asian part of Turkey's
northwestern Marmara region (which has also a European part). See map

<http://www.hippodromehotel.com/guide/images/turkey_cities_map.gif>].
The birds belonged to a turkey farmer, CNN-Turk reported, saying that
2000 birds died. Anatolia did not cite a number but said that any
animals that did not die of the disease were destroyed.
The outbreak was confirmed by Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker, who
said that Turkish officials had been communicating with officials in
the European Union and other international organizations about the
outbreak, Anatolia reported. Eker did not specify how many birds died
of the disease.
The outbreak was initially brought to officials' attention on
Wednesday [5 Oct 2005], Anatolia said. On Thursday officials went to
the village and destroyed all the birds on the turkey farm that were
still alive and buried them, then disinfected the area, Anatolia said.
That would suggest the scientists have narrowed it down to an H5 type
virus -- the family of the bird flu virus that experts are watching
-- but have not narrowed it further to determine whether it is the
exact strain H5N1 that health officials are particularly worried
about.
"Unfortunately we met with bird flu," Anatolia quoted Eker as saying.
"But everything is under control, every kind of precaution has been
taken so that it doesn't spread."
Officials from the Health Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry were
sent to investigate, CNN-Turk reported.
They ordered all winged animals in the village destroyed Saturday [8
Oct 2005], saying that farmers would be compensated for their losses,
Anatolia said.
The farmer whose birds carried the disease said he had not been
checked by doctors yet and was scared to go near his wife and
children, Anatolia reported.
Eker said the flu was likely carried by birds migrating from the Ural
Mountains, which divide Europe and Asia, across Turkey and into
Africa.
Cases of bird flu were also confirmed Saturday [8 Oct 2005] in
Romania, which borders Turkey [see ProMED reference below].

Turkey culls poultry to stem spread of bird flu-TV

ANKARA, Oct 9 (Reuters) -
Turkey culled about 1500 chickens and turkeys overnight
to prevent the spread of avian flu after reporting its
first outbreak of the disease on a farm near the Aegean
Sea, NTV private television said on Sunday.
The authorities have also imposed a 3 km (2 miles)
quarantine zone around the affected farm, where nearly
2000 turkeys died of the globally feared disease on
Tuesday and Wednesday, the station said.
Officials were not immediately available to confirm the
reports and it was not clear why the first reports of the
outbreak only surfaced on Saturday evening.
"Last night, some 1500 birds were slaughtered," NTV said.
The authorities have drawn up a national action plan, it
said, but gave no details.
The Anatolian state news agency said veterinary teams had killed 600 turkeys
overnight in one farm alone in the affected area of northwestern Turkey as a
precautionary measure. The birds were buried in lime-drenched pits, it said.
The culling will resume on Sunday evening [9 Oct 2005], the agency said.

[The possible spread of H5N1 (final identification yet to be
confirmed) to the coastlines of the Black Sea area (Tulcea, Romania,
Europe in the west, and southern Marmara, Asia in the southwest)
might be a attributed to transmission by migrating birds. These
locations are situated on a main migratory birds flyway; the annual
southwards migration has began in September 2005. As indicated in the
special report "Wild birds and avian influenza" of FAO's Animal
Production and Health Department:" "... it is plausible that HPAI
H5N1 virus could spread from Siberia to the Caspian and Black Sea
areas in the foreseeable future. Some birds are currently nesting in
the newly HPAI affected areas of Novosibirsk and Altai in Russia and
will migrate to the above-mentioned areas for upcoming winter or land
to rest on their way to Africa and Europe. The exact risk will likely
depend on the identification of specific migratory species that carry
H5 viruses without suffering the disease, and knowledge of their
resting areas and wintering grounds combined with the existing
production poultry systems and husbandry.
Bird migration routes run across southwest Asia and some Mediterranean
countries, where bird flu outbreaks could possibly occur". The report includes
a schematic major-flyways map. See:
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-
cards/avian_HPAIrisk.html>.
Final identification of the Romanian and Turkish isolates, and official
confirmation, including epidemiological data, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
[From the map referenced above, it seems clear to me that, at least up until
now, the virus has not been spread by migrating birds, since the direction of
spread has been east-west, cutting across several north-south flyways and
following the frontier between Russia and Kazakhstan westwards from the
Mongolian border. Could there be a flourishing trade in poultry along the
border? - Mod.JW]
