The Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) confirmed that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus that marked the 1st ever incursion of HPAI in Uganda belongs to the H5N8 subtype. This subtype has been making headlines in the past few months as it spread from Asia to the Middle East, Europe, and then Africa, causing massive deaths in a vast number of wild bird species but also outbreaks in poultry.

In early January [2017], Ugandan fishermen informed local authorities of a massive wild bird die-off on the shores of Lake Victoria in Wakiso District. Samples collected from 7 dead and 2 live birds tested positive for H5 HPAI. On 13 Jan 2017, additional samples from 5 domestic ducks and a hen were also confirmed to be positive in Masaka District, about 150 km [about 93 mi] southwest of Wakiso at the western shores of Lake Victoria. Uganda's Ministry for Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries reported the 2 outbreaks immediately, but further testing was necessary to better characterize the virus.

FAO, with funding made available through the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Emerging Pandemic Threat Programme Phase 2 (EPT-2), promptly assisted with laboratory reagents and protocols required to identify the virus sub-type. Samples were shipped by the National Animal Disease Diagnostics and Epidemiology Centre (NADDEC) to the UVRI, where further testing revealed the virus to be H5N8 HPAI.

Advanced genetic analysis will soon tell if this virus is directly related to the one that was first detected in wild birds near Uvsu-Nur Lake in the Russian Federation in June 2016. H5N8 HPAI has since affected 35 countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, leading to the death or slaughter of hundreds of thousands of wild and domestic birds. As a matter of comparison, the largest intercontinental HPAI spread ever recorded was due to the H5N1 subtype in 2005-2006 when it affected 20 nations, some of which are still struggling to control the virus today.

The current outbreak poses a major threat to poultry producers in East Africa. Experiences from other countries and the nature of the poultry sector suggest widespread transmission is likely to occur.

The geographical location of Lake Victoria (shared also by Kenya and Tanzania) and its role as a sanctuary for many wild birds raise the concern that neighbouring countries are at high risk of incursion and that detection of the virus in other areas of the region is to be expected over the next weeks. This spread could occur either via wild birds or through trade with infected poultry or poultry products, should the virus become established in poultry populations.

To date, no human case of H5N8 has been reported, despite a now wide geographical distribution of the virus. Good food safety practices and personal protection when handling dead birds should nevertheless be applied in any case. As a general rule, properly cooked poultry products are, however, safe for consumption.

FAO continues to closely monitor the situation and provide technical assistance to affected countries and those at risk. Since the 1st HPAI detection in Wakiso District, the FAO country office in Uganda has been working hand in hand with the Ministry for Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries and other relevant authorities, providing assistance for outbreak investigation and management. By applying lessons learnt in other countries, FAO is fostering regional approaches for the prevention and control of the ongoing epizootic. It is of utmost importance now to understand where else the virus might already have spread. Countries in the East African Region with wild bird stopover or congregation sites and where poultry production represents an important part of the livestock sector should be on high alert now.

What can countries at risk do now?
- Raise awareness of the general population, poultry producers or marketers and hunters about HPAI, precautionary measures as well as reporting mechanisms for sick or dead birds;
- Provide mechanisms for reporting sick or dead birds (hotlines, collection points);
- Increase surveillance efforts in poultry and dead wild birds;
- Revise and/or enhance biosecurity measures implemented in farms and markets;
- Ensure means for laboratory testing are in place to detect the currently circulating avian influenza viruses;
- Assess levels of preparedness, notably (but not exclusively) the status of contingency plans, field and diagnostic capacities, and material and equipment for rapid response such as disinfectants and personal protective equipment sets;
- Initiate resource mobilization for increased preparedness, communication and, in case of virus incursion, response activities;
- Participate in a regional approach by coordinating activities and sharing information with other countries in the region.

[The FAO article above includes a map showing the affected area.

Uganda reported the event, involving mass mortality in 2 populations of white-winged terns, initially on 16 Jan 2017. The notification included the following epidemiological comments: "There are still continuous deaths of wild ducks and birds along the shores and islands of Lake Victoria in Masaka and Wakiso districts. In Masaka alone, wild and domestic birds are dying at alarming numbers and in Lutembe, wetland white-winged terns are the ones dying. This is already a big threat to over 30 million domestic poultry in Uganda which calls for an urgent response to control the spread of the disease from wild birds to domestic birds". At that time, the causative agent was identified as "pathogenic influenza A virus, serotype H5."

Lake Victoria is situated within 2 major flyways of migrating birds: the 'Black Sea/Mediterranean' and the 'East Africa/West Asia' flyways (see interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/zruagpp).

The current distribution of the HPAI H5N8 virus strain of clade 2.3.4.4 was impressively predicted in FAO's document "H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of clade 2.3.4.4 detected through surveillance of wild migratory birds in the Tyva Republic, the Russian Federation -- potential for international spread," published in September 2016 (see http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6113e.pdf). - Mod.AS]

[2] Concern over bird migration

An outbreak of avian influenza in Uganda that's killed migratory birds on the shores of Africa's biggest lake may spread to other countries in the region.

The virus that has killed at least 1200 wild birds on the shores of Lake Victoria has been confirmed to be H5N8, Nicholas Kauta, a council member at the World Organization for Animal Health, said [Wed 1 Feb 2017] in e-mailed comments.

"The migratory birds affected tend to occupy beaches, hence the fear that the entire Lake Victoria 'coastline' and neighboring water bodies are risky spots," said Kauta, who recently retired as director of animal resources of the Ugandan agriculture ministry. No human infections of the H5N8 strain have been detected so far, according to the World Health Organization.

The disease is thought to have spread in Asia and Europe via wild migratory birds, the WHO said. Uganda is the 3rd African country to report an H5N8 outbreak, after Tunisia and Nigeria, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

The white-winged tern, the bird species infected in Uganda, has a large range and migrates from Europe during the winter. The country shares Lake Victoria with Kenya and Tanzania. The disease also infected a limited number of domestic fowls, the Ugandan government said in a [23 Jan 2017] statement [see at https://www.mediacentre.go.ug/press-release/joint-press-statement-avian-influenza-bird-flu-outbreak].

Uganda's avian flu outbreak, along with an armyworm invasion on the continent, will be discussed at a meeting of the Food & Agriculture Organization on [14 Feb 2017] in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, it said in an e-mailed statement. The virus stands to spread south due to migration patterns, it said. Countries south of Uganda include Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

[It is important to bear in mind that highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as the H5N8 cause severe disease in most bird species. Therefore, only the very few species that suffer long subclinical viremia would be able to migrate and carry it to novel regions. White-winged terns are migratory, but were highly affected by H5N8. The relevant point is that they share feeding grounds with other migratory birds that may become infected while being tolerant to the virus. It is thought that this could be the case for some species in the Anatidae family (ducks, swan, geese). - Mod.PMB
