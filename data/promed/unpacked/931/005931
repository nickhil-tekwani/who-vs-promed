New data on quarantine pests and pests of the EPPO Alert List
-----------------------------------------------
By browsing through the CABI Abstracts, the EPPO Secretariat has
extracted the following new data concerning quarantine pests and
pests included on the EPPO Alert List. The situation of the pest
concerned is indicated in bold, using the terms of ISPM no. 8.
New records:
-----------
Peach latent mosaic pelamoviroid
--------------------------------
(formerly on the EPPO A lists) is reported for the 1st time from Bosnia and
Herzegovina (Matic et al., 2004). Present, 1st found in 2004.
During a survey in 17 orchards in the northern and Sahel regions of
Tunisia, Peach latent mosaic pelamoviroid (formerly on the EPPO A
lists) was detected for the 1st time (Fekih Hassen et al., 2004).
Present, 1st found in 2004.
Grapevine yellows
-----------------
In Ukraine, typical symptoms of grapevine yellows were observed in
vineyards in the Ovidiopolskij region (near Odessa) which had been
planted in 2000 with cv. Chardonnay. Molecular studies revealed the
presence of a stolbur phytoplasma (associated with bois noir
disease). It is noted that the vector, _Hyalesthes obsoletus_, is
reported to be present in southern Ukraine. This is the 1st
documented report of a stolbur phytoplasma infecting grapevines in
Ukraine which confirms earlier observations (Milkus et al., 2004).
Present, confirmed in 2004 near Odessa.
Detailed records:
----------------
Cucumber vein yellowing ipomovirus
----------------------------------
(EPPO A2 list) occurs in courgette, cucumber, melon and watermelon grown in
protected conditions in Andalusia, Spain (Anonymous, 2003a).
_Heterodera glycines_
---------------------
[soybean cyst nematode] (EPPO A1 list) is reported for the 1st time from
North Dakota in USA (Bradley et al., 2004).
Iris yellow spot tospovirus
---------------------------
(IYSV - EPPO Alert List) is reported from Oregon (US). During 2004, a few
onion seed crops in Jefferson county in central Oregon showed severe
symptoms. The presence of the virus was confirmed in these affected crops
(Crowe & Pappu, 2005). IYSV was also detected in onion crops in Georgia
(Mullis et al., 2004) and New Mexico (Creamer et al., 2004).

[Cconfirmation of the presence of grapevine yellows caused by a stolbur
phytoplasma in Ukraine, and the report of the presence of Peach latent
mosaic and Hop stunt viroids in Bosinia and Herzegovina are the most
significant findings in this report. - Mod.DH]
[Note that EPPO credits ProMED (spelled incorrectly) with the detailed
report of Citrus canker in the USA (Florida). We also posted the Iris yellow
spot reports from USA (Oregon, Georgia & New Mexico), & of soybean cyst
nematode in USA (North Dakota) -- see refs. below. - Mod.JW]
