The Department of Health Services has revealed to the public a new situation report on the chikungunya fever, which has infected over 1000 people within Yap state since the initial outbreak in June [2013].

The department stated in its report that a total of 302 new cases -- of which 263 were in Yap Proper and 39 in the neighboring islands -- had brought the total cases in Yap state to 1404 as of 23 Dec 2013.

The previous report on 3 Dec 2013 indicated that the total number of chikungunya cases was 1102 -- 974 in Yap Proper and 128 in the neighboring islands.

With the continued increase of outpatients and no more available rooms at the Yap Memorial Hospital, the department has taken appropriate measures by setting up a hydration unit where patients can be hydrated with IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return the next day for hydration if necessary.

The department has been active in monitoring the chikungunya epidemic in both the neighboring islands and at all Yap main ambulatory clinics, including the ward, to make sure samples from new suspect cases reach the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation.

The department has been sending samples to CDC and French Polynesia-based Institut Louis Malarde since the increase of fever cases.

The samples tested at CDC Arbovirus Diagnostic Laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado were found positive of the chikungunya virus on 30 Oct 2013. On 31 Oct 2013, Institut Louis Malarde informed the department that the samples sent from Yap were also positive for chikungunya virus.

In spite of the efforts of the Department of Health Services in implementing all necessary precautionary measures at the hospital -- including health information distribution and environmental health visits to homes -- the chikungunya virus continued to spread throughout all the municipalities in Yap Proper and some of the neighboring islands.

To further prevent the virus from infecting the whole state population, department officials requested everyone in the communities to avoid mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants or skirts, use mosquito repellents and mosquito nets both day and nighttime.

Health Services officials have urged everyone to visit the hospital as soon as they become sick to prevent further complications.

[The chikungunya virus outbreak on Yap island first reported on 14 Nov 2013 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20131114.2055640) continues, with 340 suspected cases as of 24 Nov 2013 and then 1404 cases noted above. These reports do not indicate the mosquito vector involved in this outbreak. It will be of interest to learn if the outbreak has continued on into January 2014.

Mod.CP provided a good summary of the virus and the disease it causes in the initial report (ProMED-mail archive no 20131114.2055640).
