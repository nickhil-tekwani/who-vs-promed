The USGS [US Geological Service] National Wildlife Health Center and USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories has found that what was causing doves to die across the Permian Basin was pigeon paramyxovirus-1.

This particular virus has never been found to infect humans or other mammals such as dogs or cats.

Still, officials advise you to minimize your contact with doves in affected areas of West Texas until this outbreak is over.

The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department is going to continue monitoring the spread of the virus, though it's not considered a major threat to the dove populations in Texas

[Avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1; Fam. _Paramyxoviridae_) is the etiologic agent of Newcastle disease. APMV-1 strains maintained in pigeon populations have some antigenic differences from other APMV-1 isolates, and are sometimes called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), which was first reported in racing pigeons in Italy in 1981, and then it became pandemic.

[Doves are usually smaller than pigeons, but both belong to the bird family Columbidae. I would have thought that pigeon paramyxoviruses would be a threat to both doves and pigeons, and through them to poultry, in Texas.
