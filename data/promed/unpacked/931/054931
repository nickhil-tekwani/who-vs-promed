Today at the 37th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in Toronto, Canada, Dr. David Relman presented a
review and update of current knowledge of cyclosporiasis as an emerging
infectious disease. He reminded listeners that, variably acid-fast
organisms with an approximate diameter of 8-10 microns resembling large
forms of Cryptosporidium have been identified in fecal samples from
patients exhibiting episodes of watery diarrhea since the 1980s. It was in
1993 that Ortega and Sterling published a report identifying the organism
as a Cyclospora sp. in the New England Journal of Medicine. Relman himself
has generated data for the sequence of ribosomal RNA genes for this
organism, and confirmed its identity as a Cyclospora sp.
Dr. Relman described a typical clinical course for infected patients as
intermittent watery diarrhea after a 7 day incubation period. Untreated
disease can lead to anorexia, fatigue and weight loss lasting for weeks in
immunocompetent hosts, and even longer in immunocompromised hosts. The
infection can be successfully treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
Relapses are not uncommon in treated patients. No suitable alternative
therapy has been identified for sulfa-allergic persons. There are no data
for the efficacy of trimethoprim alone.
Dr. Relman offered additional insight into the epidemiology of
cyclosporiasis. Infection or colonization of asymptomatic persons is
common (endemic) in Asia (especially in Nepal), Peru and Haiti, but
uncommon in Tanzania (the latter based on comments offered during the
question and answer session). In the US approximately 0.5% of fecal
samples from symptomatic persons will contain Cyclospora. This low
incidence suggests that there are many naive hosts in North America, and
Relman suggests that this may in part explain the relatively recent
emergence of this disease in North America. Last year's documented
outbreaks involved Guatamalen raspberries, while in 1997, mesclun lettuce
and basil from other sources as well as Guatamalen raspberries have been
implicated. Between 1,600 and 1,700 cases have been reported in the US and
Canada this year.
