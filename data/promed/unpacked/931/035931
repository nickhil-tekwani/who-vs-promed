Thailand: More than 900 000 Volunteers Begin House-to-House Survey
-------------------------------------------------
Thailand launched its month-long war on avian influenza with more than 900
000 volunteers carrying out house-to-house checks for signs of the disease,
a senior health official said. Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has
announced a goal of eradicating the disease from Thailand by 31 Oct 2004
and thousands scoured outlying villages and poor areas of Bangkok for sick
birds and humans.

Thailand earlier this week confirmed its 1st probable [suspected] case of
human-to-human infection of avian influenza following the deaths of a
mother and daughter [It has not been confirmed that the daughter had
contracted avian influenza, since her body was cremated before the probable
cause of death was recognised - Mod.CP]. At least 10 people have died in
Thailand and [20] in Viet Nam from avian influenza during 2 outbreaks this
year that have killed millions of birds from across the region.

The 2 confirmed and 2 suspected cases within a single Thai family in the
last week raised concerns that the disease [virus] had mutated into a more
contagious and lethal form that could trigger a global pandemic. A mutated
avian influenza outbreak was blamed for the deaths of as many as 40 million
people worldwide in 1918 [In fact the origin of the 1918 pandemic virus is
not known. - Mod.CP]. Thai health officials said early indications were
that the [avian influenza virus] strain had not changed much and nobody
outside of the family had been infected, but tests continued in US and Thai
laboratories to discover the full picture.

The probable human-to-human case prompted the Thai government to step up
its fight against the disease. Thousands of unpaid volunteers, part of a
group set up 20 years ago and given some medical training, began work on
Friday, according to Thawat Suntrajarn, director general of the Disease
Control department. "More than 900 000 of our volunteers, assigned to
oversee some 10 households each, will go house-to-house and check the
condition of both humans and poultry," he said. A 1000-strong team of
veterinarians and epidemiologists was also being formed to move in swiftly
if volunteers warned of suspect cases.

"Most of what you would like to see is being done here," said Scott Dowell,
of the US Centers for Disease Control, which is examining samples from the
Thai family outbreak. "There's careful surveillance all around the original
family cluster and they've identified areas where chickens are sick and
dying and culled all of the poultry."

Bird flu has struck 32 of Thailand's 76 provinces since July 2004 in the
2nd wave of cases in 2004 and badly-hit poultry sales overseas. Thailand
had been one of the world's biggest exporters before the bird flu crisis.

[The Thai Ministry of Health is to be commended for their efforts to
increase surveillance for avian influenza in humans. It should be noted
that the newswire also states the house-to-house active surveillance
activities are for avian disease as well. It would not be surprising if
additional outbreaks/cases were identified as a result of this activity. -
