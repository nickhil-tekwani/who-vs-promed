Bulgaria's food safety agency authorities reported on [Wed 3 Apr 2019] an outbreak of the bird flu virus on a duck farm in the village of Yoglav in central Bulgaria and said birds on the farm were being culled.

A 3 km [1.8 mi] protection zone had been set around the farm and the movement of domestic, wild and other birds and has been banned within it, as has the sale of eggs and poultry, the food safety agency said in a statement.

[Yoglav is a village in Bulgaria's Lovech Province. This is the 2nd outbreak in Lovech since 13 Mar 2019, when the event reportedly started in the village Lisets in the same province, reported to the OIE on the same day as an H5 outbreak (20190315.6368172). According to media reports, the outbreak affected a registered mulard ducks farm.

The current 2nd outbreak has been reported to the OIE on 3 Apr 2019, similarly as H5. The report referred to 20 cases within a population of 1400 ducks, all culled. Links to both reports and a map presenting both locations are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=29840.

Previous outbreaks in Bulgaria, during 2017 and 2018, were caused by HPAI H5N8; this would suggest HPAI H5N8 in the current event; final serotyping of the current strain is anticipated.
