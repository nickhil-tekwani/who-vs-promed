Although it has long been suspected that the Chinese practice of growing
pigs and ducks together is a source of viruses causing deadly human
influenza epidemics, according to this story scientists now believe they
have discovered the reason. By looking closely into the molecular biology
of the pig's throat, they find special proteins, receptors, that allow both
avian and mammalian influenza viruses to enter pig cells. This lets bird
viruses cross a natural species barrier, enter pigs, evolve and then emerge
to infect humans. The pig's strange combination of receptors, gateways for
entry into cells, means swine can serve as mixing vessels, living reaction
chambers wherein bird viruses and mammalian viruses intermingle, swap genes
and create new varieties of flu. Globally, humans pay a terrible price.
The 12-member international research team was quoted writing in the
[September] issue of the Journal of Virology, "The evidence supports the
role of pigs as a source of potentially hazardous influenza A viruses." So
its new findings "help explain the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses,
and support the need for continued surveillance of swine" to watch for
dangerous new gene combinations in flu viruses. Given enough warning,
scientists can prepare vaccines to meet a new, emerging strain of influenza.
