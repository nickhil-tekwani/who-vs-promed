This morning, [a] hantavirus infection was confirmed in a 59 year old
man who, this past 14 Dec [2010] was admitted with symptoms of this
fatal virus [infection] in the Aysen Regional Hospital. Following
examinations that were done in the hospital, his blood samples were
sent to the Public Health Institute in Santiago, the place where
[tests] were completed confirming the infection, with notification of
the regional Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat] this
Tuesday [21 Dec 2010] afternoon.

According to the explanation of the epidemiologist Marco Acuna, this
is the 3rd case of [a] hantavirus infection in 2010, becoming the 1st
case in the spring/summer season, which will be one of high risk due
to the flowering of quila [a perennial bamboo that grows in the humid
temperate forests of Chile and Argentina] in various areas of the
region. [This 3rd case must refer only to this region, because there
have been more than 50 cases and 17 deaths from hantavirus infections
reported nationally in 2010 in Chile as of 12 Nov 2010 (see
ProMED-mail archive number 20101113.4120). - Mod.TY]

As for the health of this case of infection, Acuna explained that the
patient had presented with cardiopulmonary syndrome, a situation that
was slow to progress, with some added kidney [function] alterations,
so will be expected to remain at least a week more interned in the
Coyhaique Hospital.

Based on the discovery of this case and the arrival of summer, this
week the Regional Hantavirus Committee was assembled, an
inter-sectorial group formed by officials of different public
organizations, whose conclusion is that this will be a high risk
season for hantavirus infections becoming an epidemic year throughout
the length of the country. In this sense, the epidemiologist called
out especially to the people in the countryside, especially those who
use houses that, [sometime] during the year are uninhabited, to
ventilate and disinfect these types of buildings before occupying
them -- a measure that should be repeated when considering storage
buildings and sheds.

Finally, it is [necessary] to reiterate [preventive] measures such as
maintenance of clean perimeters of at least 30 meters [32.8 yards]
around dwellings, with short grass, maintain trash and food in
containers with tops, ventilate closed places and leave alone and
avoid passing through moist, shady areas with brush or quila
[essentially avoiding areas of habitats for the long-tailed pygmy
rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, the host of Andes hantavirus. - Mod.TY]

[Coyhaique is located in the extreme south of Chile in the Magallanes
region. Hantavirus infections are not an emerging disease in Chile,
it is endemic, and as with all zoonoses that have rodent reservoirs,
its incidence oscillates over time. This oscillation is determined by
climatic conditions that enormously influence rodent populations and
their behavior. - Mod.LJS]

[Although not stated, the hantavirus responsible for hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the area mentioned above doubtless is
Andes virus. Chile has had a series of HPS cases especially
January-May this year (2010). Reports of cases have been few since
then, but the season for transmission is again coming, hence the
report of total cases and warnings about risk of infections and how
to prevent them.

The 22 Dec 2010 edition of LaDiscusion.cl
(<http://www.diarioladiscusion.cl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20409:nuble-presenta-una-de-las-mas-altas-tasas-de-incidencia-de-virus-hanta-en-el-pais&catid=3:salud&Itemid=84>
in Spanish) reported that nationally, Chile has had 59 reported cases
of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in 2010 with 20 deaths, and a case
fatality rate of 34 percent. The number of cases in 2010 is more than
were expected (37 cases) but less than in the epidemic years of 2001 and 2002.
