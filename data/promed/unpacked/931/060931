Toilets in UPMC [University of Pittsburgh Medical Center] Presbyterian's cardiothoracic intensive care unit have emerged as a potential source of fungal infections that may have contributed to the deaths of 2 patients and sickened a 3rd.

2 heart-transplant patients contracted mold infections and subsequently died over the past year in the now-shuttered 20-bed unit, UPMC's Chief Quality Officer Tami Minnier said Thu [17 Sep 2015]. A 3rd patient, who had a lung transplant, remains hospitalized in Presby with a mold infection and other ailments.

"This is really an evolving investigation," Minnier told the Tribune-Review. "I want to be right up front. I don't have all the answers yet. We are working as quickly and as effectively as we can." She said the 2 deaths cannot directly be attributed to mold because both patients were acutely ill at the time. She did not identify the patients but said their families have been notified, adding the prognosis of the 3rd patient is "poor."

The toilets in question are "modular," meaning they are contained in a cabinet-like structure with a door. Splashing water could have soaked into the structure and led to mold, Minnier said. She said the toilets are used in some ICUs because they give patients close access to a bathroom. "This is not a firm answer," she said of the toilet theory. "But they may be a source."

The mold incidents date back to October 2014, when doctors discovered a fungal infection on the left leg of a heart transplant patient. In June [2015], doctors discovered a different form of mold on the buttocks of another heart transplant patient, Minnier said, noting the mold can be seen by the naked eye.

"You can see like anything else when mold grows," she said. "It's also growing long before you can see it, and that was the hard part about this whole situation. There was nothing visible in the room. If you walk into this ICU, you would think it's spotless, think it's clean."

The hospitalized patient [the 3rd patient?], who is male, contracted a fungal infection on his lung tissue. After his diagnosis, a physician recalled the previous mold cases in June and October [2014?], she said. "We had 1 of our ICU physicians ... actually say, 'Hmmm, I think I remember 2 previous cases in the last year,' " Minnier said.

The explanation confused hospital safety expert Lawrence Muscarella. "Dots were connected by a physician whose memory recalled previous mold infections?" asked Muscarella, a Philadelphia-based biomedical engineer who specializes in infection control. "It's unclear why the hospital apparently did not have an active surveillance system in place, as I recommend, that would have automatically alerted the staff that this was the 3rd related fungal infection in the past year."

Minnier described UPMC's infection surveillance protocols as "excellent" and "very active." Presby administrators closed the cardiothoracic ICU indefinitely and relocated its patients on 8 Sep [2015], 5 days after doctors diagnosed the lung transplant patient with a mold infection. The Tribune-Review initially reported the ICU's shutdown.

As part of their investigation, workers opened a wall in the patient's room where they found mold. A definitive source has not been established, although mold was later found in other portions of the unit, including the toilets.

Minnier said all 3 infected patients had been treated in the same ICU room. In total, 56 patients stayed in the room in question over the previous year, she said, adding that UPMC is unaware of any other infections.

Of those 56, 8 -- including the 3 infected -- had organ transplants. Minnier identified the types of mold detected as rhizomucorm [_Rhizomucor_], _Llchtheimia_ and _Rhizopus_.

The proper environment could cause several types of mold to thrive in the same area, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a Pittsburgh-based infectious disease expert who serves as a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. He said the molds in the UPMC cases are all similar and can prey on people with compromised immune systems. "The outcome is usually not good with these types of infections," he said. "If you have an environment conducive for 1 mold, you're going to have an environment conducive for other molds." The mold is sometimes found on rotten fruits and vegetables, Minnier explained, further complicating the search for a root cause. "I can't say for sure that some of these families didn't bring it in," she said. "I don't want to point any fingers, but it's possible."

Pittsburgh attorney Anthony D'Amico, whose Downtown law firm, Savinis, D'Amico, & Kane, handles medical malpractice cases, said any potential legal action could turn on knowledge of the hospital staff and doctors. He has not been retained by anyone in the matter. "The cause of action would be grounded in negligence; 1 would have to prove that someone knew or should have known about a medical threat to patients," D'Amico said. "For example, if there's water dripping behind a ceiling tile and you know that, you might not see mold behind there, but you could know that it's likely going to grow over time."

Mold has not been located in any other portion of the hospital, which is UPMC's flagship and the largest in Western Pennsylvania. "It's just heartbreaking," Minnier said. "I can't tell you how many hours we have already spent trying to understand it. I still feel like I am navigating a very active investigation."

She said the general public and hospital staff should not fear infection. "Unless you are severely immunocompromised, you are completely safe," she said.

[The news report above says that 3 immunocompromised patients in an ICU at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) acquired fungal infections due to different fungal organisms during the past year. The fungal pathogens were in the genera _Rhizomucor_, _Lichtheimia_ (formerly _Absidia_), and _Rhizopus_ (formerly _Zygomycetes_) in the order _Mucorales_.

_Mucorales_ organisms are ubiquitous in the environment, such as in soil, decaying vegetable matter, water, and air. Most individuals are exposed to these fungi daily. Human infections result from inhalation of fungal spores that have been released into the air or from direct inoculation of organisms into disrupted skin or mucosa. The diseases caused by these organisms are called mucormycosis (or at times zygomycosis or phycomycosis). _Mucorales_ species are angioinvasive, causing infarction of the involved tissue, and the mucormycosis spectrum ranges from cutaneous, gastrointestinal, rhinocerebral, and sinopulmonary to disseminated and frequently fatal infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts.

_Rhizopus_ is the most common genus causing human mucormycosis in most case series, followed by _Mucor_ and _Lichtheimia_, accounting for 70 to 80 percent of all mucormycosis cases; in contrast, _Rhizomucor_ species are commonly (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122490/). Frequently patients at risk of mucormycosis are immunocompromised by underlying conditions (e.g., hematological malignancies, solid tumors, transplantation, diabetes mellitus, AIDS, chronic alcoholism, cirrhosis, renal failure, burns, pregnancy, premature neonates, or intravenous drug abuse) or immunosuppressive treatment (e.g., radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy, antirejection medications, or corticosteroids).

Species in another genus _Apophysomyces_ are occasionally responsible for infections in immunocompetent individuals, usually as a result of soft tissue trauma (e.g., following accidents or natural disasters such as tsunamis or tornadoes); see ProMED-mail post Mucormycosis, fatal - USA (02): (MO) tornado-related 20110730.2288.

Nosocomial mucormycosis has been associated with a variety of healthcare-associated procedures or devices, such as cutaneous infection related to the direct inoculation of the fungus on the wound or skin surfaces (e.g., contaminated wound bandages; contaminated hospital linen; contaminated adhesive on ostomy bags; contaminated medication patches; contaminated wooden tongue depressors used to prepare oral medications given to patients through a nasogastric tube or tongue depressors used to construct splints for intravenous and arterial cannulation sites), ingestion of contaminated material, or inhalation of aerosolized fungal spores (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02982.x/full). - Mod.ML
