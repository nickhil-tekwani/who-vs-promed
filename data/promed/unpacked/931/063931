Vector control inspectors, in conjunction with health promoters from the province of Herrera, carried out an orientation day in the community of El Barrero, district of Pesé, after the confirmation of a case of hantavirus fever. The patient is a 32 year old female resident, who is under medical care at the Dr Gustavo Nelson Collado hospital, in Chitré, in a stable condition.

The province has recorded a total of 3 cases of hantavirus in 2022, of which 2 patients developed cardiopulmonary syndrome and one patient hantavirus fever.

[Herrera province reported cases of hantavirus infections earlier this year (2022) (see Hantavirus - Americas (30): Panama (LS) 20221012.8706113). The virus is endemic in the province and cases are reported there frequently. Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that, based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY]

The Los Lagos SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial secretariat] is investigating the death of a 39 year old man from the Quemchi commune, in Chiloé Province, which is thought to have been due to a hantavirus [infection].

The [affected] person, from Tac Island, has been in hospital since 15 Nov 2022 in the intensive care unit of the Castro Hospital. However, due to his complicated condition, it was decided to move him to the Las Higueras Hospital in Talcahuano, which did not happen because he died from causes that are still being investigated.

The acting health minister of Los Lagos, Álex Oyarzo, reported that the case, given the associated conditions, "corresponds to suspected hanta [infection]. However, other causes of respiratory origin have not been ruled out. Our epidemiology team continues to collect all the background information on the case and coordinate the confirmation of the diagnosis," which will be established by the Institute of Public Health.

The population of Tac barely reaches 300 people. Irene Millalonco, the president of the neighborhood council, said that they are "very concerned and sad about the situation on the island, because it covers the entire island, and we had no idea what was coming. He left due to a fever and we have no more information than what the doctor predicted. He is a dear friend and leader of the island, so we are very sorry," she ended.

[Tac Island is relatively near the Andean mainland. Hantavirus infections occur in a broad Andean region of Chile every year. This case is in the Los Lagos region. Although not specified in this or previous reports from this and other regions, the hantavirus involved in this case is most likely Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile. The patient likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region, which is why the Los Lagos Health authorities are investigating the situation on the island.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly from person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
