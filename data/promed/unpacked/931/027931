A man in Taitung was sent to hospital for treatment on Mon 22 Jul 2013 after being bitten by a rabies-infected ferret-badger, government officials confirmed yesterday [23 Jul 2013].

The ferret-badger, which somehow made its way into the man's home on Monday [22 Jul 2013], died Tuesday morning, apparently due to the effects of the disease. The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under the Council of Agriculture (COA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under the Ministry of Health and Welfare held a late-night press conference yesterday [23 Jul 2013] to explain the case.

According to both bureaus, the ferret-badger was confirmed to have rabies. They also said that the man, who was bitten at home in Taitung, was sent to a nearby hospital for vaccine and immune globulin injections immediately. Officials noted that because Taitung [could not provide] rabies vaccine, the hospital needed to obtain vaccines from other counties.

According to the COA, Taiwan was removed from the world's top 10 non-rabies epidemic countries after it was found to have rabies infected ferret-badgers. They noted that the death rate from being bitten by a rabies-infected animal is virtually 100 per cent if one does not immediately receive treatment after exposure. According to the BAPHIQ, after Taiwan was removed from the list of non-rabies-infected areas, Japan and Singapore became the only 2 countries in Asia on the list.

The CDC stated that a bitten person should receive up to 5 vaccinations in one month. "Because by the time one shows symptoms, the fatality rate is 100 per cent; any bitten person should receive their 1st vaccine shot within 24 hours from the time of exposure," the CDC explained. "Then the 2nd shot should be given in 3 days, the 3rd shot at 7 days, the 4th shot in 14 days, and the 5th shot in 25 days." The CDC added that a person who is exposed to rabies should be vaccinated immediately before symptoms show.

Scholars said that rabies has reappeared in Taiwan for the 1st time in 50 years. Taiwan has reported 3 recently discovered rabies cases to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), according to the COA. "But we have not yet found rabies in canines, felines, or people, so we shouldn't panic too much," the council said.

Rabies, a fatal disease that affects animals and humans and is caused by a neurotropic virus, was recently detected in the remains of wild Formosan ferret-badgers, a veterinary research team confirmed last week. This means rabies has reappeared in Taiwan for the 1st time in 50 years, said Victor Fei Pang, a professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine of National Taiwan University, during a meeting convened by the COA.

[It is not clear how the man came to be bitten by the rabies virus-infected ferret-badger, whether by accident or during the course of investigation of the outbreak. More detailed information is awaited.

The question of the origin of the rabies virus infection of the ferret-badger population in Taiwan remains unexplained. It is uncertain whether the infection was recently introduced or has been present cryptically in ferret-badgers in Taiwan for some time. The outcome of genotyping of the virus may resolve this question.

Several accounts of ferret-badger rabies in China have been published recently (for example: Zhang S, Liu Y, Hou Y, Zhao J, Zhang F, Wang Y, et al. Epidemic and maintenance of rabies in Chinese ferret badgers (_Melogale moschata_) indicated by epidemiology and the molecular signatures of rabies viruses. Virol Sin. 2013 Jun;28(3):146-51. doi: 10.1007/s12250-013-3316-7. Epub 2013 May 21). These authors investigated an epidemic of Chinese ferret badger-associated human rabies in Wuyuan county, Jiangxi province, as well as rabies virus isolates from populations of ferret-badgers in different districts in Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. The genomes of these rabies viruses were obtained and sequenced and alignments determined for epidemiological analyses. The results indicated that human rabies cases in the Wuyuan outbreak were only associated with ferret-badger bites.

The rabies viruses isolated from ferret-badger-epidemic areas in Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces were similar to the Wuyuan county viruses and found to be distinct from rabies viruses isolated from canines in the same region. The authors concluded that rabies in Chinese ferret-badgers has an independent transmission cycle, and ferret-badgers may serve as another important rabies reservoir independent of canines rabies in China.

Other studies in South China have established similarly that ferret-badger-associated rabies has likely arisen as an independent enzootic originating from dogs during the long-term rabies infestation in south east China. Consequently, it is not unlikely that ferret-badger rabies has been present cryptically in Taiwan for some time prior to its recent detection.

The Chinese ferret-badger (_Melogale moschata_), also known as the small-toothed ferret-badger, is a member of the family _Mustelidae_. This badger lives in burrows or crevices and is active at dusk and at night. It is a good climber and feeds on fruit, insects, small animals, and worms. It is savage when alarmed. The average body size of the Chinese ferret-badger is 33 to 43 centimetres (13 to 17 inches) with a tail of 15 to 23 centimetres (5.9 to 9.1 inches). It lives in grassland, open forest, and tropical rainforest from north eastern India to southern China, Taiwan, and northern Indochina (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_ferret-badger). - Mod.CP
