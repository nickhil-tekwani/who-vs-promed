BUFFALO POX (HUMAN) - INDIA (2)
===============================
In reply to Ajit Maru's note [promed archive.960325] on
the occurrence of Buffalo Pox in India, one would expect
that such outbreaks would occur when -- thankfully --
smallpox vaccination has been discontinued in the world.
It would seem useful to investigate and monitor such outbreaks:
the Pune Institute, as well as other reference laboratories in Atlanta and
Moscow can help confirm that the specter of smallpox has not re-emerged.
If a protocol is needed to investigate such outbreaks, it may be helpful
to know that WHO had published, in the late 1970's, an investigation
protocol developed by "An informal Group for Monkeypox and related
Viruses" which proved entirely suitable when we investigated a suspected
Buffalo Pox outbreak in the Sundarband of Bangladesh in 1976. There are,
in India, a number of old "smallpox buddies" who, I'm sure, would love to
get back to the field and conduct such an investigation. Contact names and
addresses can be made available with enthusiasm.
