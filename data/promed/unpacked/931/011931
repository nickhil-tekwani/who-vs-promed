State Kills 20,000 More Trout To Curb Diseases
----------------------------------------------------------
The state [MD] Department of Natural Resources (DNR) destroyed 20,000
hatchery trout Fri [4 May 2007]. That brings to at least 156 000 the
number of fish the agency has destroyed this year [2007] in hopes of
curbing the spread of whirling disease, an illness fatal to trout.
The brown and rainbow trout killed Friday [4 May 2007] were from net
pens below Jennings Randolph Dam in the North Branch of the Potomac
River. The DNR has known since 1995 that the Jennings Randolph
Culture Station harbored the parasite that causes whirling disease,
but decided in March [2007] to close the operation after the disease
was found at 2 trout-rearing stations in Garrett County.
The destroyed trout were taken to a rendering plant and converted to
chicken feed. The rendering process kills the whirling disease
parasite. The parasite deforms trout skeletons, causing them to swim
in circles until they die. The disease isn't a threat to humans, but
it has decimated wild trout populations in some Western rivers.
