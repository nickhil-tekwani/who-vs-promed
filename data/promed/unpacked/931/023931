A new national study revealed that the incidence and prevalence of brucellosis [Malta fever] in the governorates of Mafraq and Karak are the highest in the Kingdom. The study, which was carried out by the Middle Eastern Network for Community Health (AMPHNET) in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Royal Medical Services, the Princess Haya Center for Biotechnology, and the American Center for Disease Control (CDC), as part of a project implemented in 3 areas in the Jordanian governorates (Al-Mafraq), showed that in the Karak, and east of the capital, Amman, the risk factors for infection with brucellosis and exposure to animals in Mafraq and Karak are the highest.

Head of the Disease Control and Control Team in the Middle East Network, Dr Tariq Al-Sanuri, said: Malta fever is not an epidemic disease, but rather endemic, and it is widespread in the Kingdom, but in small proportions, and it does not cause fear or panic, as it is monitored periodically and continuously, pointing out, at the same time, to the importance of raising the efficiency of the diagnostic process {procedures} and laboratories for humans and animals through the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.

He added that "the rate of infection with the disease in the Kingdom ranges between 10-20 cases per 100 000 of the population, which is considered a somewhat small percentage, while in some countries of the region, the rate of infections ranges between 10 cases per 100 000, and others from 50-100 cases per 100 000, and despite the small percentage we have, the monitoring process must be activated and activated to ensure the correctness of the casualty figures so that there are no cases that go undiagnosed.

Regarding the reasons for the spread of infections in the governorates of Mafraq and Karak more than in other governorates, Al-Sanuri said that Malta fever is a common disease that is transmitted to humans and animals, and therefore the density of livestock in the regions was one of the most important criteria adopted in the study, as Mafraq and Karak have more livestock than others. That is, the risk factors and exposure to animals, and thus the rate of disease incidence, are concentrated in them, but this does not mean that it is not present in other governorates.

Concerning the process of reporting the occurrence of the disease among farmers, he explained that this fever is transmitted in 2 ways: contact and dealing with infected animals and their tissues, and the consumption of materials that are not well pasteurized, such as milk, cheese, and others. Therefore, reporting of cases is linked to the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.

He focused on the fact that the work is carried out on the principle of One Health, so that the link between human health and animal health, and when there are cases, the Ministry of Agriculture is reported, and human cases are reported to the Ministry of Health, as the goal is to activate the reporting process and consolidate the principle of One Health between the ministries.

Concerning the availability of our laboratory staff and the tests related to the disease, Al-Sanuri stated that they are all available, as the technicians are constantly raised and trained on them, to ensure that they are always able to diagnose fever accurately, not to mention holding awareness sessions in all regions of the disease and its transmission methods.

As for the means of preventing brucellosis, according to Al-Sanuri, they are not to be exposed to risk factors for humans because there is no vaccine for him, and to avoid eating milk products, dairy, unpasteurized cheese, and raw meat, and not to be exposed to infected animals, and if he has to, he must deal with them safely and soundly.

Concerning the animal, he indicated that there is a vaccine for animals against brucellosis, which is available to us, but it does not cover the Kingdom, hoping that the coverage of animal vaccinations against the disease will improve in the future. The project implemented according to the study is a vivid application of the principle of one health, where cooperation takes place between the various bodies working in human and animal health and the exchange of information on injuries to animals, and the investigation of the possibility of human injury as a result of exposure to various risk factors.

During the implementation of the project, laboratory cadres were trained on new laboratory tests such as ELISA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), genetic classification, and phosphorescence polarization (FPA), which is a qualitative leap in laboratory techniques used to diagnose disease in humans and animals.

The study recommended continuing to support activities for active monitoring of brucellosis in Jordan, maintaining and strengthening channels of communication between the animal and human sectors, and educating the general population and farmers about the proper use of dairy products, symptoms of brucellosis, and methods of infection.

It also urged the continuous provision of information to clinicians regarding treatment guidelines, case definition, and evaluation of the current brucellosis control strategy, not to mention the continued application of appropriate laboratory testing protocols for brucellosis.

[The number of human cases is not stated.

This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the USA and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many developing countries.

Each species of _Brucella_ has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid. This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers.

Among the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _B. melitensis_ (from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis, with disabling complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with complications. - Mod.LL
