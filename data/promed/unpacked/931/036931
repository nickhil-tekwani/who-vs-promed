The CDC said on Wednesday, 7 Jan 2015, that bacteria in food is what caused nearly 60 people to fall ill at a large holiday party in a Maitland office building in December 2014. The Florida Department of Health Orange County said that it received information from the CDC that food and clinical specimens from the foodborne outbreak tested positive for _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Bacillus cereus_.

Health officials said in a release that the "outbreaks often have been linked to foods that require a lot of handling when they are being processed, prepared, cooked and cooled. The department continues its investigation and the initial findings suggest the pathogens multiplied by time and temperature abuse during the food preparation, transportation and serving processes," the release stated.

Authorities were called to Maitland Colonnades on Lucien Way roughly 2 hours after the building-wide catered luncheon. The event was catered by Kitchen Divas, according to the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.

Employees tell Local 6 they were served food like sliced turkey, ham, stuffing and green beans. They say all 700 employees who work for various companies in the building were invited to the luncheon. Officials with the Maitland Fire Department said dozens of patients were treated for nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after the holiday luncheon. Some left and came back after getting sick at home and several were transported to the hospital.

[Classical food poisoning due to _Staphylococcus aureus_ presents with a short incubation period of 4-6 hours as acute nausea and vomiting usually without fever or diarrhea. The illness generally lasts less than 24 hours. The incubation of _B. cereus_ foodborne illness tends to be longer but may account for some of the 60 cases.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the US Food and Drug Administration's Bad Bug Book at http://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/causesofillnessbadbugbook/ucm070015.htm:

"In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

"In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as food handlers.

"A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

"Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning." - Mod.LL
