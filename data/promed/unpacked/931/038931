13 HFMD cases detected in N Sembilan, hospitals on alert
--------------------------------------------------------
13 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) were detected in Negeri
Sembilan from January 2006 to last Monday [27 Mar 2006?], said state health
director Datuk Dr Rosnah Ismail. She said 9 were detected in Seremban, 3 in
Jempol, and one in Tampin.
The situation was not alarming, unlike in Sarawak, but all hospitals,
medical centers and government clinics statewide had been told to be on
alert, she told Bernama here on Wednesday [29 Mar 2006]. "So far, no child
care centers and kindergartens have been ordered to close, because the
situation is under control," she said. She advised all creches [day care
centers] to ensure the cleanliness of their premises.
The disease is caused by a virus that can be found in children's excrement
and can be infectious, she said. Dr Rosnah also advised the public to
immediately send their children for treatment if they showed symptoms of
HFMD, like having a fever and rashes. As of last Sunday [26 Mar 2006?],
Sarawak recorded 6718 HFMD cases, including 8 deaths, since it was detected
in Sibu last month [February 2006].

Singapore: hand, foot and mouth cases surge
-------------------------------------------
The number of cases of children with hand, foot and mouth disease in
Singapore more than doubled to 785 last week, up from 372 the week before,
the Straits Times newspaper reported on Wednesday [29 Mar 2006].
Two more child care centers [daycare centers] have been forced to shut down
for 10 days, bringing the number of such closures in the city state to 3,
the paper said.
Singapore has recorded 2180 cases of the disease since the start of the
year [2006]. It mainly affects children under the age of 10, causing fever,
mouth ulcers, and rashes. Though most cases have been mild, the health
ministry has tightened the guidelines for when preschools, kindergartens,
and child care centers should close to prevent transmissions. Child care
centers must now shut their doors if they have had infections for more than
15 days, affecting more than 13 children, or 18 per cent of the student
population, the newspaper said.
More than 4000 children have been infected with the disease in East
Malaysia this year [2006], and 8 have died. There has been one death in
Brunei. According to the World Health Organization, there is no specific
antiviral treatment for enterovirus infections such as the hand, foot and
mouth disease. Treatment focuses on the management of complications.
