Chile has detected bird flu at a turkey production plant run by poultry producer Agrosuper in the country's central Valparaiso region, the Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) said on [Wed 4 Jan 2017].

SAG said it plans to cull the affected birds and quarantine the area to prevent the infectious disease from spreading.

No humans have been affected by the outbreak, it said.

Specialized laboratories are working to determine what strain of bird flu has infected the animals and once the results are available, SAG will decide what further sanitary measures need to be taken.

In 2002, a highly infectious strain of bird flu was detected in Chile for the 1st time, curtailing poultry exports. That outbreak was brought under control.

Agrosuper said that the turkey plant, operated by its Sopraval unit, is located in rural Quilpu√© [City and capital of the Marga Marga province in central Chile's Valparaiso Region].

Different strains of bird flu, which can be spread to poultry by wild birds, have been detected across Asia and in Europe in recent weeks [December 2016], leading to the slaughtering of millions of birds in South Korea and Japan and several human infections in China.

Chile has detected avian influenza H7 at a turkey production plant run by poultry producer Agrosuper in the country's central Valparaiso region. All affected birds (350 000) will be culled. No data regarding N type were given.

Avian influenza (AI) was diagnosed in May 2002 for the 1st time in Chile and South America [Av Dis 2007, 51(1 Suppl): 363-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17494584]. The epidemic was caused by the highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) virus subtype H7N3 that emerged from a low pathogenic virus. The index farm was a broiler breeder, located in San Antonio, V Region, which at the time was a densely populated poultry area. Stamping of 465 000 breeders, in 27 sheds, was immediately conducted. Surveillance activities detected a 2nd outbreak, one week later, at a turkey breeding farm from the same company. The 2nd farm was located 4 km [2.5 mi] from the index case. Only 25 percent of the sheds were infected, and 18 500 turkeys were destroyed.

[More information on the strain of virus would be greatly appreciated. The turkey plant is in the process of culling its birds.

It seems odd for a strain of avian influenza to be present in the turkeys in the middle of the summer in the Southern Hemisphere. However, as the article pointed out, it may be in relationship to migration patterns of birds. We have seen that migration patterns can affect disease transmission/locations. - Mod.TG]
