The New Jersey Department of Health is encouraging residents to take steps to protect themselves from all mosquito-borne diseases after 2 more human cases of eastern equine encephalitis were confirmed in the state. The new cases were confirmed in Union and Atlantic counties on Thursday [19 Sep 2019]. The department confirmed the 1st human case of eastern equine encephalitis in August [2019].

Earlier this week, eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) was found in a mosquito pool in Berkley Heights, New Jersey, authorities said. The mosquito pool was found in the Emerson Lane area of Union County near the border with Warren.

Union County officials said they would continue to aggressively spray in Berkley Heights Township. To date, eastern equine encephalitis has been detected in 65 mosquito samples in 13 New Jersey counties.

Most persons infected with eastern equine encephalitis have no apparent illness; however, some can be very ill. Severe cases of eastern equine encephalitis (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting 4-10 days after a mosquito bite. The illness may then progress to disorientation, seizures, or coma.

"While we are always concerned about more common mosquito-borne diseases, like West Nile virus, we also need to be vigilant for rare, but severe, viruses like eastern equine encephalitis," said acting health commissioner Judith Persichilli. "Individuals who are concerned they may have eastern equine encephalitis should contact their healthcare provider right away."

Eastern equine encephalitis has been diagnosed in 21 people in 6 states, and 5 people have died. The infection is being seen only in certain counties within a small number of states. The US each year has seen 7 illnesses and 3 deaths, on average.

It's not clear why numbers are up this year [2019], but for some reason, cases seem to spike once every several years, Dr. Mark Fischer, an expert at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday [18 Sep 2019]. Most infections occur in the summer, so health officials do not think it will get much worse.

Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and North Carolina have also reported [human] cases.

A human case surfaced in Connecticut earlier this week [week of Mon 16 Sep 2019], prompting a school district to hire a company to spray insect repellant near athletic fields at its schools in response to the threat of eastern equine encephalitis.

The virus is spread to people through mosquitoes that mostly feed on infected birds but sometimes bite humans [and horses]. Cases are generally confined to New England and states along the Gulf of Mexico or Great Lakes, usually in or near swamps.

The uptick in cases has prompted health warnings in some places and even calls to cancel outdoor events scheduled for dusk, when mosquitoes are most active. Precautions include using mosquito repellent and wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants outdoors.

Scientists 1st recognized eastern equine encephalitis as a horse disease in Massachusetts. There's a vaccine for horses, but not people.

It's not considered as large a concern as West Nile virus, which also is spread by mosquitoes and is seen in most states. Nearly 500 West Nile illnesses, including 21 deaths, have been reported to CDC so far this year [2019].

[EEE virus transmission has been very active this year (2019) in the USA, including in New Jersey. The 1st human case in New Jersey occurred in early August 2019. There have also been 8 horse cases and an alpaca case in New Jersey this summer. In addition to the occurrence of human cases mentioned above, there have been equine cases in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New York, Michigan (also deer), Indiana, New Jersey (also an alpaca), Maine, Ohio, North Carolina, Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, and Ontario, Canada. The horse cases are unfortunate since they could have been prevented by vaccination. No human vaccine is available, so avoiding mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
