Foot & mouth disease (FMD) in cattle has been detected in Soriano
state in the west of Uruguay, the government said.
The Uruguayan government said the bad news could hit the country's
beef industry fatally. Uruguay is currently the only member of South
America's Mercosur trade bloc (which includes Argentina, Brazil, and
Paraguay) considered completely free of the disease. Uruguay has
suspended all meat exports, which are approximately 20 percent of
Uruguay's total exports.
"The news is dramatic and will bring large economic losses to the
country," Uruguayan Vice President Luis Hierro was quoted as saying.
FMD is highly infectious due to its airborne capability. The disease
affects cloven-footed animals like pigs, sheep, goats, and cows.
Uruguay culled 20 000 animals during its last outbreak in October
[2000 to protect its 10-million-head herd from FMD.
