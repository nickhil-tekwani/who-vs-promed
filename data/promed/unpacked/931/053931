RABIES VIRUS CHALLENGE MODEL - INDIA: REQUEST FOR INFO

From: Dr. P.N. Rangarajan <ranga@biochem.iisc.ernet.in>

I am trying to test the potency of rabies DNA vaccine in India and have
approached a lot of veterinarians to develop a rabies virus challenge model
in the dog. I am surprised to find we do not have in our country, a rabies
virus strain that can kill an un-immunized dog when administered either
intracerebrally or via peripheral route.
A veterinarian, for whom I have a high regard and who can really do RFFIT
and intracerebral challenge studies in mice told me he has tried all kinds
of rabies virus strains including the street virus isolated from a proven
rabid animal but they do not kill Indian dogs (he has not tested in Beagle
dogs), when injected into tongue or intracerebrally although the same virus
kills mice when given by intracerebral route. He also says it is difficult
to get 100% mortality with peripheral challenge even in mice.
I am basically a molecular biologist and a recent entrant into the area of
rabies vaccine research and I am perplexed with this finding in a country,
where several rabid dog bite cases are reported every day, we do not have a
peripheral rabies virus challenge model in dog or mice.

had a similar experience or has any information with regard to this. - MOD.TG]
