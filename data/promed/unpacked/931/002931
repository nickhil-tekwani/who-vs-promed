[Identification of additional cases in healthcare workers in Riyadh continues, with 2 newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Both of these cases were reported to be asymptomatic, bringing the total number of secondary cases of MERS-CoV infection associated with this ongoing outbreak in Riyadh to 30, including 24 asymptomatic infections and 6 symptomatic infections. Of the 30 reported secondary case infections, 5 were in household contacts of MERS-CoV infected individuals involved in this outbreak, 18 were healthcare associated cases in healthcare workers, and 7 were healthcare associated cases in patients.

In addition to the 2 newly reported cases, today's [29 Jun 2016] report from the MOH includes 6 recoveries; all 6 individuals were from Riyadh and had been reported as asymptomatic infections, all in non-healthcare workers (2 were in other patients admitted to the hospital for other medical problems, and 4 were in household contacts).

The locations of the newly confirmed cases and recoveries can be found on a map at the source URL. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4317231,131. - Mod.MPP]

On [12 Jun 2016], the National IHR Focal Point of Qatar notified WHO of one additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case
A 23-year-old, non-national male from Al-Shahaniya City presented with symptoms at a health centre on [8 Jun 2016]. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [9 Jun 2016]. He has a history of frequent contact with camels and consumption of their raw milk. The patient also has a history of travel to Saudi Arabia on 28 May [2016]. He is currently in stable condition admitted to a negative pressure isolation room on a ward.

The Department of Health Protection and Communicable Disease Control within the Ministry of Public Health immediately carried out case investigation and contact tracing. All the healthcare workers who attended the patient followed recommended infection prevention and control measures. Respiratory swabs were collected from 26 household contacts, and all results were negative for MERS-CoV by PCR. All contacts were monitored until the end of the 14-day period following last exposure to the case, and none of them developed symptoms. Health education messages about appropriate preventive measures were shared with all contacts, who were also advised to comply with the recommended MERS-CoV preventive measures and to report to health authorities on the development of any respiratory symptoms. The Animal Health Resources Department has been notified, and investigation of camels is ongoing.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1769 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 630 related deaths.

[This is the same case reported in prior ProMED-mail posts since the 1st report on 13 Jun 2016 (see archives listed below). Of note is that none of the 26 household contacts were found to be positive by nasal swabs, in contrast with the 5 household contacts found to be positive in the outbreak in Riyadh. This report does mention that all healthcare workers followed recommended infection prevention. One wonders about the number of healthcare workers involved in the care of this case, and the number tested, and whether the patient was put into isolation while pending results of the MERS-CoV infection as a result of a high index of suspicion of possible MERS-CoV infection, as the patient was a camel worker with frequent contact.
