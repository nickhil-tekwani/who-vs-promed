Clark County school officials say an outbreak of pertussis, commonly
called whooping cough, has more than 1/3rd of Greenwood Junior High
and High School students staying home today [8 Nov 2007]. County
Health Officials say 32 cases have now been confirmed, and the school
district is fighting to contain the disease.

Greenwood High School officials say when an outbreak of illness in
the school was recently diagnosed as whooping cough, they asked for
guidance from the health department. "Our county health officials are
screening students, encouraging them, sometimes demanding they go in
and be tested to make sure they're not a carrier for us," says High
School Principal Jim Haines.

The health department has set up a station inside the high school.
They say the cough is very contagious for those in close quarters,
even for those who have had the vaccination. In fact, county health
officials say every student that has been diagnosed with pertussis
has had a vaccination for the disease.

But despite the high number of cases, Haines says they're following
the recommendation of the Health Department to keep the school open.
"It really makes a great deal of sense that they need to be able to
have contact with these people," said Haines. "If we were to close
the school for a week, or 2 weeks, or 3 weeks, we have no guarantee
that someone wouldn't come in and infect the whole group again."

But Health and School Officials say that in order to protect the rest
of the community, it's important that anyone who has been in contact
with the disease stays home during treatment. Those receiving
treatment are asked not to return to school or work until they have
received at least 5 days of antibiotics.

[This is the 2nd outbreak of _Bordetella pertussis_ infection
reported within one week, both in junior and senior high school
students. It is among this age group that immunity to the infection
begins to wane and is the reason pertussis vaccine boosters are now
recommended for 11-12 year olds as well as once in adulthood. Usually
a relatively mild disease in this age group resulting in a chronic
cough, infection in this age group can function as a reservoir to
infect infants, who have a substantial morbidity and mortality from pertussis.
