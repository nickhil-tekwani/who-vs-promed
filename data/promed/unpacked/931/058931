To further improve the information you are providing, I would like to correct a minor mistake in the general information on hepatitis E virus (I am currently doing a PhD on the virus). Contrary to what is stated [in the post], chronic infections have been reported since 2008, mainly in immunocompromised individuals like transplant or HIV patients.

This is a link to the 2008 publication that first reported chronic HEV infection: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18287603 (Kamar N et al., Hepatitis E virus and chronic hepatitis in organ-transplant recipients. N Engl J Med. 2008 Feb 21;358(8):811-7.)

A good review on the subject can be found here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21458513 (Aggarwal R. Clinical presentation of hepatitis E. Virus Res. 2011 Oct;161(1):15-22. Epub 2011 Mar 31.)

Reduction of immune suppression and both interferon and ribavirin have been found effective in treating chronic hepatitis E.

I hope this will help to improve the background information on HEV.
