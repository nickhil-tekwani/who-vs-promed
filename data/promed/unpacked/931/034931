Potato cyst nematode found in Gippsland
---------------------------------------
A 20km (12.4mi) quarantine zone in Thorpdale's potato region has
been declared following the discovery of potato cyst nematode (PCN).
The discovery, made during routine crop surveys required to meet
standards for seed potato certification, could have a devastating
effect on the industry. Department of Primary Industries (DPI)
scientists identified PCN in soil samples taken from the affected
property this week. Additional samples have been sent to an
interstate laboratory for further confirmation.

DPI Principal Plant Standards Policy Officer David Beardsell said
that DPI was meeting with potato industry authorities and growers
today [17 Oct 008]. "A team has been set up by DPI to manage the
response to the detection which is likely to include an intensive
soil surveillance program, to establish the PCN status of other
properties in the district," he said. "This will be in addition to
the ongoing soil testing required by certified seed growers."

Dr Beardsell said trade restrictions would apply to areas where PCN
was detected including a 20 km exclusion zone. No plant material or
equipment from the zone can be moved interstate. "Unfortunately this
detection has serious implications," he said. "It will affect market
access for both seed and fresh potatoes grown in the area around the
detection site."

The discovery comes just 6 months after a plant protection zone was
declared in Gippsland and after 16 years of testing found no evidence
of PCN. Mr Beardsell said Thorpdale supplied up to 30 percent of
Australia's certified seed potatoes, so there could also be
repercussions for seed supply around the country next season. "Joint
efforts by DPI and industry to effectively manage this case of PCN
will minimise both the risk of spreading this disease further and the
trade implications," he said.

Dr Beardsell said the industry and DPI had effectively managed
previous cases of PCN in the Gippsland area. He said it was not known
how the disease entered the property. "PCN can be transferred on
machinery or product but we also know it can remain dormant in soil
for up to 20 years," he said.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_) and pale (_G. pallida_) cyst
nematodes cause serious crop losses in potato. They can also infect
other solanaceous crops and weeds. Symptoms on potato are stunting,
yellowing and wilting of leaves, as well as a reduced root system.
Damage to the crop varies but can be a complete crop failure. The
pathogens survive in soil in the absence of a host as cysts
containing viable eggs for up to 20 years. Spread occurs via infected
soil, water, wind, or on plant material. It takes about 6-7 years
from introduction into a potato paddock before numbers of the
nematodes reach a detectable level. Disease management includes
exclusion, quarantine, and crop rotation with non-host species. For
more information on these nematodes please see previous ProMED-mail
report no. 20080714.2138.

The report above does not state which of the 2 species has been
detected. However, _G. rostochiensis_ has been found in the region
previously and it is therefore more likely that this is the pathogen
referred to.
