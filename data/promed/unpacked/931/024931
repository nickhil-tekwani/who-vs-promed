Students in Montana start shots for rabies
------------------------------------------
About 90 elementary school students in Montana have started a series
of rabies shots after a parent let them touch a dead bat that was
later confirmed to be diseased [see ProMED-mail reference below]. The
mother of 2 students gave presentations in 5 classrooms and allowed
the kids to touch the dead bat last week [29 Sep - 3 Oct 2008]. She
offered each student who touched the bat a sanitary wipe.

The exposed students will receive 6 shots of anti-rabies vaccine.
Stevensville Elementary School officials say they will use liability
insurance to pay up to USD 70 000 for the exposed children to be
vaccinated. The overall cost could surpass USD 150 000.The school has
since set a policy requiring that anyone visiting the school obtain a
visitor pass.

[The risk for the children in this incident of contracting rabies as
a result of touching a dead rabid bat is non-existent provided that
none of them had an exposed wound. There is a remote possibility that
virus could inadvertently be transferred mechanically to a child with
an open wound not directly involved in touching the dead bat. But it
is likely that the bat had been long dead with little residual
infectivity before the children were able to touch it.

However, I appreciate that the school authorities are obliged to take action.

One wonders why the parent concerned had access to 5 classrooms and
allowed 90 children to touch the dead bat.
