On 31 Mar 2013, the China Health and Family Planning Commission notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of 3 cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9). The cases were laboratory confirmed on 29 Mar 2013 by China CDC. Laboratory testing for influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and A(H5N1), as well as for novel coronavirus, has been negative.

The cases were reported from Shanghai (2 cases) and Anhui province (one case). All 3 cases presented with respiratory tract infection with progression to severe pneumonia and breathing difficulties. Disease onset was between 19 Feb 2013 and 15 Mar 2013. Two of the cases died. The 3rd case is currently in critical condition.

To date, no epidemiological link between the cases has been identified. An investigation including follow-up of contacts is ongoing. So far, no further cases have been identified among the 88 identified contacts under follow up.

Investigations into the source of infection and mode of transmission are ongoing.
