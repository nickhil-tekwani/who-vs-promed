Salmonella Outbreak Linked to Italian-Style Meats
-------------------------------------------------
Since the notice on 24 Aug 2021, CDC combined the outbreak of _Salmonella_ Infantis infections and the outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium infections into one investigation. As of 26 Aug 2021, the data for the 2 outbreaks will be reported together. No new cases have been reported since the previous notice.

Epidemiologic data show that Fratelli Beretta brand prepackaged Uncured Antipasto trays may be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and may be making people sick.

Epidemiologic Data
------------------
As of 25 Aug 2021, a total of 36 people infected with either the _Salmonella_ Infantis (13) or _Salmonella_ Typhimurium (23) strain have been reported from 17 states [for map and timeline see Salmonellosis, st Typhimurium, Infantis - USA: Italian style meat 20210824.8619411].

The true number of sick people in the outbreaks is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreaks may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many infected people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Officials also obtained sick people's shopper records with their consent. Of the 25 people with information, 22 (88%) reported eating a variety of Italian-Style meats. Among 15 people who remembered the specific product or had shopper card records showing a purchase, 14 had Fratelli Beretta brand prepackaged Uncured Antipasto trays.

Public Health Actions
---------------------
CDC is advising people not to eat Fratelli Beretta brand prepackaged Uncured Antipasto trays with "best by" dates on or before 11 Feb 2022. This does not include Italian-style meats sliced at a deli. The investigation is ongoing to determine if additional products are linked to illness.
