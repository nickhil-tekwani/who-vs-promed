Outbreak kills 250 000 fish at hatchery
---------------------------------------
About 250 000 rainbow trout died in a sudden disease outbreak at a south
western Idaho fish hatchery, a loss of about 8 per cent of Idaho's annual
output of catchable-sized trout. It was the second such outbreak of
_Ichthyophthirius multifilis_ in as many years at the state Department of
Fish and Game hatchery in Nampa.
Officials say it probably arose when stress from overcrowding weakened the
fish, making them more susceptible to the parasite. The outbreak happened
in January [2007], but became public this week [5-7 May 2007] because the
state agency is trying to manage remaining stocks of 6 to 8 inch fish at
its 5 other hatcheries to make certain lakes and streams still get enough
fish to satisfy anglers.
Tom Frew, who manages the Nampa [ID] site, said careful manipulation of
stocks at other facilities should make up for the losses. He said
scientists are assessing just what went wrong. One possible change to avoid
future outbreaks, he said, might be to reduce the number of fish raised at
the Nampa hatchery and increase it elsewhere. "The parasite multiplies very
rapidly," said Frew, who estimated the cost of the die-off at US $40 000,
including fish food and labor. "By the time we see signs, the disease has a
pretty strong hold on the animal."
In all, the state produces about 3 million catchable-sized trout every
year, among some 26 million total fish produced. The parasites, commonly
referred to as "ich," are visible as white spots on a fish's gills and
skin. As their attack intensifies, fish "flash,", or turn on their sides,
as they try to scrape off the bugs. The fish become lethargic and
eventually die. In the end, the parasites become so numerous on an infected
fish's gills that it simply smothers.
In addition to the outbreaks in Nampa, a sudden thunderstorm last year
washed debris-laden runoff into Idaho's Sawtooth hatchery near Stanley,
weakening chinook salmon and making them more susceptible to the parasite,
Frew said. "Normally, they're capable of sloughing off the parasite," Frew
said. "Anytime fish are in captivity, in the aquarium industry, or where
the fish are in a closed system" there's a danger of an outbreak.
Nampa's hatchery has 10 raceways, all fed by artesian wells. The disease
was found in all the raceways. Due to the hatchery's design, it's not
possible to empty the raceways of water to sterilize them, leaving the
parasite present year after year. Though hatchery officials haven't changed
their fish-raising regimen in a dozen years, Frew said, the disease appears
to have gained a more lethal toehold in 2006 and 2007. "For some reason,
the last couple of years, we've had some problems with ich at the Nampa
hatchery," Frew said. "There's not really a lot we could do, without a
complete rebuild of the Nampa hatchery."

[This species of parasitic ciliate is commonly referred to as "ick," or
"ich", a disease infecting and damaging the skin, gills, and/or eyes of
many species of fish. It often occurs in aquariums and wild fresh water
fish. The parasite's life cycle is direct and simple. The trophozoites are
found in pustules on the fish and escape when the pustules rupture. The
trophozoites settle to the substrate, form a "cyst," and then reproduce
asexually. The cyst, now containing hundreds of "swarmers" (or tomites),
breaks open, and the swarmers search for a new host. Upon contacting a new
host, the swarmer or tomite burrows into the host's tissue and grows into a
new pustule.
This parasite is found on many different species of fish under natural
conditions, but it is a particularly serious parasite under conditions of
confinement and high population density (such as aquaculture ponds,
aquariums, etc).
Usually white spots and pustules are obvious by visual inspection
throughout the skin of a fish infected with ick. In addition, a gill biopsy
may be used to determine infection. These parasites are large (1 mm in
diameter).
There are a number of commercially available treatments for the parasite.
These parasites may be treated by adding diluted formaldehyde, malachite
green, or methylene blue to the water. - Mod.TG]
