Measles outbreaks in Europe
---------------------------
As of 18 Apr 2011, 33 countries in Europe have reported more than 6
500 measles cases. Epidemiological investigations and genotyping have
confirmed transmission of measles virus among several countries in the
Region and to the Americas.

Belgium* has reported 100 cases to date, compared to 40 cases in all
of 2010.

Bulgaria* has reported 131 cases this year, compared to 24 000 cases
in 2009-10.

France* reported 4 937 cases from January to March 2011, compared to
5 090 cases reported in all of 2010.

In Serbia**, nearly 300 cases have been reported from Leskovac in the
southeastern part of the country.

Spain* has reported 2 ongoing measles outbreaks since October 2010,
with more than 600 cases reported in Andalusia. In the 1st outbreak,
the most affected areas are Sevilla and surrounding municipalities,
where more than 350 measles cases have been reported since January
2011. Cases of measles are reported among health care workers as well.
The 2nd outbreak was reported in the province of Granada, where about
250 cases have been reported since October 2010.

Since the beginning of a measles outbreak in September 2010, the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia** has reported 636 cases as of
the 1st week of April 2011, with more than 400 cases diagnosed in
2011. The national capital, Skopje, has been most affected by the
outbreak.

Turkey* reported an outbreak in Istanbul with more than 80 cases in
January 2011.

In all the outbreaks except for the 2nd outbreak in Spain and the
outbreak in Turkey, the D4 genotype of measles virus has been
confirmed. The B3 genotype of measles virus was isolated from cases in
the second measles outbreak in Spain, while the D9 genotype,
originating from and common in south-east Asia (e.g., Malaysia and
Indonesia) was confirmed to have caused the outbreak in Istanbul,
Turkey in January 2011.

In addition, this year, there have been outbreaks and an increase in
the number of cases reported in Germany*, the Netherlands*, Norway*,
Romania*, Russian Federation**, Switzerland* and the United Kingdom*.

Travel increases the risk for exposure to measles virus and its
further spread into susceptible populations if [they are] not
vaccinated. To prevent further spread, WHO encourages health
authorities to advocate immunization before travel and to provide
immunizations through health systems' immunization services according
to existing national immunization schedules.

The WHO recommends 2 doses of measles vaccine for all children and at
least one dose prior to international travel for adolescents and
adults who are unsure about their immunity status.

Measles outbreaks spread across Europe: European Immunization Week
------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 30 countries in WHO's European Region have reported a
marked increase in measles cases, with 6500 so far in 2011.
Epidemiological investigations and genotyping by laboratories confirm
exportation of the virus among several countries in the Region and to
other regions of the world. Outbreaks and the further spread of
measles are likely to continue so long as people remain unimmunized or
do not get immunized on time according to the routine immunization
schedule. An increase in international travel during the Easter
holidays (22-26 Apr 2011) will further increase the risk of
exportation and importation of measles.

This provides a compelling reason to promote European Immunization
Week (EIW), which runs from 23 to 30 Apr 2011. This year, more than 50
countries will take part in the initiative, the largest number since
EIW began in 2005.

"With shared borders and considerable population movement, countries
share health threats," said Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for
Europe. "There is a need to create strong partnerships to prevent and
control diseases, such as measles, in our Region. European
Immunization Week reminds us that there is much to celebrate about the
good work already done on immunization, but there also remains a great
deal of work to do -- and quickly."

As part of the activities planned for EIW 2011, the WHO Regional
Office for Europe will host a regional launch in Brussels, Belgium, on
26 Apr 2011 at 10:00 (CET). Her Royal Highness Princess Mathilde of
Belgium will open the launch, as WHO/Europe's Special Representative
for Immunization. The launch will be followed by a roundtable
discussion focused on measles outbreaks that will involve
representatives from several European countries that are currently
experiencing outbreaks.

"EIW 2011 provides a platform for countries to come together and
collaborate on joint planning of preventive measures and effective
responses to the common threats we face from vaccine-preventable
diseases," said Ms Jakab. "Only through this kind of collaboration can
we achieve the goals of boosting vaccination coverage and eliminating
measles and rubella by 2015."

In Belgium, the national surveillance system has reported 100 cases
of measles so far in 2011. The country reported only 40 measles cases
in the whole of 2010. In the hot spot of this outbreak, Ghent, the
virus is affecting primarily children younger than one year (and
therefore unimmunized) and students of anthroposophic schools
(unimmunized due to beliefs).

France faces the largest outbreak, with 4937 measles cases officially
reported from January to March 2011, a figure almost equal to the
total of 5090 cases reported for whole of 2010. The national
immunization system is implementing measures to get children
vaccinated during the outbreak, including vaccinating infants at 9
months of age, in line with WHO recommendations for a measles
outbreak, and offering vaccine to all unimmunized and under-immunized
people over the age of 9 months. Other significant outbreaks are
taking place in Serbia, Spain (Andalusia), The former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia and Turkey.

Measles remains one of the leading causes of death among young
children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective
vaccine. To prevent further exportation and importation of measles,
both inside and outside the Region, WHO/Europe encourages health
authorities of Member States to advocate for immunization before
international travel and to make vaccinations available to
travellers.

During European Immunization Week, other countries around the Region
will take action on their own immunization priorities. 7 Member States
(Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) will synchronize rounds of
polio supplementary immunization activities with trivalent oral polio
vaccine (tOPV) in April and May 2011. Many of these activities will
take place during European Immunization Week and will be recognized as
part of EIW activities.

In Albania, a subregional meeting will bring together representatives
from more than 10 countries to discuss shared solutions to boosting
immunization among migrant and vulnerable populations. Other Member
States will participate in EIW through media and information
campaigns, press conferences and immunization outreach via mobile
immunization teams, as well as through a range of meetings, workshops,
training events for health care workers and conferences.

Members of the media are invited to apply for accreditation to attend
the EIW launch event by contacting <eiw@euro.who.int>. Video footage
will be available the day after the event on the WHO/Europe website.

Measles resurgence in Belgium from Jan to mid-Apr 2011: a preliminary
report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:
--------
>From 1 Jan to 14 Apr 2011, a total of 155 measles cases were notified
in Belgium, whereas throughout 2010, there were only 40. Of the 103
cases with known vaccination status, 87 percent had not been
vaccinated with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. The resurgence of
measles is the consequence of insufficient vaccine coverage in
previous years. Efforts to communicate the benefits of measles
vaccination to the public and to advise health professionals on
control measures and outbreak management are ongoing.

Resurgence of measles in Belgium in 2011
----------------------------------------
Since the beginning of 2011, Belgium has seen an increase in the
number of measles cases. As of 14 Apr 2011, a total of 155 cases were
reported through mandatory notification. In 2009 and 2010, only 33 and
40 cases, respectively, were reported. This in contrast to the period
between April 2007 and May 2008, when a large measles outbreak, with
more than 130 cases, occurred in Orthodox Jewish families in Belgium
[1].

Background
----------
Since 2003, paediatricians in a sentinel network surveillance system
(PediSurv) and general practitioners in Belgium have recorded the
number of measles cases [2]. Mandatory notification of the disease was
adopted in the French-speaking community (in Wallonia) in 2006 and in
the Flemish-speaking community (in Flanders) and in Brussels in 2009,
as recommended in the national plan for elimination of measles and
congenital rubella [3]. Physicians and microbiologists have to report
suspected measles cases without delay to the regional health
authorities or to PediSurv [2]. Laboratory confirmation is strongly
recommended for sporadic cases, preferably by testing of oral fluid.
Samples are sent to the Belgian National Reference Laboratory, where
detection of measles virus-specific IgM and measles virus detection by
PCR is carried out, as well as genotyping of the circulating viruses
[4]. Notification forms are collected and analysed centrally at the
Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health.

Vaccination of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced in
Belgium in 1985 (one dose) and 1995 (2 doses). The current measles
vaccination strategy consists of 2 doses of MMR vaccine, the f1st at
12 months of age and the 2nd between the age of 10 years and 13 years.
Vaccination is free of charge and systematically offered through the
childhood immunisation and school health programmes. Immunisation
status is verified by child care and public school services. If
necessary, a catch-up dose is offered at the age of 5­7 years and
14­16 years. Despite these programmes, vaccination coverage of more
than 95 percent with one dose of MMR vaccine -- needed to meet the
measles elimination goal for 2010 [5] -- was reached in 2008 in only
one of the 3 regions in Belgium (Flanders). Coverage of 2 MMR doses is
lagging further behind.

Outbreak description
--------------------
Measles resurgence in Belgium this year began with an outbreak in
anthroposophical schools in Ghent (Flanders) in February. A total of
56 children were affected -- most of their parents were opposed to MMR
vaccination. At the same time, outbreaks and sporadic cases were
reported elsewhere in the country, especially in Brussels and
Wallonia. These outbreaks often occurred after people had travelled to
France, with spread of the measles virus to unvaccinated family
members or pupils at school. Besides the outbreak in Ghent, we
identified at least 6 small interfamilial outbreaks, 2 in schools and
one in a Roma community. In 16 cases, an epidemiological link or
recent ski trip to France was reported, and one case fell ill after
travelling to Italy. In France, more than 3700 measles cases were
reported in January and February 2011 [9].

Virus transmission is still ongoing, with 151 cases reported in
Belgium during January to March 2011, compared with 5 for the same
period in 2010. A further 4 cases were reported during 1 to 14 Apr
2011.

Details of cases
----------------
Of the 155 Belgian cases identified between January and 14 Apr 2011,
147 had known date of birth and date of symptom onset. Their median
age was nine years (range: 0­20 years). The median age of the cases
not belonging to the outbreak in anthroposophical schools (n=99) was
12 years (range: 0­49 years). One 3rd of all the cases were aged 15
years or older (Figure 3). Among the 12 cases aged less than one year,
8 were laboratory confirmed. 4 cases were younger than 9 months.

Discussion
----------
Although measles incidence rate in 2009 was low, at 4 per 1000 000
population, it did not meet the measles virus elimination indicator of
less than one measles case per 100 000 population. This suggests that
progress has been made in Belgium towards elimination, but the current
measles resurgence is not unexpected, given the insufficient
vaccination coverage of MMR vaccine in Belgium in the past, allowing
for silent accumulation of susceptible individuals. Current coverage,
as reported by the French-speaking and Flemish-speaking communities,
at 18­24 months of age with at least one dose is 92.4 percent in
Wallonia and 96.6 percent in Flanders [6-8].

During outbreak investigations, several cases were identified who had
not been notified to the local health authorities. This suggests that
data available through the routine notification system underestimate
measles incidence. Failure to notify such cases can be explained by no
medical consultation for secondary cases in the same family plus
insufficient knowledge or low motivation of some doctors regarding the
notification procedure. The fact that measles only became mandatorily
notifiable in 2009 for all the Belgian territory may also contribute
to the underreporting.

The existence of groups with low measles vaccine coverage due to
opposition to vaccination for religious or philosophical reasons or
fear of side effects has been identified as one of the major barriers
to achieve measles elimination in Europe [11]. In Belgium,
anthroposophical schools, in which most of the children are
unvaccinated, are mainly located in Flanders; only few are in Brussels
and Wallonia. Other groups were affected by measles virus in Brussels
and Wallonia -- for example, a Roma community and families opposed to
vaccination due to fear of side effects. Patients attending medical
practices in which attention is not paid to their vaccination status,
presumably due to reluctance or negligence, can also play a role in
low vaccination coverage.

This resurgence of measles in Belgium highlights the need to improve
and maintain high vaccination coverage, along with disease
surveillance and outbreak-control capabilities. Our findings also draw
attention to the need to sensitise health professionals and raise
their awareness of the issues through medical education. Convincing
parents and health professionals reluctant to vaccinate children with
MMR vaccine will be a challenge. Case investigation of every single
measles case is a prerequisite to achieving the goal of measles
elimination by 2015, planned by the World Health Organization Regional
Office for Europe [12].

WHO warns Bulgaria to immunize against measles
----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised the Bulgarian
government to carry out an immunization campaign against measles after
there have been more cases of the disease in 33 European states,
including Bulgaria. According to WHO's findings, since early 2011
there have been 6500 cases registered in Europe. France has been most
affected, with 4900 people having suffered measles January-March. Some
400 cases have been registered in Macedonia, 300 in Serbia, 131 in
Bulgaria, 100 in Belgium and 80 in Turkey.

3000 cases of measles reported in March (2011)
----------------------------------------------
Measles is exhibiting a real increase in France since the beginning
of the year [2011]. According to figures published by the Institut
National de Veille Sanitaire (INVS), more than 7000 cases of measles
have been recorded since the beginning of the year, with 3750 cases
reported between January and February, and around 3000 cases during
March, compared to 5000 cases during the whole of 2010. Measles is an
acute viral infection causing a characteristic skin rash that mainly
affects children from 5 to 6 months of age, and adults who have not
responded to the recent vaccination appeal, especially those born
after 1980.

The figures are alarming and the medical profession is very concerned
about the number of cases identified in children under one year of
age, which increased 4-fold between 2009 and 2010. These children if
infected may develop a more severe form of illness such as
encephalitis or pneumonia. The only way to avoid such complications is
vaccination, which is the best treatment available today. The child
receives a 1st dose at age 12 months (or 9 months for those in care)
which also protects against 2 other diseases, rubella and mumps. In
France a second dose of vaccine is recommended between 13 and 24
months (or between 12 and 15 months for those in care). The 2nd dose
is intended to protect those children who may not have developed a
sufficient immune response from the 1st dose to protect them against
mumps, measles and rubella (German measles). In fact, vaccination with
a single dose leads to immunity in 90-95 percent of people, while two
doses produces immunity for over 98 percent of vaccinees.

Measles cases reach 673 since beginning of January
--------------------------------------------------
A total of 673 measles cases have been recorded in the province of
Sevilla since the beginning of January 2011. Of these 216 have
occurred in the capital, although the town of San Juan de Aznalfarache
was the original focus of the outbreak, according to the latest
information given to Europa Press by the Department of Public Health
of the Ministry of Health of the Government of Andalusia. According to
this source, the capital that has experienced the largest increase in
the incidence of measles virus infection.The largest increase has been
observed in the slum in the slums of South Range, Litany, La Plata,
Torreblanca and La Candelaria, where as many as 216 people have been
infected. After the capital, San Juan de Aznalfarache, which was the
original epicenter of the outbreak, has been the next most severely
affected with 108 cases, although virus activity has now declined in
this locality with no new cases being reported now.

Elsewhere 63 cases of Alcala de Guadaira, 19 in Dos Hermanas, 15 in
Coria del Río, 13 in Mairena and 8 in Tomares Mairena. A further 213
cases, making up the total of 673 cases are considered by the health
authorities not to be part of this outbreak cluster. The chief public
health officer Ramon Santos, has said that in the case of the main
outbreak none of the victims had been vaccinated, although vaccine
coverage in the Seville area is considered to be 95 percent. The cause
of this outbreak in Sevilla was mainly due to the ignorance of
parents, as was similarly observed in the case of the recent outbreak
in the Albaicín of Granada, where some families families had refused
to have their children vaccinated.

The Public Health Department has again appealed to parents to ensure
that their children had been properly vaccinated (that is, that they
have received 2 doses (at 15 months and 3 years) of measles vaccine,
which is presented as MMR [measles, mumps and rubella triple vaccine]
in the childhood vaccination schedule. The Department is also asking
parents of children between 6 and 15 months residing in the above
areas to have them vaccinated at their local health centre without
delay as measles is extremely contagious.

Measles outbreak hits Brighton and Hove
---------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles in Brighton and Hove has sparked fears that
another epidemic will hit the city. There have been 4 confirmed cases
of the virus [infection] in the last month and doctors are waiting for
the results of lab tests on 6 more suspected victims. Children across
the city from Portslade to Woodingdean have been infected so far and
the number is expected to rise when schools return after the Easter
break.

Health [officials] believe the virus may be starting to circulate
within the community rather than just affecting individual families.
Parents are being urged to make sure their children are vaccinated
with both doses of the measles, mumps and rubella [injection] to try
to stop cases spreading.

Case of measles case puts NHS on alert
--------------------------------------
Doctors and schools are on alert after the 1st case of measles in
Portsmouth in 6 years. Health officials have put out warnings across
the city after an 18-month-old baby recently fell ill with the rare
and potentially fatal infection. The case has shocked and worried the
NHS [National Health Service], which is now waiting to see if it was
an isolated incident or the start of an outbreak.

Matt Pickerill, NHS Portsmouth's development manager for health
protection, said: "This case of measles has come as a bit of a
surprise. The worrying thing about measles is it can be a far nastier
disease than mumps and rubella -- it can be fatal. This is why we are
a bit worried. We do not want to start getting more cases. GPs have
been alerted and sent the symptoms of measles because for some younger
doctors, they may never have seen it before. Schools have been
notified as well."

The child who recently contracted measles had not had the 1st dose of
the MMR jab which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. Every
child is offered 2 doses of the vaccination -- the 1st when they are
between 12 and 13 months old, and the 2nd when they are 3 and a half
years old.

But the NHS says the uptake of the vaccination in Portsmouth is too
low. In 2009/10 only 83 per cent of youngsters had the 2 doses by the
time they were 5. The target is 95 per cent. Parents are being urged
to ensure their children have the MMR. Mr Pickerill said: "Negative
press in the past meant uptake dropped, but there really is nothing to
worry about. The vaccine is very safe and the only way to protect
against measles."

In Hampshire there have been 3 cases of measles so far this year and
7 last year. If your child has not had the MMR vaccine contact your GP
practice. Young people should also check their vaccination status
before going to university.

A total of 3 more measles cases have been confirmed on the Gold
Coast. Queensland Health is urging everyone in the city to be on the
alert for symptoms, following the announcement that 3 more people have
contracted the disease locally.

Gold Coast Public Health medical officer Dr Don Staines said there
appeared to have been ongoing low-level transmission of measles on the
Coast since March [2011]. "We urge everyone on the Gold Coast to
ensure they are protected against measles and to seek medical advice
if they develop symptoms," Dr Staines said.

The initial symptoms are fever, lethargy, a runny nose, moist cough
and sore red eyes, followed a few days later by a blotchy red rash.
The rash starts on the face then becomes widespread. Dr Staines said
symptoms usually started about 10 days after infection but sometimes
longer.

Measles outbreak alert
----------------------
Queensland appears headed for a bad measles season with 12 cases
already identified this year, compared with 14 for the whole of 2010.
7 cases have been reported on the Gold Coast this year in 2 separate
outbreaks.

Queensland Health last night urged anyone attending Carindale
Shopping Centre, in Brisbane's southeast, on 9 Apr 2011 to be alert to
measles symptoms. The alert follows confirmation of a woman shopping
there while infectious.

Brisbane Southside Public Health Medical Officer Brad McCall said
people should consult a doctor if they developed measles symptoms such
as a fever, lethargy, runny nose, moist cough, sore eyes or blotchy,
red rash. He said symptoms usually started about 10 days after
infection. "Measles is one of the most infectious of all communicable
diseases and can be acquired in public places if infectious people are
present," Dr McCall said. Dr McCall said measles complications could
include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and occasionally, death.
He said 2 recent cases on the Gold Coast required admission to
hospital.

Measles outbreak prompts warning for pregnant women
---------------------------------------------------
The recent outbreak of measles is raising concern about its potential
impact on pregnant women and those thinking about having a baby. The
Utah Department of Health is encouraging expectant moms to make sure
they have had both of the [2] needed immunizations for measles mumps
and rubella. Al Romeo says it takes 2 shots for full protection. "It's
a good idea to have that 2nd booster of the MMR, and we want them to
have that booster before they get pregnant so they can have full
immunity."

Contracting measles while pregnant increases the risk of miscarriage
and can also lead to severe complications for the baby. Romeo says
mothers who get the recommended immunizations will protect their
babies before, and after birth. "For young kids under 6 months old,
most of them aren't able to get any vaccinations so moms immunity,
passing through the breast milk, will provide that immunity for the
developing baby."

Health experts recommend getting a booster MMR vaccination if you are
uncertain if you have had one or not. To find out more about
immunizations before and during pregnancy you can visit

Hundreds possibly exposed to measles at college events
------------------------------------------------------
Measles virus [infection] may have spread outside Salt Lake County,
and public health officials are urging Utahns to get vaccinated
earlier than usual. "In an outbreak situation, we are encouraging
people to get the 2nd [vaccine] dose earlier," said Rebecca Ward,
spokeswoman for the Utah Department of Health's communicable-disease
program.

As of Thursday [21 Apr 2011], all the state's 9 confirmed cases had
occurred in Salt Lake County. But because one of those patients
attended 2 large events last week -- potentially exposing about 1000
people -- the outbreak could spread beyond the county's borders.

Health Department spokeswoman Charla Haley said the person attended
the events -- a presentation by author Nicholas Kristof at Salt Lake
Community College in Salt Lake City on 11 Apr 2011 and the
Entrepreneurial Challenge Final Awards Banquet at Rice-Eccles Stadium
at the University of Utah on 13 Apr 2011 -- before knowing they had
measles.

The State and the Salt Lake Valley health departments are seeking
individuals who attended those events and who aren't naturally immune
to the measles, or who hadn't received 2 doses of the vaccine against
the virus. They want those people to quarantine themselves in their
homes until the infectious period has passed: 29 Apr 2011 for the
Kristof speech and 1 May 2011 for the University of Utah event.

"The poison-control center line has been busy, and our hotline has
been busier," said Nicholas Rupp, spokesman for the Salt Lake Valley
Health Department. He said health officials are also contacting Salt
Lake Community College students who attended the Kristof lecture and
weren't fully immunized.

The expanded investigation has yet to lead to an increase in the
number of confirmed or suspected cases, he said. People who have had a
previous measles infection or who were born before 1957 are considered
naturally protected, even if they haven't had a measles, mumps and
rubella (MMR) immunization.

Health officials recommend that people born in or after 1957 receive
2 doses of MMR. People who receive one dose are considered 95 percent
protected; 2 doses provides 99.7 percent protection. Many adults born
after 1957 probably haven't received 2 doses. Schools didn't start
requiring 2 shots until 1999.

But even with the requirement, parents can sign a waiver to exempt
their children from receiving the vaccine. The Salt Lake County
outbreak occurred mostly among unvaccinated people. The ages of those
affected range from 2 to 22, said Ward of the state Health
Department.

Minnesota Measles Outbreak Grows to 21 Confirmed Cases
------------------------------------------------------
More people have come down with measles [virus infection]. The
Minnesota Department of Health is now reporting 21 confirmed cases of
measles. 17 of the cases have been linked to a person who contracted
the virus in Kenya. One case was contracted in Florida, and one in
India. The infection source for one case is currently unknown.

Those who have come down with the measles range in age from 4 months
to 51-years-old. In 7 of the cases the person was too young to receive
vaccine. 8 were old enough, but were not vaccinated. At least one was
vaccinated. Health officials say it is unclear if the remaining 4
people have been vaccinated.

13 people have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported.
