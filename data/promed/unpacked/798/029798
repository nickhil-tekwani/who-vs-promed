The state government on [Tue 26 Feb 2019] told the Karnataka High Court that 8 people have died so far due to Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) in the state. Of the 1512 suspected, 189 tested positive for the virus in Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, and Chikkamagaluru districts. All 41 suspected cases in Udupi tested negative.

A statement in this regard has been submitted to the court during the hearing of a PIL [public interest litigation] petition, filed by KP Sripal and an advocate from Shivamogga. While pointing out that usually 70 000-80 000 doses of KFD vaccine are required every year to prevent the spread of KFD to humans in Shivamoggga and surrounding region, the state said the number of vaccines required is very high this year [2019] due to the sudden outbreak and the order for around 2.7 lakh [270 000] doses has been placed with the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals (IAHVB), Hebbal, which is the only facility in the world to manufacture KFD virus [vaccine]. The IAHVB will be supply 50 000 doses by [11 Mar 2019], another 50 000 doses by [14 Apr 2019], the government said while pointing out that a more potent vaccine for KFD is being developed by the National Institute of Virology, Pune, and Manipal Centre for Virus Research.

It said a committee, comprising a retired IAS [Indian Administrative Service] officer and a medical officer had been constituted on [24 Jan 2019], to inquire into dereliction of duty by staff of health and other services and make necessary recommendations.

A Division Bench comprising acting chief justice L Narayana Swamy and justice PS Dinesh Kumar adjourned further hearing of the petition, which had sought directions to the authorities to make available sufficient quantity of KFD vaccine, to distribute sufficient quantity of dimethylphthalate (DMP) oil, a tick repellent, and to set up more diagnostic centres.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_, characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The virus was first identified in 1957 after it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka state of India. Between 400 and 500 human cases have been reported every year since the diagnosis of the 1st case in 1957.

The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html).

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, linked to increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Risk factors include exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings with herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters at increased risk of contracting the disease. Use of personal protective measures against tick bites and vaccination in high risk groups can be essential steps to prevent KFD. - Mod.UBA
