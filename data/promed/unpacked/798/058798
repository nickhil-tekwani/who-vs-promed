Preliminary results indicate the presence of the lethal H5N1 bird flu virus
in poultry that died en masse in Ukraine's Crimea peninsula last week.
"According to preliminary results it looks to be it," a spokeswoman at the
agriculture ministry told AFP when asked if the H5N1 virus had been detected.
The H5N1 strain has killed nearly 70 people in Asia over the past 2 years.
Earlier, Ukraine's former chief veterinary inspector, Pyotr Verbitsky, was
quoted as saying that preliminary results from a Russian lab showed the
presence of H5N1 strain. "But the tests continue and tomorrow it will be
known for certain," Interfax quoted Verbitsky as saying.
President Viktor Yushchenko fired Verbitsky earlier this week for what he
said was unpreparedness by veterinary authorities for a bird flu outbreak
in Ukraine.
Last Saturday, tests confirmed the presence of an H5-type virus in the
poultry that began dying en masse in the northeast corner of the peninsula
last week. Samples had been forwarded to laboratories in Britain, Italy and
Russia to establish if the virus is of the deadly H5N1 strain, with results
expected this week.
The poultry is thought to have contracted the virus from wild birds,
millions of which use the nearby Sivash saltwater lake as either a
wintering site or a stopover point on their winter migration route.
Yushchenko declared a state of emergency in the affected areas of Ukraine's
southern peninsula in the Black Sea and the villages where the H5 virus has
been confirmed have been placed under quarantine.

Tests have confirmed that birds which died in Ukraine last weekend had the
form of avian flu which can be dangerous to humans, officials said on Thursday.
The outbreak was detected in villages on the Crimean peninsula where about
2500 birds died suddenly. Ukraine has been battling to contain its first
outbreak of bird flu and declared a state of emergency in affected areas.
"We have information that the strain H5N1 was detected," Vyacheslav German,
deputy director of the state institute for biotechnology, told a news
conference.
Bird tissue was sent for laboratory tests to an institute in Russia
immediately after officials detected the disease in several villages in the
northeast of the Crimea. Officials said the strain matched the one recently
found in neighbouring Romania and in Russia. They said the bird tissue was
also sent to Britain for further tests. The test results from Russia are
preliminary, but confirmation was expected on Friday.
Local residents said signs of the illness were detected in September 2005
but that no action had been taken.
The Agriculture Ministry said on Thursday that suspected bird flu had been
found in 2 more villages in the same area. Poultry in the area will be
culled, the ministry said.
President Viktor Yushchenko, who toured the affected area on Monday, has
announced a state of emergency, a measure that the Emergency Ministry said
was key to stop the spread of the disease to other parts of the country. He
also ordered the dismissal of chief veterinarian Petro Verbitsky, saying
animal health authorities had failed to act quickly to detect the outbreak.
The Emergency Ministry, which is overseeing measures to contain the
outbreak, is carrying out a cull of domestic poultry in the affected areas
on the Crimean peninsula in the Black Sea -- a major stopping point for
migratory birds heading south for the winter.
So far its staff have seized more than 29 000 birds in house-to-house
checks in villages sealed off by an exclusion zone. The government is
paying for killed birds from $3 for a chicken to $18 for a turkey.
Ukraine is also vaccinating the population in the affected area against
seasonal flu to boost their immunity. The ex-Soviet state has not reported
any cases of bird flu so far in humans.

The bird flu virus found in Ukraine has been confirmed as the deadly strain
of H5N1, a Russian agriculture official said Friday.
"This is so-called Asian strain H5N1 that poses a potential threat to man,"
Russian chief agriculture inspector Sergei Dankvert told the Itar-Tass news
agency, referring to the virus found in Ukraine and sent to the All-Russia
Research Institute of Animal Protection for testing. Ukraine is also
waiting for results of laboratory tests in Britain next week.
Ukraine recorded its 1st case of bird flu Saturday and the disease has
spread rapidly across parts of the Crimea peninsula in the past week.
Ukrainian officials said Thursday the bird flu virus had been confirmed in
8 residential areas of the Crimea, where more than 30 000 fowl were already
culled.
By Wednesday, the country's Emergency Situations Ministry had seized about
28 000 birds in house-to-house checks in villages in a sealed-off exclusion
zone.

Romania said on Thursday that it had found bird flu in 9 dead hens in a
county close to the Danube delta where the virulent form of the virus first
emerged.
Avian flu has been found in more than a dozen villages in the Balkan state
since October 2005, including in several places outside the delta which is
Europe's largest wetland and lies on a major migratory route for wild birds.
"The H5 virus type has been detected in 9 hens from Zavoaia village,"
Florica Durlea, a bird flu specialist at the veterinarian authority, told
Reuters.
Officials had said earlier on Thursday they were testing samples taken
after suspicious poultry deaths in the village. The village, home to more
than 1000 families, would be quarantined and domestic birds in the affected
area culled, Durlea said.
Since October 2005, 3 outbreaks have been confirmed as the deadly H5N1
strain which has killed 69 people in Asia. Samples from other outbreaks
have been sent to Britain for testing but officials say it is unlikely that
the virus is a different one.
Officials say that high temperatures for the time of the year mean the
migration period for wild birds will be longer, increasing contamination
risks. The Danube delta near the Black Sea is on the migratory route of
millions of wild birds.
Romania's neighbour Ukraine said on Thursday the disease recently detected
in the Crimea peninsula was H5N1. Scientists fear H5N1 risks sparking a
pandemic in which millions of people could die if it mutates into a form
that spreads easily among humans. But so far there is no sign the virus has
changed in this way.

Tests on an infected turkey have confirmed that deadly bird flu in Romania
has spread outside the Danube delta where it was first detected in October
2005, officials said on Friday.
Romania in November 2005 sent a turkey to Britain for further tests after
it was found to have a form of avian flu. The bird was from the small
village of Scarlatesti in Braila county, some 70 miles (110 km) west of the
area where the virus was first detected in birds in the Danube delta.
"The turkey from Scarlatesti in the Braila county tested positive for H5N1
in London," an official from the veterinary agency told Reuters.
The results show the disease has spread to birds on the fringes of more
populated regions of Romania. Scarlatesti, a village of 1000 farmers in an
area of lakes, lies close to a number of towns. It is 170 km from the
capital Bucharest.
It remains hard for people to catch, but there are fears it could mutate
into a form which passes easily from person to person, sparking a pandemic
in which millions could die. There have been no cases of human infection
outside of Asia.
Avian flu has since been found in birds in a dozen or so villages in and
around the Danube delta, Europe's largest wetlands which lies on a major
migratory route for wild birds.
3 previous outbreaks have been confirmed as the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain.
