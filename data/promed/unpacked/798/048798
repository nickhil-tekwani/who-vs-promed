Abstract
-------
Regional cases of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) were documented previously in Turkey. Previous cases were confirmed in South-East Turkey with low cow mortality. Recent BEF-suspected outbreaks with high mortality were documented in many regions of Turkey in 2012.

The aim of study was the epidemiological examination of the outbreak and molecular characterization of the viruses detected from the outbreak. For this reason, blood samples were collected from BEF-suspected outbreak regions.

From the results of RT-PCR, a high rate of BEF-suspected samples (48/60 or 80 percent) was found positive for BEF virus (BEFV) RNA. The nucleotide sequences of the G1 region of G gene of BEFV in the current study during the 2012 outbreak were grouped into cluster II of BEFV. It was suggested that BEFV may be spread out to other neighbor countries in the future years.

[Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), which is not an OIE-notifiable disease, seems to be under-reported. This vector-borne disease caused by the bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family _Rhabdoviridae_, deserves attention due to its high morbidity rate and significant economic losses, mainly due to dramatic decreases in milk production, abortion in late pregnant cows, loss of condition, temporary infertility in bulls, and some deaths.

The following additional data, selected with slight editing from the text of the paper above, may be of interest.

"Previous BEF cases were reported in the South-East region of Turkey where there is a border with Syria, Iraq, and Iran. In summer 2012, BEF suspected cases with high mortality were reported by official and unofficial veterinarians in many regions (Southern, Eastern, Western and Central Anatolia, Black Sea, and Marmara Regions of Turkey) (A map, fig.1, is available on page 12 of the paper at the source URL above).

"1st cases were noticed in June 2012 from the provinces (Adana, Sanliurfa, and Hatay) adjacent to the Middle East. Then, similar cases were reported from provinces in many regions of Turkey during the summer months until the end of September 2012. Animal owners and veterinarians reported that the disease was detected in many animals (mean 35 percent morbidity) in the farms, and many of the animals recovered within 3 to 4 days. But, mortality was reported from about 15-20 percent of the ill animals. This mortality rate was higher than that reported in 2008, according to the official reports obtained from the registered farms.

"While earlier outbreaks were recorded in regions which have a common border with Syria and Iran, where BEF was reported previously, the cases of the 2012 BEF outbreak were detected from many regions of Turkey. For example, Sakarya province is a distance of approximately 1000 km (about 621 mi) from the Southern Anatolia Region. In comparison with the distance between these 2 epidemic regions (Southern Anatolia and Sakarya province), it is quite obvious that Sakarya province is not very far (about 400 km/249 mi) from the Balkan countries. Therefore, due to the convenient geographical location of Turkey, it will be possible that the disease may be spread out to Europe countries, such as Greece and Bulgaria in the future years if effective control measures are not taken. The results of the present study may prompt other countries, in some parts of [those neighboring] Turkey, to cooperate in the prevention of BEF.

"There is no vaccination against BEFV in Turkey."

Vaccination against BEF is practiced by several countries where the disease is known to be a significant cattle-health problem, such as Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Egypt, and Israel. For a list (incomplete) of BEF vaccine producers, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Vaccines/disease_list.php?disease=bovine-ephemeral-fever&lang=en.
