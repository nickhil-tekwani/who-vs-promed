Increased incidence of HFRS in Udmurtiya
----------------------------------------
Since the beginning of 2009, 114 cases of hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome [HFRS] have been reported in the Republic of
Udmurtiya. This is 6 times the rate recorded during the same period
of last year. In total during the past year [2008] there have been
1330 cases of HFRS and 2 fatalities in the Republic of Udmurtiya.
HFRS was recorded in all administrative regions of Udmurtiya, but the
highest incidences were reported in the Sjumsinsky, Seltinsky,
Kiznersky, Vavozhsky, Uvinsky, Few-Purginsky, Jakshur-Bodinsky, and
Zavjalovsky regions of the Republic.

The woodland rodent population has survived the winter of 2008/2009
well and consequently the HFRS prognosis for 2009 remains
unfavorable. In Udmurtiya one half of all patients contract infection
during visits to forested areas for recreation and collection of
fungi and berries. City dwellers often become infected in their
gardens, and allotments, and during visits to their summer residences
in the country. In 2008 every 3rd patient was a town or city dweller.
