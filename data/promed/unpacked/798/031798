The discussion of this paper is fascinating because it highlights the difference between the needs of a test for purposes such as screening, surveillance, and clinical diagnosis.

For the purposes of clinical diagnosis, a test has to be good enough to assist an informed physician. Clearly, "informed" here includes an understanding of the implications of the test, and in particular its positive and negative predictive values.

For screening purposes, a test has to have sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be useful, given the background rate of the condition tested for in the population. The lower the proportion of the population with the condition, the lower the positive predictive value will be, and the higher the likelihood that a positive result is a false positive. For uncommon conditions, a test with very high specificity (very few false positives) is required -- otherwise the number of false positives can easily outnumber the number of true positives.

For surveillance purposes, it is most important that the test is consistent over time -- an increase in the diagnosis could, for example:
- be due to a genuine increase in the population; or,
- be an artefact without any change in the actual proportion of the population to have the condition, due to, e.g.:
-- more tests being done; an increase in the proportion of the population being tested;
-- an increase in the proportion of test results that are positive due to either increased sensitivity (fewer false negatives); or
--- decreased specificity (more false positives).
