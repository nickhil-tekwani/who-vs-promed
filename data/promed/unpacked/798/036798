Australia: dengue fever outbreak in north Queensland may be waning
------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of people diagnosed with dengue fever in the north Queensland
city of Cairns has climbed to 280, the Tropical Public Health Unit (TPHU)
said. There have also been 3 cases of the mosquitoborne disease in
Townsville, one in Mossman, north of Cairns, and one in Mareeba, a TPHU
spokeswoman said.
However, the outbreak seems to be tapering off. "There are still some
notifications coming in, so it will continue, but they have said it is
slowing," the spokeswoman said. Some areas of Cairns are still concerning
authorities, and residents are being encouraged to destroy mosquito
breeding sites. The Townsville and Mossman cases were imported from Cairns,
and the Mareeba case was imported by a traveller returning from Bali.
