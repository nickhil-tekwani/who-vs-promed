[According to media-derived information, which (as retrospectively
demonstrated by the current, long-expected official notification to
the OIE) was reliable, Chui was already heavily infected at the
beginning of June 2007 and probably earlier. Reportedly, the disease
was recorded at that time in 6 out of the 8 districts of the Chui
region (province).
Chui is one of 8 main regions (provinces, 1st-order divisions) in
Kyrgyzstan. Since the beginning of May 2007, media reports stated
that FMD was recorded in 3 other provinces, namely Batken, Talas, and
Osh. Kyrgyztan reported to the OIE on 8 Jun 2007 an outbreak in
Batken; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5697>.
In view of the 2 official notifications, the media-derived
information about outbreaks in Talas and Osh deserve to be seriously
considered. For a map of Kyrgyzstan, see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.pdf>.
The website of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright,
UK includes information about the following FMDV serotypes identified
in Kyrgyzstan in recent years: FMDV Asia 1 in 2004, FMDV O in 2006;
see
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/fmd_genotyping/asia/krg.htm>.
Summarizing, Kyrgyzstan has been experiencing, most probably, more
outbreaks than the 2 mentioned in its notifications to the OIE. The
disease is suspected to be spreading in neighboring Armenia; accurate
information on the situation in trans-Caucasian countries and
notifications to the OIE are desirable. - Mod.AS]
