An Indonesian woman from an area just west of the capital Jakarta has
died of bird flu, taking the country's confirmed human death toll
from the virus to 95, a health ministry official said on Monday [14
Jan 2008]. The 32-year-old woman from Tangerang died at her home last
Thursday [11 Jan 2008] after her family had taken her out of a
hospital where she had been receiving treatment a day before, said
Suharda Ningrum of the health ministry's bird flu centre.
Contact with sick fowl is the most common way of contracting bird
flu, endemic in bird populations in most of Indonesia. "She bought a
live chicken and some eggs from a market and cooked them," Ningrum
said, adding there were also chickens living in her backyard. Two
tests at 2 different laboratories confirmed the H5N1 virus.
On Christmas day [25 Dec 2007], a 24-year-old woman from Jakarta also
died from the virus after buying a live chicken from a market. Last
week, a teenager suffering from bird flu was admitted to a hospital
in Jakarta. An official at the hospital said that the teenager was
stable but was still on a respirator to help her breathe.
Indonesia, which has now had 118 cases of the disease in humans, has
had the largest number of deaths from bird flu of any country.
Excluding the latest case, there have been 349 cases and 216 deaths
from the disease globally since 2003, according to World Health
Organisation data.

[According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Table of the
Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/H5N1,
as of 11 Jan 2008, the number of cases for Indonesia is 117 and the
number of deaths 94; see,
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2008_01_11/en/index.html>.
If this case is confirmed by WHO, it will become the 118th case and
the 95th fatality in Indonesia, and the 350th case and 217th fatality
from avian H5N1 virus infection globally. No result has been reported
so far for the 12-year-old boy hospitalised as a suspected case on 8
Jan 2008. For a map showing the geographic locations of human cases
