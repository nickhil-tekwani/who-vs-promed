Cambodia Flu Outbreak Kills 2 Infants
-----------------------------------------
A flu outbreak has hospitalized more than 1000 children in the
Cambodian capital, and taken the lives of 2 babies, forcing some
young patients to share beds and catching doctors by surprise.

The victims were boys, aged 9 months and 14 months, Dr. Kdan Yuvatha,
chief of the technical department at the state National Pediatric
Hospital, said on Thursday [30 Jun 2005]. Both died over the past 2
weeks from severe lung infections. "When they arrived to our
hospital, their conditions were beyond salvation already," the doctor
said.

Deputy Health Minister Heng Tay Kry described the number of influenza
cases as "unprecedented," with more than 1000 children recently being
admitted to Phnom Penh hospitals.

Government and World Health Organization officials have said the
outbreak involves a form of human flu, not the avian influenza that
has killed dozens of people in neighboring countries.

Cambodia is sandwiched between 2 countries, Viet Nam and Thailand,
that suffered heavily from last year's [2004] bird flu. 38 people in
Viet Nam, 12 in Thailand and 4 in Cambodia were killed by avian
influenza, which they contracted from sick birds.

Samples from sick children this week [1st week July 2005] have tested
positive for Influenza B virus, which is a "relatively mild disease
compared to avian influenza," said Megge Miller, an epidemiologist
with the World Health Organization in Cambodia.

Saying the number of children admitted to hospitals with flu was more
than would normally be expected, Miller said an investigation is
under way to determine exactly how many children have been
hospitalized and how many have died.

Officials at WHO headquarters in Geneva declined comment, saying they
did not have enough information on the situation.

Influenza types A or B viruses cause epidemics almost every year
around the world, according to a Web site for the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza B is the less common of the
2 types, but the symptoms are the same for both: fever, headache,
body aches, fatigue, coughing and sneezing.

The outbreak has strained a grossly inadequate health care system
that serves a population in which about 40 percent survive below the
poverty line. Flu vaccines are rarely given.

The large number of cases has forced at least one hospital to put 3
or 4 children to a bed.

Kdan Yuvatha said the outbreak took doctors by surprise at the
National Pediatric Hospital, where preparations were underway for a
possible outbreak of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease that
commonly strikes during the 1st months of the rainy season. He said
the National Pediatric Hospital has received more than 500 patients
with acute respiratory infections in June 2005 alone, compared to 200
in May 2005. "The number keeps increasing this week [1st week July
2005], but the situation is still under control," he said. "Though
the fatality rate is still low, we have to be constantly attentive to
the problem." He said extra beds were being set up in the main ward's
lobby and corridor to accommodate the influx of sick children.

Influenza B is currently also circulating in New Zealand, where 3
young people have died of its Hong Kong strain this year [2005].

[The above newswire does not mention an increase in numbers of cases
reported in this outbreak, but does mention 2 deaths now associated
with this outbreak, and the identification of influenza B virus in a
few of the cases. As mentioned in the 1st posting on this outbreak,
influenza B virus has been circulating in the Pacific, with prior
reports of outbreaks in New Caledonia and New Zealand and possibly
the outbreak in Guangzhou, China listed below. More information on
this outbreak from authoritative sources would be appreciated. -
