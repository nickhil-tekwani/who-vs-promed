Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 16 Jan 2008
Date submitted to OIE: 21 Jan 2008
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: June 2006
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, serotype H5N1

This event pertains to a defined zone within the country
New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 Rivne, Krasnogvardeisk, Crimean
Date of start of the outbreak: 15 Jan 2008
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Species: birds
Susceptible: 25 000
Cases: 173
Deaths: 173
Destroyed: 15000
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: laying hens in 2 poultry houses. 180 day old chickens
were kept in the 1st poultry house and 390 day old chickens in the 2nd one.
The youngest population showed 1st clinical signs of disease. Clinical
signs were detected during epidemiological examination as follows:
depression, disheveled feathers, oedema, and cyanosis of head. The period
from the 1st clinical signs till death lasts from 2 to 8 hours. During
postmortem examination, the following observations were made: enlarged
liver, enlarged gall bladder and kidneys, catarrhal inflammation of
duodenum, pinpoint haemorrhages into submucous membrane of ferriferous stomach.
Outbreak statistics
Species: birds
Apparent morbidity rate: 0.69 per cent
Apparent mortality rate: 0.69 per cent
Apparent case fatality rate: 100 per cent
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: 60.69 per cent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter
Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the owner notified the disease to the Veterinary
Services for the 1st time on 16 Jan 2008. The same day, a commission
consisting of experts of the Veterinary Administration of the Autonomous
Republic of Crimea and Republican Laboratory specialists was constituted.
As of 1600 19 Jan 2008 the destruction of poultry was completed.
No other notifications on illness or loss of poultry in the Autonomous
Republic of Crimea have been registered up to date.
203 groups for control of poultry health status were organized. 201 200
birds in 507 settlements of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea were
examined. 12 poultry establishments were also examined.
State Committee for Veterinary Medicine of Ukraine assigned to the
Veterinary Administration in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea disinfection
means, individual safety kits for conduction of disease eradication. [The
detailed comments are valuable and provide a level of insight into the
situation. However, I can only guess that the last statement above means
that individuals conducting the culling operations were issued personal
protective equipment but I reiterate that I am only guessing. A
clarification would be appreciated. - Mod.PC]

[The 2 outbreaks here represent an opportunity to begin unravelling the
epidemiology of these poultry outbreaks, which is often overlooked and
undervalued. The maps accompanying the OIE reports indicate that both
outbreaks are only separated by the rather large body of water known as the
Black Sea. A quick glance at a map of the area (see
<http://www.maplandia.com/turkey/zinguldak/zonguldak/>) begs the question
of how the flu virus sailed over the Black Sea.
Moreover, which outbreak started first could be helpful in clarifying
details about the epidemiology of this disease in the Black Sea area: 12
Jan and 15 Jan 2008 are report dates for Turkey and Ukraine, respectively,
placing them near enough together in time that spatial relationships should
be considered a critical question. Definitively knowing what direction the
virus travelled would be helpful in many ways and may help us get a sense
whether commercial traffic by land, sea traffic, or wild birds were
involved among other potential sources of spread. - Mod.PC]
