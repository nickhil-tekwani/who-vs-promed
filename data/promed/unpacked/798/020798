District magistrate [DM] B Chandrakala of Bulandshahr [Uttar Pradesh] has ordered medical camps to be set up across the district after a 'mystery fever' broke out in Korora village.

"Korora is a village with a population of 13 000 people. 23 people have been admitted to Bulandshahr district hospital and some others have been sent to hospitals in Meerut and Aligarh. In a span of 24 hours, 16 people from Korora village lost their lives. However, not all these deaths were caused by the fever. Some of the deceased were elderly people, who may have simply died of old age. But we cannot deny that at least some of these deaths were caused by the disease. I visited the village and did an inspection," the DM told TOI.

She added, "Unfortunately, the disease has also spread to surrounding villages. This is why I have ordered officials to set up medical camps across the district. 3 camps have been set up in Korora village alone and several others will be set up in other parts of the district as well. The aim of these camps will be to diagnose and treat the disease. I have asked the chief medical officer of Bulandshahr district to monitor these camps."

Chandrakala said that no further cases have been identified since [Fri 11 Sep 2015]. "There is good news since those who have the fever are slowly recovering and no new cases have been reported recently. However, even those who have been cured continue to feel some of the symptoms. Patients have been complaining of headaches and nausea after having been treated of the disease."

The DM added that while the authorities are still trying to ascertain the exact nature of the disease so it can be fought accurately, it appears to be a dangerous combination of viral fever and malaria. Authorities are trying to contain it as much as they can and making sure that those affected by it get better soon.

The disease, said Chandrakala, seems to be contagious. "Bad hygiene seems to be contributing towards the spread of the disease. Even though this is a village with relatively well-off residents, bad hygiene is an issue. There are open drains and the fecal matter in them sometimes flows in front of houses. We have asked people to maintain hygiene but that is not something we can force upon them."

[There have been occasional reports of undiagnosed febrile diseases in India recently, with scrub typhus suspected.

Additional information including a more complete clinical description of these cases and any laboratory results would be appreciated.
