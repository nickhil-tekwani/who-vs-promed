Authorities say a Graham County man has died of complications from the [a] hantavirus [infection], the 1st reported case of the disease this year [2013]. The Graham County Health Department says the 39-year-old man died earlier this month [May 2013], but no additional information was immediately available Wednesday [22 May 2013].

The hantavirus[es can cause] a rare disease that exhibit symptoms similar to the flu including fever, muscle aches, and vomiting [and may progress to a cardiopulmonary syndrome with a high fatality rate].

In Arizona, 34 cases of the virus [infection] have been recorded since 2001. Of those, 38 per cent were fatal.

Health experts say there's no specific treatment for hantavirus [infection] and victims should seek medical attention as soon as they notice symptoms.

Officials recommend sealing up any openings or crawl spaces around the household that could shelter unwanted rodents and placing traps in areas where rodent droppings have been detected.

[Although not specified, the hantavirus involved in this case is probably Sin Nombre virus. And although the report gives no information about the circumstances under which the man could have been exposed to the virus, the rodent host of Sin Nombre virus is the deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) which is widely distributed in North America and can be found in houses and other buildings.

An image of _Peromyscus maniculatus_ can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg.
