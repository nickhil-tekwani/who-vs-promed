South Korea winning FMD battle
------------------------------
The worst appears to be over for South Korean livestock producers as
the latest foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak appears to have
peaked on the wake of a 2nd round of vaccines. The epidemic forced
Korean officials to slaughter nearly a 3rd of the country's hog and
cattle herds. Damages caused by the outbreak are expected to hover
around USD 2.6 billion.

The Chosun Ilbo reports that the South Korean Ministry for Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced an improvement in
slaughter totals for animals culled to stop the spread of FMD,
indicting success in eradicating the disease from their herds. The
decrease in daily cull numbers appears to be a result of the 2nd wave
of a vaccination campaign.

Nearly 74 percent of hogs and 99 percent of cattle had been
vaccinated by 21 Feb 2011.

"We're cautiously predicting that FMD will abate early next month
once vaccination is completed late this month," Yoo Jeong-bok, the
country's farm minister, told The Chosun Ilbo. Yoo also told the
Yonhap News Agency that damages are estimated at USD 2.6 billion.
Damages are focused on the direct losses to livestock and compensation
for quarantine efforts.

The FMD epidemic was 1st reported in Nov 2010. More than 3.3 million
animals -- primarily hogs -- were culled to keep the disease from
spreading. The country began their 1st round of vaccinations in late
December [2010], but the initial vaccinations were deemed unsuccessful
as more cases continued to be reported and confirmed.

Like many of the country's livestock producers, Lim Kang-soo, a
cattle producer in the South Chungcheong Province, never believed his
cows could fall victim to the contagious disease. "We sterilized
ourselves head to toe whenever we stepped in and out of the shed," Lim
said to the Yonhap News Agency. "Our village is tucked away deep in
the hills, 60 kilometers (37 miles) away from the closest FMD case.
How could this have happened?"

An independent investigation, commissioned by the Icheon municipality
west of Seoul, released a report pointing to transmission by air Â­-
not direct contact Â­- as a likely primary force behind the rapid
spread of the disease.

"Judging by the fact that the FMD spread rapidly in heavily
controlled areas while they were quarantined, there is great
possibility that the disease was boosted by this winter's cold snap
and strong winds, transmitting pathogens via air," said the Icheon
municipality in a press release. [For previous commentary re airborne
spread of FMD, see 20101215.4442, 20110211.0470. - Mod.AS]

South Korea announced in January [2011] that 60 000 tons of imported
frozen pork would be temporarily duty-free. Following the continued
spread of the FMD outbreak, officials nearly doubled the quota for
duty-free pork imports. Officials increased the quota by 50 000 tons
to 110 000 tons.

According to Bloomberg, South Korean pork imports are expected to
jump by as much as 20 percent in 2011. The country imported roughly
180 000 metric tons of pork in 2010.

[According to South Korea's most recent follow-up report (Number 12,
submitted to OIE on 18 Feb 2011; commentary in 20110218.0530), the
last outbreak started on 14 Feb 2011. It affected a farm with 2000
pigs in Hasodong, Dong-gu, Daejeon Metropolitan City, of which 5 pigs
were found to be clinically affected. These affected animals were
culled, the rest of the flock kept alive. This, in line with the
statement in the report, that "the number of culled animals (as part
of disease control) in the affected farms depends on the vaccination
status and timing." It may be assumed that this flock had been
vaccinated earlier, probably twice, enabling the decision to refrain
from a wholesale culling. During earlier stages of the epizootic, all
animals in such a flock would be immediately culled.

This outbreak is the 149th since the start of the South Korean
epizootic in November 2010. Its location can be seen in the appended
map, at

In the meantime, the FMD epizootic in North Korea seems to be
continuing. - Mod.AS]
