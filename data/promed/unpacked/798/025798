----------------------------------------------
West Nile Virus National Surveillance Report
English Edition
7 Aug 2005 - 13 Aug 2005 (Week 32)
Human:
During week 32, 12 West Nile virus (WNV) cases of human illness were
reported in Ontario (7), Manitoba (4) and Saskatchewan (1). As of 13 Aug
2005, a total of 22 human WNV cases have been reported to the Public Health
Agency of Canada (PHAC). Of the 22 cases, 20 were clinical cases and 2 were
asymptomatic. Of the 20 clinical cases, 7 (35 percent) were reported as

Non-Neurological Syndrome, and 1 (5 percent) was Other Clinical /
Unspecified. Three cases are travel-related (see human table).

During week 32, 260 dead birds were tested and 76 (29 percent) were
reported positive for WNV (see bird table). Three new health units in
Ontario reported dead birds positive for WNV. To date, positive dead birds
have been reported in 25 health units in Ontario (Niagara region, Oxford
county, Wellington-Dufferin-Guel, Algoma, Chatham-Kent, Huron County,
Oxford County, Timiskaming, York Regional, Halton, Hastings-Prince Edward,
Lambton, Middlesex-London, North Bay, Northwestern, City of Ottawa,
Peterborough, Thunder Bay, Toronto, Brant, Eastern Ontario,
Hamilton-Wentworth, Peel,Simcoe, and Waterloo), 8 health regions in
Manitoba (Winnipeg, North Eastman, Interlake, Brandon, Central,
Assiniboine, South Eastman, and Parkland), 4 health regions in Quebec
(Laval, Mauricie et Centre-du-Quebec, Monteregie, and Laurentides) and one
health region in Saskatchewan (Regina Qu'Appelle). A total of 2956 dead
birds have been tested since 2 May 2005, of which 180 (6.1 percent) were
positive f!
or WNV. 144 of the 180 positive birds were American Crows.
Domestic Animal:
As of week 32, 2 horses positive for WNV, have been reported in Saskatchewan.
Mosquito:
As of week 32, 189 mosquito pools positive for WNV were reported in
Manitoba (50), Ontario (106), Saskatchewan (32) and Quebec (1). National
West Nile virus surveillance data and maps can be found on the Public
Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) web site at:

Provinces/Territories: Detailed WNV information can be accessed through the
Links section on the PHAC WNV web site.

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis. Click here for further
explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not
state health departments report these cases to CDC. Click here for further
explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was
not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC -
These numbers reflect both mild and severe human disease cases occurring
from 1 Jan 2005 through 23 Aug 2005 that have been reported to ArboNet by
state and local health departments. ArboNet is the national, electronic
surveillance system established by CDC to assist states in tracking West
Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2005
virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 501 cases, 205 (41 percent) were reported as West Nile meningitis or
encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 270 (54 percent) were reported as
West Nile fever (milder disease), and 26 (5 percent) were clinically
unspecified at this time. Please refer to state health department web sites
for further details regarding state case totals.
Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among reported
cases of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance reporting bias.
Serious cases are more likely to be reported than mild cases. Also, the
surveillance system is not designed to detect asymptomatic infections. Data
from population-based surveys indicate that among all people who become
infected with West Nile virus (including people with asymptomatic
infections) less than 1 percent will develop severe neuroinvasive disease.
