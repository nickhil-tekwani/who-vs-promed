The prepared foods section at Whole Foods' Detroit [Michigan] store on Mack Avenue is linked to 2 recent cases of hepatitis A, the Detroit health department announced today, 20 Oct 2016. The department is asking anyone who ate prepared foods at the store from 6-12 Oct 2016 to speak to a doctor and seek preventative treatment.

"While it remains unclear exactly how either of these individuals contracted hepatitis A, and we know that Whole Foods Market Detroit has a comprehensive food safety protocol, we want to do our best to protect our residents and those of surrounding communities who may have been exposed," said Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, executive director of the Detroit health department.

Hepatitis A, a contagious liver disease, can be spread when ingesting food or drink infected with the hepatitis A virus. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, yellow eyes and skin and dark urine, according to the city's health department.

[According to another report (http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/212748366-story), one case was diagnosed in an employee who handles prepared food at the store and the other was a customer who ate prepared food. It is possible that the food preparer also ingested the food vehicle rather than contaminating it. The time of onset of the 2 cases can help differentiate the 2 scenarios. Either way, additional cases are likely to occur. Many cases of acute hepatitis A are asymptomatic or anicteric (not jaundice) and may not be diagnosed. Intervention early in the incubation period with HAV vaccine or immune globulin can mitigate or prevent the infection. - Mod.LL
