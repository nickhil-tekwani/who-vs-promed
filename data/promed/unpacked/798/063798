The number of Polynesians currently affected by chikungunya has increased to 35 000 according to a recent assessment by the Bureau de Veille Sanitaire [BVS; Health Surveillance Office].

Chikungunya is a major epidemic in French Polynesia. Following the appearance of the virus in Polynesian territory this past October 2014, the number of infected people increased to 35 000, according to the latest assessment of the French Polynesia BVS.

Of these 35 000 cases, the BVS reports 7 deaths, including an infant. Of these patients who died, all had a delicate profile. Among them were 3 elderly people, including one suffering from chronic renal failure and an infant of 8 days, infected by his mother at birth.

Since early October [2014], the official start of the chikungunya epidemic, 11 000 people have been infected with the virus. A previous report published on 27 Nov [2014] said that the number of cases of infections in Polynesia had doubled in the space of 15 days.

The exact estimate of the number of infected patients is still difficult. In fact, Polynesians do not visit doctors. "In a neighborhood, there is sometimes a person who is seen [by a physician]; once one has identified [a] chikungunya [virus infection], others know they are infected and do not see a doctor," says Priscilla Bompard, epidemiologist in the BVS.

[The number of chikungunya virus infections in this outbreak in French Polynesia continues to climb rapidly. Since the detection of the 1st cases on 10 Oct 2014, the virus has spread to several islands in French Polynesia, and the case number has now climbed from an estimated 5000 with 2 deaths on 19 Nov 2014, to 18 352 with 4 deaths on 1 Dec 2014, and now to an estimated 35 000 with 7 deaths. It is not clear whether the 11 000 cases cited above are confirmed ones versus the 35 000 estimated cases or represent an earlier number. In any case, the increasing number of new cases indicates that a significant chikungunya epidemic is occurring in French Polynesia and will likely be the source of virus introduction into other Pacific islands.

In the absence of a commercially available vaccine, vector control is the only preventive measure available, which is the reason for the spraying campaign mentioned in earlier reports. Health authorities and the general public need to engage in a collaborative effort to eliminate vector mosquito breeding sites.
