The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) has detected a viral disease that affects mostly okra, cucumber, and tomato crops in several districts of the Upper West Region. Their regional office has been informed. The office was asked to investigate the situation and find effective solutions. Farmers were advised to uproot and bury affected plants to help stop the spread of the disease.

[Although the undiagnosed disease above is labelled as "viral", no further information is given on diagnosis and it is possible that the term is merely used as a general name for an unknown cause.

The crops above belong to different, unrelated families: tomato (_Solanum lycopersicum_; Solanaceae); cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_; Cucurbitaceae); and okra (_Abelmoschus esculentus_; Malvaceae). A number of pathogens (including fungi, bacteria, and viruses) are known for each group, but it is not certain that the problems reported above are due to the same pathogen affecting all 3.

Similar symptoms may be due to different pathogens and/or environmental factors and the problems in the 3 crops may be due to the same or different causes. Effective control measures will need to be based on reliable diagnosis of the causal factors. In the absence of a conclusive diagnosis, disease management may include phytosanitary measures (as mentioned above), clean planting material, and crop rotation.
