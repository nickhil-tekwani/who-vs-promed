A Dutch case of atypical pneumonia after culling of H5N1-positive
ducks in Bavaria was found infected with _Chlamydophila psittaci_. In
late August 2007, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A
virus (HPAIV) of subtype H5N1 was reported in a large duck farm in
Wachenroth, in the county Erlangen-Hochstadt, state of Bavaria, in
Southern Germany (index farm). Daily mortality among ducklings was
approximately 2 percent and the presence of HPAIV H5N1 was confirmed
in several samples (although clinical signs were not typical for
HPAIV H5N1). Protection and observation zones were installed
according to German legislation, and more than 165 000 animals were
subsequently culled.

The epidemiological contact investigation of the flocks (forward and
backward tracing) led to the identification of H5 infection of ducks
in 2 other farms in the nearby county of Schwandorf (contact farms 1
and 2). As in the previous farm, clinical signs were not typical for
HPAIV H5N1. The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, the Federal Research
Institute for Animal Health in Germany, confirmed the presence of the
Asian lineage of HPAIV H5N1. Culling of another 205 000 ducks was
started at these two sites on 7 Sep 2007, exactly 2 weeks after the
first outbreak. Then, 2 days later, low pathogenic avian influenza A
virus (LPAIV) of subtype H5N8 was detected in 2 farms (contact farms
3 and 4) in the 2 adjacent counties of Rottal-Inn and Dingolfing in
Bavaria (approximately 250 kilometres [155 miles] away from the index
farm). On these 5 farms, 438 000 animals were culled. A specialised
company from the Netherlands was commissioned to perform the culling.
We currently have no information about how many foreign nationals
took part in the operation, or whether other foreign companies were
also involved. To our knowledge. the involvement [of] companies and
the hiring of foreign nationals is not unusual.

On 22 Sep 2007, the National Institute for Public Health and the
Environment (RIVM) of the Netherlands informed the Robert Koch
Institute, its German counterpart, about a Dutch poultry worker
hospitalised with high fever and radiologically confirmed pneumonia
who was reported to have been involved in the culling in contact
farms 1 and 4.

Case report
The onset of the disease with flu-like symptoms, including
[low-grade] fever (38 DEG C [100.4 DEG F]), headache, myalgia, a
slight cough and general malaise, was reported by the Dutch poultry
worker on 18 Sep 2007, just inside the upper limit of the potential
incubation period of avian influenza (8 days) [1]. Prophylactic
oseltamivir [dosage] was changed to the therapeutic dosage (75 mg
twice daily), but hospitalisation was not initially necessary. In
accordance with the Dutch preparedness protocol for exposure to avian
influenza virus [2], nose and throat swabs of the patient were taken
on 18 Sep 2007 at home by the Municipal Health Services (the
guidelines recommend isolation [by] cohorting when the patient is
hospitalised to avoid contact with other patients; analogous mixing
with other outpatients should be avoided by taking the samples at
home). The swabs were analysed simultaneously by PCR at the RIVM and
the Erasmus Medical Centre (Erasmus MC), Rotterdam, for general
influenza virus A, specific influenza virus A (H1, H3, H5, H7),
influenza virus B, other respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial
virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus 1-4,
adenovirus, bocavirus and coronaviruses) and _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_.
All result[s], including those for influenza virus, were negative.
However, the patient reported to have taken oseltamivir (irregularly)
as prophylaxis, which could have caused a negative influenza result.

On 21 Sep 2007, the condition of the patient worsened, and he was
admitted in isolation [to] the hospital. The patient then started
antibiotic treatment for atypical pneumonia. The patient's condition
did not initially improve. As a result of this, and because lower
respiratory tract specimens have a higher positive rate for H5N1
[3-5], it was decided to redo the laboratory diagnosis with material
from a bronchoalveolar lavage.

After information about the case from RIVM, the data in the German
national surveillance system were screened for cases of ornithosis
because of the known risk to poultry workers. Results showed 5 human
infections with _Chlamydophila psittaci_ in the county
Erlangen-Hochstadt, where the index farm was located, between January
2001 and September 2007. In 4 of these -- 2 cases from 2001 and one
each in 2004 and 2005 -- work in a poultry abattoir [that] was
reported as the suspected source of infection. Screening the national
database for all cases of ornithosis with additional information
about the source disclosed 2 further cases in the states of Thuringia
from 2001 and 2004 that were potentially linked to professional
slaughtering of poultry in the county of the index farm.

Provided with the information on possible exposure of the patient to
the ornithosis agent, the doctor in charge of the patient, in
consultation with the RIVM, expanded the differential laboratory
diagnosis by PCR testing for the pathogens as indicated above by
including testing for bacteria in the Order _Chlamydiales_ [6]. The
only positive finding for the bronchoalveolar lavage material was in
the _Chlamydiales_ PCR of which the product was identified as _C.
psittaci_ by sequencing as the causative agent of the pneumonia in
this patient. The clinical conditions improved rapidly and the
patient was released from the hospital after 7 days.

Discussion and conclusion
This case showed the usefulness of national and international
surveillance and communication for the rapid diagnosis of human
illness following exposure to potential zoonotic micro-organisms. The
rapid exchange of relevant information on the circulation of
ornithosis was crucial in directing the diagnostic procedure in a
situation [where] primarily exposure to HPAI H5N1 was the most likely
cause of the clinical symptoms.

The risk of transmission of _C. psittaci_ from ducks is well known,
and high seropositivity rates have been reported previously in farm
workers [7]. Since protective measures for HPAI would have been
sufficient for _C. psittaci_ infection, it is not clear how the
patient contracted the infection and other unidentified exposure
situations can not be excluded.

This case is also a reminder that culling of large numbers of
animals, especially in farms suspected to be infected with avian
influenza virus, often involves large numbers of workers coming from
several countries, where recommendations for worker protection might
differ. Therefore, when involved in mass culling, local authorities
should assure the following:
1. Informing cullers about recommended protective measures according
to local recommendations and the current risk assessment (if final
confirmation of the causative agent is pending, strict adherence to
protective measures against potential animal to human transmission is
necessary);
2. Supervising the adherence to these recommendations;
3. Assuring the possibility of tracing and contacting exposed
workers, in case increased risk for exposure to HPAIV is suspected;
4. Ensuring early close collaboration between veterinary and public
health authorities [8].

Furthermore, pre- and post-exposure serum samples of exposed workers
involved in culling might be considered in order to detect clinically
unapparent transmission, enhance knowledge on the risk for infection,
and improve rapid differential diagnosis should workers develop
symptoms after exposure.

A lack of personnel in [the] responsible local authorities and a fear
of economic losses among farming and culling businesses may hamper
these activities. However, the potential risk to public health
demands alertness and close cooperation between the authorities in
charge and the businesses involved, locally and even internationally,
as this case report has illustrated.

[Ornithosis (also called psittacosis) is a zoonosis caused by
_Chlamydophila psittaci_ (formerly _Chlamydia psittaci_), an obligate
intracellular bacterial pathogen. The natural reservoirs are domestic
and wild birds, in which the infection is usually latent, unless the
animals are stressed by crowding or prolonged transport. Many types
of birds are susceptible. _C. psittaci_, which is shed in the birds'
feces, contaminates the feathers and the environment. When the feces
dry, the organisms can become airborne as droplet nuclei that remain
suspended in air, traveling widely by air currents. The dried
organisms can remain viable for months at room temperature.

Humans become infected by inhalation of these infections aerosols;
the organisms are thought to spread via the blood stream to the
reticuloendothelial system. Subsequently, secondary bacteremia causes
lung infection and as a consequence patients develop an atypical
pneumonia syndrome that can resemble influenza pneumonia. Patients
may also have a typhoid-like syndrome, hepatitis, myocarditis,
pericarditis, endocarditis, neurologic involvement, or nephritis. The
incubation period generally is 5-14 days. Person-to-person
transmission is unusual so that isolation of the patient is thought
unnecessary.

Individuals are usually exposed in line of work that includes pet
store work, poultry farming, poultry processing, pigeon breeding, and
veterinary medicine. Inhalation of infectious aerosols generated by
mowing lawns has also been noted to be a risk factor. The diagnosis
is usually confirmed serologically. Treatment with a tetracycline can
shorten the course of the disease. The mortality rate prior to the
advent of antimicrobial treatment was approximately 15-20 percent.
The mortality rate is less than 1 percent with appropriate antibiotic
therapy. - Mod.ML]
