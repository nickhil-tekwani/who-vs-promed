Visitors of one of the sushi bars in the city of Krasnodar are continuing to be admitted to the regional hospital for an "unknown intestinal infection." 17 people have been hospitalized thus far. The 1st of the poisoned visitors of the restaurant of Japanese cuisine was admitted to the hospital with the typical symptoms of food poisoning. This incident did not appear to be an emergency.

After a few hours, poisoned inhabitants of Krasnodar started to arrive in the hospital, one after the other, and their recollection of the history of the disease was surprisingly similar. They all ate in the "About Sushi" restaurant, all having acute intestinal infection and a temperature above 40 C. When the 3rd visitor of the restaurant arrived at the hospital, the physicians officially declared a mass poisoning.

The activity of the restaurant, the visitors of which were in the hospital, was suspended pending clarification of the source of contamination, said the Deputy head of the administration of Rospotrebnadzor in the Krasnodar region, Yuri Ananich. "An administrative investigation was immediately initiated. In the meantime, the activities of the restaurant were suspended. The raw materials will be examined. The staff will also be investigated, and that has already begun. A bacteriological investigation will be carried out within 5 days."

According to official data, the Krasnodar regional hospital for infectious diseases now has 17 patients related to this situation. A few patients with different data from which the hospital did not suspect poisoning have been discharged. These patients were initially suspected of having just an intestinal infection, which has not been confirmed.

Several restaurants, operating under the trademark "About Sushi," in Krasnodar were closed until determination of the responsible party, chef, or suppliers. The 17 hospitalized patients from the Japanese cuisine restaurant are reported as having a condition of moderate severity. However, given the diagnosis of an "unknown intestinal infection," according to the prognosis by the doctors, with the patients receiving the best care and treatment, recovery is still estimated to take about 2 weeks.

It is very difficult to say which of the numerous possible intestinal infections may have afflicted the people. There is no mention of the time from the consumption of the food to onset of symptoms or of what food was consumed. We might be bold and suggest vomiting and diarrhea; however, there may or may not have been other symptoms present. Consequently, it is not possible to suggest an etiology for this situation. - Mod.TG]

[According to the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, 19th edition, 2008, the incubation period of common food-poisoning organisms ranges from

- 30 mins to 8 hrs (usually 2-4 hrs) for staphylococcal infection,
- 30 mins to 24 hrs for _Bacillus cereus_,
- 6-24 hrs (usually 10-12 hrs) for _Clostridium perfringens_,
- within 12 hours for 4 types of shellfish poisoning,
- a few hours for scombroid fish poisoning (resolving spontaneously within 12 hours),
- within 24 hrs for ciguatera (fish) poisoning,
and
- a few hours for puffer fish poisoning, which has a 60 percent case fatality rate.

Take your pick. - Mod.JW]
