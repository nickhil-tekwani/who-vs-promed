----------------------------------------------------------------------
On Thu 10 Feb 2011, it was reported to Institut Pasteur from
Madagascar that 14 people had died from a very contagious disease.
According local health staff, syndromes of patients were likely to be
pneumonic plague. To our knowledge, only 2 out of 7 sputum samples
have given positive results on rapid test strips.

The initial cases appeared in a remote village located 45 km [28 mi]
from Ambilobe (administrative region of Sava [Antsiranana province],
in the north of Madagascar). Other suspected cases have been reported
in other villages closer to Ambilobe. On Fri 11 Feb 2011, bubonic
plague suspected cases have been reported in Ambaja, another city
located in the south of villages where the 1st cases were reported.

Madagascar is an endemic region for plague but cases are generally
located in the Central Highlands. The current outbreak is occurring
in a region were plague is not endemic. It is not clear for now if
the index cases was a patient who came from an endemic area
incubating the disease or in its earlier stages and developed
pneumonic symptoms on arrival. Over the last year the regions of
Ambaja and Ambilobe experienced increasing numbers of gem seekers.
Indeed, sapphires have been recently found between Ambaja and Ambilobe.

Institut Pasteur from Madagascar (IPM) sent on Sunday morning, 13 Feb
2011, staffs by plane in order to collect specimens. A joint team
including MoH (Division of Emergency and Response against Disease,
DULMN) is going on site for investigation.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Heraud for this report. It may never be
clearly determined how _Yersinia pestis_ was introduced into this
area of northern Madagascar where plague has not been endemic. - Mod. LL]
