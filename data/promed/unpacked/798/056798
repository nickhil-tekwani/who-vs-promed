CDC, public health, and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections.

Epidemiologic data show that Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses may be contaminated with _Listeria_ and may be making people sick. A specific type or brand of Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheese has not yet been identified.

As of 11 Feb 2021, 7 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 4 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 20 Oct 2020, to 22 Jan 2021, with 6 recent illnesses in 2021.

State / Number of Sick People
------------------------------
Connecticut / 1
Maryland / 4
New York / 1
Virginia / 1
------------------------
Total / 7

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Listeria_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 2 to 4 weeks to determine whether a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Sick people range in age from 45 to 75 years, with a median age of 61. Six people are Hispanic, and 43% are female. All 7 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. Of the 4 people interviewed, 3 reported eating at least one type of Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses, and all 3 reported eating queso fresco. Public health officials are continuing to interview sick people to try to identify a specific type or brand of cheese.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely got sick from the same food.

State officials are testing samples of Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses that they collected from stores where sick people report purchasing cheeses from.

CDC is advising people at higher risk for severe Listeria illness to not eat Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses (like queso fresco) until we learn more and to contact their healthcare provider right away if they have any symptoms of severe Listeria illness after eating Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses.

[Hispanic style fresh, soft cheese often called queso fresco ("fresh cheese") is a classical vehicle for listeriosis. This bacterium, a Gram positive bacillus, is psychrotrophic, that is, it can grow at refrigerator temperatures and, therefore, can become an issue for refrigerated foods such as cheese, fresh cut fruit, and cold cuts. Infection with _L. monocytogenes_ can be asymptomatic but diarrhea can occur. However, in those with defects in cellular immunity, such as from chemotherapy or in organ transplant recipients, the gastrointestinal infection (which can be asymptomatic) can cause bacteremia and meningitis. Infection can also occur during pregnancy and may cause fetal loss. The elderly are also at higher risk of clinically overt listeriosis.

The following article highlights risk factors for _Listeria_ growth in queso fresco cheese:

Abstract
------
_Listeria monocytogenes_ is a hardy, psychrotrophic pathogen that has been linked to several cheese-related outbreaks in the United States, including a recent outbreak in which a fresh cheese (queso fresco) was implicated. The purpose of this study was to develop primary, secondary, and tertiary predictive models for the growth of _L. monocytogenes_ in queso fresco and to validate these models using nonisothermal time and temperature profiles. A mixture of five strains of _L. monocytogenes_ was used to inoculate pasteurized whole milk to prepare queso fresco. 10 grams of each fresh cheese sample was vacuum packaged and stored at 4, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 C. From samples at each storage temperature, subsamples were removed at various times and diluted in 0.1% peptone water, and bacteria were enumerated on _Listeria_ selective agar. Growth data from each temperature were fitted using the Baranyi model as the primary model and the Ratkowsky model as the secondary model. Models were then validated using nonisothermal conditions. The Baranyi model was fitted to the isothermal growth data with acceptable goodness of fit statistics (R2 = 0.928; root mean square error = 0.317). The Ratkowsky square root model was fitted to the specific growth rates at different temperatures (R2 = 0.975). The tertiary model developed from these models was validated using the growth data with 2 nonisothermal time and temperature profiles (4 to 20 C for 19 days and 15 to 30 C for 11 days). Data for these 2 profiles were compared with the model prediction using an acceptable prediction zone analysis; over 70% of the growth observations were within the acceptable prediction zone (between -1.0 and 0.5 log CFU/g). The model developed in this study will be useful for estimating the growth of _L. monocytogenes_ in queso fresco. These predictions will help in estimation of the risk of listeriosis from queso fresco under extended storage and temperature abuse conditions. - Mod.LL
