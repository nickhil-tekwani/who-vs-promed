According to the Department of Health, of the 500 beds at San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, 261 are filled with measles patients, with patients in one ward having to share beds as the city deals with an outbreak that began in October 2013. In an interview Dr Jose Benito Villarama said the influx of measles patients started last October [2013] and rose steadily from November. By 14 Dec 2013, the Department of Health had tallied 1724 measles cases across the country, 21 of which led to death. "The increase in the number of measles patients has forced us to convert sections of San Lazaro Hospital into measles ward," Villarama said.

At least 75 have died of the disease in 2013, according to a report on "24 Oras" aired Friday evening [3 Jan 2014] that quoted Villarama. As he led reporters on a tour of the hospital's Pavilion 4, which houses 96 measles patients, Villarama disclosed 2 measles patients now occupying one hospital bed. 3 pavilions in the hospital were converted to measles wards, the report said. Villarama said as soon as a measles patient shows signs of dehydration or difficulty in breathing, the patient must be rushed to the nearest hospital for medical attention.

The "24 Oras" report showed most of the patients were babies and children. One of the patients was 3 months old, puzzling even Health Assistant Secretary Enrique Tayag, who said the common age for measles patients is 6 months. Outside, dozens more wait for their turn to be admitted to the hospital full of patients, the report said.

In a separate press conference, Tayag said the National Capital Region reported the highest number of measles cases, registering 744 out of the 1724 cases. In 2012, the DOH listed 1536 measles cases. Southern Luzon with 436 cases and Western Visayas with 282 complete the top 3 regions hardest hit by measles, Tayag said. Of the country's 17 regions, only Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao, and Caraga regions had no reports of increased measles cases. Tayag urged local government units and health centers nationwide to administer vaccines against measles daily, if possible. "You cannot escape measles... " he said.

Tayag added one may have measles without prior vaccination or exposure to the virus. He said the ideal age for children to be vaccinated is from 9 months to one year old and from 15 months to 18 months old. The US Department of Health and Human Services says a 2nd dose of the vaccine must be given when a child is 4 to 6 years old. The symptoms of measles are redness of the eyes, coughs and colds, fever reaching 40 deg C [104 deg F], and rashes on the ears, face, neck, and the whole body. Tayag said the patient may also have difficulty in breathing.

The outbreak of the measles virus is recorded in the following areas:
- Calooca: Dagat-dagatan, Bagong Barrio
- Las Pinas: Talon Singko, Talon Dos
- Manila: Quiapo, Sampaloc, Tondo, Santa Cruz, Port Area, Santa Mesa, Binondo
- Muntinlupa: Alabang
- Paranaque

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease transmitted through droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. The WHO said there is no specific treatment for measles and recovery may take 2 to 3 weeks. But complications of measles in malnourished children may result in blindness, diarrhea, pneumonia, encephalitis and ear infection.

A measles outbreak [alert] has been issued in Victoria after an infected man came into contact with thousands of people during Boxing Day [26 Dec 2013] at a shopping centre in Melbourne [Victoria]. Similarly, the New Zealand Ministry of Health has confirmed 10 cases of affected people, all of whom have attended a Hip-Hop competition in New South Wales.

Dr Rosemary Lester, Chief Health Officer of the Department of Health of Victoria, said that a 21-year-old man infected with measles may have passed the highly contagious virus to countless others on Boxing Day while he was shopping at the Chadstone Shopping Centre in Melbourne. It's likely that the man caught the virus at the World Supremacy Battlegrounds' Hip-Hop dance competition in December [2013], The Age reports. New Zealand has also announced a measles outbreak in that country after 10 cases have been confirmed. All patients have been linked to the same international dance competition in Australia.

Dr Harriette Carr, acting deputy director Public Health at the Ministry of Health, said that 3 of the infected had attended the dance contest, while the rest of the cases were family or acquaintance of those who had attended the competition. No-one has been hospitalised yet, though all those currently infectious are being kept isolated at home. The cases of measles in both Australia and New Zealand appear to have originated in the Hip Hop dance competition, and the main source is suspected to be a competitor from the Philippines. Marco Selorio, the founder of the competition, believed that the 1st known case was a Filipino who competed even though he had shown flu-like symptoms. He became bedridden later.

"We were first contacted by the Auckland regional public health service on 30 Dec 2013 and informed that a New Zealand dancer contracted measles," he had been quoted by The Age as saying: "The following day, the Australian Department of Health alerted us that another dancer from South Australia was also infected. "Since we got the call from the department of health, we have been trying to contact everyone to make sure this does not spread any further." The World Supremacy Battlegrounds' Hip-Hop dance competition was attended by over 2000 people, with competing teams from Guam, Japan, and Malaysia, as well as the 3 aforementioned countries: Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

Australian Medical Association Victoria VP Dr Tony Batone stated that that any non-immunised person could acquire the virus within 3 metres [10 ft] of an infected person. Adults who are between 33 and 47 years old are the most at risk of catching measles, symptoms of which include fever, sore throat, cough, and red eyes, and then rashes becoming visible on the face and down the body after 3 to 7 days.

Anyone who develops the symptoms is advised to contact their GP or hospital first to alert them instead of turning up at the hospital.

Last month [December 2013], a stadium-sized crowd descended on Sydney for the 2013 World Supremacy Battlegrounds [WSB dance competition]. "The biggest and most prestigious international hip hop street dance competition in the Southern Hemisphere" promised to bring together the year's best dancers, b-boys, and beat boxers to battle it out over 2 days for their share of AUD 15 000 [USD 13 436] in prizes. The December event proved an initial success, but some punters have left with a little more than they bargained for.

A little over 3 weeks after the event, promoters have issued a statement warning World Supremacy Battlegrounds attendees to be on the lookout for measles symptoms. According to the ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation], at least 14 people who attended the event have since been diagnosed with measles, meaning the WSB was the likely site of an outbreak of the notoriously infectious disease.

"NSW Health issued a health alert after being made aware of 3 measles cases in people who PROBABLY contracted the infection while in Sydney," WSB posted to their Facebook. "NSW Health communicable diseases director Dr Vicky Sheppeard advised anyone who attended the dance event to be alert for measles symptoms...NSW Health believes that there may be other cases in the community now or secondary cases could be developing."

Anyone who attended the 2013 World Supremacy Battlegrounds who is now exhibiting measles symptoms -- fever, tiredness, runny nose, cough, sore red eyes, and a red blotchy rash -- are advised to contact their local public health unit.

Families across the North Island have been warned of a measles outbreak after at least 10 people contracted the disease following a hip-hop event in Sydney [New South wales, Australia].

Public health officials have warned people who attended the World Supremacy Battlegrounds in early December [2013] -- and anyone else who has come into contact with them -- to look out for symptoms of the infectious disease.

The 1st confirmed case was a young Auckland [New Zealand] woman, and 9 other cases in Turangi and Taupo [Waikato, New Zealand] have since been confirmed. 4 of those who have contracted the disease were at the event, and the others came into contact with them.

As extended families travelled around the country over Christmas, officials fear they have spread the disease more widely than would usually be the case. They have since been in contact with people in Wellington, asking them to stay isolated until they can be cleared of the disease. Nobody has yet been admitted to hospital but all those infected -- ranging in age from 5 to 28 -- have been isolated.

New South Wales [Australia] health authorities have also confirmed 3 measles cases in connection with the event, issuing a public warning on Tuesday [31 Dec 2013] after an Adelaide competitor became ill. Public health staff in New Zealand are interviewing people who attended the event, checking whether they were immunised or infected, and have been getting in touch with anyone with whom infected patients have been in contact.

Auckland's last major measles outbreak, in 2011, resulted in nearly 500 cases and 80 hospital admissions, and this is the city's 1st case since June 2012. Ministry of Health acting deputy director of public health Harriette Carr said any outbreak was significant because it was New Zealand's goal to become measles-free. However, the latest outbreak was not yet an epidemic. "It's highly infectious, and the problem with measles is that people are infectious for 5 days before they get the symptoms ... people are giving it to other people before they know they've got it."

Identifying and isolating people until measles could be ruled out was important to stop it spreading, as the number of cases could multiply quickly, she said.

There was a perception that measles was a mild disease, but she warned it could be very serious for those who were vulnerable, such as babies and the elderly. New Zealanders born before 1969 are likely to have been exposed to the disease as children, and are considered immune. However, Dr Carr said those born after 1969 and before big pushes to improve measles immunisation rates were at risk. "It's very important if people have symptoms of measles that they seek medical advice.

"Because measles can be easily spread, however, it's also important that people contact the Healthline 0800 number or ring their doctor first, so that their symptoms can be initially assessed without risk of infecting others in a GP waiting room or hospital emergency department."

She said the latest outbreak was a reminder that the most effective protection against measles was immunisation. "I think the message is, if you haven't been immunised, it's a good new year's resolution."

More measles cases linked to a dance festival in Sydney [Australia] have been reported in New Zealand. There is now one confirmed case of measles in Auckland and 9 confirmed cases and one case under investigation in Turangi and Taupo [Waikato, New Zealand]. NSW Health [Australia] issued a health alert after the World Supremacy Battleground hip hop competition in Sydney. The 1st case was notified on 27 Dec 2013, when a competitor from Adelaide [South Australia] became sick.

Public health authorities in New Zealand are working to identify people who may have been in contact with those affected. "Measles can be a serious disease and is easily spread to someone who is not immunised, nor who has not been exposed to measles previously," the acting deputy director public health at the Ministry of Health said. Dr Harriette Carr said the Auckland case, and 3 of the 9 confirmed cases in Turangi/Taupo had attended the hip-hop competition. The remaining cases were family or known to those who had been at the festival. No one has been hospitalised but all those currently infected are being kept isolated at home. Festival attendees are also known to have come from Huntly and Hamilton, and local public health unit staff there are following up. "It's very important if people have symptoms of measles that they seek medical advice," Dr Carr said. She said the cases are a reminder that the most effective protection against measles is immunisation.

Measles symptoms start with a high fever, which develops about 10 days after exposure, followed by a runny nose, cough, red eyes, and small white spots inside the mouth. A red blotchy rash on the neck and face appears 3 or 4 days later before spreading to the rest of the body.
