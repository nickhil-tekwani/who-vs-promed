Health officials closed a hotel in Acapulco on Thursday after guests
reported developing symptoms of a lung infection that afflicted more than
400 customers in April and May, 2001.
The Calinda Beach hotel will remain closed while the owners investigate
reports
from customers who called in at the end of September saying they had symptoms
of histoplasmosis, said Rafael Garcia Pimentel, president of the
Association of
Hotels and Tourist Businesses in Acapulco.
This is the third time the 300-room, 34-floor hotel has been linked with
histoplasmosis, a fungus infection that affects the lungs and may occasionally
invade other parts of the body.
The fungus that causes the illness spreads through the air, lives in soil
and is
sometimes found in the droppings of birds and bats. People typically are
exposed
after inhaling dust particles that have the fungus' spores.
The disease usually is not life-threatening.
In April, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
detected
histoplasmosis in 35 U.S. tourists who had stayed at the Calinda Beach.
On May 1, the fungus was reported by 229 U.S. students who had stayed at the
hotel during Spring Break.
On May 2, the health secretary for the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon
detected 180 cases of the infection in as many vacationers who had stayed
at the
hotel.
The hotel "will not reopen until it is confirmed that no problem related to
histoplasmosis exists," Garcia said.
The hotel belongs to the chain CARSO owned by Mexican billionaire Caorecasts.

[Apparently this is an ongoing problem at this hotel. I am not aware that
other tourist facilities in Acapulco that have been similarly affected. -
