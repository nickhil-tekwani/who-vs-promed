Rotavirus Surveillance -- Worldwide, 2001-2008
-----------------------------------------------
Rotavirus infection is the leading cause of severe acute diarrhea
among young children worldwide (1,2). An estimated 527 000 children
aged less than 5 years die from rotavirus diarrhea each year, with
greater than 85 percent of these deaths occurring in low-income
countries of Africa and Asia (3). Two licensed rotavirus vaccines
have shown efficacy of 85-98 percent against severe rotavirus
diarrhea in trials conducted in the Americas and Europe (4,5), and
they have been introduced into routine immunization programs in 11
countries in these regions and in Australia. Additional trials of
these vaccines are ongoing to assess efficacy in low-income countries
of Asia and Africa, where vaccine performance might be affected by
factors such as concurrent enteric infections, greater prevalence of
malnutrition, and a greater prevalence of unusual rotavirus strains.
Results of these additional trials are expected within the next 1-2
years. To collect epidemiologic and burden-of-disease data that could
form the basis of vaccination policy worldwide, beginning in 2001,
the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with partners,
established networks of hospital-based sentinel surveillance sites
for detection of rotavirus diarrhea and characterization of rotavirus
strains. This report presents an analysis of results from the WHO
surveillance networks for 2001-2008, which indicated that
approximately 40 percent of diarrhea hospitalizations among children
aged less than 5 years worldwide were attributed to rotavirus
infection. The most common rotavirus strains found were G1, G2, G3,
G4, and G9, and the distribution of strains varied markedly across
regions. Since 2001, regional networks of sentinel hospital-based
sites have been established in 35 countries located in each of the 6
WHO regions worldwide.* These sites have conducted rotavirus
surveillance using standard guidelines described in a WHO generic
protocol (6). The period of surveillance differed among the sites
depending on when regional networks were established. All data
presented in this report were obtained during August 2001-July 2008.

At each site, all children aged less than 5 years hospitalized with
diarrhea (i.e., 3 or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) were
enrolled. Approximately 5 cc of bulk stool were collected from each
patient with diarrhea and placed in a screw-top container, preferably
within 48 hours of hospital admission. Specimens were stored in a
freezer at -4 F (-20 C) until rotavirus testing was performed,
generally in a hospital laboratory within the country. A confirmed
case of rotavirus diarrhea was defined as diarrhea in a patient who
had rotavirus antigen detected by a commercial enzyme immunoassay
(EIA) (most frequently used assay was IDEIA Rotavirus [Oxoid Ltd
(Ely), Cambridge, United Kingdom]) in a fecal specimen. G and P
genotypes of strains were characterized in a sample of
rotavirus-positive specimens by reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) (7), generally in a regional reference laboratory.

To avoid bias from seasonal patterns of rotavirus disease, only data
for complete years at each site were analyzed. The percentages of
children hospitalized with diarrhea who tested positive for rotavirus
and the distribution of strains among rotavirus-positive specimens in
each WHO region were examined. Median detection rates and the range
of detection rates for all countries within each region and for all
countries overall were calculated. Data for the Southeast Asian and
Western Pacific regions were combined for this report because
countries in these 2 regions were part of a single surveillance network.

A total of 62 584 (range: 3374--26 065 per WHO region) hospitalized
patients aged less than 5 years with acute diarrhea were tested for
rotavirus during the study period at all sites combined. The overall
median detection rate of rotavirus among all countries was 40
percent. The median rotavirus detection rate was lowest in the Region
of the Americas (34 percent) and highest in the Southeast Asian and
the Western Pacific regions (45 percent).

Of the 4936 rotavirus-positive specimens from all regions for which
strains were characterized, 325 were from the African Region, 388
specimens were from the Region of the Americas, 323 were from the
European Region, 1290 were from the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and
2610 were from the Southeast Asian and the Western Pacific regions.
The most common strains in all regions except the Eastern
Mediterranean and African regions were G1P[8], G9P[8], and G2P[4],
accounting for approximately 2/3rds of strains in these regions. In
the Eastern Mediterranean and African regions, specimens
characterized in the category "other" accounted for 50 percent and 46
percent of strains, respectively; this category included specimens in
which either the G or P type (or both) of the infecting strain could
not be characterized.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
The hospital-based surveillance findings in this report indicate
that, during 2001-2008, rotavirus accounted for approximately 40
percent of hospitalizations for diarrhea among children aged less
than 5 years worldwide. This percentage is greater than those
percentages reported in 2 literature reviews (one reviewing studies
published during 1986-1999 and one reviewing studies conducted during
1990-2004), which indicated a median rotavirus detection rate of 22
percent and 29 percent, respectively for diarrhea hospitalizations
among children aged less than 5 years (2,3). The higher rotavirus
detection rates in the surveillance networks described in this report
might reflect more standardized approaches for selection of patients
(e.g., enrolling inpatients only and excluding those with milder
disease) and/or improved collection and testing of specimens (e.g.,
obtaining whole stool specimens and avoiding rectal swabs, which
might yield a falsely low rotavirus detection rate) than were used in
the studies included in these reviews. Alternatively, the higher
detection rates described in this report might reflect changing
trends in the etiology of severe childhood diarrhea over the past 2-3
decades, reflecting either an absolute increase in the incidence of
rotavirus diarrhea or a relatively greater decrease in the incidence
of diarrhea from other causes. One review of more recent studies
published during 2000-2004 reported a median detection rate of 39
percent (1), which is comparable to the overall rate observed in the
surveillance data presented in this report. Similarly, surveillance
data collected using a consistent approach (i.e., systematic sampling
of patients seeking care for diarrhea) at Dhaka Hospital in
Bangladesh during 1993-2004 also indicate that the percentage of
childhood diarrhea hospitalizations attributed to rotavirus increased
from 22 percent during 1993-1995 to 42 percent during 2002-2004 (8).

The substantial health burden of rotavirus diarrhea in the world
underscores the need for effective interventions (e.g., vaccines) for
the control of this disease as part of a comprehensive approach for
prevention and control of diarrhea. For optimum results, rotavirus
vaccines need to provide good protection against the range of
rotavirus strains in circulation. Although the 2 licensed rotavirus
vaccines differ in strain composition (i.e., one is monovalent, and
one is pentavalent), both appear to provide protection against a
variety of strains, including some strains not included in either of
the licensed vaccines (4,5). The findings in this report support
other observations that strains with G types 1-4 and 9 generally are
the most prevalent (9), although the Eastern Mediterranean and
African regions showed a high prevalence of other strains. As
rotavirus vaccines are implemented in immunization programs
worldwide, the sentinel hospital-based rotavirus surveillance
networks described in this report will provide valuable baseline
information to assess the future impact of vaccination. These sites
also will provide platforms for conducting specialized epidemiologic
studies of vaccine performance (e.g., vaccine effectiveness
evaluations) and for detecting possible changes in the epidemiology
of rotavirus disease (including possible changes in strains) in the
post-vaccination era. In countries of Latin America where vaccines
have been licensed and recommended by WHO, existing surveillance
networks currently are being used to conduct such evaluations of
vaccine impact and effectiveness.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations.
1st, although the countries participating in the various regional
networks conducted surveillance using a standard generic WHO
protocol, methods were adapted according to local needs (e.g.,
obtaining information on use of oral rehydration therapy or
antibiotics before hospitalization) and availability of resources.
These variations might have affected the comparability of data across
sites, but key factors such as criteria for enrollment of cases,
procedures for obtaining fecal specimens, and methods of rotavirus
detection and strain characterization were well standardized. Formal
assurance and standardization systems are being implemented to ensure
further improvement in the quality and comparability of data across
various countries and networks. 2nd, although surveillance generally
was conducted in large pediatric hospitals that cared for a
substantial number of patients with acute gastroenteritis, these
sites might not be representative of the total population of the country.

Data generated from global rotavirus surveillance networks highlight
the burden of rotavirus hospitalizations, including those in
low-income countries that are eligible for financial support for
vaccine purchase through the GAVI Alliance (formerly known as the
Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations). 14 low-income
countries in regions where vaccine efficacy is proven (i.e., Latin
America and Europe) are currently eligible for GAVI Alliance support
for rotavirus vaccine purchase. If ongoing trials in Africa and Asia
show good vaccine efficacy, this support likely will be extended to
the remaining 58 countries eligible for GAVI Alliance funding in
other regions. The availability and use of rotavirus vaccines
globally should have a substantial impact on hospitalizations and
mortality associated with childhood diarrhea and thereby will
contribute to achievement of the United Nations' Millennium
Development Goals for reduction of childhood mortality.

[These data demonstrate the substantial burden of rotavirus diarrhea

The hospital-based surveillance findings in this report indicate
that, during the period 2001 to 2008, rotavirus accounted for
approximately 40 percent of hospitalizations for diarrhea among
children aged less than 5 years worldwide. These findings also
support other observations that Group A rotavirus strains of G
serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 generally are the most prevalent, although
the Eastern Mediterranean and African regions showed a high
prevalence of other serotypes. At least 15 G serotypes and 27 P
serotypes have been recognized, and it remains to be seen whether the
2 currently approved vaccines (one monovalent and the other
pentavalent) will have any marked impact on the prevalence of
rotaviral diarrhea in children in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. - Mod.CP]
