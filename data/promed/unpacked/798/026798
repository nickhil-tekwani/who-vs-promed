Adding to a total of 10 incidents of contact with rabid animals in Middlesex County recently, a rabid raccoon fought with 2 dogs in the yard of a private property in nearby Spotswood, resulting in the animal being killed by the dogs' owner.

The Middlesex County Office of Health Services is reporting that a raccoon tested positive for rabies in Spotswood, Middlesex County, in the vicinity of Burlington Avenue and Madie Avenue. This is the 10th rabid animal reported within Middlesex County for 2016, but the 1st rabid animal reported in Spotswood.

On Wed 29 Jun, a raccoon was found to be acting strangely and aggressively in a Spotswood resident's yard by 2 dogs and an altercation occurred. The raccoon was killed by the owner in the altercation and was sent to the New Jersey Department of Health Laboratory for testing.

It was reported on Tue [5 Jul 2016] that the animal tested positive for rabies. The dogs are considered exposed to this animal, and while they have been treated by a veterinarian following the incident, the dogs will be quarantined for 45 days. The 2 residents were given a letter to see a physician regarding possible rabies post exposure treatment. Additionally, Middlesex County Office of Health Services' Registered Environmental Health Specialists will be distributing rabies fact sheets within the area.

The Middlesex County Office of Health Services continues to monitor rabies cases within the municipality. Residents should report wild animals showing signs of unusual behavior to the Police Department. Additionally, it is recommended that residents should avoid contact with wild animals and immediately report any bites from wild or domestic animals to your local health department and consult a physician as soon as possible. Finally, be sure that all family pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations and licenses.

Rabies is caused by a virus which can infect all warm-blooded mammals, including humans. The rabies virus is found in the saliva of a rabid animal and is transmitted by a bite, or possibly by contamination of an open cut. New Jersey is enzootic for raccoon and bat variants of rabies. Bats, raccoons, skunks, groundhogs, foxes, cats, and dogs represent about 95 percent of animals diagnosed with rabies in the United States.

State health and wildlife officials warned area residents to be vigilant after an animal resembling a mink bit several customers Mon [4 Jul 2016] at the Wal-Mart on Post Road in Westerly.

Officials from the state Departments of Health and Environmental Management said late Tue [5 Jul 2016] that "several" customers were bitten between 4 and 5 p.m. on the 4th of July. The agencies are asking anyone who may have had physical contact with a small, black mammal, either inside the Westerly Wal-Mart or in the immediate vicinity to contact the department during business hours at 401-222-2577 or outside of business hours at 401-272-5952.

A press release from the agencies said at least 2 people were bitten, but neither came forward to seek treatment. Because the animal was not tested, state officials said they were are operating under the assumption that it could have rabies. The individuals who were bitten, and others who may have had contact with the animal, are at risk of rabies exposure and should be evaluated, the authorities said.

Once symptoms appear, rabies is fatal in people and in animals. Rabies immunization must be started as soon as possible after exposure. The public is reminded to always:

- Make sure all pet dogs, cats, and ferrets are up to date on rabies vaccinations, as required by state law.

- Avoid all contact with stray, wild, or free-roaming domestic animals, and avoid feeding these animals.

- Avoid feeding pets outdoors; as this will attract other animals (this is especially dangerous when feeding groups of free-roaming cats).

- Dogs should be walked on leashes and kept in fenced yards. Do not let pets wander unsupervised.

- Report all animal bites to local city or town animal control officers.

- Securely cover all garbage cans so wild animals cannot scavenge for food.

[While the NJ raccoon was killed and tested, the Westerly "mink" appears to have got away so there is just the strong suspicion of a rabid exposure. Still, this should be taken seriously. For statistics on animal rabies cases in NJ go to: http://www.nj.gov/health/cd/rabies_stats.shtml. In 2016 they have already identified rabies in 49 terrestrial animals and in one bat.
