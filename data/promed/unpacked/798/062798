Botulism outbreak in four states linked to alfalfa cubes
--------------------------------------------------------
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in cooperation with the departments of agriculture in Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico and Texas, is investigating cases of illness and death in horses. The FDA is aware of at least 98 horses in these states who have developed neurologic signs. At least 45 of these horses have died or were euthanized due to declining health. Their signs are consistent with botulism.

The FDA is cautioning horse owners not to feed Top of the Rockies alfalfa cubes with the date codes 111222, 111322, 111422, 111522 and 111622. Manzanola Feeds of Manzanola, Colorado, has recalled these cubes directly. The company directly distributes the alfalfa cubes to feed stores and co-ops in 10 states. Further distribution is possible, so it is important to check the date codes if you have this product.

The FDA is currently conducting further testing to pinpoint the exact cause of the horse illnesses. Horse owners should immediately contact their veterinarian if their horse ate this product and shows signs of neurologic illness. Signs can include muscle tremors, difficulty eating or swallowing, difficulty standing or collapse.

["Botulism is a rapidly fatal disease with motor paralysis. It is commonly caused by eating food contaminated with the toxin (a type of poison) produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. This organism grows rapidly in decomposing animal tissue and sometimes in plant material. It results in rapid death due to the paralysis of vital organs. Botulism is not usually an infection but a poisoning. The frequency of botulism in animals is not known with accuracy, but it is low in horses." (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/horse-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-horses/botulism-in-horses)

"There are 7 types of _C. botulinum_, differentiated by the antigenic specificity of the toxins: A, B, C1, D, E, F, and G. Types A, B, and E are most important in humans; C1 in most animal species, notably wild ducks, pheasants, chickens, mink, cattle, and horses; and D in cattle. In horses, the most common type in North America and Europe is type B (> 85% of US cases)... Type G, isolated from soil in Argentina, is not known to have been involved in any outbreak of botulism." (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/veterinary/generalized-conditions/clostridial-diseases/botulism-in-animals)

Of the 7 types of _Clostridium botulinum_ toxins, "the C1 toxin is seen in most animal species, although type B is most common in North America and Europe. The usual source of the toxin is decaying carcasses or vegetable materials such as decaying grass, hay, grain, or spoiled silage. Toxins of all types have the same action."

"The signs of botulism are caused by muscle paralysis. They include paralysis becoming progressively more severe, disturbed vision, difficulty in chewing and swallowing, and overall weakness. Death is usually due to paralysis of the lungs or heart. Diagnosis of this condition is difficult, and it is often made by excluding any other possible causes of paralysis and by association with a likely source of the toxin.

"Botulism may also originate in 2 other ways. _Clostridium botulinum_ has occasionally been found to grow in the gastrointestinal tract and produce toxins there. When the toxins are released, they cause typical botulism. This occurs in foals usually less than 4 weeks old and results in the shaker foal syndrome. Foals may be found dead without previous signs, but most often, foals show signs of paralysis that slowly progresses. Stilted gait, muscle tremors, and the inability to stand for more than 4 to 5 minutes are key signs. Other signs include difficulty swallowing, constipation, dilated pupils, and frequent urination. As the disease progresses, labored breathing with extension of the head and neck, rapid heart rate, and respiratory arrest occur. Death occurs most often 1 to 3 days after signs are first noted. Botulinum antitoxin has been used for treatment, with varying success. Early administration to foals, before they can no longer stand, is reported to be successful. Full supportive care is also important. In endemic areas, such as Kentucky, vaccination with type B toxoid appears to be effective.

"A 3rd form of botulism occurs in humans -- and sometimes in adult horses -- when the bacterium grows and produces toxin in a wound. This is referred to as wound botulism." (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/horse-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-horses/botulism-in-horses)

"Botulinum antitoxin has been used for treatment with varying degrees of success, depending on the type of toxin involved and the species of host. Treatment involves hydration, correcting electrolyte disturbances, and general supportive measures. Treatment of ducks and mink with type C antitoxin is often successful; however, such treatment is rarely used in cattle. Early administration of antitoxin (type B) specific or polyvalent to foals before recumbency (30 000 IU, IV) is reported to be successful. Supportive care in valuable animals is essential; prognosis is poor in recumbent animals. In endemic areas (e.g., Kentucky), vaccination with type B toxoid appears to be effective."
