A harmless form of bird flu was found in Duhok. After the discovery
of a harmless strain of the bird flu in the province's poultry,
procedures are being developed to prevent its spread.

"More than 50 000 chicks were destroyed at 2 poultries in Semel town
because of the H9 strain of bird flu," said Luqman Tayeb Omer,
general director of the Duhok veterinary office. He gave assurances
that this type of bird flu is not dangerous to humans, but he also
stressed that strict procedures must be taken to contain it.

The veterinary office is developing a plan with related sides,
especially the health and agriculture directories in the province.
Omer showed optimism and stressed that the owners of the 2 infected
poultries have already shown cooperation in fighting the disease.

Mosul is suspected to be the source. "According to our information,
this disease is found in Al-Hamdaniya, Talkef, and Shalalat districts
near Mosul. It came from there. Thus, the government should take
measures to prevent chicks from being brought here from those areas,"
said Omer.

The hatcheries in Duhok are clean from the infection, Omer stated.
"There are 2 hatcheries in the province: one in Semel and the other
in Miruna district. In every period of 21 days, the 2 hatcheries
produce 24 000 to 26 000 chicks." They are now being supervised.

Regarding the danger of the H9 strain, Omer gave further assurances
that "this type of disease is found in several world countries and
does not affect humans if necessary procedures are taken."

Bassim Ali Askar, a student of veterinary medicine at Duhok
University, said: "There must be protections and health procedures,
but eating these chickens is not dangerous." He warned that this
disease can spread through touch, but if the meat is boiled well, it
can be safely consumed.

The danger of H9 is to poultries and their production, said Askar,
and the disease has to be controlled to avoid economic damages.

The dangerous bird flu, known as H5, spread throughout parts of the
Kurdistan Region in February 2006, killing 2 people. Thousands of
chickens were destroyed as a result.

[Low pathogenic avian influenza of the H9N2 strain is regarded
enzootic in the Middle East, including Iraq/Kurdistan (see the FAO
update references). This strain is indeed not pathogenic for humans.
The only effective way to prevent its spread and consequent economic
losses is by mass vaccination, as several countries (e.g. Israel) routinely do.

For Mosul and Hamadaniya in northern Iraq, see map (zoom in) at
<http://healthmap.org/promed?name=Mosul%2C+N%C4%ABnaw%C3%A1%2C+Iraq&g=99072&v=36.335,43.119,6>.

To exclude the possible involvement of the zoonotic H5N1, laboratory
tests of all suspected cases are essential. Such tests should rule
out another poultry disease with similar symptoms, also enzootic in
the region, namely Newcastle disease. Differential diagnosis of the 3
disease entities can be achieved only by laboratory investigations. - Mod.AS]
