Leishmaniasis can be transmitted by biting midgets
--------------------------------------------------
Australian researchers said Wednesday [22 Dec 2010] they have found a
deadly parasite can be transmitted by more than one species of
insect, raising hopes the discovery could save lives. The
leishmaniasis parasite causes a disease that leads to large ulcers
forming on the skin.

According to Menzies School of Health researcher Deborah Holt, no
human cases have been recorded in Australia since the leishmaniasis
parasite was discovered in Australia 7 years ago. The [strain] of
parasite in Australia has only infected kangaroos and wallabies.

Scientists believed the disease could only be transmitted by
sandflies, but Dr Holt said research shows biting midges can also act
as a vector. Tens of thousands of people around the world are
infected by leishmaniasis [parasite] every year and thousands die.

"That's the 1st evidence anywhere in the world that an insect other
than a sandfly is capable of transmitting the parasite," she told ABC
News on Wednesday [22 Dec 2010].

"This raises real possibilities that there are other insects involved
and that may be a reason why some of the control programs don't work
as well as they would be expected to." And in addition there are some
places in the world where the vector is unknown and they cannot find
evidence that they are being transmitted by sandflies. And now we
believe that this may be because they are being transmitted by another insect."

Holt said if a deadlier strain was to enter the country from
overseas, it could pose a significant risk to people.

[The information in the news release is based on studies so far only
available at the Australian Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
website
(<http://www.daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/emergency/wedpp/leishmania-in-nt>).
The study indicates that the new species of _Leishmania_ identified
in Australia (Dougall A et al: New reports of Australian cutaneous
leishmaniasis in Northern Australian macropods. Epidemiol Infect.
2009; 137(10): 1516-20; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19288959>) is transmitted by
biting midges and not by sandflies. The midges have been identified
as "day feeding midges of the _Lasiohelea_ spp., with a prevalence of
up to 15 percent from a new undescribed species." Biting midges are
small flies belonging to the order Diptera, and other biting midges
are vectors of bluetongue and African horse sickness.

If confirmed, the finding indicates that this group of insects could
also be vectors in other parts of the world, which will have
implications for control programs. - Mod.EP]
