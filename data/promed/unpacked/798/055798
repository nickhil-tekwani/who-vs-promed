African horse sickness appears in Western Cape of South Africa
--------------------------------------------------------------
2 of 4 horses that died over the weekend in the Western Cape region of
South Africa tested positive for deadly African horse sickness.
The outbreak of the noncontagious viral disease, which affects horses,
mules, and donkeys, was found at the Elsenburg Agricultural College, where
work horses died on 21 Feb 2004, the South African Press Association reports.
"Preliminary tests conducted at the Equine Research Centre yielded positive
results for African horse sickness," said Johan Gelderblom, a member of
South Africa's executive council for agriculture, environmental affairs,
and development planning. "These tests were repeated at the Onderstepoort
Veterinary Institute confirming the diagnosis. Further tests will be
carried out to identify the virus type involved in the outbreak."
The source of the infection, spread by arthropods known as midges, was
already being investigated during a wide search of the area. The Elsenburg
Agricultural College is about 25 miles from the African horse sickness-free
zone, the only area in South Africa from which horses can be exported to
other countries.
Clinical signs may include a fever, hemorrhages in the mucous membranes,
subcutaneous swelling of the head, fluid in the lungs, and death. A vaccine
with 2 separate injections is available.

[AHS, an OIE List A disease, is an infectious but noncontagious viral
disease affecting all species of equidae. AHS is caused by an orbivirus of
the family Reoviridae and is characterised by alterations in respiratory
and circulatory functions. AHS is transmitted by at least 2 species of
_Culicoides_. 9 different serotypes of the virus have been described.
Details on the AHS vaccine, produced and available in South Africa, are to
be seen at

The recording of AHS so close to the Western Cape Province -- the only
province in South Africa that is regarded as free from the disease --
is indeed a cause for concern.
Data on the African Horse Sickness (AHS) serotype involved in the current
cases will be appreciated. AHS does not affect humans. - Mod.AS]
