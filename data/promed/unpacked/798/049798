Medina county elk tests positive for chronic wasting disease
------------------------------------------------------------
Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials have confirmed chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an elk located within the South-Central Texas CWD Zone. The elk was harvested on a high-fenced premises with common management as a property where white-tailed deer were previously confirmed to have CWD.

This case was detected as part of the ranch's herd management plan, which was developed by TAHC to assess the ranch's risk of CWD.

CWD has been found in free-ranging elk across the United States, including New Mexico and Colorado. This is the 2nd known elk in Texas to test positive for CWD. The 1st CWD positive elk in Texas was a free-ranging elk harvested in Dallam county on [6 Dec 2016].

Due to CWD being found in white-tailed deer, mule deer, and elk, TAHC established movement and surveillance requirements for exotics [cervid species not native to Texas] in CWD Zones and statewide on [30 May 2017]. Statewide surveillance requires all eligible mortalities of exotic CWD susceptible species be tested until such time that 3 animals are tested. Please note that for CWD Surveillance and Containment Zones, all exotic CWD susceptible species hunter harvested must be tested.

To learn more about the TAHC exotic CWD susceptible species statewide surveillance and movement requirements, visit http://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/2017/2017-05-30_CommissionMeeting.pdf. For more information about CWD regulations within CWD Zones, visit https://tpwd.texas.gov/publications/pwdpubs/media/pwd_bk_w7000_1942.pdf.

CWD was 1st recognized in 1967 in captive mule deer in Colorado. The 1st case of CWD in Texas was discovered in 2012 in free-ranging mule deer in an isolated area of far West Texas. The disease has since been detected in a total of 15 free-ranging mule deer, 1 free-ranging elk located on a high-fenced property, 1 free-ranging white-tailed deer, and in 5 white-tailed deer breeding operations located in Medina/Uvalde and Lavaca counties. For a full list of CWD positives in Texas, visit https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/diseases/cwd/tracking/#texasCWD.

CWD is a progressive, fatal disease of cervids that commonly results in altered behavior as a result of microscopic changes made to the brain of affected animals. An animal may carry the disease for years without outward indication, but in the latter stages, signs may include listlessness, lowering of the head, weight loss, repetitive walking in set patterns, and a lack of responsiveness. CWD is not known to affect humans, however, recent studies suggest there may be a risk to non-human primates that consume CWD infected meat, therefore, the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization recommend not to consume meat from infected animals.

[It is not entirely unexpected to find an elk with CWD in a confined facility, but it is sad it has actually happened.

While this does not represent a spread of the disease, it represents a new species in confinement in Texas. - Mod.TG
