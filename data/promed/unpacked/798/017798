Yesterday I was called to a ranch up on the divide, which is 30 miles
north of Leakey, to see a dead axis buck in the tank. He was not
there the day before but was there the next morning. The owners
dragged him out and away from the tank into the trees. They got to
thinking and then called me, so I went to look and found sure enough
a dead axis buck. They had rain around 2 Jul 2006 so the time frame
is about right. There were no eyes or anus when I got there --
buzzards -- but also he was in the tank possibly all night. I tried
to get some blood from the jugular but no luck there, but I did get
some of the bloody liquid from beneath the skin there. I went ahead
and ran the quick [anthrax] test you [Mod.MHJ] sent me and when it diffused
across the test well, a line appeared immediately and remained there
[signifying positive. - Mod.JW].
I did not open the carcass -- buzzards had opened the rumen already.
The owner will do the charcoal thing to destroy it and I may have an
opportunity to see another one if one should die, as I prepared them
to protect another one and get there sooner if possible.
As I was leaving, I had to drive by the adjoining ranch fence some
1/2 mile from where this deer died and -- lo and behold -- there in
their water lot was the carcass of a dead cow -- dead about a week
ago. Nothing on that, just absentee owners who lost a cow and they
don't care or don't know or both.

[I spoke with Wylie and he is overnighting the test fluid and his
bloodied syringe to TVMDL College Station for confirmation. While the
US Navy test kits are reliable, one should get confirmation just in
case. As both animals -- the axis buck and the neighbour's cow
-- were found dead in the respective water tanks one can assume that
they died fevered. If our fly hypothesis is correct, the short shower
(2 Jul) will not have resulted in a meaningful tabanid fly hatch and
so any deaths will be limited in number and space. As the carcasses
were in water tanks that might affect the nearby browse contamination
by blowflies -- if anything these tanks have small trees by them more
than scrub -- but time will show if any browsing white-tailed deer
are affected. - Mod.MHJ]
