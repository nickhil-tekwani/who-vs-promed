2003/076 Potato spindle tuber pospiviroid is no longer found in Australia
Potato spindle tuber pospiviroid (PSTVd - EPPO A2 quarantine pest) had been
detected previously in potato breeding programmes in Victoria and New South
Wales in 1982 and eradicated. Subsequently, it was detected and eradicated
in breeding tomatoes in Northern Territory and at a third property in
Western Australia. In June 2001 it was found in glasshouse tomatoes in New
South Wales (2 plants on one farm).
Surveys of glasshouse tomatoes were recently finalized in New South Wales.
500 000 tomato plants grown on 15 properties were surveyed over the last 12
months; no symptoms were observed. On the farm where the 2 infected plants
had been found, monthly inspections failed to detect the disease.
It is considered that the outbreak in Western Australia has been eradicated
and that PSTVd is no longer present in Australia.
The situation of PSTVd in Australia can be described as follows: Absent,
reported in the past but no longer found.

[PSTVd is notoriously difficult to eradicate from affected seed stock. It
is a major pathogen of solanaceous crops, causing spindle tuber in potato
and bunchy top in tomato. Crop losses can be extensive (up to 65 percent in
potato and as much as 50 percent in tomato). It is widely distributed in
parts of North and South America, Asia, and Oceania. More recently PSTVd
has been reported in France (potato) and the Netherlands (tomato).
Unfortunately, the disease is established in eastern Europe, including
Poland, and others may follow. Disease management involves use of
viroid-free seed, strict adherence to phytosanitation, and use of bleach to
disinfest equipment, tools, and production benches.
