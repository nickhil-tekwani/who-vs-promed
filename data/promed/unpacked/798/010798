At least 125 people in Milwaukee, Wisconsin have tested positive for HIV, syphilis, or both in one of the largest sexually transmitted infection [STI] 'clusters' ever reported in the US. The number of cases is expected to grow as more people come forward and clinicians identify more potential cases through asking those infected for their sexual history.

Among the cluster are as many as a dozen high school students, according to Milwaukee's Journal Sentinel. Officials have said this is an ongoing, city-wide health issue especially among people between the ages of 15 and 24 that will have serious consequences if it doesn't get under control soon.

In 2017, 3 babies were born with syphilis and health officials became increasingly concerned with the growing prevalence of STIs in mid-December [2017] after several people reported having HIV or syphilis symptoms.

On [Wed 7 Mar 2018] it was reported that 125 people, the majority of whom are men, have tested positive for one or both of the diseases, with 45 percent testing positive for HIV [56 of the 125 people]. Officials say the actual number of people in the cluster is likely higher than the 125 reported because many people don't come forward out of fear of being stigmatized.

The group has been identified as a 'cluster' because they could all be connected and were in contact with each other during a 12-month period, local public health consultant Melissa Ugland told the Journal Sentinel. Fewer than 10 percent, or about 12 people, are Milwaukee Public School [MPS] students.

'We are working with the health department to provide preventative information to our students as they fall within this age group and we have the unique ability to literally reach hundreds of students at one time with information that can protect their health,' MPS spokeswoman Denise Callaway told Daily Mail Online.

After a person tests positive for an infection, they are referred for care and interviewed about their sexual history. Officials then reach out to others who may have been infected so they can be tested and treated. Reports say that while some people in the cluster have been cooperative, others have been hesitant to reveal names of previous sexual partners.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were more than 80 000 reported diagnoses of syphilis in 2016. The disease is most prevalent in men who have sex with men, but the number of cases affecting heterosexual men and women has increased in recent years.

In 2015 there were an estimated 39 513 new diagnoses of HIV in the US, a 10-percent decline from 2010. HIV is spread through bodily fluids such as blood and semen. Most HIV infections can be detected 4 weeks after contact and are diagnosed using a blood test. HIV rates vary from state to state, and 45 percent people with HIV are living in the South. Georgia has the highest rate with 31.8 people per 100 000 living with HIV. By comparison, Wisconsin has a rate of 4.6 per 100 000 people.

[The United States has experienced a rising incidence of syphilis since 2000. In 2000 and 2001, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis reached historic lows with less than 6000 reported cases and an incidence rate of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people. However, in 2015, 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported with an incidence of 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, the highest rate reported since 1994. Syphilis rates increased in every region of the US, a majority of age groups, and across almost every race/ethnicity.

During 2000-2016, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the US was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). In more recent years (2013-16), P&S syphilis also increased among women, which was associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis. During 2015-2016, the rate of reported P&S syphilis increased 14.7 per cent among men and 35.7 per cent among women (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/Syphilis.htm), and in 2016, the number of congenital syphilis cases was the highest it's been since 1998 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm).

The increasing incidence of syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections can be attributed to a change in sexual behavior away from safer sexual practices of the 1980s and '90s during the midst of the AIDS epidemic. As evolving medical therapy has changed HIV infection into a more manageable chronic disease, people have become complacent and stopped using condoms.

Other factors include use of geolocating apps on smartphones that facilitate multiple anonymous hook ups for casual sex such as Grindr, Internet chat rooms, pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive "party drugs", and lack of education about the necessity of safer sexual practices.

56 of the 125 people in the Milwaukee outbreak were HIV positive. This Milwaukee outbreak may represent what the CDC has recently defined as a "rapidly growing cluster" (RGC) infected by similar HIV strains on the basis of molecular sequencing (http://www.croiconference.org/sites/default/files/uploads/40.pdf). The CDC and co-workers reported 60 RGC in 20 states in all regions of the country. RGC had 5-42 persons during a 12-month period and HIV transmission rates ranging from 21-132 transmission events (median of 44) per 100 person-years compared with the national average of four transmission events per 100 person-years. The 903 persons in RGC were disproportionately young men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly young Hispanic/Latino MSM.

We are not told in the news report above the specifics of this outbreak in Milwaukee: for example, are the people involved disproportionately MSM or of a particular race or ethnicity? Have they used cell phone apps, such as Grindr, "party drugs", PrEP, etc.? Knowing this type of information may help pinpoint prevention efforts. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
