Cholera in India
----------------
Detected through its early warning surveillance system, the Government of
Orissa has reported 34 111 cases of diarrhoea including 33 deaths, in 24
districts in Orissa State since 7 Jul 2001, related to the floods that
occurred at that time. Orissa has a population of 37 million people, of
which 8 million were affected by the floods.
Among the cases of severe acute diarrhoea in a cluster of 121 samples
(taken from 5 districts) positive for _Vibrio cholerae_, 46 % were positive
for serogroup O139. This proportion of O139 is high compared to the rates
found in neighbouring Bangladesh, where there were 24 % positive isolates
for O139 in non-coastal areas and 7.2 % in coastal areas in 2000.
WHO is assisting the national health authorities in continuing surveillance.

[This report is interesting for 3 reasons. It shows that O139 cholera is
still sparking away in the Indian subcontinent, & possibly spreading. It
confirms the occurrence of cholera in Bangladesh, which does not notify
cholera to WHO as it should. And it suggests a possible connection of O139
with fresh rather than estuarine or sea water. - Mod.JW
