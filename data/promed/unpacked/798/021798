Sixteen die of mystery illness in West Sepik
LAE: A medical team will be sent to the Yapsie area of Sandaun province
today to investigate the reported deaths of 16 people and attend to
dozens of other villagers hit by an unknown epidemic.
Peter Tavun, the provincial disaster and emergency services coordinator,
said from Vanimo yesterday that the deaths had occurred in the Urapmin,
Siarimin and Niyol villages in the Yapsie area of Telefomin district.
Mr Tavun said his office had received reports of the mystery disease
from various sources but the headmaster of the Yapsie school on Saturday
confirmed the death of 16 people while 32 others were seriously ill.
"Earlier, other reports had reached my office on Dec. 7 and again a week
later," he said.
The Yapsie area is accessible only by air and the medical team flying in
today will have to walk for at least three days into the areas
reportedly hit by the unknown epidemic...
The Urapmin, Siarimin and Niyol villages have a total population of
about 1,000 people, according to available provincial data.

Mystery disease claims 10 more
By ALPHONSE BARIASI
LAE: The Catholic Church diocese of Vanimo yesterday reported another 10
deaths from the as yet unknown epidemic that has hit at least three
villages in the Yapsie area of West Sepik province.
Yesterday's reported deaths were from Siak while 16 other people died in
Urapmin, Siapmin and Niyol villages earlier.
Reports of the mystery illness began arriving from the Catholic station
at Yapsie and the community school headmaster there since Dec. 7.
On Monday reports from the provincial disaster office put the number of
deaths at 16 and a further 32 falling unconscious.

Yesterday's figure would mean there had been altogether 26 deaths and
many others falling unconscious since the epidemic hit the remote
villages of the Telefomin district...
West Sepik administrator Jerry Poivi, who arrived in Vanimo from Port
Moresby yesterday, said a medical team will be flown to Yapsie at 10
o'clock this morning to assess the situation. The team will be in
Yapsie conducting a field assessment. If there is any worsening of the
epidemic the team will be stationed there for another two to three
weeks, he said. "After tomorrow we should know what the disease is and
start dispatching medication and other supplies to the area."
