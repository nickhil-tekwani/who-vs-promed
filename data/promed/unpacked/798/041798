A patient in Denmark has become infected with an untreatable form of salmonella, scientists announced today. They also discovered untreatable bacteria in 5 samples of chicken imported from China via Germany. Experts fear it is the start of a global epidemic of untreatable infections. The Danish scientist who made the alarming discovery told the Daily Mail he would be 'very surprised' if the bug was not already in Britain.

The grim announcement comes just 3 weeks after Chinese academics discovered that superbugs had breached the last line of antibiotic defences for the 1st time. The Chinese team had warned that the hyper-resistant bugs were likely to spread fast -- but last night experts said the speed at which they had travelled to Europe was extremely serious.

Colistin -- a drug classed as 'critical' to human medicine -- was until recently the only antibiotic to work after all others had failed. But experts [in November 2015] identified the 1st germs to become resistant to the drugs, and warned of the 'inevitable' spread of uncontrollable superbugs which attack the blood and lungs.

They discovered mobile gene called MCR-1, which made bacteria such as _E. coli_ [_Escherichia coli_], salmonella and germs [that] cause pneumonia untreatable. Critically, they found that the gene could easily be transferred to other types of bacteria, meaning it could spread quickly between animals and humans.

Experts at the Technical University of Denmark started searching for signs of the MCR-1 gene in their own country as soon as they read the Chinese report. And, to their horror, they found 6 samples -- 5 in imported chicken and 1 in the blood of a sick patient.

Professor Frank Moller Aarestrup, a microbiologist at the Technical University of Denmark, said today: 'This is a very alarming discovery. It is something I had feared, but hoped I would not see.' He said the bugs had probably come from China via imported meat, or brought in by people travelling from the Far East. Experts fear this is the start of a global epidemic of untreatable infections. But he added: 'I would be very much surprised if it was not in the UK already. It is a much bigger country than Denmark, with more travel and more food imports.'

The professor said the anonymous patient had suffered from a blood infection earlier in 2015, and in subsequent checks had tested positive for _Salmonella_ bacteria with the MCR-1 gene. The patient's current health could not be disclosed, the scientist said.

Dr Lance Price, of George Washington University in the US, who worked with the Danish team, said: 'History shows that these mobile resistance genes can spread around the world quickly, silently riding in people, animals, and food. The news that MCR-1 has been discovered in Denmark suggests that this scenario is playing out in real time.'

Leading British expert Professor Mark Enright, a microbiologist at Manchester Metropolitan University, said last night that patients infected with such superbugs would have very few treatment options. 'Colistin is a top-shelf antibiotic -- it is the antibiotic of last defence when nothing else works,' he said. 'This gene is going into bugs which are resistant to everything else, which is very worrying. If a patient [that is, the pathogen infecting the patient] is resistant there is not a lot you could do.' He said the only option would be to treat them with 2 or 3 extremely powerful antibiotics at the same time -- in the hope that something works -- but said there was no guarantee it would be effective.

Professor Enright said people are probably getting the bug by handling infected meat. But he warned that once it gets into hospitals it would be very hard to control, passing from patient to patient with ease. 'Now that it is [in] Europe, we can't contain it,' he said.

A major problem is that colistin is widely used in farming. The more that antibiotics are used -- whether in humans or animals -- the easier it is for bacteria to evolve to become resistant against them. Yet colistin was the 5th most widely used antibiotic in European agriculture in 2010. Dame Sally Davies, the British Government's chief medical officer, has called for a vast reduction in the use of antibiotics in farming, in order that drugs not be rendered useless in humans. In 2014 she even proposed, controversially, that sick animals be slaughtered rather than treated with the drugs. Dame Sally has repeated[ly] warned of the disastrous consequences of antibiotic resistance, putting it on a par with terrorism and climate change.

The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has launched an immediate risk assessment of colistin use. Experts last night said they were alarmed at the findings, and called for urgent restrictions of the use of colistin drugs among animals. Dr Price said: 'We must act swiftly to contain the spread of colistin-resistant bacteria, or we will face increasing numbers of untreatable infections. Leaders from every nation should immediately implement a ban on the use of colistin in animal agriculture.'

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association said: 'This represents a significant milestone in the growth of antibiotic resistance in Europe and is a worrying step towards a future where the simplest of infections routinely become life-threatening. Professionals from across the medical community need to work together to drastically reduce prescription rates of these life-saving drugs to ensure that they continue to work for those who need them most and that patient safety is no longer compromised by careless overuse of antibiotics.'

Professor Neil Woodford, head of Public Health England's antimicrobial resistance unit, said: 'Public Health England is aware of the reports of a new colistin resistance gene from China and Denmark. However, people should be reassured our current assessment is that the public health risk is very low.'

[The polymyxins (colistin and polymyxin B) are cationic antibiotics that exert bactericidal action as a result of an electrostatic binding to the anionic lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin), the main constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacilli. This causes a disruption of the bacterial cell structure, leakage of the cell contents, and thereby cell lysis. In addition, this binding can neutralize the biological properties of endotoxins. Time kinetic-kill in vitro studies have shown a concentration-dependent bactericidal action.

The bactericidal spectrum of the polymyxins includes many Gram-negative bacilli (e.g. _Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella_ spp and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_), but polymyxins are not active against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative cocci, anaerobes, _Mycoplasma_, or inherently resistant species of Gram-negative bacilli, including _Serratia_, _Providencia_, _Burkholderia_, _Morganella morganii_, and _Proteus_ (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/9/1333.full).

Acquired resistance to polymyxins in normally susceptible bacteria can develop through chromosomal mutations and has been associated with a change in the surface charge that results in decreased binding sites for the cationic polymyxins, as observed in _Salmonella_ spp., _Escherichia coli_ and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ (http://cmr.asm.org/content/21/3/449.full). Adaptive resistance that is dependent on the continuous presence of the antibiotic has also been described. Colistin resistance confers resistance to polymyxins and a range of other cationic peptides.

Because of the absence of horizontal gene transfer of these chromosomal mutations, the risk of spread of resistance to polymyxins was thought to be low (http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Report/2013/07/WC500146813.pdf). But the situation has recently radically changed. Insertional inactivation of the mgrB gene by a mobile chromosomal genetic element caused resistance to colistin in the _K. pneumoniae_ isolated from a UAE patient (ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance - UAE: panresist. K. pneum, mobile chrom. colistin-resist. 20151126.3820586). ProMED-mail also recently posted a report of colistin resistance encoded on a mobile genetic element MCR-1 located on a plasmid (ProMED-mail Antibiotic resistance - China: colistin, plasmid-encoded, humans, animals 20151122.3810204). MCR-1 is a member of the phosphoethanolamine transferase enzyme family, with expression in _E. coli_ resulting in the addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid A. MCR-1 carriage was observed in _E. coli_ isolates collected from 78 (15 percent) of 523 samples of raw meat and 166 (21 percent) of 804 animals during 2011-14, and 16 (1 percent) of 1322 samples from inpatients with infection in China (http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099 percent2815 percent2900424-7/abstract).

The above news report says that Danish investigators, after reading the Chinese report in Lancet Infectious Diseases, found the MCR-1 gene in 5 samples from imported chicken, "probably" imported from China, and in 1 "salmonella" isolate from the blood of a sick patient in Denmark. Details are lacking, for example, concerning how the study was done, the number and source of meat samples and clinical specimens screened for MCR-1, the source of the 5 MCR-1-positive chickens, and the epidemiological history of the MCR-1-positive patient (e.g., travel history, contacts, dietary history, etc). ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information in this regard from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
