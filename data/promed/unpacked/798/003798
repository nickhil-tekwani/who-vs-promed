Pollution changes sex of fish
-----------------------------
A third of male fish in British rivers are in the process of changing
sex due to pollution in human sewage, research by the Environment
Agency suggests.
A survey of 1500 fish at 50 river sites found more than a third of
males displayed female characteristics. Hormones in the sewage,
including those produced by the female contraceptive pill, are
thought to be the main cause.
The agency says the problem could damage fish populations by reducing
their ability to reproduce. It said its study highlighted the need
for water companies to develop new treatments.
There has been concern for some time that chemicals, known as
endocrine disruptors, are causing fish to change sex. The latest
study is the 1st to show the scale of the problem in Britain.
