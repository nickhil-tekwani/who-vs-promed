Rheumatic fever rates are on the up despite AUD 65 million [USD 50 million] being spent on prevention, new figures reveal. A report by crown research unit ESR (Environmental Science and Research) shows a "significant increase" in cases of the disease in the year to September 2014, with 235 notified acute cases, up 75 on the previous 12 months.

The fever is an inflammation of the heart, which can leave scarring on valves and is linked to poverty, poor and overcrowded housing, and a lack of access to healthcare. Maori and Pasifika children aged 5-14 years are most at risk.

The Government has pumped resources into combating the illness with free drop-in clinics, healthy homes initiatives and public information campaigns, and wants to reduce incidences by 2/3rds by June 2017.

Labour's health spokeswoman Annette King said the Government was failing with rates of the disease rising in the last 3 years. One child a week with a heart badly damaged by [rheumatic] fever underwent surgery at Starship children's hospital in Auckland, she said.

Estimates put 140 adult deaths a year down to the illness. "As former health minister Tony Ryall himself said: 'We are the only developed country in the world with levels of rheumatic fever you would see in the 3rd world'," King said. "Acute rheumatic fever is largely a disease of poverty, overcrowding, and healthcare inequality," she said. "Preventing it requires more than throat-swabbing and publicity campaigns; it requires a health system that provides services that are accessible for all and a coordinated effort to address social factors that impact on health, such as housing."

Health Minister Jonathan Coleman referred questions to his ministry. Dr Chrissie Pickin, who leads the health ministry's rheumatic fever programme, said notified cases of acute rheumatic were not the best way to measure progress on stamping out the disease. "We know that there can be considerable volatility in cases reported year on year. A case reported in 2014 could have actually been diagnosed in prior years. Almost a quarter (23 percent) of the cases reported in 2014 occurred in earlier years."

Instead, officials focused on cases where patients were sent to hospital. "The most recent hospitalisation data available is from July 2013 to June 2014 and shows a slight decrease. Updated data is currently being finalised and is expected to show a further decrease in hospitalisation rates," she said.

Green party health spokesman Kevin Hague echoed King's comments, saying it was "ridiculous" to set a target to reduce rates while refusing to put one in place to tackle child poverty. "Rheumatic fever is a disease of poverty," he said. "The most deprived kids are almost 30 times as likely to get the disease." However, he said throat-swabbing clinics were "important" in improving access to health care.

There were 235 cases in the year to September 2014, up from 160 in the previous year; 3 were in children aged between 1-4 years old; 19 were in children aged between 5-9, 22 in ages between 10-14, and 34 cases in those aged 15 and over. 68 cases were acute; 10 were recurrent.

[Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a nonsuppurative complication that may follow 2-3 weeks after untreated group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis. The disease presents with various manifestations that may include arthritis, carditis, chorea (rapid involuntary movements), subcutaneous nodules, and skin rash (erythema marginatum). ARF can occur at any age, although most cases occur in children 5 to 15 years of age. The pathogenesis of ARF is thought to involve immunologic "mimicry," whereby an immune response against the GAS cross-reacts with host molecules (e.g., in the heart or joint tissue). With time, the inflammatory response may heal with varying degrees of scarring.

ARF most commonly occurs in developing countries and among the poor and indigenous groups. In New Zealand, ARF is now almost exclusively a disease affecting Maori and Pacific peoples. The majority of cases occur in low socioeconomic communities in the northern and central North Island and in pockets around the Wellington region, the capital city and 2nd most populous urban area of New Zealand, located at the southwestern tip of the North Island (http://www.bpac.org.nz/BPJ/2011/august/rheumatic.aspx). Maori children are about 20 times more likely to be hospitalized for rheumatic fever and Pacific children about 40 times more likely than non-Maori/non-Pacific children, which has been attributed to GAS pharyngitis that goes untreated among Maori and Pacific people (http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/rheumatic-fever).

Rheumatic fever can be prevented by prompt diagnosis of a GAS throat infection and treatment with antibiotics. The New Zealand Ministry of Health's Rheumatic Fever Prevention Programme (RFPP) was established in 2011 to improve access to timely treatment for GAS throat infections among its at-risk communities; to increase awareness of rheumatic fever; and to reduce household crowding and therefore reduce household transmission of GAS throat bacteria (http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/rheumatic-fever).

Antibiotic treatment is indicated for patients with acute pharyngitis who have a positive throat culture or rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for GAS. However, because of the low sensitivity of many RADTs, a negative test does not exclude GAS infection in children, and a throat culture usually should be performed (http://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0201/p346.html). GAS resistance to penicillin has never been documented, and penicillin prevents primary attacks of rheumatic fever even when started 9 days after onset of illness. Patients are no longer considered contagious after 24 hours of antibiotic therapy. Acute infections with group B and C beta-hemolytic streptococci can appear similar to GAS pharyngitis, but ARF has not been documented as a complication of these infections.

For patients allergic to penicillin, a narrow-spectrum cephalosporin can be used in persons without immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin; otherwise azithromycin, clarithromycin, or clindamycin can be used (http://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0201/p346.html#afp20100201p346-t2). The following agents are not acceptable for prevention of ARF: sulfonamides, trimethoprim, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. - Mod.ML
