New report of _Alternaria alternata_ causing leaf blight of tomato in Pakistan
K.P. Akhtar <kpervaiz_mbd@hotmail.com>, M.Y. Saleem, M. Asghar and M.A.
Haq, Nuclear Institute for Agriculture and Biology, Jhang Road, P.O. Box
128, Faisalabad, Pakistan. Accepted for publication: 30 Jul 2004.
During February 2004 a leaf blight disease of tomato (_Lycopersicon
esculentum_) was observed in a tomato field at the Nuclear Institute for
Agriculture and Biology, Faisalabad, Pakistan.
Symptoms on affected plants started with yellowing and browning of the
lower leaves, progressing upwards under high humidity conditions. Symptoms
often developed from the leaf tips and along the margins of the leaf petiole.
Under severe infection, lesions enlarged and coalesced causing blighting of
the leaves. Concentric circles with dark layers of spores were observed
under moist conditions on blighted leaf portions. Infection under favorable
conditions was found to cause severe defoliation, with considerable yield
losses when it occurred prior to flowering.
Isolations were made on PDA from infected leaves collected from the field.
The fungus _Alternaria alternata_ [Aa] was consistently isolated and
identified based on morphological characters (Ellis, 1971; Sultana, 1981;
Shakir et al., 1997). The fungus grew well on PDA and formed greyish-black
colonies of about 90 mm in diameter in 7 days, when incubated at 25ï¿½2 deg C.
Conidia formed in long chains and were obclavate and muriform, often with a
short conical or cylindrical, pale beak, less than one third of the length
of the conidium. Conidia had 3-7 transverse septa and usually several
longitudinal or oblique septa.
Pathogenicity tests were carried out in a screen house on 8-week-old tomato
plants of the cultivar 'Pakit'. Test plants were sprayed with a conidial
suspension (50 000 conidia per ml) of Aa isolated from diseased tomato
leaves. Control plants were sprayed with sterilised distilled water. All
test plants were covered with polyethylene bags for 2 days. Leaf blight
symptoms similar to the ones observed in the field started to develop after
4 days and Aa was consistently reisolated from these plants. Control plants
did not develop leaf blight symptoms.
Aa has previously been reported in Pakistan as a saprophytic pathogen of
tomato causing post harvest losses in high frequency (Akhtar et al., 1994).
Among 35 Aa isolates collected from rotted fruits from fields and markets
only 1 isolate from the field was able to produce leaf blight symptoms.
This shows that Aa causing leaf blight in the present study is a distinct
pathotype.
This is believed to be the first report of Aa causing leaf blight in tomato
plants in Pakistan.

[Aa is the most frequently reported _Alternaria_ species causing plant
disease. It is primarily a weak pathogen, attacking already stressed
plants, but may also be pathogenic on healthy plants. It is interesting to
note that all of the previous posts related to Aa concern citrus. Wounding
is required, especially during harvest, leading to post-harvest and storage
infections of tubers and fruits, or by insects and nematodes. Insects
facilitate infection and act to stress the entire host-plant system,
thereby reducing overall plant resistance. Furthermore, insects may act as
vectors by dispersing inoculum throughout the crop. Infection pathways
include nutrient, water, or microclimate-originated stresses.
Recommendations for disease management include a 3-year crop rotation for
tomato or potato, planting of crops that are not hosts of Aa, removal and
burning of infected debris and eradication of weed hosts to further reduce
inoculum. Combining resistant cultivars and other control measures greatly
decreases disease progress.
