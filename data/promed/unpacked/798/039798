A bull owned by a farmer in southwestern Manitoba was euthanized late last
month, adding to the tally of livestock claimed by rabies during a peak in
the disease's cycle.
The farm where the bull was penned was also placed under a 2-month
quarantine as a precaution in case other livestock were infected. Tom
Walshe, a veterinarian based at Killarney, Man., said the bull had bellowed
incessantly for about 3 days before it was destroyed. Walshe said the
animal was oblivious to his presence when he went to check on it. "Every
time you see a neurological problem in an animal, you have to consider
rabies."
George Luterbach of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, said Manitoba is
at the high end of its rabies cycle. There were 223 confirmed cases of the
disease last year in Manitoba compared to 24 in 1996. Victims last year
included wildlife, cattle, horses, dogs, cats and a bison. Nineteen cattle
and 3 horses were diagnosed with the disease. Luterbach said signs of
rabies in livestock are behavioral changes or symptoms suggesting a
neurological problem. In advanced cases of rabies, varying degrees of
throat paralysis can occur, making it difficult for the animal to swallow,
causing the drooling effect often associated with rabies. Unusual bellowing
can be another symptom.
Walshe said he has encountered a dozen cases of rabies in cattle during his
more than 20 years in practice. Skunks are a common carrier of the disease
in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Foxes and raccoons are other carriers.
"If a rabid animal bites domestic livestock, there's a good chance the
(bitten) animal is going to contract rabies." [Unless the animal is
vaccinated against rabies. - Mod. TG] Once the animal contracts rabies, the
odds are it will die or will have to be destroyed. Owners who suspect
rabies in livestock should contact a veterinarian to have the animal
checked. Luterbach encouraged pet owners to keep their dogs and cats
vaccinated against the disease.
A wild animal acting strangely should be reported to the province's natural
resources department and a federal veterinarian. "We like to encourage
people to observe wildlife rather than handle them."
