Health officials have linked two cases of [salmonellosis in Wyoming to
unpasteurized orange juice that was recalled in six states. A total of 74
cases in seven states have now been linked to contaminated juice, officials
said. "Using DNA fingerprinting techniques, the DNA pattern of the
_Salmonella_ isolates of the two Wyoming cases matched the patterns seen in
other states," said Dr. Richard Harris, manager of the state Health
Department's public health laboratory.
Orange juice and other drinks were recalled from six states 20 April 2000
because of possible _Salmonella_ contamination. The drinks included Naked
brand orange and grapefruit juice, lemonade, strawberry lemonade,
old-fashioned lemonade and "Tangerine Scream." Also recalled were Ferraro's
orange juice, Von's orange and grapefruit juices and Trader Joe's blood
orange juice. The recalled products were sold in Arizona, California,
Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state. They had "best if used by"
dates on or before May 4.
According to Wyoming health officials, California had 36 cases linked to
orange juice, while Colorado had 28. Arizona and Nevada reported three
cases each, and Washington and Idaho had one each. "This outbreak
demonstrates the importance of epidemiology and public health laboratories
in protecting the public's health," said Dr. Garry McKee, director of the
Wyoming Department of Health.
