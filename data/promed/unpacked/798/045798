Ethiopia battles wheat rust outbreak
------------------------------------
An outbreak of wheat rust in critical wheat-growing regions is threatening recent crop production gains, following a long period of drought. In late August [2016], surveys first spotted rust in Oromia and southern regions, [it] has since spread to Amhara and Tigray. As of October [2016], the disease has been detected in nearly 2200 communities and on close to 300 000 hectares of land across the country.

Although yellow rust is by far the most widespread identified, stem and leaf rust have also been spotted. Wheat is the 3rd most important crop for food security in Ethiopia and covers an estimated 17 per cent of Ethiopia's total agricultural land.

An estimated 92 per cent of the farms affected have been sprayed with fungicides by regional authorities. However, some issues persist in the management of the disease. Fungicide spray equipment and protective gear is in limited supply in parts of the country. In addition, many farms required spraying more than once, compounding costs for resource-poor farmers.

[There are 3 known rusts that can affect wheat:

Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat. While stem rust poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale.

Wheat stem rust (also called black rust) is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 80 per cent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the most dangerous at present is the Ug99 group of strains (see ProMED-mail post 19990519.0812), which have overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. Since then Ug99 strains have spread (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). In Ethiopia, strains of the Ug99 as well as other groups (for example, ProMED-mail post 20140327.2360315) are known to be present, but it is not clear which of the pathogens are involved in the current outbreak reported above.

Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_. Related pathogens affect barley and rye. The disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can cause yield losses of over 40 per cent in individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems, and later on heads. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode" during favourable weather.

Rust spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season and are also spread by mechanical means and with infected plant material (straw, grain). The fungi need living tissue to survive between seasons and cannot survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer cereal plants and some wild grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars and control of volunteer crop plants. Early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

New strains of cereal rusts with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or the ability to break down genetic resistance of specific host varieties. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution. Development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple rusts (ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190) is particularly difficult since the pathogens can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains.
