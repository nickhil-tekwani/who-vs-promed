After 14 students, aged between 10 and 12, came down with mumps, 6 classrooms at Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Sentosa in Rawang [Gombak district, Selangor] were ordered to be closed for 2 weeks. All 14 pupils received outpatient treatment at an area hospital and are reported to be in a stable condition, said Selangor health director Datuk Dr Khalid Ibrahim. The shuttered classes are now undergoing cleansing and disinfection measures to control the infection, he added.

Dr Khalid said mumps is caused by the _Paramyxovirus_, the symptoms of which are fever, headache, muscle pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, swelling and pain in the parotid (salivary) glands. He said it is an airborne virus which spreads through droplets of contaminated saliva or contact with contaminated objects. "Those infected will usually take 2-3 weeks to recover," Dr Khalid said, adding that students with mumps symptoms should avoid going to school to prevent infecting others.

[Malaysia started its immunisation programme for mumps in 2002 with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, which reduces the risk of infection or its severity. According to health director-general, Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, despite those infected with mumps being isolated and health education classes conducted, student mingling was allowing the virus to spread.

Complications of infection can include meningitis and inflammation of the testicles, which can affect fertility in men in later life. Some patients can also experience less common complications such as inflammation of the pancreas, deafness, arthritis, and inflammation of the heart. - Mod.LK

The Health Service Executive [HSE] has reiterated a warning to parents in the west, following an increase in the number of cases of mumps in the region in recent weeks. Parents of students at a school in Claregalway [County Galway] have been notified that a number of children have developed mumps-like symptoms. It follows an increase in the number of cases of the condition in the area, mainly among those aged between 15 and 29.

The HSE says immunisation though the MMR vaccine provides the best protection for people, and it is urging those who have not had 2 doses of the vaccine to seek an additional dose. People who are uncertain if they have had 2 doses are also being advised to get vaccinated as soon as possible, because it can take up to 28 days for the antibodies to take effect.

Children who develop symptoms should be kept out of school for at least 5 days after the onset of neck swelling.
