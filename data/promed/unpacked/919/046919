Seventy acres of paddy crops in Balangoda [Ratnapura district] have been infected with an unidentified disease. The farmers state that due to the disease, all the paddy heads turn white, rendering it inconsumable. They noted that the disease had destroyed their crops and they are left helpless. They requested the officials to look into the matter and provide a solution.

The Balangoda Agrarian Center has already informed the Bathalagoda Rice Research and Development Institute (RRDI) regarding the issue, and 3 officers had arrived to inspect the fields. They have concluded that the plants were damaged due to weather conditions.

[It is not clear whether the "white heads" above are considered to be due to bleaching by loss of chlorophyll, or whether drying off of upper parts of the shoots make the fields appear white.

While environmental factors may lead to particularly the latter type of these symptoms, as seems to have been suggested above, both types of symptoms may also be due to some known rice diseases (for example, foot rots) or pests.

A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes, have been reported to affect rice crops in the region. Reliable, preferably molecular, diagnosis is needed to investigate the potential involvement of any pathogen(s) before suitable management strategies for the reported problems can be developed.
