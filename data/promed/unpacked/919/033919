- On 2 Apr 2013, the Shanghai municipal government held a press conference to refute any link between the pigs and the H7N9 virus, noting that 34 porcine carcasses had been tested for H7N9 and that all results had come back negative.

- On 2 Apr 2013, someone claiming to be a hospital worker at the Nanjing Gulou Hospital, a major city in Jiangsu Province, posted on Weibo what he said was a piece of paper with a 30 Mar 2013 diagnosis of H7N9 in a patient. The typed sheet said the patient was a 45-year-old woman who worked as a chicken butcher.

Unsurprisingly, the Weibo post was quickly deleted by censors. But the image of the diagnosis had already been picked up and widely disseminated. A day later, on 3 Apr 2013, Xinhua, China's state-run newswire, ran a story announcing 4 new cases of H7N9 in Jiangsu province. The patients, Xinhua reported, included a female 45-year-old chicken butcher. One assumes the Weibo post helped hasten Xinhua's article.

- On the afternoon of 3 Apr 2013, another purported doctor piped up on Weibo, this time supposedly from Shanghai's venerable Tongji Hospital: "Holy god, just now one patient in our hospital died of the new bird flu." The comment was soon deleted.

[2] WHO update

On 3 Apr 2013, the China Health and Family Planning Commission notified WHO of an additional 4 cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9). The 4 patients are from Jiangsu province in eastern China. There is no link between the cases.

The patients include: A 45-year-old woman with illness onset on 19 Mar 2013; a 48-year-old woman with illness onset on 19 Mar 2013; an 83-year-old man with illness onset on 20 Mar 2013; and a 32-year-old woman with illness onset on 21 Mar 2013. All of these patients are in a critical condition. To date, the total number of confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China is 7;
3 confirmed cases were reported earlier from Shanghai and Anhui provinces, including 2 deaths.

More than 160 close contacts of these 4 cases in Jiangsu province are being closely monitored. Thus far, none of them have developed any symptoms of illness. Retrospective investigation is ongoing into 2 contacts of one of the cases reported earlier from Shanghai. Both of these contacts developed symptoms of illness; one died, and the other recovered. No laboratory confirmation is available for these 2 contacts.

The Chinese government is actively investigating this event and has heightened disease surveillance for early detection, diagnosis and treatment. Infection prevention and control has been strengthened in health-care settings. Communication efforts between human and animal health and industry sectors have increased. The government has advised the population to maintain good personal hygiene, including frequent hand-washing and avoiding direct contact with sick or dead animals.

WHO is in contact with national authorities and is following the event closely. The WHO-coordinated international response is also focusing on work with WHO Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and other partners to ensure that materials are developed for diagnosis and treatment and vaccine development. No vaccine is currently available for this subtype of the influenza virus. Preliminary test results provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre in China suggest that the virus is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir).

At this time, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

[3] 10th case
Date: Thu 4 Apr 2013

Another H7N9 bird flu case has been confirmed in east China's Zhejiang Province, the provincial health department said Thursday [4 Apr 2013], bringing the country's total number of cases to 10. The patient is a 64-year-old man from Huzhou City. He became ill on 29 Mar 2013 and was admitted to a hospital in Huzhou on 31 Mar 2013. On Thursday [4 Apr 2013], medical experts confirmed that he was infected with the H7N9 bird flu strain after the provincial center for disease control and prevention said late Wednesday [3 Apr 2013] that he tested positive for the virus.

An investigation has found that none of 55 people who had close contact with the man have exhibited any abnormal clinical symptoms, the department said. The Zhejiang provincial government has demanded that medical staff take all measures to treat H7N9 patients. So far, China has confirmed 10 H7N9 cases: 4 in Jiangsu Province, 2 in Shanghai Municipality, one in Anhui Province, and 3 in Zhejiang. The 2 patients in Shanghai and one in Zhejiang have died.

Health authorities and hospitals in many Chinese provinces have been on high alert for H7N9 cases. In Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi Province, which neighbors Zhejiang, 5 hospitals have been selected and ordered to be ready to treat H7N9 patients, though no cases have been reported there. South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has ordered an inventory on medical supplies and respirator deployment for potential H7N9 cases. The regional health department also demanded that one hospital be designated to receive H7N9 patients and that teams of experts be set up at the city and county levels, in addition to 3 regional hospitals that have already been arranged.

China's health authorities have promised transparency and cooperation to the World Health Organization (WHO) in regards to human infections of the new strain of bird flu. On Wednesday [3 Apr 2013] afternoon, the National Health and Family Planning Commission briefed officials from the WHO China office on the latest developments in H7N9 avian influenza infections and the country's countermeasures.

The commission distributed prevention and control plans and technique directives to health institutions nationwide. The directives require areas affected by the new strain of bird flu to prepare daily updates on the local epidemic situation. "So far, the sources of infection have not been clear, but based on past experiences and recent epidemiological studies, the sources could be poultry or the secretion and excrement from poultry," according to the plan.

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday [3 Apr 2013] that no human-to-human transmission of H7N9 has been discovered and no epidemiological connection between these cases has been found.
