[With the addition of today's (3 Dec 2014) 2 newly confirmed case including 1 fatality, yesterday's (2 Dec 2014) newly confirmed case and the newly reported death on 1 Dec 2014, the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia is now 817, including 351 deaths (case fatality rate 43.0). The newly reported cases today (3 Dec 2014) are from Riyadh and Bruidah, the latter (Bruidah) the capital of the Al-Qassim Region in north-central Saudi Arabia (a map showing the location of newly reported cases, deaths and recovered cases can be found at the source URL for the date of each report).

This is the 1st report of a case from Bruidah, and according to the information available, no known high risk exposures have been identified. As this case was reported as a fatality with no identifiable risk exposures, one can't help but wonder whether there may have been low level transmission ongoing in the area involving mild clinical expression that has been "missed" by the health sector, a not uncommon occurrence when a "new disease" is introduced into an area; at 1st, the more severe cases are recognized, then with time and increased awareness of the clinicians, milder illnesses are identified. Hence, it is possible there was contact with MERS-CoV infected individuals in either the healthcare environment or in the community that went unrecognized.

The newly reported case on 2 Dec 2014 is from Najran, a city in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia near the border with Yemen (again, a map showing the location of Najran can be found at the source URL for 2 Dec 2014). The most recent case reported from Najran prior to today's [3 Dec 2014] case was a 50-year-old expat male with no identifiable risk factors reported as a confirmed case on 11 Oct 2014, and reported as recovered on 21 Oct 2014. Today's newly confirmed case gave a history of animal exposure in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

In addition to the newly confirmed case, there were 3 recoveries reported on 2 Dec 2014. The 1st, a 44 year old Saudi male from Riyadh was most likely reported as a confirmed case on 13 Oct 2014, at which time he was admitted to the ICU and had no history of exposure to animals. The 2nd recovered case reported on 2 Dec 2014 is a 40 year old Saudi female healthcare worker from Riyadh/Sakaka who was most likely reported as a confirmed case on 30 Oct 2014 at which time she was reported to have been in AlJawf at which time she was admitted to the ICU and gave a positive history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment. The 3rd case, a 45 year old Saudi male from Riyadh was most likely reported as a confirmed case on 7 Nov 2014, at which time he was in stable condition and gave a positive history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the community.

The newly reported fatality on 1 Dec 2014 was most likely the 79 year old Saudi female from Alkharj who was reported as a confirmed case on 26 Nov 2014, at which time she was in critical condition and gave a history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases in the healthcare environment.

Over the past few weeks, the case fatality rate in Saudi Arabia has been subtly increasing from approximately 42.2/42.3 to 42.9/43.0. A report such as yesterday's (2 Dec 2014) involving a young individual with no history of pre-existing co-morbidities currently in critical condition contributes to an uncomfortable sense that something may be evolving here. - Mod.MPP]

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 3 previously reported MERS-CoV cases.

Globally, the WHO has been notified of 927 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 338 related deaths.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[According the most recent global tally of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported to WHO, there have now been a total of 927 laboratory confirmed cases including at least 338 deaths (case fatality rate 36.5 percent).

Of the 18 newly reported cases to WHO from Saudi Arabia, 4 (22.2 percent) have a history of exposure to animals (3 to camels and 1 to pigeons), 8 (44.4 percent) have a history of either definite contact with known MERS-CoV infected individuals in the healthcare environment (1 individual) or visiting a healthcare facility where MERS-CoV infected individuals were being treated (7 individuals), 1 (5.6 percent) had a history of contact with a known MERS-CoV in the community, and 5 (27.8 percent) had no identifiable risk exposures during the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Hence, person-to-person transmission was a significant factor in at least 50 percent of these cases. If one postulates that the 5 individuals with no documentable risk exposures did have unknown encounters with MERS-CoV infected individuals in the community, one would increase the proportion of cases attributable to person-to-person transmission to 77.8 percent. Of note is that 12 of the 18 confirmed cases in the above WHO report were admitted to the hospital between 1 and 15 days after the onset of symptoms, suggesting it is possible that they were out in the community while ill with MERS-CoV.

There's an excellent epi curve of the global MERS-CoV experience available on the ECDC website, current through the end of October 2014 (and hopefully will be updated through the end of November 2014 shortly). In November 2014, there were a total of 25 newly confirmed cases, all reported from Saudi Arabia. What one sees on this curve is that, globally, there have been cases reported every month since April 2013.

Reviewing reports of MERS-CoV infections since September this year (2014), of the 91 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV during this period, there were a total 4 cases reported from outside of Saudi Arabia: 2 from Qatar, and 1 each from Turkey and Austria. The 2 cases from Qatar had a history of visiting camel barns (one owned one, the other frequently visited one), whereas the cases reported from both Turkey and Austria had exposure and onset of illness associated with transmission in Saudi Arabia.

With studies demonstrating present as well as past infections with MERS-CoV among camels in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Iran, UAE, Qatar and other countries in North Africa, one can't help but wonder why the overwhelming majority of cases of MERS-CoV are reported by Saudi Arabia. According to the ECDC epidemiologic update, through the end of October 2014, 804 of 940 cases of MERS-CoV (85.5 percent) were reported by Saudi Arabia, 73 (7.8 percent) were reported by the UAE, 18 (1.9 percent) were reported by Jordan, 9 (1.0 percent) were reported by Qatar, 5 (0.5 percent) by Iran, 3 by Kuwait, 2 by Oman and one each by Egypt, Yemen and Lebanon. Is this a function of "seek and ye shall find," or is it something else as yet unidentified that makes the situation in Saudi Arabia different?

[3] Saudi Arabia - MOH training in infection control
Date: Fri 28 Nov 2014

MOH Applies Developmental Programs in the Infection Control Field - [28 Nov 2014]
----------------------------------------
His Excellency the Assistant Deputy Minister of Health for Preventive Health, Dr. Abdullah Assiri, revealed that the Ministry of Health (MOH), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is currently applying a number of developmental programs in the field of infection control.

The said programs aim at consolidating the preventive measures to protect the patients and workers in the health sector against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Upon his opening of a training workshop of evaluators of infection control in Riyadh region, which was held recently at the MOH's Headquarters, Dr. Assiri said the programs include a number of theoretical and practical activities to qualify a number of workers in the medical sector to work as inspectors, thus guaranteeing the application of standards of infection control at the health facilities. Elite of infection control consultants from the Saudi Central Board of Accreditation for Healthcare Institutions supervise the training of the evaluators.

The MOH's objective is to have a qualified team of inspectors in each directorate, working as per a definite program and having the required authorities to impose the requirements for infection control. The team would have the full support of the director of health affairs and specialized departments in the Ministry.

Dr. Assiri pointed out that the major challenges facing infection control are the lack and scarcity of qualified cadres; therefore, the MOH is working on several steps to fill the gap, including its development of a qualifying diploma in infection control, from which around 40 trainees will be graduated annually. Also, coordination is currently underway with the medical services at the Saudi Aramco to get advantage of their partnership with the US Johns Hopkins University and send a number of health practitioners to the US to have short and intensified training courses in the field of infection control.

He noted that the MOH, during the last months, has trained more than 40 000 health practitioners at its facilities on how to curb the risk of infection at hospitals, adding that: "The infection acquired in the health facilities is an international problem regardless of the type of the provided health services. The risks result from the interventions experienced by the patient during his hospitalization. Infection control is mainly based on training health facilities' workers on methods of controlling infections and providing special requirements on infection control. The infection control programs are available at all health facilities targeting all employees. However, some workers are assigned to perform the duties of infection control supervision."

Dr. Assiri added, "We focus on a number of infectious diseases inside the health facilities that are more prevalent than others, such as blood infections, surgical infections and urinary catheter infections. Certain ways of prevention are used for controlling these types of infections. Complete prevention may not be possible, but there are ways to reduce infections, which is the ultimate goal of all infection control programs."

He indicated that the MOH has implemented a broad program, in collaboration with the Saudi Central Board of Accreditation for Healthcare Institutions, to assess the readiness of health facilities to deal with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The program included more than 418 hospitals; the majority of them belong to the MOH and also a number of big private hospitals.

It is noteworthy that the said workshop targets the infection control practitioners in Riyadh region, whereas the Health Facilities Infection Control General Department, in collaboration with the Saudi Central Board of Accreditation for Healthcare Institutions and McKinsey & Company, organized a workshop for training the infection control evaluators in Riyadh region.

The 1st part of the training program is a workshop, and the 2nd part is a practical training in hospitals. The workshop included lectures and active discussions about the use of evaluations forms; that is to be added to training attendees on the use of the different forms. The trainees showed a good understanding of the skills needed for a successful evaluation process, and they were also given the required forms for the evaluation process.

The last part of the training process will start next week [week of 1 Dec 2014] at different hospitals in Riyadh region, where the trainees will carry out infection control evaluation operations under the supervision of specialized trainers in the field. After the trainee passes this test, he will carry out the evaluation process by himself.

[Given the observation that nosocomial transmission is a significant contributor to the MERS-CoV outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the above described plan for enhanced training of hospital personnel in infection control procedures is a critical step in impacting transmission within the healthcare environment.

In a recent study by Maltezou HC and Tsiodras S, published in the American Journal of Infection Control, the authors reviewed the literature and documents on reported cases of MERS-CoV infection and identified 11 events where nosocomial transmission was identified, involving a total of 369 cases. Of these 369 cases 115 (31.2 percent) were in healthcare workers. The need for improved infection control procedures was clearly highlighted as is seen in the abstract below.

(Maltezou HC and Tsiodras S., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Implications for health care facilities, AJIC, Dec 2014, 42(12):1261-1265 available at http://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(14)00931-6/fulltext. ProMED-mail thanks our Rapporteur Mary Marshall for sending this link.)

"Background
"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that causes a severe respiratory disease with high case fatality rate. Starting in March 2014, a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, many of which were acquired in health care settings. As of [9 May 2014], 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally.

"Methods
"Review of publicly available data about MERS-CoV health care-associated transmission.

"Results
"We identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care-associated transmission with high morbidity and mortality, mainly among patients with comorbidities. Health care workers are also frequently affected; however, they tend to have milder symptoms and better prognosis. Gaps in infection control were noted in all events. Currently, health care-associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula.

"Conclusion
"There is a need to increase infection control capacity in affected areas and areas at increased risk of being affected to prevent transmission in health care settings. Vaccines and antiviral agents are urgently needed. Overall, our knowledge about the epidemiologic characteristics of MERS-CoV that impact health care transmission is very limited. As the MERS-CoV epidemic continues to evolve, issues concerning best infection control measures will arise, and studies to better define their effectiveness in real life are needed." - Mod.MPP]
