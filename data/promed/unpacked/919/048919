Uganda's ministry of health says a 4th health worker has died from the spreading Ebola outbreak that has killed 11 people. The outbreak of the Sudan strain of the virus began in September [2022], but health authorities are also testing a suspected case of the Zaire strain.

Fifty-eight-year-old [MN], an anesthetic officer, is Uganda's 4th health worker to succumb to the deadly Ebola Sudan virus. [MN] reportedly battled the disease for 17 days. Dr. Sam Oledo, the president of the Uganda Medical Association, says [MN] was to retire in 2 years.

The Uganda Medical Association has been spearheading a call to Uganda's ministry of health to provide adequate protective gear to health workers and says there has been a good response. Oledo describes the state of hospitalized health workers.

"It's painful because there is no amount of words that can replace colleagues whom you've been working with. And it's our prayer that the family is compensated," said Oledo. "We are glad that our other colleagues, who were doing so bad about 3-4 days ago, they are improving. So we are glad that those who were diahorrating 36 times a day, they are now having about 3 or 4 motions, which is good to us."

Uganda registered its 1st case of the Ebola Sudan strain on 20 Sep [2022] in the Mubende district, and the disease has spread to 4 other districts: Kassanda, Kyegegwa, Bunyangabu, and now Kagadi. [There are now 63 confirmed and probable cases, including 29 deaths. - Mod.LK]

The ministry of health has since moved all affected health workers into supportive management treatment at the Fort Portal specialized unit. But Dr. Tonny Kapsandui, program manager for Amref Health, notes that as more health workers succumb to Ebola, it sends fear and panic among health workers in an already ill-prepared health system.

Kapsandui also says Uganda may have to brace for more Ebola cases if a suspected case of the Congo-Crimean strain is confirmed in Amuru district in Northern Uganda.

"And we got information from our project manager there, that there's a case in Amuru. And that, interestingly, is the Congo-Crimean variant. Not the South Sudan. We expect South Sudan most likely to show up in Amuru because it's at the border with South Sudan. But it's the Congo variant." [See comment below; Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is not a variant of Ebola, but rather a genetically and biologically distinct virus, albeit with similar symptoms. - Mod.LK]

The ministry of health has yet to confirm the new variant case. If confirmed, it will be exactly 3 years since Uganda reported a case of Ebola Zaire virus. There's still no current and effective vaccine. [There is no approved vaccine against Sudan Ebola virus; however there is at least one candidate with safety data in the clinical trial pipeline that showed promise in animal studies. - Mod.JH]

The Sudan Ebola strain was first reported in southern Sudan in 1976. Although several outbreaks have been reported since then in both Uganda and Sudan, the deadliest outbreak in Uganda was in 2000, claiming over 200 lives.

["Since the initial outbreak was discovered in the central district of Mubende, cases have been found in Kassanda, in the east, as well as in Kyegegwa and Kagadi, to the west."

"But Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has vowed not to impose any lockdowns to tackle the disease, saying last week that there was 'no need for anxiety.'"
(https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11282931/Ebola-death-toll-hits-10-Uganda-health-bosses-scramble-contain-outbreak.html)

"The center of the outbreak lies along a major highway connecting Uganda's capital, Kampala, with the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is around 20 mi [32 km] from Kibale National Park, popular with foreign tourists coming to see Uganda's chimpanzees. Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, and South Sudan have started screening travelers crossing their borders with Uganda for Ebola symptoms."
(https://www.wsj.com/articles/vaccine-resistant-ebola-strain-spreads-in-uganda-11664889314?mod=world_major_3_pos4)

"The director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that 63 Ebola cases and 29 deaths have already been confirmed in Uganda and called for clinical trials of new vaccines to be conducted in the country.

"At a press conference, Tedros reported that 10 healthcare workers have been infected, 4 have died, and 4 others have already recovered from the disease. 'We have released USD 2 million from the Emergency Contingency Fund and are working with our partners to send additional experts, supplies, and resources to curb the spread of the disease,' said the WHO chief."

"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_) in the family Bunyaviridae."
(https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/index.html)

It is a totally different virus from Ebola virus, which is in the order Mononegavirales, family Filoviridae.

"The disease was first characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.

"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is found in Eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union, throughout the Mediterranean, in northwestern China, central Asia, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent."
(https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/index.html)

"An outbreak of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has been confirmed in Amuru district [Uganda].

"Health officials revealed on Thursday [29 Sep 2022] that samples taken from an 18-year-old man who succumbed over the weekend tested positive for the viral disease. He had reportedly presented with symptoms similar to the Ebola virus disease.

"The victim, a resident of Lulai village in Opara sub-county, was confirmed dead on arrival on Saturday [24 Sep 2022] at Lacor health center III in Pabbo town council, where he had been rushed by his family for treatment.

"Amuru Resident District Commissioner Osorn Oceng told Uganda Radio Network in an interview that blood samples taken from the victim had been referred for a test at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).

"He says on Wednesday [28 Sep 2022], they received notification from UVRI through Gulu Regional Referral Hospital that the victim's blood sample tested positive for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.

"Latek says they have activated contact tracing and notified the family of the deceased and health workers who attempted to treat him to reach out to medical workers in case they start experiencing symptoms similar to the disease.

"He, however, called on locals in the district not to panic and asked them to be vigilant about any strange symptoms similar to hemorrhagic fever.

"Latek suspects unregulated movement of animals infected with the viral disease could have caused the outbreak in the district."

"According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the disease is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals.

"Human-to-human transmission can also occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons and has a case fatality rate of 40%, according to CDC.

"Uganda had not reported outbreaks of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in humans until 2013, when human cases of CCHF were detected in the northern Uganda district of Agago." - Mod.LK

Abstract
--------
Filoviruses, including Ebola virus, pose an increasing threat to the public health. Although 2 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have been approved to treat the Ebola virus disease (1,2), there are no approved broadly reactive drugs to control diverse filovirus infection. Filovirus has a large polymerase (L) protein and the cofactor viral protein 35 (VP35), which constitute the basic functional unit responsible for virus genome RNA synthesis (3). Owing to its conservation, the L-VP35 polymerase complex is a promising target for broadly reactive antiviral drugs. Here we determined the structure of Ebola virus L protein in complex with tetrameric VP35 using cryo-electron microscopy (state 1). Structural analysis revealed that Ebola virus L possesses a filovirus-specific insertion element that is essential for RNA synthesis, and that VP35 interacts extensively with the N-terminal region of L by 3 protomers of the VP35 tetramer. Notably, we captured the complex structure in a 2nd conformation with the unambiguous priming loop and supporting helix away from polymerase active site (state 2). Moreover, we demonstrated that the century-old drug suramin could inhibit the activity of the Ebola virus polymerase in an enzymatic assay. The structure of the L-VP35-suramin complex reveals that suramin can bind at the highly conserved NTP entry channel to prevent substrates from entering the active site. These findings reveal the mechanism of Ebola virus replication and may guide the development of more powerful anti-filovirus drugs.

Discussion
-----------
In summary, we determine the structure of EBOV L protein in complex with tetrameric VP35 and capture a previously missing structural snapshot of mononegavirus polymerase in the non-initiation state, with a supporting helix and priming loop getting away from the active site. Of note, we demonstrate that suramin could inhibit EBOV L-VP35 activity and elucidate the structural basis of suramin binding to RdRp, suggesting the feasibility of developing non-nucleoside antiviral drugs to treat filovirus infection.

[A broad-spectrum antiviral that would be effective against different strains of Ebola virus as well as other filoviruses would serve as a valuable tool to fight these viruses, as evidenced by the current outbreak of Ebola Sudan. Suramin is a multifunctional drug that is known to inhibit activity of parasites, viruses, and cancers, but it has a number of shortcomings. Optimization of suramin to increase specificity and affinity would overcome some of the current shortcomings to provide a valuable broad-spectrum inhibitor. - Mod.LK

It is important to remember that the named Ebola viruses are distinct species, not strains. Ebola Zaire virus is roughly 40% different genetically from Sudan Ebola virus. In fact both are more closely related to Ebola Reston than they are to one another. Those large genetic differences are why existing Ebola Zaire vaccines are ineffective against Sudan Ebola and reinforce the need to not only develop vaccines, but develop polyvalent and/or broadly neutralizing vaccines/therapeutics capable of providing immunity/protection against multiple Ebola virus species. - Mod.JH
