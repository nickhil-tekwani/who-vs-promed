[1] Cuba: language problem delaying in-country deployment

All the Cubans sent to West Africa at the beginning of October 2014 had received weeks of instruction in Cuba, including about protective measures and equipment, and they were expected to get another 2 or 3 weeks of "immersion" training in an Ebola treatment center working with patients.

Guinea
------
Guinean officials said language was one of the issues causing delay, with the Cubans speaking Spanish and their hosts French... Guinea, which is just about to open its own training center, using Guineans trained by Doctors Without Borders [MSF], is organizing to train 6 of the Cuban doctors using 2 interpreters, he said. Two Cubans already have been trained by the medical aid group. But at this rate, it would take months to train the entire crew...

Sierra Leone
-----------
There has also been a delay in deploying Cuban doctors in Sierra Leone, with only about 60 of 165 Cubans there in the field, said Castro, leader of the Cuban doctors in Guinea. Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health would say only that some of the Cubans there are working while others still are being trained, according to spokesman Sidie Yayha Tunis. He said the Cubans are being trained at a center run by the ministry and did not mention any language problems though his country is English-speaking... - more

[Cuba has received deserved international recognition for being the 1st overseas government to send doctors in West Africa, but it comes to mind that they could have had training in the relevant foreign language and medical terms before leaving Cuba, or while they have been waiting in-country. Their 6-month deployment ends in March 2015. - Mod.JW]

[2] US: Vaccine liability protection
Date: Tue 9 Dec 2014

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/09/us-firms-liability-protections-ebola-vaccine


The US Department of Health and Human Services on Tue [9 Dec 2014] offered liability protections to drug makers rushing to develop Ebola vaccines and urged other countries to follow suit. The health and human services (HHS) secretary, Sylvia Burwell, made the announcement as part of the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (Prep) Act in a move aimed at encouraging the development and availability of experimental Ebola vaccines...

The declaration provides immunity under US law against legal claims related to the manufacturing, testing, development, distribution and administration of 3 vaccines for the Ebola virus. However, it does not provide immunity for a claim brought in a court outside the USA. Secretary Burwell urged other countries to follow suit by enacting similar liability protections. "As a global community, we must ensure that legitimate concerns about liability do not hold back the possibility of developing an Ebola vaccine, an essential strategy in our global response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa," she said in a statement... - more

[3] Emory case notes
Date: Mon 8 Dec 2014
Source: The Times of India [edited]
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/An-Ebola-doctors-return-from-the-edge-of-death/articleshow/45410146.cms


A 44-year-old physician contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone while treating Ebola patients in the government hospital in Kenema. He was evacuated to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on 9 Sep 2014, the 3rd American with Ebola to be airlifted there from West Africa. He had a long, agonizing illness, with 40 days in the hospital... 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds before he got Ebola, he has lost 30 pounds, much of it muscle. He tires easily, but has begun a grueling physical therapy program to rebuild wasted muscles. "[He] was by far the sickest patient with Ebola virus cared for at Emory," said Dr. Jay B. Varkey, an infectious-disease specialist.

Doctors say his recovery has taught them that aggressive treatments, even life-support measures like ventilators and dialysis, can save some Ebola patients. Dr. Bruce S. Ribner, who leads the Emory team, said that until recently, the general practice was not to bother intubating Ebola patients or put them on dialysis, because if they got that sick, they were going to die. "One of the things his illness taught us was that you can get sick enough to need those interventions, and you can still walk out of the hospital," Dr. Ribner said. "I think it has sent a message to our colleagues around the world."

[The doctor] signed on with WHO -- expenses only, no pay -- and in August 2014 was in Kenema. He planned to stay 3 or 4 weeks. The experience was even more wrenching than he had imagined; there were often 60 to 80 patients, sometimes more, suspected and confirmed cases, from all over the country. They arrived day and night. Blood, stool and vomit were ever-present, though cleaners mopped with chlorine several times a day. But there were moments of grace. Mothers whose babies had died would feed children who were orphaned or alone. "Childless parents took care of parentless children," he said.

The protective gear required to enter the ward -- hoods, masks, rubber boots, goggles, double gloves, Tyvek suit -- was stifling. No one could wear it for more than an hour without becoming dangerously overheated. Dr. Crozier would go into the ward 2-3 times a day for as long he could stand it. When he came out to cool off, he would pour the sweat out of his boots...

On the morning of Sat 6 Sep 2014, during rounds on the ward, he developed a fever and a headache. He isolated himself in his hotel, hoping he had malaria. A colleague brought equipment so that he drew his own blood for an Ebola test, which tested positive. He had no idea how he had become infected. The specially prepared airplane picked him up on Mon 8 Sep 2014. He took pictures of himself during the flight as his face swelled and he broke out in a rash. He has no memory of the 3 weeks after he arrived at Emory...

Dr. Varkey, the infectious-disease specialist, said there were warning signs early on that he might become severely ill. The viral load in his blood was extremely high, more than 100 times that of the other patients Emory had treated. And he was becoming delirious, a sign of encephalitis. He developed intense diarrhea and received fluids and salts to prevent dehydration. He got steadily worse. By Fri 12 Sep 2014, he was struggling to breathe, and on Sun 14 Sep 2014, he was placed on a ventilator. A nurse who had also been infected in Kenema, Will Pooley -- whose evacuation Dr. Crozier had supervised -- flew to Emory from England and donated several units of plasma. The Ebola virus levels began dropping, but his kidneys failed, and he was connected to a dialysis machine. He had swelled up with 20 pounds of excess fluid. He had begun having abnormal heart rhythms. He was on the ventilator for 12 days, and on dialysis for 24 days.

He began to recover physically. But there were ominous signs that he might have suffered brain damage: His eyes wandered in different directions, and he took a long time to wake up when his sedation was withdrawn. "I thought we'd be discharging him to a nursing home as a cognitively impaired person," said Dr. Colleen Kraft, one of his doctors. When he finally did open his eyes at the end of September 2014, a few days after his 44th birthday, there were scar-like lesions on his retinas, and it is not clear whether they were getting better or worse.

He hopes to return to West Africa by February or March 2015 to help treat Ebola patients. Survivors are thought to be immune to the strain that infected them, so he figures he has built-in protection." There's still a great deal left to be done," he said... - more
