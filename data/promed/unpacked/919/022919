The Humane Society for Tacoma & Pierce County is seeking help from the community. Over 31 dogs have shown signs of canine pneumovirus at the shelter since May [2022], according to a news release. As of Fri 11 Nov [2022], there are 15 dogs currently receiving treatment at the shelter.

The non-zoonotic virus is highly contagious between dogs and rodents but isn't transferable to humans or cats. The virus's effects include coughing, abnormal breathing, and discharge from the eyes or nose.

"Several other shelters across the nation have experienced increased cases of canine respiratory illnesses this year," chief operating officer Leah Turner said in the news release.

The affected dogs have been placed in quarantine. The shelter is following procedures outlined by its veterinary team as well as other nationally recognized disease control practices.

As a result, the shelter will stop taking stray, lost, or owner-surrendered dogs until further notice. People are advised to hold onto a lost or stray dog if found. They will accept dogs only in an emergency such as if the dog needs immediate medical care. Tips on what to do when a lost pet is found are available online at http://www.thehumanesociety.org/lost-pets/. The shelter also asks people who can to adopt or foster a pet. As of 11 Nov [2022] there are over 35 adoptable dogs, all of which are healthy and do not exhibit signs of upper respiratory illness.

All adoptable pets have had a wellness exam and have been spayed or neutered. All of them also got their initial vaccines and are microchipped. People interested in adopting or fostering can look online at http://www.thehumanesociety.org/adopt/.

"Shelter pets need the community's help now more than ever," communications manager Lindsey Heaney said in the news release. "If you have space and love to spare right now, even for a temporary time, please consider fostering or adopting."

People can also help the shelter by donating unopened bags of dog food, dog collars, and leashes. Plastic travel crates, training pads, cleaning gowns, and towels are also accepted.

Donations can be brought to the shelter Tuesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monetary donations at http://www.thehumanesociety.org/donate and wish lists at http://www.thehumanesociety.org/ways-to-give/donate-items are also available online.

["Canine pneumovirus was first isolated in 2010 from dogs with respiratory disease in the United States. Since then, seropositive dogs have been detected in Europe, Africa, and Asia with genomic sequences determined from samples in England and Italy. Seronegative dogs entering animal shelters quickly seroconvert with a strong correlation between exposure to canine pneumovirus and the development of respiratory disease. These observations indicate canine pneumovirus contributes to what is commonly referred to as the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) complex. The canine virus is very closely related to pneumonia virus of mice. Infection of mice with the canine virus produced a mild pneumonia, and recovered mice were protected from a lethal challenge with pneumonia virus of mice. Pneumovirus has also been isolated from cats, and several wildlife species (raccoons and foxes) show a high seroprevalence for the canine virus. These data call into question whether rodents are a natural host for pneumovirus as wild rodents show little or no exposure to pneumovirus. Canine pneumovirus is difficult to isolate in cell cultures, and many laboratories offer PCR panels that include canine pneumovirus." - Mod.TG
