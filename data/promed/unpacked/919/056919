West Nile fever is spreading in Israel, although the number of cases
remains low. 12 cases of the disease, which generally surfaces in the
summer, have been confirmed and another 12 patients are thought to be
suffering from the illness. The disease is spread to humans by
mosquitoes, which are infected with the virus by birds. Incidence of
the fever has been centered in the Tel Aviv area.

West Nile causes flu-like symptoms, headaches, rashes, and
conjunctivitis, and in 8 percent of cases meningitis, which can
affect the nervous system and even cause death. An 87-year-old woman
from Ramat Efal who had a history of heart and metabolic conditions
died of West Nile fever [virus infection] this summer [2010]. 2
patients remain hospitalized with symptoms of meningitis. Most of
those affected are over 65 or are suffering from chronic illness. The
largest recent outbreak in Israel occurred in 2000 when more than 400
caught the fever and 29 people died of it.

The Health Ministry recommends taking measures to avoid contact with
mosquitoes, including wearing long sleeves, using window screens,
using mosquito repellent, and eliminating standing water where
mosquitoes breed.
