Anthrax outbreak confirmed in northwestern Bangladesh
-----------------------------------------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed in the samples collected from some
villages of Bangladesh's 2 northwestern districts where 127 people
were infected with the disease in the past week, said a senior health
official Wednesday [25 Aug 2010].

Mahmudur Rahman, chief of Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology,
Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) under the country's Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare, told Xinhua Wednesday, "We confirm the
disease as anthrax. Some 46 blood samples taken from animals and
people suspected to have been infected by cutaneous anthrax in
northwestern Bangladesh have tested positive," he said, adding that
all possible measures have been taken against the spreading of the disease.

Rahman said the main risk factor for getting cutaneous anthrax is
contact with animal hides or hair, bone products, and wool, as well
as contact with infected animals. "A total of 127 people have so far
fallen ill with anthrax contracted from consuming meat or coming in
contact of ill domestic animals in Sirajganj district, some 134 km
[83 mi] northwest of capital Dhaka, and neighboring district Pabna," he said.

Rahman said all of the anthrax infected people are responding to
treatments and now recovering. Infection has caused wound-like
lesions in the body, he said, adding that usually the infected parts
start rotting if not treated properly.

Anthrax infected people informed the health officials that they [had]
consumed meat of domestic animals that were slaughtered after
[having] fallen ill on different occasions in some villages of the
districts since the end of last month [July 2010], health officials
had said earlier. They said that about a week ago, some residents of
a village in Sirajganj came first to the hospital with anthrax
symptoms. Rahman said health officials including doctors and experts
have been camping in those villages and treating the patients at
their homes. He, however, confirmed that nobody died of anthrax.

Anthrax is a highly contagious disease [sic -- see below. - Mod.MHJ],
usually transmitted [to] people through contact with meat, blood, or
skin of a dead animal that has been infected. Infection in humans
most often involves the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, or the lungs.

Bangladesh's Directorate of Livestock Services has reportedly
vaccinated over 4000 animals in the districts as part of its efforts
to contain the outbreak of anthrax which, according to health
officials' claim, has remained under control.

[The Bangladesh medical belief that this disease is 'contagious'
indicates their absence of prior experience. Anthrax is infectious,
not contagious; contagion is very rare. I was surprised by the use of
the word "rotting" in cutaneous cases. The extreme oedema and
inflammation might suggest 'rotting' but not in reality. One of the
problems with cutaneous anthrax is the long time it takes for the
oedema and inflammation in human patients to resolve. It does but in
its own time. Healing is helped by draining the bloody fluid, which
will contain EF (oedema factor) and LF (lethal factor) toxins long
after the organism has been killed by the antibiotics.

As long as the patient has not been self treating with antibiotics
diagnosis is fairly straightforward in humans with cutaneous lesions.
Gastrointestinal anthrax is more difficult as the initial symptoms
are not that pathognomonic -- fever, maybe diarrhea, abdominal pain.

I suspect that the finding of only cutaneous cases reflects ease of
diagnosis, not reality if such large numbers are complaining of
symptoms. By definition one does not acquire cutaneous anthrax by
"consuming meat" of infected animals. Also there could well be some
hysterical cases adding to the clinical noise. On the other hand it
will add to the public pressure to have a structured proactive
livestock control programme in place. It would also be worth the
while, when the present fuss has died down, for the Bangladesh
medical and veterinary authorities to organize relevant continuing
education workshops to bring their people up to speed on recognizing,
treating, and controlling this disease, to review what was done, and
what might be done in future. - Mod.MHJ]
