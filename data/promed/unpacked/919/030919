Gonorrhea cases in Sweden are increasing as bacteria in the sexually transmitted diseases are becoming stronger [By this do they mean that _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, the bacterium that causes gonorrhea, is increasingly more drug-resistant?]. [According to the] Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control, the number of recorded cases in the country went up from 951 in 2011 to 1098 in 2012, a 16 percent increase. The infection has been rising in the Scandinavian country since the mid-90s, particularly among young people and gay men. The institute's Inga Velicko described the large figures as a 'worrying development'.

The disease is much more prevalent among males, mainly due to the fact that it can spread more easily among men having sexual relations with each other. However, there has also been a rise in the number of cases recorded among heterosexual couples.

Gonorrhea, if not treated, can lead to sterility, and many carriers, particularly women, see no symptoms from the infection. It can be cured with antibiotics, but researchers are worried that as the bacterium strengthens, the antibiotics may lose their effectiveness.

[Magnus Unemo, director of the] World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Gonorrhea and Other Sexually Transmitted Infections [in Orebro, Sweden; http://apps.who.int/whocc/Detail.aspx?cc_ref=SWE-62&cc_code=swe], said that the increase was part of a global trend and has been happening for roughly 5 years. He added that the concerns over gonorrhea [are] rising, and there are now international recommendations for how best to treat the infection [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2012/9789241503501_eng.pdf].

WHO estimates that there are 106 million cases of the infection worldwide [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2012/9789241503501_eng.pdf].

Sweden has been singled out as the sexually transmitted disease (STD) capital of Europe, with sexually active Swedes found to be more likely than their European counterparts to seek treatment for diseases such chlamydia and gonorrhea.

"An increasing number of young Swedes are aware of the fact that many sexually transmitted diseases don't have visible symptoms. As a result, they may be more inclined to get tested as a precaution," Pelle Ullholm, an expert with the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (Riksforbundet for Sexuell Upplysning, RFSU) told The Local.

Figures compiled by online health clinic HealthExpress reveal there has been a significant rise in the number of reported STDs in Europe in recent years, the Daily Mail newspaper reported.

Based on data from more than 3500 consultations, Swedes sought treatment for STDs most often, followed by Germans and Britons.

Chlamydia was found to be the most common STD across Europe, according to the paper.

Ullholm wasn't surprised by the findings, citing a number of factors that may have resulted in Swedes' penchant for getting tested for STDs such as increased awareness about infections and easy access to testing.

"While I can't speak specifically about other countries, Sweden has a number of youth-friendly clinics where young people feel comfortable seeking advice and treatment," he said.

He explained that Swedish law requires people found to test positive for certain STDs, including HIV and chlamydia, to tell past partners about their infections. "They are given access to free treatment, but they need to tell all their past sexual partners, to the best of their memory," said Ullholm.

Dr Hilary Jones, a medical adviser with HealthExpress told the Daily Mail that Sweden's STD reporting requirement should be seen as a model that could be followed elsewhere in Europe.

"Although some may view the country's rules as 'draconian,' having legislation which protects people from infection could help other countries within the EU dent the rising STD figures," she told the paper.

Ullholm noted further that Swedes remain single and unattached longer in comparison to other European countries, which can result in more sexual partners.

In addition, a recent survey found half of young Swedes don't use condoms when having sex with a new partner and that 30 percent of Swedes use no contraceptive measures at all. "Clearly that figure needs to be improved," he added.

[The 1st news report above cites data that the incidence of gonorrhea in Sweden has been increasing and the 2nd news report says that this increase may in part be attributed to the propensity of sexually active Swedish youth to get tested for gonorrhea as a precaution, even if they are asymptomatic. Most women and many men with gonorrhea are asymptomatic (http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/STDFact-gonorrhea-detailed.htm), especially when the infection is in the oropharynx and rectum. Such asymptomatic carriers are often identified when sexual contacts are traced.

The following is extracted from moderator ML's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post, Gonococcal disease - UK: increased cases, antibiotic resistance 20130301.1565249:

Gonorrhea is a major cause of serious reproductive complications in women and can facilitate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. The latest CDC data for sexually transmitted disease caused by _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ show that while reported rates were at historically low levels in the United States, cases increased slightly from 2009 to 2010 and more than 300 000 cases were reported in 2010. However, the CDC estimates that fewer than half of gonococcal infections occurring in the US are diagnosed and reported. There are also signs from CDC surveillance systems that the disease has become resistant to several of the antibiotics previously available as treatment options (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats10/trends.htm).

Ceftriaxone, an injectable 3rd generation cephalosporin, is the most effective cephalosporin for treatment of gonorrhea, but the percentage of _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates with elevated minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to cephalosporins has been rising (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6026a2.htm). Resistance of _N. gonorrhoeae_ to cefixime, an oral cephalosporin used to treat gonorrhea, reported in approximately 30 percent isolates in Japan, led to withdrawal of cefixime in Japan for the treatment of gonorrhea. (See ProMED-mail posting Antibiotic resistance, Neisseria gonorrhoeae - Japan: ceftriaxone 20110713.2114). Similarly in the UK, reduced susceptibility to cefixime was noted in nearly 20 percent of cases in 2010, compared with just 10 percent of cases in 2009 (ProMED-mail posting Antibiotic resistance, Neisseria gonorrhoeae - UK: cefixime 20111012.3051). In the UK, the recommended treatment for uncomplicated anogenital gonococcal infection in adults is ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single dose with azithromycin 1 g oral as a single dose (http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&Page&HPAwebAutoListName/Page/1221117908959). Cefixime 400 mg oral as a single dose is only recommended if an intramuscular injection is contra-indicated or refused by the patient and is always accompanied by azithromycin 1 g oral as a single dose.

In the United States, in an attempt to forestall loss of ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonococcal disease and anticipating the emergence of resistance to cefixime before resistance to ceftriaxone, the CDC has recommended the routine use of the combination of 2 anti-gonococcal antibiotics, ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly plus azithromycin 1 g orally (preferably) or doxycycline for treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.

The following is extracted from the CDC 2010 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Surveillance information that is available at http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats10/gonorrhea.htm:

The CDC recommends the substitution of a drug in treatment regimens for gonococcal disease when the rate of resistance to that drug is 5 percent or higher in a general community so that all recommended treatments for gonorrhea can be expected to cure greater than 95 percent of gonococcal infections.

Only ceftriaxone meets the CDC's efficacy standards. Because of experience with other microbes that have developed antimicrobial resistance rapidly, combination therapy using 2 antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action is recommended to improve treatment efficacy and potentially delay emergence and spread of resistance to ceftriaxone.

Based on data from CDC's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), the CDC recommends combination therapy with ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and either azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as the most reliably effective treatment for uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhea (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm). The use of azithromycin as the 2nd antimicrobial is preferred to doxycycline because of the convenience and compliance advantages of single-dose therapy and the substantially higher prevalence of gonococcal resistance to tetracycline than to azithromycin among GISP isolates, particularly in strains with elevated cefixime MICs (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

The 250 mg IM dose ceftriaxone cures 99.2 percent of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal and 98.9 percent of pharyngeal infections in published clinical trials. A 250 mg dose of ceftriaxone is now recommended over a 125 mg dose given the 1) increasingly wide geographic distribution of isolates demonstrating decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins in vitro, 2) reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures, 3) improved efficacy of ceftriaxone 250 mg in pharyngeal infection (which is often unrecognized), and 4) the utility of having a simple and consistent recommendation for treatment regardless of the anatomic site involved.

When ceftriaxone cannot be used for treatment of urogenital or rectal gonorrhea, 2 alternative options are available: cefixime 400 mg orally plus either azithromycin 1 g orally or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally for 7 days if ceftriaxone is not readily available, or azithromycin 2 g orally in a single dose if ceftriaxone cannot be given because of severe allergy. However, if either of these alternative regimens is prescribed, then the patient should return in one week for a test-of-cure at the site of infection (http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/2012/GonorrheaTreatmentGuidelinesFactSheet8-9-2012.pdf).

Because of GISP data of declining cefixime susceptibility among urethral _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates collected in the United States during 2006-2011, the CDC no longer recommends cefixime at any dose as a 1st-line regimen for treatment of gonococcal infections (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

Spectinomycin, which is useful in persons who cannot tolerate cephalosporins, is expensive, must be injected, and is not available in the United States. However, it has been effective in published clinical trials, curing 98.2 percent of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections. Spectinomycin has poor efficacy against pharyngeal infection (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/STD-Treatment-2010-RR5912.pdf).

Because of the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance, fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended for treatment of gonococcal infections (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5614a3.htm).
