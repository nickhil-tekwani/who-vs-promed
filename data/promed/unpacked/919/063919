Rotavirus vaccine trial: Reported by Stuart Handysides <shandysi@phls.co.uk>
PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, England
Two days after the New England Journal of Medicine published results of a
randomised controlled trial of a quadrivalent rhesus rotavirus vaccine
carried out in Venezuela, the Lancet published the results of a similar
trial from Finland. Of 2398 babies born in the Pirkanmaa area of Finland
and enrolled in the study, 1191 received at least one dose of vaccine and
1207 a placebo. A total of 256 episodes of rotavirus gastroenteritis were
reported, of which 65 were among the vaccine recipients and 191 among the
placebo recipients (relative vaccine efficacy 66%; intention to treat
analysis). Vaccine efficacy was higher for more severe episodes (as judged
using a 20 point scale), of which 100 occurred. The first dose of vaccine
was associated with significantly more febrile reactions, crying, and
irritability in the first five days than placebo. About 30% of those who
received vaccine developed fever, based on rectal temperature. The authors
conclude that the vaccine could reduce severe rotavirus gastroenteritis by
90%, and all severe gastroenteritis in children by 60%, but recognise a
need for individual countries to analyse the costs and benefits for their
own populations.
