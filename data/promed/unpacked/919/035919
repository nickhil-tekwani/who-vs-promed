Twenty anthrax cases have been registered in southern Kyrgyzstan, as the
epidemic spreads from the Osh Region. Over 250 other people were believed
to have had contact with anthrax-infected beef, according to a source at
the country's health ministry.
Kyrgyzstan's extraordinary anti-epidemic commission has imposed a state of
emergency in the southern areas of the country. Regional and local
authorities and veterinary services have been told to tighten their control
over the slaughter of animals and the sales of meat, Interfax said.
