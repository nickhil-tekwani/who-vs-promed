Influenza update number 256, based on data up to 24 Jan 2015
------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally, increasing levels of influenza activity continued to be reported in the temperate zones of the northern hemisphere with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as the most detected virus.

- Increasing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity continued to be reported in Europe. Some countries in northern and eastern Europe reported a sharp increase in influenza like illness (ILI) and an increase in severe cases due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. [See [4] below. - Mod.LK] A few countries in Europe reported an increase in activity predominantly of influenza B virus.
- In North America, a slight increase of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was reported, but overall levels were still low.
- In eastern Asia influenza activity was increasing in Japan and the Republic of Korea due to predominantly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. In North China, influenza A(H3N2) and B were the predominant circulating viruses detected.
- In western Asia, influenza activity remained at high levels in Israel but appeared to have peaked in Jordan, Oman and Iran.
- Few influenza virus detections were reported by countries in tropical Africa.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, Central America and the Caribbean, influenza and other respiratory virus activity were overall at low levels in most countries. Puerto Rico and Guadeloupe reported increased influenza and ILI activities in recent weeks. In Costa Rica, influenza activity continued at high but decreasing levels.
- In Tropical Asia, countries in Southern and South East Asia continued to report ongoing low influenza activity.
- In the temperate countries of the southern hemisphere respiratory virus activity remained low.
- National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 87 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 11 Jan 2016 to 24 Jan 2016 (data as of 2016-02-05 04:13:45 UTC).The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 112 204 specimens during that time period. 20 839 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 17 413 (83.6 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 3428 (16.4 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 10 873 (81.9 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2405 (18.1 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 509 (42.1 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 700 (57.9 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[2] Risk assessment: seasonal influenza A(H1N1)pdm09
Date: Mon 8 Feb 2016

http://www.who.int/influenza/publications/riskassessment_AH1N1pdm09_201602/en/


Compared to previous years, northern hemisphere seasonal influenza activity commenced late in some countries in western Europe, North America, and eastern Asia. Transmission, as demonstrated by influenza-like illness (ILI) rates, has started to exceed country-specific baseline rates, but is still relatively low in general with the exception of some eastern European countries where a sharp increase of ILI rates has been observed [see items [3] and [4] below] and countries in western Asia where influenza activity may have already peaked.

Among the currently circulating seasonal influenza viruses in the temperate zone, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is predominating, except in northern China where influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses are widely co-circulating though the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is increasing. In a few European countries, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses are also circulating.

In some countries there have been reports of hospitalizations with severe disease associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections. Based on the WHO global influenza surveillance, in countries with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominating, the hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission patterns seem to be similar to previous seasons when this virus predominated and where young/middle-aged adults experienced severe disease.

The WHO Collaborating Centres for Influenza (CCs) of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) have characterized influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected from more than 30 countries since September 2015, including those from countries reporting severe infections. So far, phylogenetic analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) demonstrated that the HA genes of all viruses collected since September 2015 belong to genetic subgroup 6B. Within 6B, sub-subgroups with shared amino acid changes have emerged. Despite the genetic evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, the majority of 6B viruses including those in the emerging sub-subgroups, remain antigenically* closely related to the vaccine virus. In addition, a pool of human post-vaccination sera collected from healthy adults in the United States of America who received influenza vaccine in the 2015-2016 season well inhibited all recent viruses tested in the WHO CC at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.

Influenza vaccines containing an A/California/7/2009-like component, as recommended by WHO for use in the 2015-2016 seasonal vaccines, are expected to provide good protection against infections associated with the currently circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. WHO strongly recommends that high risk groups be vaccinated against influenza (Weekly Epidemiological Record, 23 Nov 2012; 87(47): 461-76; [available at http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8747.pdf]). Risk groups for influenza include people at increased risk of exposure to influenza virus as well as those at particular risk of developing severe disease resulting in hospitalization or even death. The former group includes healthcare workers (HCWs) whereas the latter groups include pregnant women, children aged 6-59 months, the elderly, and individuals with specific chronic medical conditions.

Globally more than 450 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been tested for antiviral susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors, of which only 2 viruses showed reduced susceptibility. Currently circulating viruses are expected to be susceptible to the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. Early administration of neuraminidase inhibitors, ideally within 48 hours of influenza symptom onset, reduces severe complications and death and is recommended for persons at increased risk and progressive disease. When influenza is suspected in such populations, antiviral treatment should not wait for diagnostic confirmation but should start immediately.

Countries are encouraged to continue surveillance and programmatic disease control activities, and to timely share surveillance information with WHO and representative viruses with WHO CCs [Collaborating Centres] of GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] in order to have continuous risk assessment of circulating and emerging influenza viruses.

*Evaluated with haemagglutination inhibition tests using post-infection ferret antisera raised against A/California/7/2009, the vaccine virus, and recent circulating virus strains.

[3] Ukraine: influenza A(H1N1)

Daily victims of the flu: sanitary-epidemiological station reports frightening statistics
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Every day in Ukraine influenza and influenza-like illnesses kill about 10 people.

Acting head of State sanitary-epidemiological service (SES) of Ukraine, Sviatoslav Protas, has reported this information to journalists.

According to him, the most common cause of death is late request for medical aid and complications caused by the disease.

"Individuals who died had not been vaccinated against influenza. Today [29 Jan 2016] in Ukraine 123 000 people were vaccinated against flu. This is a very low proportion of the population. In European countries, 30-50 per cent of the population has been vaccinated; among representatives of risk groups vaccination rates reach up to 75 per cent," said Protas.

According to SES, the largest number of deaths -- 32 persons -- have been recorded in the Odessa region, and 11 deaths in the Vinnytsia region.

The expert has again urged Ukrainians not to self-medicate and to go to doctors immediately after the onset of symptoms of viral diseases.

As was reported by "Observer," according to the Ministry of Health, the number of victims of a flu epidemic in Ukraine has reached 155 people.

[Today, 9 Feb 2016, Tass Russian News Agency reported over 240 dead from influenza in Ukraine, with epidemic thresholds exceeded in 15 of 27 Ukraine's regions (http://tass.ru/en/world/855505). Also see [4] below, with 183 people reported dead from influenza in the Ukraine. Regardless of the exact number, the situation appears to be serious in eastern Europe. - Mod.LK

[4] Eastern Europe and Middle East: influenza A(H1N1)
Date: Tue 9 Feb 2016
Source: The Guardian [edited]
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/09/swine-flu-spreading-across-eastern-europe-and-middle-east


Swine flu has killed 183 people in Ukraine this winter and is spreading rapidly across eastern Europe and the Middle East. At least 107 people have died in Russia after contracting the disease, 18 in Armenia, and 10 in Georgia, according to government figures.

In the Middle East, 112 deaths from the virus have been reported in Iran and there are unconfirmed reports of dozens more deaths in areas of Syria and Iraq occupied by Islamic State.

Rates of severe H1N1 infection have spiked within the EU. Hospitals in 8 countries have recorded an increase in the number of cases requiring intensive care over the past 3 weeks, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

"Western European countries are also reporting severe cases associated with H1N1," said Dr Caroline Brown, programme manager for influenza at the WHO in Europe. "It's all over the region at the moment."

Unlike other strains of the flu virus, which are most dangerous for older people, H1N1 can be life-threatening for healthy people under the age of 65. Symptoms can appear similar to the common cold and include fever, fatigue, coughing, and a sore throat -- but the disease can quickly lead to pneumonia if left untreated. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the 2009-10 global H1N1 pandemic caused an estimated 284 000 deaths worldwide.

Vaccination programmes and residual immunity were thought to have kept the virus under control. Experts are struggling to determine why the latest outbreak is proving so aggressive. "The information we have so far shows the virus hasn't changed in any significant way to make us suspect it would be causing more severe disease," Brown said.

In Ukraine, the health ministry says 3000 people a day are now being hospitalised with flu. More than 3.2 million people have been diagnosed since 1 Oct 2015 -- 63 per cent of whom are under the age of 17. "Because of what's happening this flu season we're looking very carefully at this younger age group that is affected," Brown added. "We think the data show that most of the people severely affected have underlying conditions."

Schools in the country are closed for a 3rd consecutive week and all public-facing workers have been ordered to wear surgical masks in an effort to hamper transmission of the highly contagious illness.

The WHO has deployed an epidemiologist from Public Health England, Sophie Newitt, to support Kiev's response to the outbreak, but the Ukrainian healthcare system -- handicapped by war, economic crisis, and years of mismanagement -- is struggling to cope.

Countries where the H1N1 virus is circulating, including Ukraine, can expect an increase in the level of severe disease and death in high-risk groups, according to the WHO. The vaccine for the 2015-16 season in the northern hemisphere includes H1N1, H3N2 and B virus strains -- closely related to those circulating among people. The vaccine is therefore expected to provide good protection.

But less than 1 per cent of Ukraine's 45 million inhabitants have been vaccinated against the flu, and potentially life-saving treatments are in short supply. State hospitals usually dispatch patients to private pharmacies to buy medicine, but, despite a recent donation from Lithuania, there is a nationwide shortage of the anti-viral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza.

"Last [Sun 31 Jan 2016], my sister complained that she had difficulty breathing," said [a woman], whose 44-year-old sister, was diagnosed with H1N1. "The clinic took x-rays and said she had pneumonia. They took her by ambulance to the hospital, where we were given a list of the drugs we had to buy, including Tamiflu. We were only able to find them on [Wed 3 Feb 2016], but by then [her sister] was already in intensive care. She died shortly afterwards. She left behind her 6-year-old son."

Access to medical care is even more limited in the country's war-torn eastern regions. Kremlin-backed rebels have banned several international aid organisations from the territory under their control and heavy fighting has destroyed much of the medical infrastructure.

Hundreds of doctors, nurses, and paramedics fled the area during 22 months of fighting, which has left more than 9000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced. Others simply left after months without pay, cut off from the government in Kiev by trenches and checkpoints.

[Swine flu or influenza A(H1N1) circulates in humans as a seasonal flu virus and protection against this strain was included in the seasonal flu vaccine for 2015-16. The situation in eastern Europe sounds serious, and appears to be a consequence of low vaccination coverage, shortage of antivirals, and is exacerbated by the political unrest and poor economic situation in the region.
