Deaths of sea birds have wildlife officials puzzled
-----------------------------------------------
Wildlife officials are investigating the mysterious deaths of hundreds of
sea birds that have washed up on beaches along the Atlantic coast since
mid-June 2005, including south of Sandbridge and on the Outer Banks.
Most of the birds have been greater shearwaters, which are now migrating
north from their breeding grounds in the South Atlantic. The birds, while
fairly common, are rarely seen by beachgoers because they typically stay 30
to 100 miles offshore, where they feed on small fish and squid.
Some of the birds have washed up alive, unable to fly and appearing weak,
and later died. The number of dead birds has alarmed wildlife officials,
who are scrambling to pinpoint a cause.
More than 500 dead sea birds have been reported from Maryland to Florida
since June 12, said Emi Saito, a wildlife disease specialist with the U.S.
Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis. "It's
unusual to see so many," Saito said this week.
Wildlife pathologists are examining the carcasses for exposure to toxins,
pollutants such as heavy metals, and infections that might indicate a
broader environmental concern, she said.
During the past week, staffers at the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge in
Virginia Beach have found about a dozen dead greater shearwaters on the
beach, said Dorie Stolley, a wildlife biologist. Only a few remained in
good enough condition to be examined, and the others were incinerated by
city animal control officers, she said.
Staffers used rubber gloves and took other precautions while collecting the
birds. People are advised not to touch dead birds they find on the beach.
Reports of dead birds also have come from Ocracoke and Hatteras Island on
the Outer Banks.
Diane Duncan, an ecologist with the federal wildlife agency's Ecological
Services Office in Charleston, S.C., said the first reports came from
Myrtle Beach, Hilton Head and several nearby islands. Nearly 200 birds
have washed up since then in South Carolina, Duncan said.
"In 20 years here, I have never seen this kind of mortality event," Duncan
said. "It certainly is a concern to us, and we'd like to know the cause."
Tests on 2 of the birds ruled out toxins found in red tide, a type of
algal bloom that biologists initially suspected as a culprit, Duncan said.
Will Post, an ornithologist and curator at The Charleston Museum, said he
had dissected 6 greater shearwaters that had washed up alive, unable to
fly, and later died. The birds' stomachs were empty, but they had varying
levels of fat reserves, suggesting that they did not die of starvation,
Post said. "They were below normal weight, but that's normal when they're
in migration," he said.
The shearwaters fly nearly 5000 miles during their annual migrations to and
from their nesting grounds on Tristan da Cunha, a chain of volcanic islands
in the South Atlantic, Post said. The cold-water birds breed in April and
May and then fly to their summer grounds off New England and points north,
he said.
Islanders in the South Atlantic are allowed to harvest about 50 000 of the
young birds a year for food, which is controversial, Post said. There's an
estimated 5 million breeding pairs, he added. The birds resemble gulls in
appearance and size, with brown to gray heads and white undersides. They
have webbed feet and dark, tube-like bills.
Since they spend their lives at sea, Post said, they are able to drink salt
water, excreting excess salt through special glands in their heads.
