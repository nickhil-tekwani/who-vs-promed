Deadly cheese in Neuenburg
--------------------------
2 elderly people died from _Listeria_ infection in the canton of Neuenburg.
In addition, 2 women suffered miscarriages, and 6 others were brought to the
hospital. All had eaten Tomme cheese (a raw milk white cheese) produced in
the canton.
The Neuenburg canton physician Daphne Berner confirmed the deaths through a
report on the local RTN radio. Both elderly people had died during the past 2
weeks. The bacterial infection contributed to their deaths.
Beforehand the public health officials reported on a cluster of _Listeria_
cases occurring in May 2005, but without any mention of deaths. At present,
10 patients have entered hospitals with listeriosis. Within the past week, 5
cases have become known.
Canton Neuenburg's Tomme soft cheese has been implicated as the cause. The
investigators state in their report that those affected had eaten cheese of
this type produced by the firm. The canton chemist is conducting further
investigations to identify the origin of the disease-causing bacteria.
***Because of the severity of the incident, the Health Department declared
that the public should not consume Neuenberg Tomme cheese already purchased
from the stores within the canton or at marketplaces. Suspect cheese should
be destroyed. At the same time the officials called on pregnant women to
consult their doctor should they have consumed Neuenburg Tomme over the past 3
weeks and have a fever. Listeriosis can also be dangerous to those with a
weakened immune system. The illness manifests itself with flu-like symptoms
and can lead to an infection and even to meningitis.***
This occurrence harks back to the unpleasant memories of the _Listeria_
epidemic in 1987 that occurred in French-speaking Switzerland. At that time
31 people in Switzerland died after consuming contaminated Vacherin Mont d'Or
cheese. At least half of the deaths were fetuses and newborns. As a
consequence, officials [banned] a dozen different cheese types, and a ton of
cheese had to be destroyed. The market within Switzerland as well as outside
declined rapidly, and brought many cheese producers in the western part of
Switzerland to financial ruin. France experienced a _Listeria_ epidemic in
1992 that cost 60 people their lives.

[Unpasteurized cheese is a common vehicle for _L. monocytogenes_. As noted in
the report, serious infection with this Gram-positive bacillus is most common
in the elderly, the immunosuppressed, and pregnant women and their fetuses. -
