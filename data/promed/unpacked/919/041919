A cholera outbreak at a village in north east Afghanistan has infected 1492 people, killed a young woman, and left another 100 in critical condition, a provincial official said on Tue 13 Aug 2013.

Abdul Marouf Rasekh, a spokesman for the governor of Badakhshan province, said the outbreak began 3 days ago and was restricted to one town that has been quarantined. When it first appeared in the mountainous village of Chappa [also spelled Chapa - Mod.LL] in the Darayen district, Rasekh said it infected 850 people but quickly spread until the quarantine was put in place.

Rasekh said the source of the infection had been traced to a single spring of water that supplies the entire town's drinking water. Health authorities were bringing in water from nearby towns until the problem was solved. He said that 36 of the most serious cases have been taken to a hospital in the provincial capital of Faizabad and that the sole death so far was an 18 year old woman.

Afghanistan has had cholera outbreaks in the past but they are not common. Typhoid and other intestinal diseases and parasites are far more common but not as deadly if left untreated. Access to clean drinking water is a problem in rural Afghanistan and health care is rudimentary in large parts of the country, which has one of the world's lowest life expectancies at 50. Only 12 per cent of Afghans living in rural areas have access to clean drinking water, according to the US Agency for International Development.

Badakhshan Province (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badakhshan_Province) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the north eastern part of the country between the Hindu Kush mountains and the Amu Darya River. It is part of a broader historical Badakhshan region. In the east of the province a long spur called the Wakhan Corridor extends above northern Pakistan's Chitral and Northern Areas to a border with China.

Contaminated water is a common vehicle for transmission of _Vibrio cholerae_. Since the infection is uncommon in the country, one would wonder how the water source became contaminated. - Mod.LL]
