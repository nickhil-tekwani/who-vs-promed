As an immunologist I applaud and welcome the Lyme disease vaccines as
developed by SmithKline and Pasteur Merieux Connaught. The fact that it
appears that it may require three boosters and a full year before full
effectiveness does not worry me. We seem to be too preoccupied with magic
bullets that work 100% and instantly. The fact that we might have a vaccine
with apparently 80% effectiveness is worthy of celebration.
Some of the caveats that were posted by Martin Hugh-Jones should, on the
other hand, concern all of us in the health care profession. One: the fact
that the vaccine appears not to be ready for use in children is of great
concern for it is children who appear to be at significant risk. Not only
are they in more intimate contact with the ground, as pointed out in the
posting by Hugh-Jones, but their personal grooming is likely to be less
fastidious than with adults and as such increases the chance of disease
transmission by nymphs and adult ticks.
The second concern is the vaccine's safety. If the side effects, of
soreness and swelling at the vaccination site, and joint pain, fatigue, and
fever are transient and mild then this vaccine is not much different than
many other commonly administered vaccines. However the possibility of this
vaccine aggravating immunologically mediated pathology then that is
something which, in my opinion, requires serious investigation.
The last concern that I have comes from my professional position as a
diagnostic laboratory manager. If this vaccine is truly wonderful and if it
generates a relatively safe level of significant protection and if it is
administered to large numbers of individuals then we need to very quickly
re-examine our diagnostic protocols. Currently immunodiagnosis is the best
tool we have for infections with _Borrelia burgdorferi_. However the vast
majority of ELISA screen assays employ a plethora of antigens including, I
believe, the Osp-A antigen. This could then lead to "false positive" screen
results which could presumably only be resolved at the Western Blot level
with vaccinated individuals having only the Osp-A band light up while
others would have a more broadly based immunological response to the
pathogen.
All in all I still feel we have much to celebrate with the advent of these
vaccines and I for one celebrate their arrival albeit with the above listed
caveats.

[Firstly I should point out the caveats expressed were those of the
reviewing committee. I merely pulled the reports off the AP. Secondly, Neal
raises a most important diagnostic point of the possible potential need for
vaccination markers or 'flags'. With many infections one finds that
vaccination and post-exposure titres are different but are they so with
Lyme disease? If we have any members with SmithKline or Pasteur Merieux
Connaught, would they be willing to comment as to whether the need for
vaccination markers has been considered? - Mod.MHJ
