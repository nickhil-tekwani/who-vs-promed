Equine infectious anemia in Ireland: (Disease never reported before
in Ireland).
Information received on 16 Jun 2006 from Dr Patrick J. Rogan, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural
Development, Dublin:
Report date: 16 Jun 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: first occurrence of a listed
disease in a country.
Date of start of the event: 22 May 2006.
Two outbreaks of equine infectious anaemia have been reported in 2
stud farms in Meath county. The affected animals were a mare, which
has died, and a foal in Kilcock and a foal, which has also died, in
Dunshaughlin. The number of animals involved is unconfirmed as yet.
The date of first confirmation of the event was 15 Jun 2006, but the
foal in Dunshaughlin had died on 22 May 2006. The diagnosis has been
made by the Irish Equine Centre using the Coggin's test and the
Central Veterinary Research Laboratory at Backweston in Kildare
county has also found post-mortem results consistent with equine
infectious anaemia.
The source of outbreaks is suspected to be the introduction of new
animals/animal products.
The control measures to be undertaken are:
- modified stamping out;
- screening.

[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) was first reported in the U.K. in
1976. It is probably easier to list the European countries that have
never reported EIA previously (according to OIE): Belgium, Czech
Republic, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Malta, Netherlands, Slovakia and
Switzerland. All these countries should consider themselves lucky
and congratulate themselves on the success of their disease control
tactics, as EIA is not a trivial disease for the horse population. - Mod.PC]
