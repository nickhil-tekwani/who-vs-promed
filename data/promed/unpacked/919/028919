Six patients and an employee at the Kenneth E. Spencer Memorial Home
in Moncton have been infected with salmonellosis in an outbreak that
started 18 Sep 2011 at the facility. A resident has died.

"Someone did die. They did have salmonellosis but at the particular
time they had multiple diagnoses," said Barbara Tremble Cook, the
nursing home's executive director. "So I guess we can't say with
certainty that would have caused their death, but it could have been a
contributing factor."

Cook said the resident received proper assistance. "When they were not
responding to treatment, they were transported to hospital and saw
medical assistance there," she said. She added that the facility's
kitchen has been found clear of any trace of salmonella.

Public health officials continue to monitor the outbreak. The facility
remains open to visitors as the investigation continues. Spencer's is
home to about 200 people and employs about 230 staff.

[The time span of the onset of illnesses in this outbreak caused by an
unknown serotype is not stated to assess whether cases are still
occurring. The elderly represent a significant cohort of those
acquiring salmonellosis because of higher incidence of morbidity and
mortality than other age groups. This is also true with most enteric
bacterial pathogens including _Listeria_ and _E. coli_ O157. Only
shigellosis differs where those less than 5 years of age are at the
highest level. - Mod.LL]
