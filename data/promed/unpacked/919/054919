Avian flu killing Jharkhand crows: virology institute
-----------------------------------------------------
Deaths of crows have been reported in large numbers across Jharkhand
in the past week [last week of November 2011]. Carcasses have been
spotted in Jamshedpur, Bokaro, Hazaribagh, and other areas. Media
reports estimate the number of crow deaths to be between 500 and
1000.

Scientists at National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune have found
the virus to be H5N1. It is a highly pathogenic virus that can even
spread to humans.

Residents report that incidents of crow deaths started surfacing in
the beginning of September [2011]. However, the event captured media
attention only towards the end of November [2011]. Several teams,
including that of the Indian Institute of Veterinary Research (IVRI)
in Bareilly, have collected carcasses and are presently conducting
tests to ascertain the cause of the deaths. The IVRI results are still
awaited. NIV, in the meanwhile, has confirmed the presence of the HN51
virus in the dead crows.

The crows tested negative for Japanese encephalitis or West Nile
virus. M Sharma at IVRI Bareilly says the report will be out in a
couple of days. He says the deaths of crows in such huge numbers have
not been reported before.

MD Dwivedi, bird watcher and researcher at Vinobha Bhave University in
Hazaribagh in Jharkhand, claims he has seen several crows die.
Explaining their symptoms, he says, "It appears the right side of
their body is not working. They seem to have concussion." After
speaking to labourers in the Bokaro steel plant, he concluded there
have been 500 deaths in the region.

[Avian influenza outbreaks in poultry caused by H5N1 highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI) virus were confirmed in a neighboring state,
West Bengal, in August/September 2011 (see ProMED-mail archives 20110909.2747 and 20110923.2882). However, no associated poultry cases
were reported in this episode. Since 2002, a substantial number of
deaths associated with H5N1 HPAI virus infection were reported in
several domestic and wildlife species. This virus strain proved to be
pathogenic to a majority of the species exposed to it, and thus it is
surprising that only crows are reported affected in this die-off. The
results of tests being carried out by IVRI will clarify the situation.
HPAI H5N1 virus is not transmitted from human to human, so an outbreak
in people would depend on the exposure to sick reservoir hosts. -
