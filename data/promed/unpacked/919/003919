Anthrax cases reported in North Dakota county;
ranchers urged to vaccinate cattle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
North Dakota's Agriculture Department on Tuesday
[24 Aug 2010] said more cases of anthrax had been confirmed in cattle.

The new cases were in northeast North Dakota's
Pembina County. Earlier cases were confirmed in
Barnes, Dickey and Sioux counties, all in the
southern half of the state. [For accounts of
these check the 1st 2 reports listed below. MHJ}

State animal health officials are continuing to
urge ranchers to have their cattle vaccinated against the disease.

Anthrax bacteria spores lie dormant in the ground
and become active under conditions such as heavy
rainfall, flooding or drought. North Dakota
usually has a few anthrax cases in cattle every year.

[Pembina is right on the Manitoba boundary and
across the old cattle trails from North Dakota
and Minnesota to Winnipeg, Canada. It has a very
long history of cattle anthrax, certainly back
into the 1920s and probably earlier. The rancher
was asleep and didn't vaccinate his stock this past Easter. Â­ Mod.MHJ]
