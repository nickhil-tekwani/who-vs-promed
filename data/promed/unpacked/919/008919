An outbreak of cholera has killed 35 people and infected more than 1400 others, health authorities in Hoima District have confirmed. The outbreak was 1st reported in Kyangwali Refugee Settlement Camp in February 2018.

Health workers now say it has spread to 4 villages in Kabwooya Sub-county and in some parts of Hoima Municipality. Most of the affected are Congolese refugees. "As of Monday [5 Mar 2018] evening, we had registered 1439 (cholera) cases out of which 35 people have died," Dr Nicholas Kwikiriza, the chairperson of the district cholera taskforce, said.

Last Friday, 2 Mar 2018, 30 new cholera patients were admitted to Sebagoro Health Centre III; 10 cases were registered at Kasonga Isolation Centre, while 2 cases were reported at Hoima Regional Referral Hospital. "We are promoting efforts by people to access sanitation, water and hygiene, but there are some communities that have low pit-latrine coverage," Dr Kwikiriza said. He said the district in partnership with development partners is distributing aqua safe tablets for water purification.

The commissioner for clinical services in the Health ministry, Dr Charles Olaro, in a statement said the Congolese refugees contracted the disease from their country. The Resident District Commissioner, Mr John Stephen Ekoom, said security has heightened surveillance along the Uganda-DR Congo border to ensure that all refugees entering Uganda are screened.

According to the Health ministry, the most affected settlements are Kyangwali and Kyaka II in Hoima and Kyegegwa districts, respectively.

[2] Cholera - Kenya (Tana River county)

The number of people suspected to be infected with cholera in Tana River County has risen to 227, up from 218 last week as the county health personnel continue to investigate the source of infection. Health officers in Tana River County are yet to establish the source of the disease, 40 days since it was 1st reported.

A report by the County public health officer Samuel Jefwa said field investigations to determine the source of the infection had not been done as they have to borrow equipment to test the water. He also said the infection was fast spreading to Charidende, Nanighi, Bokawells and Mulanjo areas. Control units were becoming insufficient as the number of patients grows.

More than 90 people have tested positive for cholera, while 227 are suspected of having the disease. The county referral hospital does not have the capacity to run all the culture tests, and there is unreliable transport for cholera response activities, Mr Jefwa said. He added that some residents were also not cooperating with health officers. The residents are reportedly not giving information on sick people but later complain of neglect and claim that some people have died as a result of cholera.

Some food premises with low hygiene and sanitation standards have been closed and open parties in the county discouraged. Facilities have also been advised to scale up rapid diagnostic tests and laboratory confirmation for new cases. The health officers continue to hold inconsistent outbreak coordination meetings in Bura Sub-County Hospital.

[3] Cholera - Angola (Uige, Cabinda provinces)
Date: Fri 9 Mar 2018
Source: Noticias AO Minuto [machine trans. edited]
https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/970239/surto-de-colera-na-provincia-angolana-ja-afetou-730-pessoas-e-matou-13


An outbreak of cholera in the Angolan province has already affected 730 people and killed 13, and according to a press release sent to Lusa agency, the data refer to the period between the last week of December 2017 and 6 Mar 2018, and in January 2018 alone, a total of 419 cases were reported in the city of Uíge, which resulted in 5 deaths, compared with 209 cases and 2 deaths in February 2018.

In the document, the Angolan Ministry of Health reported that the Inter-ministerial Commission of the Response to Endemic Diseases visited that province in the north of the country to "verify the results of actions and complementary measures" in the fight against the cholera epidemic. The districts most affected by the outbreak, namely, Kakiuia, Ana Candande, Candombe Velho, Candombe Novo and Mbemba Ngango, will be part of the roadmap of the Inter-ministerial Commission, which should also visit the province's drug depot.

In addition to this outbreak in Uíge, cases of cholera in the Angolan province of Cabinda were also confirmed this week, with 1 dead and 13 cases reported, local authorities said. This outbreak is, for now, confined to 3 districts of the city of Cabinda, capital of the province.

In the 2 provinces, there are surveillance teams on the ground working on disinfecting the cacimbas and distributing free tablets for the treatment of water for consumption, also carrying out actions to raise awareness of measures to prevent cholera.

[4] Cholera - Sudan (Central Darfur)
Date: Fri 9 Mar 2018

https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/suspected-cholera-claims-two-more-lives-central-darfur


The spectre of acute watery diarrhea -- suspected to be cholera -- continues to hang over the villages of Nierteti and the western parts of Jebel Marra in Central Darfur. Two more people have died. Fresh reports to reach Radio Dabanga on Thu 8 Mar 2018 say that 2 people died, and 12 others were infected.

A voluntary work activist told Radio Dabanga that 2 people died, and 4 others were infected in the medical isolation centre of Kuweila on Thu 8 Mar 2018. He explained that the total number of cases held at the centre was 20. The isolation centre of Mara received 6 new cases, making the number of cases held at 9 until Thu 8 Mar 2018. The activist said the isolation centre of Nierteti recorded 1 new case and so did the isolation centre of Korifal, pointing out that the total number of cases held at both centres was 7 until Thu 8 Mar 2018.

According to cases reported to this station, the death toll in Nierteti this year [2018] now amounts to at least 22: 18 people were reported to have died from acute watery diarrhoea in Nierteti in February 2018, and 4 people in March 2018 so far.

Acute watery diarrhea is the term the Sudanese authorities and several international organizations use for the disease, of which the spread turned into epidemic proportions last year [2017]. Using WHO pathology standards, doctors and epidemiologists at the time independently confirmed the cases of diarrhea to be cholera.

[5] Cholera - Malawi
Date: Sun 11 Mar 2018

https://malawi24.com/2018/03/11/cholera-death-toll-hits-22/


According to Ministry of Health and Population official Joshua Malango, 3 new cholera cases have been reported in the past few days, taking the number of cases since the start of the outbreak to 731. "So far, cholera has killed 22 people, and the total number of cholera cases has reached 731. 10 cholera patients are in treatment camps, and 3 new cholera cases have been reported," Malango said.

Districts heavily hit by the disease are Karonga, Lilongwe, Salima and Dedza. The cholera outbreak has also hit Rumphi, Dowa, Nkhatabay, Likoma, Nsanje and Mulanje. The Ministry of Health recently attributed the rise in number of deaths to people's delay in seeking medical help in public hospitals. There are also concerns over Malawi's lack of critical national infrastructure to effectively manage waste and the country's failure to end open defecation.

Recently, Area 18 residents in Malawi's capital, Lilongwe, were supplied with sewage-contaminated water by Lilongwe Water Board (LWB), raising concerns that new cases will be recorded in the area.

[6] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Harare)
Date: Fri 9 Mar 2018

http://allafrica.com/stories/201803090667.html


A single case of cholera has been confirmed in Harare, barely a month after 5 people succumbed to the disease in Chegutu. A 12-year-old girl was treated at a clinic in Waterfalls on Tuesday, 6 Mar 2018.

In an interview with The Herald yesterday [8 Mar 2018], Health and Child Care permanent secretary Dr Gerald Gwinji said Government has since confirmed that the girl was suffering from cholera. "Our laboratory tests have since confirmed that the girl was suffering from cholera. We have since begun contact tracing in case there could be other people who could have gotten into contact with this girl before she received treatment, as well as taking her history to try and establish the possible source of the disease," said Dr Gwinji.

He said the latest case raises more worries for the ministry, as the rains create a conducive environment for the spread of the disease.

Harare has of late been battling diseases such as cholera and typhoid, with high-density suburbs such as Mbare being the most affected.

[Harare (officially called Salisbury until 1982) is the capital and most populous city of Zimbabwe. Situated in the northeast of the country in the heart of historic Mashonaland, it can be found on a map at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare.

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
