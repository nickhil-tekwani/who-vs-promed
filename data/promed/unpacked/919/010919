One suspected case of polio reported in Bihar under investigation
---------------------------------------------
One suspected case of poliovirus has been reported in Darbhanga district of Bihar. The case is under detailed investigation. As a measure of abundant precaution, an immunization drive is being carried out in 28 districts of Bihar early next week [week of 15 Oct 2012].

The case is suspected to be of wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3). Bihar has not had any case of WPV3 since January 2010. India has been polio free since [13 Jan 2011]. The WPV3 strain is prevalent in Nigeria and Pakistan.

Further information will be shared when the results of the full investigations are available.

[Given the official source of the information above -- the Government of India Press Bureau -- and the additional information that a wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) is suspected, it is highly likely that this case will be confirmed as a WPV3-associated case of poliomyelitis. As the press release notes, India has not had a confirmed case of WPV associated polio since 13 Jan 2011, 21 months ago. India had been removed from the list of polio-endemic countries earlier this year (2012), and was headed toward a polio-free status if there were no reports of WPV associated disease for 3 consecutive years.

Of note is that WPV3 has not been reported in Bihar for almost 3 years (last report January 2010). The mention that the WPV3 strain is prevalent in Nigeria and Pakistan, both still classified as polio-endemic countries, is most likely a prelude to the genetic studies on this WPV3 isolate to determine the most likely origin of this virus. If found to be a recently imported WPV3 from either one of these countries, this case may not be counted as an indigenous case, but rather a recent importation from a known polio-endemic area. Of note, during the period 1 Jan 2012 to 3 Oct 2012 there have been 17 cases of WPV3 identified in Nigeria and 3 cases of WPV3 identified in Pakistan (one of which was a mixed infection with both WPV1 and WPV3 identified)(see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx). The date of most recent onset of WPV3 associated polio was 12 Aug 2012 in Nigeria and 18 Apr 2012 in Pakistan (see http://www.polioeradication.org/Portals/0/Document/Data&Monitoring/Wild_poliovirus_list_2007_2012_02Oct.pdf).

For a map of India showing states and neighboring countries, see http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/indiastateandunion.htm. Bihar is located in the north eastern part of India bordering with Nepal and near to the border with Bangladesh, whereas Pakistan is on the west of India, bordering with the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Jammu and Kashmir, about 1000 miles [1600 km] away. For a map of districts of Bihar, see http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/bihar/bihar-district.htm. Darbhanga district is located on the border with Nepal. For the HealthMap/ProMED map showing Bihar state in India, see http://healthmap.org/r/1*O9.

More information on the genetic profile of the WPV3 identified would be greatly appreciated when available. - Mod.MPP]
