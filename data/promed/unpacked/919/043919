[Impression: WPV1 is still circulating in Afghanistan and Pakistan as evidenced by the positive environmental samples identified this week, 3 in each of the countries and involving 2 provinces in Afghanistan (Nangarhar and Hilmand) and 3 of the 4 provinces in Pakistan (Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa tribal districts, and Sindh). As for the cVDPVs, activity appears to be quiet in all countries discussed above with the exception of Nigeria, where a case associated with a cVDPV2 infection was confirmed in Ogun state.

In searching for when the last case of polio was reported from Ogun state, I found a media report from May 2017 stating it had been 8 years since the last case of polio reported in Ogun state (https://punchng.com/ogun-polio-free-for-eight-straight-year-govt/). That being said, checking the weekly epidemiologic reports from the Nigerian CDC, when AFP surveillance is presented, I find it always concludes with no cases of polio confirmed, presumably referring to cases of WPV1 and not the cVDPV2 cases (https://ncdc.gov.ng/reports/181/2019-march-week-13). The AFENET (African Field Epidemiology Network) website has a report on the outbreak response to the cVDPV2 outbreaks in Northern Nigeria dated in January 2019 (http://www.afenet.net/index.php/news/news/478-outbreak-response-of-circulating-vaccine-derived-polio-virus-in-northern-nigeria). In the absence of additional official information, I'm speculating that the occurrence of this case may be related to either the positive environmental samples identified in Lagos, or the known cases previously confirmed in Kwara state to its north, although travel to or from the northern states where known transmission had been ongoing may also be a relatively direct route of arrival of the cVDPV2.

A map of Nigeria showing states can be found at https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/. Note that Ogun state borders with Lagos to its south, although Imeko Afrun LGA (local government authority) is further north and borders with Benin. Of note is that Imeko Afun LGA is 174.6 km (108.5 mi) northwest of Lagos and shares a western border with Benin.

[2] Pakistan, sewage sampling
Date: Thu 18 Apr 2019
Source: Gulf News [edited]
https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/polio-virus-detected-from-sewage-in-12-pakistani-cities-1.63411519


The extensive environmental surveillance established by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme has detected the poliovirus in sewage of 12 cities. According to result shared by the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), the presence of virus was confirmed in sewage samples collected in March 2019 from cities of Peshawar, Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi, Mardan, Bannu, Waziristan, Hyderabad, Kambar, and Sukkur.

Considering the associated risks, the country programme has urged parents to ensure immunisation of all children during every polio campaign.

The sewage water samples are collected on a monthly basis from 59 sampling sites across the country. The criteria of sample selection included population size, socioeconomic status, and a functioning sewage system. These samples are collected under the supervision of relevant provincial health departments and tested by the state-of-the-art Regional Polio Reference Laboratory housed at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad.

The genetic sequencing further guides the programme in undertaking requisite response activities.

The persistent poliovirus circulation in a given area represents the existence of under-immunised children who miss vaccination in routine and the door-to-door polio campaigns due to any reason. These missed children pose a risk for themselves as well as other children around them by shedding the virus to the sewage.

The prime minister's focal person on polio eradication Babar Bin Atta said, "The country has the best opportunity to stop transmission of poliovirus, and it's time to gear up our support to the brave frontline workers, enabling them to reach and vaccinate every child."

He said, "Presence of virus anywhere is a threat for vulnerable children. The continuous population movement to and from many of these metropolises pose a real risk to the children elsewhere as well. I can't emphasise enough how critically important it is to ensure that each and every child is vaccinated during the upcoming polio campaign in the month of April [2019]."

He said the 2nd nationwide polio vaccination campaign of 2019 will start across the country on [22 Apr 2019].

During this campaign, a total of 260 000 frontline workers will go door-to-door across all provinces and towns to ensure more than 39 million children receive 2 drops of the polio vaccine, which will protect them against the poliovirus. He said that polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of 10 years. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death.

While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease. Each time a child under the age of 5 is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased.

He said repeated immunisation have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries in the world to become polio-free.
