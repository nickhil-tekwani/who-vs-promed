This fall, equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) spread among patients in the
veterinary hospital at Colorado State University (CSU), despite the
fact the school runs one of the nation's top veterinary biosecurity
programs. The finding forced 20 hospitalized horses into a
quarantine, which is expected to be lifted 17 Nov 2006.
The outbreak apparently began after hospital staff admitted a
critically ill and partially paralyzed horse on 23 Oct 2006. Because
EHV-1 was suspected, the horse was isolated from the hospital
population and managed with increased biosecurity precautions. Lab
tests did not confirm the diagnosis for 10 days, but in the interim,
2 horses hospitalized for other reasons developed unexplained fevers.
When those horses tested positive for EHV-1, the CSU large animal
hospital officials immediately elected to quarantine all equine
patients. In total, 5 hospitalized horses have been confirmed to be
infected with EHV-1 after admission of the paralyzed horse. Four
horses had mild fevers, and one developed mild neurologic signs that
are improving. Since 31 Oct 2006, the Veterinary Teaching Hospital
has been accepting emergency patients only, and its staff has been
treating them in isolation from the quarantined horses.
"We were surprised," admitted Paul S. Morley, DVM, PhD, director of
biosecurity at CSU. "We have a strong biosecurity program to prevent
incidents like this, and we did not expect it to occur."
Morley noted that it was possible the EHV-1 was not transmitted by
the initial patient, but from another horse admitted to the hospital
for a different reason. All horses carry the virus, and they can shed
it when stressed by illness or other conditions, so all horses can be
a potential source of the virus. Morley explained that the vast
majority of horses never show signs of illness, especially after they
are 2 years old. "Regardless of how the virus was introduced, we
believed it was critical for us to act decisively to protect our
patients," said Morley.
Equine herpesvirus can spread through direct contact or through the
air, making it a concern where groups of horses are stabled. Race
horses at Monmouth Park in New Jersey also were quarantined this
October due to 4 horses testing positive for EHV-1, and patients at
the Mid-Atlantic Veterinary Clinic in Ringoes, N.J. were quarantined
after one horse tested positive in November.
Morley explained that only rarely does EHV-1 cause serious outcomes
such as neurologic signs (including the inability to control the hind
limbs or tail and urinary problems) or late-term abortions in mares.
Most horses that show signs of illness have unexplained fever or
nasal discharge -- clinical signs that are indistinguishable from
influenza. Special testing is required to definitively diagnose EHV
infections through virus culture of blood or nasal secretions, PCR (a
DNA test of blood or nasal secretions), or serology (antibody titers).
Morley cautioned horse owners against overreacting, because most
infected horses recover fully with supportive care (antiviral
medications might help). Infected and exposed horses should be
isolated, and horses that have come in contact with them should be
quarantined and monitored for fever. Horse owners should consult
their veterinarians for expert advice on control and prevention of
EHV.
"It is very likely that this is not an increase in the occurrence of
EHV we are experiencing, but an increase of discovery," noted Morley.
"We are more aware of the signs now, and we are watching more
closely, so we are diagnosing EHV more often."

[Although EHV-1 (Equine herpesvirus) often occurs in transient
populations, such as race horses moving from track to track, it is
equally possible that a horse in a hospital is stressed. This stress
to the system causes outbreaks of this disease, which is very
infectious and easily spread.- Mod.TG]

Prompt diagnoses and quarantines appear to have contained an outbreak
of equine herpes virus among thoroughbreds in New Jersey, according
to state officials and a Ringoes veterinarian treating a racehorse
exposed to the potentially deadly illness.
Animals have been quarantined at Monmouth Park and the Meadowlands
after possible exposure to an infected horse in October 2006. But one
thoroughbred had been sent from Monmouth Park to Mid-Atlantic Equine
Medical Center, Delaware Township, for unrelated surgery on 21 Oct
2006, before the outbreak.
"He initially tested negative, but then a week later he tested
positive," said Peter Bousum, a co-owner and manager of the animal
hospital. In the interval, officials at Monmouth Park discovered the
horse had been exposed to an infected animal.
In late October 2006, racetrack officials found 16 horses tested
positive for the virus. One had a fever, and another showed signs of
neurological problems, said Jeff Beach, spokesman for the agriculture
department. On 27 October, all were quarantined, as were another 80
horses that had been housed in barns with them, he said.
Horses shipped to the Meadowlands after the close of the Monmouth
season also have been quarantined, but have not shown signs of
illness, Beach said.
Strains of the equine herpes virus vary widely in severity. It does
not affect humans, and it is transmitted through contact between
horses, similar to a human cold. Some cause respiratory problems,
especially in young horses, or spontaneous abortions in pregnant
mares. A neurological form causes staggering and kills many affected
animals. But some types are no worse than a mild cold, and many
exposed animals remain healthy.
Although the positive test showed the Ringoes horse had developed
antibodies against the disease, Bousum said that as of yesterday,
"He's doing fine. He has no symptoms at this point; he never showed
any symptoms."
The Ringoes horse, a 5-year-old thoroughbred, needed emergency
abdominal surgery for colic. While at the hospital, it came into
contact with 4 other horses, Beach said. Two were still there when
Monmouth Park put out an alert, he said. One animal had died of an
unrelated cause, and one had been sent to a rehabilitation center,
Beach said.
"We have the universe of horses that came into contact with them
corralled, so to speak," Beach said, adding many could be released as
early as today following negative tests.
The situation still was unsettling, Bousum said, because the cases he
has seen have been "few and far between" and never where a horse had
tested negative. The virus more often turns up among "transient
populations," such as at racetracks, he said, noting the first
Monmouth case was a horse from Canada.
In the past decade, "we've learned a lot more about the disease and
its epidemiology," Bousum said. "Now, the diagnosis is done through
DNA," without waiting for symptoms, he said. Mid-Atlantic personnel
already take measures to prevent infection, such as spraying barns
with anti-viral aerosols, he said.
But racehorses likely will remain quarantined at Monmouth Park until
early December 2006, said John Heims, the racetrack's spokesman.
While the incubation period for the virus is typically 2 to 10 days,
and the December time frame "will be at least 30 days that all the
potentially affected horses have been segregated," he said.
State veterinarian Nancy Halpern said the measures are warranted
because New Jersey's equine industry "accounts for millions of
dollars in economic activity."

[Clearly when the incubation period is 2-10 days, the NJ officials
are acting out of extreme caution to protect their state's industry.
Also since this disease most often affects populations of horses that
move frequently, the extreme caution will help prevent the disease
from spreading, except for the one horse in the NJ hospital. - Mod.TG]
