Viral meningitis in adults in Marseille and south eastern France:
involvement of enteroviruses and Toscana virus
-----------------------------------------------
I would like to add some information relating to the occurrence of viral
meningitis that has been observed in adults in the South of France,
especially in Marseille. As in numerous towns of France, most of the cases
we had to treat could be attributed to enterovirus infection (on the basis
of positive PCR tests for enterovirus in cerebrospinal fluid).
But I would like to add that we also identified a few cases of severe
lymphocytic meningitis during August 2005 that were due to autochthonous
Toscana virus infection (on the basis of seroconversion). All patients
reported having stayed in the Marseille region, especially in the
surrounding towns below the hills.
To date, there are no published entomological data to explain the emergence
of this arboviral infection in this area. This diagnosis should be
considered particularly in the case of patients with lymphocytic meningitis
or encephalitis when they have stayed or traveled in this part of
southeastern France in summer, when headache is very painful and resistant
to painkillers, or when the total number of lymphocytes is high (>100) in
cerebrospinal fluid.

[Toscana virus is a phlebovirus -- that is, it belongs to the genus
_Phlebovvirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_ -- and is classified as a
member of the _Sandfly fever Naples virus_ species. These are viruses that
are transmitted by sandflies (_Phlebotomus pernicious_). Toscana virus was
isolated initially from sandflies in the Tuscany region of Italy and was
subsequently shown to be associated with cases of aseptic meningitis
occurring during summer. Serological surveys have indicated that Toscana
virus infection is prevalent in other parts of southern Europe, although
its clinical importance is unknown. Dr Simon's observations are
particularly relevant in this respect. - Mod.CP]
