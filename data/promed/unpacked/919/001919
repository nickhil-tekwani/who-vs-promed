Isolated blight outbreaks rising
--------------------------
Recent thundery weather has lead to further development of potato
late blight [PLB] in some areas, according to latest British Potato
Council (BPC) reports. In the past week (w/e June 27) there have
been a further 6 outbreaks confirmed in England and Wales, plus one
more in Scotland, although overall blight incidence remains below
2004, experts said.

High humidity, high nighttime temperatures, and showers have given a
flush of Smith Periods [see moderator comment below] in the
Southwest, southern England, coastal Wales and parts of northern
England, said Nick Bradshaw of ADAS.

"A feature of all the crop outbreaks is that they are described as
'scattered infections throughout the crop'. This strongly indicates
the presence of a source of sprouting material somewhere in the
vicinity of these outbreaks."

With wetter weather forecast, which will encourage the disease,
growers should maintain robust spray programmes and maintain short
intervals while crops are going through rapid haulm growth, he said
[haulm is the stem or top of a cultivated plant].

Crops not sprayed sufficiently during rapid haulm growth are more
likely to be infected later in the growing season when the risk
increases, added the Scottish Agricultural College's Ruairidh Bain.

According to Bain, it is vital to remember that blight risk can be
very localised. "What matters is the risk status where crops are and
therefore access to good local information is important."

[Potato late blight [PLB], caused by _Phytophthora infestans_, is one
of the most devastating plant diseases. Managing potato crops
involves forecasting for PLB, which depends upon the probability of
weather conditions that will favour PLB and assumes the existence
somewhere in the area of a primary source of infection; the actual
level of inoculum present at any time is unknown. Many spraying
decisions will be made in the light of -- and before the onset of --
deteriorating weather. The Smith Period is used to identify periods
of high risk of disease spread, i.e., when the temperature and
humidity favour blight. Smith Periods are defined as: 2 consecutive
24-hour periods in which the minimum temperature is 10 C or above and
in each of which there are at least 11 hours with a relative humidity
above 90 percent. In practise, the occurrence of a Smith Period
provides a wake-up call.

Management of PLB has traditionally relied on copper, which is a
broad-spectrum fungicide which protects against disease. It has been
superseded by modern systemic fungicides, such as metalaxyl and
furalaxyl. However, PLB overcame these plants because new strains
(physiologic races) developed. New cultivars were developed that have
"polygenic" or "field" resistance to the PLB pathogen. Combinations
of several "minor" genes, none of which gives absolute resistance,
are now used, and together they impede the rate of fungal development
and enable the plant to tolerate infection.
