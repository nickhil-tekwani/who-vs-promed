China Announces New Bird Flu Death: WHO Concerns
-----------------------------------------------
Chinese authorities announced another human case of H5N1 avian flu on
Sun 5 Mar 2006, a man from the southern Chinese province of
Guangdong, who fell ill 22 Feb 2006 and died 2 Mar 2006 [see also:
Avian influenza, human - worldwide (22): China, Indonesia
20060304.0706, and part (2) below]. The case came to light amid
warnings from the World Health Organization that other human cases
may be going undetected in the world's most populous country. In an
interview from Beijing, the WHO's senior person in China paused when
asked whether he felt there was more human disease in the country
than Chinese authorities are admitting. "It's very conceivable that
there are more cases," said Dr. Henk Bekedam, the WHO's
representative for China. "But we do not have the impression, at
least from the central ministry, that they are hiding information
from the outside world." Rather, Dr. Bekedam said he believes China
has a "capacity problem" in terms of its ability to conduct
surveillance for infection in birds and detect all human cases,
particularly those in which the virus triggers milder disease.
The man's case was reported on Hong Kong's Cable TV by Zhong Nanshan,
Director of the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases and
confirmed by China's Ministry of Health in Beijing, according to the
Xinhua news agency. When suspected human cases have cropped up in
other countries, the WHO has required testing by a external
laboratory before it officially confirms a case. But to date, China
has not agreed to send out its specimens for independent testing. And
the WHO has accepted positive tests from China as confirmation of
H5N1 infection. Many outside the country are skeptical of whether
China is reporting the full extent of its H5N1 avian influenza
disease problem. The country's deeply engrained tradition of secrecy
-- evidenced by its attempts to cover up the emergence of SARS in
2003 -- is fuelling a belief that China's problems are more extensive
than the country is willing to admit. There are also suspicions that
Chinese officials choose strategic moments at which to announce new
cases. Last weekend, when world media attention was focused on the
discovery of Europe's 1st outbreak of H5N1 in domestic poultry -- at
a turkey farm in Ain, France -- Chinese authorities announced 2
additional human cases. They became a footnote to the coverage of
Europe's spreading H5N1 problem.
"I'm very much aware about the sentiments about China," Dr. Bekedam
said when asked whether he shares the suspicion. But he said he
believes that if the country is under reporting it is because central
authorities don't have a full picture of the problem in China's
diverse regions. "There are some challenges in a big country like
China," Dr. Bekedam said. "But our sense is when the central Ministry
of Health knows about it and when they have done their confirmation
test, that we are being informed." Dr. Bekedam said he meets
regularly with officials of the Health Ministry, who assure him they
are determined to improve the speed at which they detect human cases.
"It's a very clear objective of the ministry."
Unlike other jurisdictions, where suspected human cases are quickly
reported -- and often just as quickly dismissed -- Chinese
authorities do not report until confirmatory testing is completed.
Dr. Bekedam said the WHO doesn't object to that system, so long as
there are no hints of human-to-human transmission among the people
being investigated. "As long as you're talking about sporadic cases,
we have no problem that you inform us at the moment that they have
been properly confirmed," he said he has told Chinese authorities.
"But if there are other close contacts who are also sick, then we
would like to be informed. And we need to be informed."
Clusters of cases could signify that the H5N1 virus is mutating in
ways that allow it to more easily jump to and between people. If the
virus acquires the ability to move readily from person to person, it
is believed it would trigger the world's 1st flu pandemic since the
Hong Kong flu of 1968.
Dr. Bekedam said a worrisome feature of China's problem is that the
massive die-offs of domestic poultry that typically alert authorities
to the presence of H5N1 have dwindled off in China. Widespread use of
poultry vaccines may be masking the virus's presence, he said.
Vaccinated poultry can acquire and shed the H5N1 virus, perpetuating
a sort of low level or invisible spread of virus in a region. "So
somehow the animal surveillance system is not picking up the sick
poultry. And that is of concern," Dr. Bekedam said. He noted that
none of China's 14 human cases -- Sunday's [5 Mar 2006] announcement
would make that 15 -- were from areas where outbreaks in poultry had
been reported. Investigation after the fact uncovered evidence of
sick birds in at least 8 of the cases.
Recent statements from Chinese officials lay the blame for the
virus's spread on infected migratory birds. On Friday [3 Mar 2006],
the country's Vice-Premier Hui Liangyu warned that when the spring
migration begins, poultry outbreaks and human cases could soar in
China. Dr. Bekedam suggested his Chinese counterparts may be focusing
too much attention on the wrong facet of the problem. "We ... still
feel that there has been a relative over-emphasis on what's happening
up in the air," he said. "We do believe that China ... has also still
a major threat on the ground over here, meaning that I think the
virus is endemic in many parts of China."

China: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 6
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in China has reported an additional laboratory
confirmed case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza
virus. The case occurred in a 32-year-old man from the southern
province of Guangdong. He developed symptoms of fever on 22 Feb 2006
followed by pneumonia. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and he
died on 2 Mar 2006. He was unemployed. No outbreaks in poultry have
been reported in Guangdong Province since 2004. The newly confirmed
case is the 1st [human case] reported from Guangdong Province.
To date, China has reported 15 laboratory confirmed cases. Of these,
9 have been fatal. 2 patients remain in critical condition.
