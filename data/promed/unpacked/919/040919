The incidence of dengue fever is expected to reach its highest level in 40
years this year, affecting some 300,000 persons, the Ministry of Public
Health warned yesterday. Changes in climate as a result of the global
warming effects of El Nino and inadequate preventive measures are blamed,
according to Public Health Minister Rakkiat Sukthana.  Usually dengue fever
occurs only during the monsoon season, but since last year it has been
escalating through the cool and hot seasons, he said.
In the first three months of this year, the illness has taken 31 lives and
affected 10,197 patients, a threefold increase over the previous year when
it took eight lives and affected 3,280 patients.  According to Epidemiology
Division statistics, nearly 100,000 cases were reported in 1997, compared
to 38,000 cases in 1996.  Recent cases have been occurring more among older
children than among small children of below five years.  Reports of
patients treated in state hospitals show that 70-75 percent of patients
with dengue fever are between 5 and 14 years of age.  Since dengue fever
previously occurred among young children, its diagnosis on older children
is often slow, leading to severity which often leads to shock and death,
said Supachai Rerkngam, an expert at the Communicable Diseases Control
Department.  He said most doctors tend to overlook the possible occurrence
of dengue fever among older children or young adults and often suspect them
of being infected with other illnesses.  "By the time they (doctors)
finally find out that their patient is suffering from dengue fever, they
(the patient) may have already reached a critical condition," said Dr
Supachai.  Studies are being carried out to find out the cause of infection
among older children, he said.
Deputy Permanent Secretary of Health Vinai Viriyakijja said that since most
infections occur in schools and communities, a mass campaign to destroy
mosquitoes and sources of their breeding will be launched between June 15
and 19 in 800 districts throughout the country.  He said if nothing is done
to destroy the sources of infection, the ministry will not have sufficient
budget to take care of increased cases of dengue fever, whose treatment
costs 3,000 baht per case.  Each district will be provided with a campaign
budget of 10,000 baht, in addition to abated sand [granular Abate?, a
chemical which is mixed with water.  Meanwhile, the Medical Services
Department is working on testing the use of a bacteria found in the soil,
which when added to water wards off mosquitoes and is not harmful to
humans, said Mr Rakkiat. Without naming the bacteria, the side-effects of
its use are being tested, after which, if proven successful, it will
replace the use of abated sand.
