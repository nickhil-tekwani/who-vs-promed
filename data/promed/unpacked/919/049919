Deaths from CCHF in Tajikistan (Gursunzadevskiy Region)
-------------------------------------------------------
A total of 3 people out of 5 infected with CCHF virus died in the
Gursunzadevskiy Region (which borders on the Uzunskiy Region of the
Surkhandaryinskiy Oblast in Tajikistan). A report from Ministry of Health
Care says that 26 people have been hospitalized and are under medical
supervision on of CCHF virus infection in the Gursunzadevckiy Region. The
minister of health care of Tajikistan, Nusratullo Salimov, with his working
group went to the Tursunzadevskiy District in this connection on 6 Aug
2009. Anti-epidemic activities are being carried out and educatioal
literature is being disseminated among the local population.

The Ministry of Health recommends seeking immediate medical care in the
case of 1st symptoms of this disease to prevent fatalities (symptoms such
as high temperature up to 40 degrees Celsius [104 deg F], fatigue, pain in
muscles and joints). Hemorrhagic fever takes a very severe course because
of blood clotting problems. At the peak of the disease process nasal,
gastrointestinal, uterine, and other bleeding occurs.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in Tajikistan
----------------------------------------------
On 7 Aug 2009, the Ministry of Health of Tajikistan informed the WHO
Country Office, Tajikistan, about a cluster of 5 confirmed cases of
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the Tursunzoda District, 50 km
[31 miles] west of the capital Dushanbe. The Tajik Research Centre of
Preventive Medicine, in Dushanbe, used serological methods to make a
preliminary laboratory diagnosis of CCHF virus infection.

The index case, a 50 year old man from Ziyoratut village, Tursunzoda
District, presented with symptoms on 18 Jul 2009 and died on 26 Jul 2009. A
total of 4 of his close contacts, 3 relatives and one health care worker,
later presented with symptoms compatible with CCHF virus infection. 2 of
the relatives, including a pregnant woman, are currently in hospital in a
stable condition. The health care worker and the 3rd relative involved in
the burial of the index case died on 6 and 5 Aug 2009, respectively. A
total of 44 individuals identified as contacts, including 24 health care
workers, are being monitored.

On 11 Aug 2009, an additional case of CCHF virus infection was confirmed in
a 42 year old man from Kulyab, south western Tajikistan. 14 close contacts
are currently under medical observation.

WHO has sent a team of 3 experts in infectious diseases and infection
control to help the national authorities assess and investigate the cluster
in Tursunzoda District, to advise and assist with case management and
infection control, to deliver hands-on infection control training to health
care workers in districts where CCHF is endemic, and to advise the national
health authorities on the development of a medium-term national
intersectoral strategy for CCHF control. In addition, the WHO is deploying
personal protective equipment from a global stockpile and assisting with
the procurement of the antiviral drug ribavirin.

CCHF is a tickborne disease caused by a virus belonging to the _Nairovirus_
genus [of the family _Bunyaviiridae]. It is endemic in many countries of
Africa, Asia and Europe, including Tajikistan. Humans infected with CCHF
acquire the virus through tick bites, or through direct contact with blood
or other infected tissues from livestock or humans. The onset of symptoms
is sudden, with fever, myalgia (aching muscles), dizziness, neck pain and
stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes, and photophobia (sensitivity to
light). Nausea, vomiting, and a sore throat may occur early on, accompanied
by diarrhoea and generalized abdominal pain. Over the next few days, the
patient may experience sharp mood swings, and may become confused and
aggressive. After 2 to 4 days, this agitation may be replaced by
sleepiness, depression, and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize
to the right upper quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver
enlargement). Mortality from CCHF is about 30 per cent, with death
occurring in the 2nd week of illness. Those patients who recover generally
begin to improve on the 9th or 10th day from the onset of illness.

The HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Tajikistan of is available at
<http://healthmap.org/r/00Fa>. The Tursunzoda District is the westernmost
district of Tajikistan, bordering on Uzbekistan in the west and enclosed by
Tajikistan's Shahrinaw district from the other directions. The Tursunzoda
District is a major grower of rice and cotton in Tajikistan. CCHF virus
infection is more usually associated with livestock rearing areas. - Mod.CP]
