The number of hepatitis E cases in South Darfur and Blue Nile states of Sudan has risen to more than 700 confirmed cases. Almost half of the reported cases were identified in South Darfur's Kalma camp for the displaced. In Blue Nile state, more than 80 cases have been reported, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan reports in its latest weekly bulletin released today, 25 Sep 2014.

According to the WHO, as of 17 Sep 2014, a total of 84 hepatitis E cases, with 3 deaths, have been reported in the area of Madina 10, Geissan locality, Blue Nile state. The actual number of people infected with the hepatitis virus may be much higher, as this is an area with a large population and most of the cases go unreported as people make use of traditional treatments.

In response, the Blue Nile state's Ministry of Health, with the support of Unicef, and the government's Water and Sanitation Department, is implementing controlling measures including active case searching, soap and chlorine tablet distribution, as well as health education and community awareness activities. WHO is supporting the Health Ministry in coordination, surveillance, active case finding, appropriate case management, and water quality monitoring and testing.

According to WHO, 628 people are suffering from hepatitis E in South Darfur. The number of patients in El Salam and Kalma camps is gradually declining, owing to treatment by humanitarian organisations. Cases have increased, however, in El Sareif camp, Nyala locality, during the last 3 weeks, OCHA reported.

Apart from treatment, humanitarian organizations have organised health education activities focusing on preventative measures. Jerry cans, soap and hygiene kits have been distributed, water points and storage containers were cleaned, new latrines constructed, the water quality tested, and infected water points disinfected.

The humanitarian organizations operating in South Darfur still face challenges and constraints, including insufficient ground water supplies and a lack of funding. There is also a significant shortage in the number of latrines available for use. Oxfam-USA has constructed 100 new latrines; however, this is well short of the 2000 latrines required.

[Both South Darfur and Blue Nile states are in southern Sudan bordering the nation of South Sudan, where hepatitis E is also occurring.

The following discussion (with the citations removed) regarding various strains is from Kamar N, Bendall R, Florence Legrand-Abravanel F, et al: Hepatitis E. Lancet 2012;379: 2477-2488:

"Molecular characterization of various HEV [hepatitis E virus] strains circulating among human beings and animals has led to the recognition of 4 major genotypes, representing a single serotype. HEV1 and HEV2 are restricted to human beings and transmitted via contaminated water in developing countries. HEV1 occurs mainly in Asia, and HEV2 in Africa and Mexico. HEV3 and HEV4 infect human beings, pigs, and other mammalian species and are responsible for sporadic cases of autochthonous hepatitis E in both developing and developed countries. HEV3 has a worldwide distribution. By contrast, HEV4 mostly occurs in southeast Asia, but has recently been isolated in European pigs. Although HEV3 and HEV4 infections have been linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked pork or game meat, the full range of species that are reservoirs for HEV is still unknown. On the basis of full-length genome-sequence analyses, HEV genotypes have recently been characterized in rats in Germany, wild boars in Japan, and farmed rabbits in China. HEV1 can be classified into 5 subgenotypes, HEV2 into 2, HEV3 into 3, and HEV4 into 7. Phylogenetic analyses show that HEV subgenotypes circulating in human beings and animals in the same area are closely related, supporting zoonotic transmission. Studies of the evolutionary history and population dynamics of HEV show that HEV has evolved through a series of steps, in which the ancestors of HEV might have adapted to a succession of animal hosts leading to human beings."

Although generally considered to cause only acute infection, the review article also discusses chronic hepatitis E, which is defined by persisting HEV RNA in serum or stools for 6 months or more, in immunosuppressed patients. Most cases have occurred in solid-organ-transplant recipients. Additionally, a few cases have been reported in individuals with HIV and patients with hematological disorders receiving chemotherapy. Chronic infection with HEV1 or HEV2 has not been reported. - Mod.LL
