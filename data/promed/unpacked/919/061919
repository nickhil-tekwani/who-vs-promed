Despite the fumigation of Ette, and Umuopu communities in Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area [LGA] of Enugu State against yellow fever by the state government and the ongoing immunisation against the disease at some local government areas in the state, the death toll has hit 133. About 57 victims lost their lives in Ette, and Umuopu communities initially before both the federal and state governments flooded the areas with yellow fever vaccines.

In the last 2 weeks, health workers had been working round the clock to curtail the spread of the disease to other communities. However, reports indicated that 21 persons died of the disease in Isiugwu community within the last 2 weeks while about 10 died at Umuopu again on Tuesday [24 Nov 2020], just as 2 others died on Wednesday [25 Nov 2020]. At the Aji Community, 4 persons died while several others reportedly died at Okpo and Igogoro communities among other communities in the council area. Health officials were said to have been moved to Isiugwu community for mass vaccination when Vanguard visited the council area for official comments on the issue. However, a health officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that it takes about 10 days for the vaccines to start working on anybody, adding that those who had been vaccinated could still die if they were already infected before being vaccinated because of the period of time it takes for the vaccine to become effective.

He added that altogether, the council area has lost at least 75 persons within the last 2 weeks. While reacting to the development, the council boss, Ejike Itodo said he has engaged relevant stakeholders for aggressive sensitisation and enlightenment of the people of the council area on the disease outbreak. He further said that the residents of the affected communities are turning out en masse to be vaccinated. While urging the people to pray against the disease, he said he has also directed that anyone who presents any form of symptom be conveyed to the general hospital at the council headquarters for adequate medicare. It was gathered that a young pharmacist, CE, was among the victims who died at Isiugwu community.

Some residents who spoke to Vanguard, including CO, and OE, expressed fear as the death toll keeps soaring. According to relations of some of the victims, the symptoms start with weakness of the body, pains, heaviness of the heart, before vomiting of blood, and eventual death. Recall that at least 27 cows also died mysteriously across some communities in the local government last week [week of 16 Nov 2020]. Meanwhile, all efforts to speak with the Enugu State Commissioner for Health, Dr Emmanuel Ikechukwu Obi, and the state's Epidemiologist, Dr Chinyere Ezeudu, on the soaring death toll proved abortive as they neither picked calls put through to their phone lines nor responded to text messages. Yellow fever is caused by a _Flavivirus_. It is an acute, systemic disease, meaning that it starts suddenly, and it affects the whole body. The virus is transmitted by mosquitos, mainly the _Aedes_ [in Africa and South America] and _Haemagogus_ species [in South America].

[The increase in yellow fever (YF) cases in number and geographic distribution in Nigeria is of concern. In addition to Enugu, Delta, Benue, and Bauchi states, there has been a PCR positive sample for YF reported from Ohaukwu LGA in Ebonyi State. This LGA has also been the location of a cluster of probable YF cases that were IgM positive at the national reference laboratory and had dates of onset July-August 2020. Security challenges in the LGA had hindered full investigation and work-up at the time of initial notification (https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/disease-outbreak-news-yellow-fever-nigeria-24-november-2020).

The vaccination efforts mentioned in the report above are a positive indication that both health officials and the public are taking this outbreak seriously and acting to halt transmission of the virus. One hopes that these efforts, including intensification of surveillance, can be aggressive enough to bring the numbers of new cases down and interrupt the chain of transmission. - Mod.TY
