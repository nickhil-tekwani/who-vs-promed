Health officials say a Louisville woman has tested positive for tularemia, the 2nd human case of "rabbit fever" in Boulder County in 2014.

Boulder County Public Health officials say the woman was exposed to a dead rabbit while she was walking her dog in an open space in Louisville. The woman said her dog picked up the rabbit and while she was trying to get it out of the dog's mouth, it may have touched a small cut on her knee.

The Daily Camera reported Wed 17 Sep 2014 (http://bit.ly/YTE6m6) that she was hospitalized but is now recovering at home.

Statewide, 9 people and 19 animals have tested positive for the disease this year [2014].

[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter. Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can be infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are important in its ecology.

Humans become infected through a variety of mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type of exposure will dictate the form of the disease manifestation with cutaneous exposures usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms.

The type of disease in this case is not stated but is likely to be ulceroglanular in the inguinal area as the possible contact point was the knee. - Mod.LL
