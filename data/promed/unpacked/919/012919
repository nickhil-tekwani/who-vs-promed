In Cuba, between epidemiological week (EW) 27 of 2012 and EW 34 of 2013, there have been 678 confirmed cholera cases, including 3 deaths. No new cases have been reported since 24 Aug 2013.

In the Dominican Republic, since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) through EW 49 of 2013, there have been a total of 31 271 suspected cholera cases, including 462 deaths. Between EW 1 and EW 49 of 2013, there have been 1907 suspected cases, including 41 deaths, registered at the national level, with a monthly average of 173 cases and 4 deaths. Two provinces, Baoruco and Santiago, have registered more cases than the monthly average. While 31 of the 32 provinces have reported cases, 8 of the provinces account for 80 percent of the cases registered in 2013; these are the provinces of Altagracia, Azua, Boaruco, La Vega, San Cristobal, San Pedro de Macoris, Santiago, and Santo Domingo. There have been 75 percent fewer reported cases in 2013 compared to the same period of 2012 (1907 versus 7703 cases, respectively); however, the 2013 case fatality rate has been higher at 2.1 percent compared to 2012 (0.8 percent) and 2011 (1.7 percent). Since EW 46 of 2013, a decrease in the number of suspected cases has been recorded, following the increase registered in EW 43.

In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) and until EW 48 of 2013, there have been 693 875 cholera cases, of which 387 820 were hospitalized (55.9 percent) and 8482 died. The cumulative case-fatality rate remains 1.2 percent, with variations ranging from 4.4 percent in the department of Sud Est to 0.6 percent in Port-au-Prince. Between EW 1 and EW 48 of 2013, 55 736 cholera cases and 431 deaths have been registered with a monthly average of 5066 cases and 36 deaths and with a weekly average of 1140 cases and 9 deaths. The monthly average of cases registered in 2013 is lower than recorded in 2011 (29 197 cholera cases and 243 deaths) and in 2012 (8429 cases and 77 deaths). Four departments (Artibonite, Centre, Nord and Ouest) have registered a greater number of cases than the average, and 2 (Artibonite and Ouest) account for 52 percent of the total registered cases of 2013. In the past 5 weeks, an increasing trend has been noted, coinciding with the rainy season and similar to the previous year [2012].

In Mexico, from EW 37 to EW 51 of 2013, there have been a total of 187 confirmed cases of infection with toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa, including one death, registered. Between EW 50 and EW 51, 3 additional cases have been reported, one in the Federal District and 2 in the state of Veracruz. Of the total cases, 3 are residents of the Federal District, 160 of the state of Hidalgo, 9 of Mexico State, 2 of the state of San Luis Potosi, and 13 of the state of Veracruz.

38 months into the cholera epidemic in Haiti, many cases -- more than 1100 cases and about 10 deaths -- are still occurring weekly in Haiti, too many cases for far too long. - Mod.LL
