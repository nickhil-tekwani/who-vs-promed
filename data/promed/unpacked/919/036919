"Bulgaria and Romania produce some 60 percent of the hepatitis cases in Europe," said Dr Stanimir Hasardzhiev, Chairperson of the National
Association for Hepatitis Prevention (Hepasist), speaking for FOCUS News Agency.

"Some 5 to 6 percent on the average of the population in Bulgaria have been affected by the hepatitis B virus, while between 1 and 1.5 percent of the adult population have been affected by hepatitis C. As a figure this is not a small number of people. The supposed number of people that [have been] affected by hepatitis is between 300 000 and 450 000," the specialist explained.

[It is not clear if the HBV number relates to the number of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus or those with chronic infection plus those with past infection since, unlike HCV, there is an effective vaccine and most people infected with HBV will clear the infection. Specific numbers for Romania are not given. - Mod.LL
