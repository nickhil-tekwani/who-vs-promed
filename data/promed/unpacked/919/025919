The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and other news sources reported significant increases in measles cases during the week ending 2 Feb 2019.

The CDC has confirmed 79 individual cases of measles from 10 states during 2019. The CDC's data may not include recent state-based news reports.

USA
---
The most discussed measles outbreak in the USA has been focused on the Oregon-Washington area.

Atlanta, GA: The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) has confirmed measles in 3 residents of the metro Atlanta area. All 3 individuals are members of the same family. These individuals were not vaccinated.

California: Los Angeles County officials confirmed 1 case of measles in a person who visited several locations in Malibu, Pasadena, and Santa Monica while infectious during 2019.

Colorado: Denver Public Health confirmed 1 adult with measles who had traveled internationally.

Connecticut: Connecticut Department of Public Health confirmed an unidentified 1 New Haven County adult has measles.

Hawaii: Hawaii Department of Health has confirmed 2 cases of measles during 2019 in unvaccinated children visiting the Big Island from Washington state.

Illinois: Champaign-Urbana Public Health District is reporting a 2nd local case of measles, with both of the infected people connected to the University of Illinois.

New Jersey: Between October 2018 and January 2019, the New Jersey Department of Health confirmed 33 outbreak-associated cases, including 30 in Ocean County residents and 3 cases in a Passaic County household. Because no new cases have been identified, the New Jersey outbreak is being considered over.

New York City: As of 29 Jan 2019, there have been 64 confirmed measles cases in Brooklyn since October 2018.

Oregon: The Oregon Health Authority has confirmed 1 case of measles in a resident of Multnomah County. People with measles visited the following locations in the Portland metro area and could have exposed others.

Rockland County, NY: As of 1 Feb 2019, there were 130 confirmed measles cases

Rochester, NY: The Monroe County Health Department says it is aware of 3 non-lab confirmed cases of measles, in addition to 4 previously announced, which increases the total number of measles cases during 2019 to 7.

Washington: Clark County Public Health has identified 47 confirmed cases and 7 suspect cases.

Americas
--------
According to a new report published by the CDC on 30 Jan 2019, Venezuela had contributed 68 percent (5525/8091 cases) of the measles cases reported in the Americas and most of the measles-related deaths (73/85).

World
-----
Australia: Measles cases were reported in New South Wales, Sydney, and Perth.

England: A warning has been issued regarding a measles outbreak in Greater Manchester.

Georgia: Minister of IDPs [Internally Displaced Persons], Labor, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia, Davit Sergeenko, has stated that the vaccination against measles will be free of charge for all citizens of Georgia.

Israel: Ministerial committee tells doctors they could put children and adults at risk, as they 'mislead the public and endanger health' Italy: During 2018, Italy reported 2548 measles cases.

France: As of January 2019, France reported 2912 measles cases during 2018. The CDC issued a Level 1 Travel Alert regarding France's measles outbreak during 2018.

Kazakhstan: Measles has been confirmed in more than 1600 citizens of Kazakhstan.

Madagascar: Measles outbreak case count has risen to 28 747 and 80 deaths since early October. The vast majority of the outbreak cases have been reported in children.

Philippines: During 2018, 211 measles cases were confirmed in region no 6 [Western Visayas].

Poland: 75.9 percent of people in Poland reported least likely to agree that vaccines are important for children to have.

Portugal: The Directorate General of Health announced 37 measles cases had been confirmed since 8 Nov 2018 in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region and in Madeira.

South Korea: A total of 38 confirmed measles were reported on 25 Jan 2019.

Thailand: 285 measles cases including one death have been reported from 31 provinces during 2019.

Ukraine: Health officials reported 11 757 people with measles from 28 Dec 2018, to 25 Jan 2019.

Viet Nam: Ministry of Health's delegation confirmed 1989 measles cases, 95 percent of them had not been vaccinated and most of the patients are below 10 years old while a surge in measles adults in the age of 26-34 is being recorded during 2019.

Measles is often brought into the United States by unvaccinated people who become infected in other countries, says the CDC.

These international travelers then spread measles upon their return, which cause outbreaks in the USA.

In the USA, there are 2 approved measles vaccines, MMR-II and ProQuad.

International travelers can request a vaccine appointment with a pharmacy at Vax-Before-Travel.

The CDC Vaccine Price List provides the private sector vaccine prices for general information. And, measles vaccine discounts can be found here.

Vaccines, similar to medications, can cause side effects, says the CDC. Significant vaccine side effects should be reported to the CDC.

[3] Impact of anti-vaccine movement
Date: Thu 24 Jan 2019

The measles has returned, and with force. This infectious disease that had been eradicated in the United States in the year 2000 is causing outbreaks of historical magnitude in New York and now other cities in the country are added. The reluctance to vaccinating seems to be the main cause of this fearsome rebirth.

In New York, the outbreak began last year [2018] and has continued: until 23 Jan 2019, 62 cases of measles had been confirmed in an Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn that began to register in October 2018. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the origin was an unvaccinated child who traveled to Israel, where there is a large outbreak of the disease, and upon returning to the country infected other unvaccinated children. It is the worst outbreak that has occurred in the city in years.

Recently, Clark County Washington declared a public health emergency for an ongoing measles outbreak. The local health department confirmed 23 cases and others are investigated. The majority of those affected are children 1-10 years old; there are 4 cases in children 11-18 years old, and one adult case.

Portland also joined the list of outbreak locations. Authorities reported that a person with measles arrived at the city's International Airport on 7 Jan 2019 and then went to a Portland Trail Blazers game. On [Fri 18 Jan 2019], there were 19 people infected and the emergency was declared, and by [Tue 22 Jan 2019], cases had increased to 23 and other suspects were investigated. As reported by The Washington Post, the vast majority of those who got it had not been immunized.

Contagious, but preventable
---------------------------
Measles, caused by the measles virus, is an infection that can be serious for young children . The disease is so contagious that if someone has it, 90% of people in the vicinity who are not immunized can also become infected, according to the CDC.

Jonathan Mou, an Adventist Health physician in Portland, told local media KOIN-TV, that while the virus is highly contagious, it is also one of the most preventable: "Once it is established in a community, the likelihood that it extends beyond that community or becomes widespread within that community is high, especially when vaccination rates are low."

In the United States there are 18 [states] that allow non-medical exemptions of childhood vaccines due to philosophical beliefs. On this topic, in June 2018 a study was published in the journal PLOS Medicine that found an increase in the number of children enrolling in kindergarten with a non-medical exemption in 12 of those states and identified 15 metropolitan areas with higher exemption rates. Portland was one of them.

The CDC says that in 2018 there were 17 outbreaks in the country: 349 individual cases of measles in 26 states and the District of Columbia. This is the 2nd highest number of annual cases reported since measles was eradicated, 18 years ago (the largest was 667, in 2014). The disease has been more widespread in communities where there are groups of unvaccinated people.

A real threat
-------------
The growing threat of measles due to anti-vaccine movement is a subject that has been debated for months. This week the World Health Organization included this trend in its 10 health threats in 2019.

The reasons for the lack of immunization are quite complex. Although some countries with poor health systems do not guarantee access to immunizations, there are people who choose not to vaccinate or vaccinate their children voluntarily.

This decision is motivated by the belief that there is a link between vaccines and the onset of autism, based on a study carried out by British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield. Although the research lacked solid evidence and was even removed from the journal where it was published, The Lancet, the belief remained and has spread between countries in America and Europe, where there has also been a rebound of the disease.

The physician Manuel Meléndez Córdoba, who is part of the staff of HolaDoctor.com, explained that so far there is no study that shows a direct correlation between vaccination against measles with any serious adverse effect. Instead, he warned about the consequences of not getting vaccinated.

In the absence of immunization, people can contract or import the virus from other regions. "For example, if you or a family member does not have immunization against the measles virus and comes into contact with an infected person in a public place, you or your family member can get it," said the specialist.

According to the WHO, the reluctance or refusal to be immunized, despite the availability of vaccines, threatens to reverse the progress made in the fight against diseases preventable by vaccination.

Two patients at Yale-New Haven Hospital have confirmed cases of the measles on [Su 3 Feb 2019]. According to the hospital, within the last 2 weeks, they have seen 2 patients with confirmed measles.

It is unclear if the 2 patients know each other.

Last week, the Connecticut Department of Public Health said the 1st confirmed case of measles this year [2019] was in New Haven county. Health officials said the patient was an adult.

Vaccination is required to attend schools and colleges in Connecticut, but medical and religious exemptions are available.

Clark county health officials confirmed 4 more measles cases as the outbreak continues to grow, making for 47 confirmed cases and 7 suspected cases since the beginning of the year [2019].

Since 23 Jan 2019, there has been one confirmed case in King county, upping the overall total in Washington state to 48 confirmed cases.

Clark county health officials said they have not found any other possible exposure sites that the patients visited while contagious.

According to officials, 41 of the patients were not immunized, 5 weren't verified to have had the vaccine, and one patient had the 1st dose of the vaccine.

Clark County Public Health said most of the patients are children under 10 years old, 12 cases involve kids ages 11-18, and 1 case is in an adult between the ages of 19 and 29.

"Measles can be so contagious that you can be in a room, and if you're susceptible, 2 hours after someone with measles left, and still get the disease," said Dr Alan Melnick, the director of public health for Clark county.

Venezuela's health system collapse represents a real threat to the Americas and, potentially, global public health, a paper revealed.

The South-American country has plunged into economic ruin and political chaos following almost 20 years of price control and stringent policies launched by socialist leader Hugo Chavez. The meltdown has profoundly affected Venezuela's health system, whose current state has been compared by experts to the ones of war-stricken countries such as Syria and Yemen. Diseases such as measles and diphtheria, which could be contained with widespread vaccinations, have re-emerged in the country, putting its neighbouring countries at risk of contagion as millions flee to Brazil and Colombia for a better life.

A paper in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases [see below] said: "The ongoing diphtheria and measles epidemics in Venezuela, and spill over into neighbouring countries, evoke the re-emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases observed in Syria and Yemen and the consequent threat to regional, and potentially global, public health."

Measles, a highly infectious viral illness which can be fatal, and diphtheria were thought to be under control in Venezuela, but its chronic shortage of medicines and vaccines and the general poverty of the country fuelled their return.

Moreover, medically trained workers are among the millions who have left the country, according to the paper written by academics led by Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, a Venezuelan infectious diseases pathologist.

He said: "The continued mass exodus of around 2 million persons from Venezuela since 2014, not only to Colombia, but also to Ecuador, and Brazil, represents an ongoing risk that vaccine-preventable diseases will be carried with them."

Venezuela now contributes to nearly 7 out of 10 cases of measles in the Americas, just 11 years after the country believed to have stamped it out.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Venezuela's tumbling economy and authoritarian rule have precipitated an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Hyperinflation rates now exceed 45 000%, and Venezuela's health system is in free fall. The country is experiencing a massive exodus of biomedical scientists and qualified healthcare professionals. Reemergence of arthropod-borne and vaccine-preventable diseases has sparked serious epidemics that also affect neighboring countries. In this article, we discuss the ongoing epidemics of measles and diphtheria in Venezuela and their disproportionate impact on indigenous populations. We also discuss the potential for reemergence of poliomyelitis and conclude that action to halt the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases within Venezuela is a matter of urgency for the country and the region. We further provide specific recommendations for addressing this crisis.

The Taiwan Disease Control Department announced [Fri 1 Feb 2019], 2 new measles cases.

One patient is 30-year-old man who worked in Viet Nam and the 2nd is a 50-year-old woman with no recent history of travel abroad.

This brings the total measles cases in the country to 8 in 2019. 6 cases are linked to travel to the Philippines and Viet Nam, both countries experiencing increases in measles, and 2 were domestically acquired.

There has been a recent outbreak of measles in the international community to include several of Taiwan's neighbors in Asia -- mainland China, Viet Nam, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and India; Europe, in particular Ukraine, Serbia, Romania, France, and Italy; South America -- Venezuela and Brazil; Africa -- Madagascar, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and the United States.

The Disease Control Department especially urges parents get their children vaccinated with 2 shots of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and people travelling abroad.

https://www.theleader.com.au/story/5881579/another-measles-alert-as-infectious-traveller-lands-at-sydney-airport/?cs=1507


Anyone who was in the international arrivals terminal at Sydney Airport on [22 Jan 2019] is urged to keep an eye out for symptoms of measles after an infectious passenger arrived back in the country.

NSW Health is alerting passengers following a new diagnosis of measles in a returned traveller.

The woman was infectious on her flight from Singapore to Sydney SQ231 departing Singapore airport at 12:42 am on [22 Jan 2019] and arriving at Sydney International Airport at 11:58 am on [22 Jan 2019].

Passengers on this flight and people in Sydney International Airport around lunchtime on this date, including baggage carousels, customs, and the arrivals area are advised to watch for signs and symptoms of measles until 9 Feb 2019.

The woman developed a rash a few days after returning from the Philippines, where she is likely to have been infected.

She was briefly hospitalised due to her illness but has since been discharged and is recovering. She was not infectious during her hospital stay.

The local public health unit is working with a medical practice visited by the woman while she was infectious, contacting other patients present at the same time and offering preventive treatment, if needed.

This case brings the total number of cases since Christmas [2018] to 12.

Outbreaks of measles in popular tourist destinations means the risk for measles being imported into Australia at the moment is high. NSW Health urges people travelling to South East Asia, where measles is prevalent, to ensure they are fully vaccinated before heading overseas.

[10] Reunion Island: travel-associated

Reunion Island (France) facing a measles epidemic in the south of the island, linked to cases imported by travelers, mostly to Madagascar. Already 22 cases of measles reported in the south of the island

Following the arrival of several travelers who contracted measles out of the department, Reunion is currently facing the beginning of an epidemic in the south of the island. Measles is very easily transmitted to children and adults by coughing, sneezing, and saliva. Given the extreme contagiousness of this disease, it is feared that many cases will occur in the coming days. The only way to prevent the epidemic is vaccination. Also, the ARS [Regional Health Agency] Indian Ocean [OI] calls the population to a strong vigilance: all people who have not already contracted the disease in their childhood must check their health book and get vaccinated, if necessary, from their doctor.

Epidemiological situation
-------------------------
Between 1 Dec 2018 and 29 Jan 2019, 22 cases of measles were reported to the ARS OI:
- 8 imported cases, mostly from Madagascar (5 cases), but also from Metropolitan France (1 case), Mauritius (1 case), and Mayotte (1 case)
- 14 cases contracted in Reunion:
- For 9 of these cases, the investigations made it possible to establish a direct link with an imported case; for the 5 others, the origin of the contamination is at this stage unknown, making spread of the virus on the territory a fear.

This unusual situation is followed with the greatest attention, since Reunion is usually free of measles. The last episode of virus circulation of this magnitude on the island dates back to 2011 (with a total of 33 cases spread over 11 weeks).

Although progressing, vaccination coverage in Reunion is currently too low to ensure collective protection of the population vis-à-vis measles.
