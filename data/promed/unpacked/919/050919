Mt Algidus cattle with bovine tuberculosis (Tb) were moved to Mid and
North Canterbury farms, but were quickly detected and slaughtered.

"We have found it, we have contained it," Animal Health Board regional
coordinator for the Northern South Island Danny Templeman said.
However, the disease may have spread in the Rakaia Gorge itself, and
testing is under way. "It just shows the issue with Tb, how we can't
be complacent about it," Mr Templeman said.

He said 3 farms in both the North and Mid Canterbury areas were
infected from Mt Algidus stock. The stock were traced through animal
status declaration forms, 10 were detected with the disease, and
slaughtered. A larger number had been slaughtered following the
original detection of Tb on Mt Algidus, but the number would not be
revealed for privacy reasons.

Further testing of Mt Algidus breeding stock could not be carried out
yet, as calving was under way.

Whether Tb has been contained in the Rakaia Gorge itself is unknown.
The board is testing herds on 17 high country stations upstream of the
Rakaia Gorge, on both sides of the river. The "special testing area"
is 154 000 hectares [about 380 000 acres] and has over 10 000 stock
which will need testing. "We need to work out where the Tb is and then
push it back," Mr Templeman said.

Tb has been confirmed in 4 possums and 4 wild pigs from the area
surrounding Mt Algidus. The board has contracted a worker to undertake
a possum survey to determine if there has been further infection of
the marsupial population.

Possums are the main host of the disease, so present the biggest risk
to stock in the area.

All wild animals and livestock returning tests to date have had "type
19" strain, the same type found in South Westland, Karamea, and the
Hutt Valley. Mr Templeman said the testing and survey operation in the
gorge would be a costly one, adding up to hundreds of thousands of
dollars, funded through farmer levies and government funding.

The spread of the disease had shown the importance of farmers filling
out animal status declaration forms every time stock was moved or
received, he said. The board compensates farmers for slaughtered stock
to the level of 65 per cent of the market value.

[The primary cause of tuberculosis in cattle is the bacterium
_Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_). This bacterium is in the same
family with the bacteria that cause Johnes disease and leprosy. Adult
cattle are usually infected by inhaling invisible droplets containing
the bacteria into their lungs, while pre-weaned calves are more often
infected by drinking contaminated milk. The route of entry will
ultimately determine the clinical signs of the disease.

Since the bacterium is usually inhaled into the lungs in adult cows,
the most common clinical signs are related to pulmonary tuberculosis.
Once the bacteria enter the lungs, they begin to multiply and
generally spread to the lymph nodes near the lungs. At this primary
site of infection, the lesions can remain quietly inactive or develop
further depending on the ability of the cow to fight off the
infection. When the cow's immune system is fully activated, the
infection may remain limited to the lungs and could go undetected for
the productive life of the cow. If the infection over-powers the body
defenses, the bacteria may be carried to other locations in the body
in the lymph or blood circulation. New areas of infection often occur
in the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and the lymph nodes associated
with these organs. In cases allowed to progress over an extended
period of time, lesions may be present in the uterus or mammary
gland.

When calves are exposed to the tuberculosis bacteria in the milk, the
most common lesions are noted in the lymph nodes at the junction of
the neck and head around the throat. The main sign may be swelling of
these nodes. The primary lesions in calves, however, are most
frequently located in the lymph nodes along the intestinal tract.

Other species of _Mycobacterium_ may complicate the diagnosis of
tuberculosis in cattle caused by _M. bovis_, but cattle are resistant
to these infections, and they rarely cause infections with clinical
signs. _Mycobacterium avium_, causing infection by ingestion and
lesions in the intestinal tract of adult cows, and _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_, the main cause of human tuberculosis, are 2 of these
species. They cause the cattle to be sensitive to tuberculin testing
and give false positive reactions when tests are being conducted to
find cows with _M. bovis_ infections. These other bacteria are more
important as causes of infection in swine, sheep, goats, and humans.

Bovine tuberculosis (Tb) arrived in New Zealand with the cattle of the
1st European settlers. It was a serious problem by the 1940s, reducing
productivity and putting many people's lives at risk, and today it
remains the most important disease for both cattle and deer farming in
New Zealand. It is a wasting disease in both cattle and deer, leading
to weight loss and death. In cattle, milk production may decline.
Bovine Tb is similar to human Tb and can move from livestock to humans
with potentially fatal consequences. Owing largely to the
pasteurization of milk and the compulsory Tb control program for
cattle, bovine Tb is now a minor cause (1-5 percent) of Tb in humans
in New Zealand. The current issue is how it affects livestock
industries and exports.

In most countries eradication of Tb from cattle herds is
straightforward. All cattle are tested and those that are
"test-positive" are either re-tested or slaughtered. Normally this
rapidly reduces the level of Tb and can eliminate it entirely. The
vast majority of New Zealand's trading partners and competitors
(Australia, North America, most Western European, and South-East Asian
countries) are classified as free from Tb. New Zealand has had a
compulsory, national Tb eradication campaign operating in cattle herds
since 1970, and in deer herds since 1990. However, 0.5 percent of the
national cattle herds and 1.4 percent of deer herds are still infected
with Tb. In the 12 months to July 2002, 922 cattle and 274 farmed deer
were confirmed with Tb.

So why does New Zealand still have a significant Tb problem, despite a
long-running national eradication campaign?

In the late 1960s, veterinarians in the Westport area were puzzled by
chronic infection in cattle herds that could not be cleared by
standard test and slaughter methods. Researchers linked the problem to
high levels of Tb infection in the possum populations adjacent to
these herds. Bovine Tb had "jumped" to a new host. Since then, possums
with Tb have been identified in widely separated areas of New Zealand,
co-existing with tuberculous cattle. While several wild animal species
can be infected with Tb, research suggests that possums, and perhaps
ferrets, are likely to be the only self-sustaining reservoirs of Tb.
Feral red and fallow deer have also been identified as important
vectors of Tb.

In the 1960s and 1970s, infected possum populations were mostly
confined to high rainfall areas of the West Coast, and the lower and
central North Island. Since then, infected possum populations have
continued to spread throughout the country. Scientists now regard
possums as the most important vector of Tb, for most infected herds in
New Zealand, over the last 25 years. In total, Tb-infected possum
populations now occupy about 38 percent or 10 million hectares (about
25 million acres) of New Zealand. By 2002, approximately half of this
area (4.6 million hectares [about 11 million acres]) was under
sustained Tb vector control.

Current management of possum populations for Tb involves 2 distinct
phases. First, the population has to be heavily reduced over a large
area, to cut down the likelihood of infected possums interacting with
cattle or deer herds. Sometimes in this initial stage it is necessary
to target other wild animal vectors, such as red deer and ferrets, as
well. Large areas have to be treated, otherwise new possums moving in
from the edges of the controlled area quickly increase the population
again. Making these initial reductions often involves spreading 1080
(sodium monofluoracetate) baits by air, over large (more than 1000
hectares [2500 acres]) or difficult areas of forest and scrub. Aerial
operations provide rapid control over a large area, something that
ground control rarely provides. Aerial operations are complemented
with ground control of possums, often using a variety of techniques,
on adjoining pasture and forest/pasture margins.

Phase 2 is maintenance, which may require redosing of the possums.

These control operations, coupled with herd testing, culling of
"test-positive" animals, and controls on stock movement, usually
achieve an immediate reduction in the level of Tb in herds close to
infected possum populations. However, if the possum population and
other vectors are not kept down through maintenance control, then Tb
levels in the herds usually rise to the pre-control levels within 5 to
8 years. On the other hand, if control operations are able to keep
possum populations low enough for long enough, Tb can be completely
eradicated from the population. This is the long-term aim of AHB's
(Animal Health Board) operations, and has been achieved so far in 6
small areas.

Likely there is active surveillance at slaughter plants. Meat
inspectors check the lymph glands and other organs of each cow for
signs of tuberculosis. When any signs suspicious of tuberculosis are
found, tissues are collected and sent a laboratory capable of handling
and testing for confirmation. If bovine tuberculosis is confirmed,
trace-back studies are performed to find the herd of origin. The most
effective means of control in a tuberculosis herd is to depopulate the
entire herd and compensate the owners. Otherwise, the herd will be
quarantined and tested repeatedly until all evidence of infection is
eliminated.

Tuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease that can lurk for quite a
while before rearing its head. Unfortunately, the best tests, as noted
above, do not always detect this disease in its earliest stages.
Vigilance in disease detection is key to preventing further spread of
this or any disease.

Science has been hard at work trying to develop a better test for this
disease but has not yet succeeded.
