Some pigs at the Ashtabula County Fair tested positive for swine flu. According to the Ohio Department of Agriculture, earlier this week, pigs at the fair showed signs of the flu. The fair veterinarian was immediately called and several pigs were sent home.

Further testing confirmed that some of the pigs had H3N2 influenza- a virus commonly carried by pigs.

Transferring the virus from pigs to humans is rare, according to the Ohio Department of Agriculture, and can usually be prevented by thoroughly washing your hands after touching animals.

The show veterinarian was closely involved in this case as the animals were sent home. To protect the other animals, and possibly for human protection this was likely a wise move.

Thus far, no humans from this particular fair have been reported with this strain of flu. Personal hygiene around animals is more than just a good idea; it is a great way to reduce the spread of any virus among animals or from animals to people - Mod.TG]
