Dengue has caused another death in Campo Grande. A 54-year-old
electrician of the Legislative Assembly of Mato Grosso do Sul for 31
years, died after presenting symptoms of the disease and being
interned in a private hospital in the capital for less than 72 hours.
This could be the 12th death caused by the [dengue] epidemic in the
capital and the 26th in the state. There are 7 confirmed deaths in the
city and another 4 under investigation. In the state, 16 [dengue
deaths] were confirmed and 9 are suspected [fatal cases].

Campo Grande is facing the most lethal dengue epidemic in its history.
It is the 2nd epidemic in 3 years. In 2007, more than 45 000 people
contracted the disease, but just 2 died. This year [2010] with almost
25 000 reported cases, there are now 7 confirmed fatalities and 4 are
suspected [fatal cases], without considering the man who just died.

In this post the moderator commented:
"It would be of interest to know which dengue virus serotypes of the 4
is circulating in Bolivia currently. This report does not indicate
which of 7 of the 9 departments have confirmed dengue cases.
Presumably transmission is occurring in those departments that have
areas within the tropical Amazon Basin, and especially Santa Cruz
department which was particularly hard hit in the 2009 epidemic."

According to this document from Bolivia's Department of Health
(<http://www.sns.gov.bo/documentos/epidemiologia/2010_3_22_2.pdf>)
[edited]:

"Dengue virus] serotypes 1 and 4 are circulating: DEN-1 virus
(Guayaramerin - Beni) and DEN-2 virus (San Matias, San Ignacio - Santa
Cruz) and (Trinidad - Beni)

The affected provinces are
- Beni
- Chuquisaca
- Cochabamba
- La Paz
- Pando
- Santa Cruz
- Tarija
Oruro and Potosi have no confirmed cases."

[ProMED-mail thanks Vicki Hansen for forwarding this information,
confirming the report that dengue cases are occurring in a wide
geographic area in Bolivia, and that 2 dengue virus serotypes are
circulating.

[4] Sri Lanka

A dengue outbreak in Sri Lanka has taken the lives of 63 patients so
far this year [2010], the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health
reveals. A total of 10 950 dengue cases have been reported until this
week [week of 22 Mar 2010]. During the same period last year [2009]
only 3096 cases had been reported. The total number of dengue patients
diagnosed in 2009 was 35 010. A majority of the dengue patients this
year [2010] was from Colombo and Gampaha districts in the Western
Province while Jaffna district had the highest number with 1784 cases.

The dry weather during the past weeks has caused reduction of dengue
cases. But health authorities are alarmed by the increase of cases
with the onset of inter- monsoonal showers. Health authorities appeal
to the public to keep their environs clear of [standing] water where
mosquitoes breed.

[5] Japan ex Indonesia (Bali)
Date: Wed 24 Mar 2010
From: Meng Ling Moi <sherry@nih.go.jp> [edited]


In Japan, 6 travelers who visited Bali, Indonesia were diagnosed with
dengue fever in February and March 2010. All 6 of these cases were
viremic upon returning to Japan and dengue virus genome was detected
by real-time PCR: dengue virus type-1 (DENV-1) genome in 2 cases,
DENV-2 genome in 2 cases, and DENV-4 genome in 1 case. The other case
was confirmed to be dengue fever by detecting anti-dengue IgM and IgG
antibodies, and DENV NS-1 antigen.

Detection of DENV-3 and DENV-4 was previously reported in travelers
who returned from Bali in 2008 (ProMED post no. 20080721.2211). The
present report of the detection of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4 among
the travelers who returned from Bali within these 2 months, suggest
that these DENV serotypes are currently circulating in Bali. The
incidence is consistent with a report of a dengue fever outbreak in
Bali (ProMED post no. 20100222.0597).

Infection with one DENV serotype does not confer protection to
sequential infection with other serotypes. Current co-circulation of
at least 3 DENV serotypes in a popular tourist destination such as
Bali increases the risk of DENV re-infection in both locals and
tourists. As such, one of the 6 imported cases, a 90-year-old male,
was serologically confirmed to be secondary DENV infection. Viremic
international travelers also increase the risk of dissemination of
DENV in non-endemic areas, such as Japan, where one of the competent
vectors, _Aedes albopictus_, is present. These concerns raise the need
of awareness towards the risk of DENV dissemination by international
travelers.

[This report from Dr Ming Ling Moi and colleagues emphasizes the
importance of the risk of importation of viruses via viremic
individuals into areas where competent mosquito vectors occur.
ProMED-mail thanks these health professionals for their report.
