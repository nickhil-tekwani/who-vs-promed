7 more die of dengue fever; 337 affected since April [2003]
----------------------
7 more patients died of dengue fever up to 24 Nov 2003 out of a total
of 337 people affected since April [2003] across the country,
officials at the Directorate of Health Services said yesterday.
2 died at Dhaka Shishu Hospital on 12 & 13 Nov 2003, 2 others died at
Dhaka Medical College Hospital on 14 & 16 Nov, one each died at
Chittagong Medical College Hospital on 9 Nov, Suhrawardy Hospital on
22 Nov, and Bangladesh Medical College on 2 Nov 2003.
Out of 337 dengue patients, 256 have been released from various
hospitals, while 81 are under treatment.
A DCC source said that 136 people died of dengue in 2000, some 39 in
2001, and at least 26 last year [2002].
[For one of the world's most populous countries, 337 cases is a very
small number, especially compared with the 3000-6000 reported from
New Delhi alone in neighboring India. - Mod.JW]

[Officially there are] fewer than 2800 confirmed dengue cases among
the 3700 admitted in hospitals with dengue-like symptoms. According
to sources, the number of cases admitted in hospitals from January
[2003] is more than 6000. "The numbers given by the MCD are those
confirmed as dengue by the NICD [National Institute of Communicable
Diseases] from June [2003] onwards, which are about 60 percent of the
total admissions in the hospital. But the total number since the
beginning of this year [2003] are nearly equal to the number reported
since June," said an official in the ministry.
The numbers, however, are much lower than during the 1996 epidemic,
when the figure touched 11 000.
