TECHNICAL NOTE No. 07/2006/COVEV/CGDT/DEVEP/SVS/MS
Subject: Report on the epidemiological situation of Yellow Fever in Brazil
in 2006
Brasilia, 18 May 2006.
Situation in 2006.
-------------------
Up to epidemiological week 19/2006 [7 - 13 May 2006] 2 cases of yellow
fever, both fatal, were confirmed in the municipalities of Iranduba
(Amazonas state) & Nova Ubirata (Mato Grosso state).
During the same period, deaths in monkeys were reported from 2 states:
Tocantins, in the municipalities of Porto Nacional & Piraque, April 2006;
and Rio Grande do Sul, in the municipalities of Santo Antonio das Missoes &
Sao Nicolau in Feb 2006, and in the municipality of Joia, in May
2006. All were investigated, but due to logistical difficulties it was not
possible to collect adequate samples from all cases.
The epizootic in Joia is worrying, because the municipality is outside the
area of transition for YF, and therefore routine vaccination is not done
there. However, vaccination is planned for this and all other areas with
"epizootic rumors".

In 2006, 83 cases of YF have been notified so far in Brazil.

[The SINAN number refers to the number of notifications, but not of
confirmations. As yellow fever is such a sensitive issue, every case with
fever and icterus is notified as yellow fever. According to the system, if
you request any test for yellow fever in a public health laboratory,
filling a form for SINAN is mandatory. The number 83, therefore, is for
notified, or suspect cases. - Mod.LJS]
[According to the old International Health Regulations, suspected as well
as confirmed cases of YF in humans, primates or mosquitoes had to be
reported to WHO within 24 hours, with confirmation to follow as soon as
available. I cannot trace any report of these cases, confirmed or
suspected, on either the PAHO or WHO websites -- but maybe I didn't look in
the right place. I understand that the revised International Health
Regulations adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2006 now allow WHO
to report outbreaks of internationally important diseases without having to
wait for official notification from the country. - Mod.JW]
