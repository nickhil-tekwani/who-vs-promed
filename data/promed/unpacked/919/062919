Rabies Virus Infection and Birds
--------------------------------
In the official Chinese news agency report, posted as "Rabies - China
(Guangxi) 20031112.2802", it was stated that: " A serious, fatal disease
that can be transmitted by dogs, cats, livestock and certain wild animals
and birds, rabies infects and kills thousands of people every year in
China." Several correspondents have pointed out there is no evidence
supporting the transmission of rabies virus by birds.
A similar statement was included in an Agence France Press report
concerning an outbreak of human rabies virus infection also in China in
July (see: Rabies, human - China (Guangdong) 20030721.1783). In a
correction posted as "Rabies, human - China (Guangdong) (02):
correction 20030722.1793", I stated in a Moderator's comment that: "In
fact, although pre-human diploid cell vaccines were produced in embryonated
duck eggs or primary chicken and quail embryo cells, birds have never been
shown to be susceptible to rabies virus infection, nor have raptors or
avian scavenger species been implicated in the transmission of rabies. The
report should have been amended to read "terrestrial animals and bats".
Subsequently Nikos Gurfield, DVM <nikos.gurfield@sdcounty.ca.gov> informed
me that: "Although I concur that rabies infection has never been shown to
be transmitted by birds, the moderator's comment that "birds have never
been shown to be susceptible to rabies virus infection" may not be entirely
correct. Helga Gerlach's chapter in Avian Medicine: Principles and
Application, eds. Ritchie et al, Wingers Publ., Lake Worth, 1994, p. 920,
describes virus neutralizing antibodies, clinical disease and necropsy
findings in infected birds. She references Gylstorff I: Virusinfektionen.
In Gylstorff I, Grimm F: Vogelkrankheiten. Stuttgart, Verlag Eugen Ulmer,
1987, pp 255-257.
Charles Rupprecht <cyr5@cdc.gov> informed me also that: "A number of much
older papers purport natural transmission by birds, but this has not been
documented in recent memory using modern methods. There were several
experimental comparative studies involving birds, which appear to undergo
an abortive infection. One of the better examples is described by Schneider
LG, Burtscher H. Studies on the pathogenesis of rabies in fowls after
intracerebral infection. Zentralbl Veterinarmed B. 1967;14:598-624.
ProMED-mail and the Moderator [CP] would welcome any further information on
this question.
