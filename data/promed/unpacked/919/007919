A 2nd North Carolina horse has tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [11 Jul 2018]. "On Wednesday, July 11 [2018], the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services confirmed ... EEE in a 13-year-old unvaccinated female chestnut draft mix located in Onslow County," the EDCC said. "This is the second case of EEE in North Carolina for 2018."

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75% to 80% among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems. Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it can take 3 to 10 days for clinical signs to develop.

Vaccines have proven to be an effective EEE prevention tool. Equids that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. Unvaccinated horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules, or those with an unknown vaccination history will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period. In a statement issued after the state's 1st EEE case of the year, confirmed earlier this week, State Veterinarian Doug Meckes, DVM, said he recommends a booster shot every 6 months in North Carolina because of the state's prolonged mosquito season.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Mosquitoes can breed in any puddle that lasts for more than 4 days, so removing any source of standing water can reduce the chance of exposing animals to West Nile virus or EEE. Additionally, owners can keep animals inside during the bugs' main feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and apply mosquito repellents approved for equine use according to manufacturer recommendations.

Onslow County [NC] officials are reporting a case of mosquito-borne Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) found in a horse. The 13-year-old horse died from contracting the disease from locally infected mosquitoes, according to a press release. EEE has the risk of impacting humans, too. This is the second EEE case in North Carolina and the first in Onslow County [in 2018], officials said.

A press release from Onslow County with more information follows:

A case of mosquito-borne EEE virus has recently been identified in a horse in Onslow County, indicating that humans in the area are also at risk from this mosquito-borne disease, according to North Carolina Public Health and Department of Agriculture officials. This is the 2nd case of EEE this year in North Carolina and the 1st in Onslow County. There are no human cases of EEE in Onslow County. The 13-year-old horse died after apparently contracting the disease from a locally infected mosquito.

Even though no humans have been infected with EEE in Onslow County, both horses and humans can get EEE through the bite of an infected mosquito. "EEE is a rare disease, but the presence of an EEE-positive horse serves as confirmation that there are mosquitoes in Onslow County infected with the virus, so people are urged to remain vigilant and take measures to protect themselves," explained Angela Lee, Health Director for the Onslow County Health Department.

EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the US, with an approximately 33% mortality rate in humans and significant brain damage in those who survive. Some people infected with EEE have no symptoms. However, those who do develop symptoms may have a fever and joint or muscle pain. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those with a severe form of the disease will have "sudden onset of a headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, and coma."

"EEE is a serious and dangerous disease; if someone is experiencing flu-like symptoms, including fever and headache, they should contact their medical provider immediately," added Lee.

According to Tony Padgett, Director of Onslow County Environmental Services, once his department was notified, they acted immediately, "We take this positive finding of EEE very seriously, and upon notification from the Department of Health and Human Services of a case of EEE in Onslow County, we began spraying the affected area. We will continue to spray the area the remaining of the week and monitor the area."

"This unfortunate finding emphasizes the need for residents and visitors of Onslow County to continue to use an effective repellent when enjoying the beautiful things Onslow County has to offer" added Padgett. While there is no vaccine to protect humans from EEE, Padgett stated, "People can protect themselves by taking preventive actions to suppress the mosquito population."

[We now have EEE confirmed in horses in Richmond and Onslow counties in North Carolina. We can expect more.

Onslow County is on the southeast coast of North Carolina. Richmond County is inland in south-central North Carolina on the border angle with South Carolina; see: http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/states/north_carolina.gif. These are 2 widely separated counties in a state with unvaccinated horses. - Mod.MHJ
