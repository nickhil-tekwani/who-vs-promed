An outbreak of an unknown illness with a high mortality has been
reported from the province of Kasai Occidental, in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. The exact number of cases and deaths is
unknown at this time.
The clinical features in the majority of cases include fever,
headache, diarrhoea or colicky abdominal pain, and vomiting. Over 50
percent of cases have been in children under 10 years of age.
An investigation team from the Provincial and National Health
Ministries, the Institut National de Recherches Biologiques (INRB),
and WHO is in the field, and has taken clinical samples for
laboratory testing. WHO is mobilizing support for the epidemiological
investigation and logistics, including supplies, and water and
sanitation and technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network (GOARN) have offered to provide support to the MoH
(Ministry of Health) if required.
At the present time, the etiological agent is unknown, but the
national health authorities have taken a precautionary approach and
are implementing measures to improve hygiene, ensure the safety of
the water supply, promote safe burial practices, and strengthen
infection control.

[This outbreak appears to be in the same general area as the oubreak
attributed by the media 3 days ago to viral hemorrhagic fever or
typhoid -- see ProMED archive below. However, this report does not
mention hemorrhagic symptoms, and in contrast to the other, which
reported that only 3 /103 deaths were in children, this says 50
percent (of an unstated number of cases and deaths) were children. - Mod.JW]
[ProMED-mail requests additional information about this outbreak as
it becomes available. The identification of the etiological agent
would be of particular interest, as well as epidemiological
information about the outbreak, including the numbers of cases over
time, age distribution, case fatality rates, and environmental assessment.
