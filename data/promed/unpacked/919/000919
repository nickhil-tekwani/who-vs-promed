Rising TB levels in pets sparks concern
---------------------------------------
New figures showing a significant rise in bovine TB infection in
domestic cats has prompted fresh concerns about the dangers of failing
to control the disease in cattle and wildlife. The figures released by
DEFRA [UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] show
that from 2005 to 2007, 42 cats were confirmed with _M.bovis_
infection in Britain, compared with just 15 over the
previous 7 years. The data, released after a Freedom of Information
request by the NFU [National Farmer's Union], also show varying
degrees of infection over the past 3 years in domestic pigs, llamas,
alpacas, goats, sheep, dogs and ferrets.

At the same time, new DEFRA figures have confirmed a huge rise in bTB
incidence in cattle this year. More than 20 000 cattle were
slaughtered in the 1st half of 2008 because of bTB, 44 percent up on
the same period in 2007. While the numbers of people and pets
confirmed with bTB remain low, the trend is upwards and the concern
is that the risks are growing due to the relentless rise in infection
in badgers and cattle.

Roger Sainsbury, a former Cornwall divisional veterinary officer
(DVO), said it may now be necessary to introduce active surveillance
for the disease in domestic animals across the EU. "All mammals can
get bTB, and where the badger population is large and heavily infected
there is a great deal of environmental infection and the risk is
higher. You can't be too alarmist because the numbers are low but
there is an ongoing risk," he said.

NFU TB spokesman Jan Rowe said the rise in incidence in domestic
animals should send a 'severe warning' to Government on the
consequences of failing to curb bTB spread. "We have always said the
biggest risk in terms of human health is the sheer level of bTB
around in the countryside that could infect pets. Primarily it is
wildlife, because you rarely get to the stage where cattle are highly
infectious," he said.

However, the Badger Trust has accused the industry of
'scaremongering'. It claims veterinary investigations have previously
linked the cases in cats to drinking unpasteurised milk or eating the
lymph nodes of infected rats. "Cattle, not badgers, are the source of
the disease," it said.

The Health Protection agency report the current risk posed by bTB to
human health in the UK was 'considered negligible,' while DEFRA
insisted 'apparent incidence is low' in pets.

[Until one knows with some certainty how these got infected, it is
scary but how meaningful? How many of these 42 cats are/were farm
cats? How many were suburban cats normally only getting pasteurised
milk? ... did they get it from cheese? Rodents? How many were
enthusiastic hunters? Couch potatoes/window bird-watchers?

From past experience, how do feline cases relate to human
cases/reactors in the same household? Put another way, for every
sentinel cat case, how many human cases might we expect? I say this as
someone who is skin test positive to M.bTB as a result of childhood
exposure to unpasteurised milk, but with no symptoms at any time. On
the other hand my godfather, Ted Robinson, had a spinal M.bTB
infection and as a result lost his toes. - Mod.MHJ]
