This concerns the case of the Austrian patient who was admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit at Ceuta Hospital. Please be advised that
Ceuta is not in Morocco but is part of Spain.
The patient has been transferred to Austria, and the Ceuta hospital
provided intensive care while he was moved.
The symptoms that the patient presented were compatible with a case
of human rabies of canine origin. The patient seemed to have acquired
the illness in the next country, Morocco.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Lopez for the update on the patient, and for
correcting our geography. The atlas that we consulted showed Ceuta
in Africa, on the border of Morocco, hence the confusion.
"When Spain handed over most of northern Morocco to the newly
independent kingdom in 1956, they kept Ceuta and Melilla (about 250
km further east). [They have] been under Spanish control since 1580."

However, we think it would be confusing to our readers to have called
this thread "Rabies - Spain ex Morocco," and we do not propose to
change the name now to "Rabies - Austria ex Morocco." - Mod.JW]
