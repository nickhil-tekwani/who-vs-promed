Rampant weeds giving wombats liver disease
------------------------------------------
Researchers think they have worked out why illness has been killing high numbers of southern hairy-nosed wombats in the Murraylands in eastern South Australia. Brigitte Stevens from the Wombat Awareness Organisation has documented finding about 2800 sick wombats in the region. "[They are] very skinny animals that are bald and can't walk," she said. Few have been caught because they scurry into their burrows.

But despite that challenge, Dr Wayne Boardman and Dr Lucy Woolford of Adelaide University have done postmortem examinations on 6 wombats. "It's not just a skin disease, it's actually a liver disease," Dr Boardman said.

The researchers have concluded native grasses have disappeared under pressure from a range of potentially-toxic plants, such as onion weed. "We've found that they've had severely scarred liver as a consequence of eating these plants," Dr Boardman said.

[Common plant names are always difficult. In searching onion weed in Australia, the following 3 species of the plant came up:

1. _Asphodelus fistulosus_ came up specifically from http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/PC_93103.html?s=0. Onion weed is in the family Asphodelaceae. It not a true onion and it does not have the onion taste or smell, nor does it produce a bulb. The leaves are similar in appearance to the true onion. It is also similar in appearance to another weed, once referred to as branched South African onion weed (_Trachyandra divaricata_) but more recently named strapweed or dune onion weed. The major difference between the two is that South African onion weed has flat rather than round leaves and a much branched flowering stalk.

2. _Nothoscordum inodorum_ came up on several garden sites in Australia, all under the name of onion weed. In the United States this plant is most commonly called the false onion.

3. Onion grass (_Romulea rosea_). While this plant also came upon numerous gardening websites, they did say onion grass, not onion weed.

Not knowing specifically which of these plants is the one the article referred to, it is difficult to make a knowledgeable comment.

Also it is impossible to comment on what the toxic agent in the plant might be without knowing what the plant really is. However, in general, many plants have an effect on the liver of animals. When the liver is compromised, we may see a variety of secondary effects, such as encephalopathies, commonly called hepatic encephalopathy because the situation originated with the liver.

A similar situation occurs when the liver is affected such that it cannot remove the photosensitizing agent, phylloerythrin (a porphyrin). The phylloerythrin accumulates in the plasma due to impaired excretion by the hepatobiliary system. Phylloerythrin is a product of the breakdown of chlorophyll by microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. Phylloerythrin, not chlorophyll, is normally absorbed into the circulation and is effectively excreted by the liver into the bile. Failure to excrete phylloerythrin due to hepatic dysfunction or bile duct lesions increases the amount in the circulation. Thus, when this product reaches the skin, it can absorb and release light energy, initiating a phototoxic reaction.

Hopefully the researchers will find the cause of the problem affecting these fascinating creatures. A fact sheet and photographs of hairy nosed wombats may be found at http://www.wombania.com/wombats/hairy-nosed-wombat.htm. - Mod.TG
