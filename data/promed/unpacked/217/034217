An outbreak caused by monophasic _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium is rapidly evolving in 7 European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the United Kingdom (UK). As of 5 Apr 2022, 134 cases have been reported, mainly among children under 10 years old. The first case was identified in the UK on 7 Jan 2022. Since 17 Feb 2022, cases have also been identified elsewhere in Europe.

The outbreak is characterized by an unusually high proportion of children being hospitalized, some with severe clinical symptoms such as bloody diarrhea. Based on interviews with patients and initial analytical epidemiological studies, specific chocolate products have been identified as the likely route of infection. Affected cases have been identified through advanced molecular typing techniques. As this method of testing is not routinely performed in all countries, some cases may be undetected.

Product recalls have been launched in several countries to date, including Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the UK, to prevent the consumption of products potentially contaminated with salmonella. [Switzerland has also issued a recall: (https://www.coop.ch/en/promotion/recall--various-ferrero-products.html). - Mod.SH] Further investigations are being conducted by public health and food safety authorities in countries where cases are reported, to identify the cause and the extent of the contamination, and to ensure contaminated products are not put on the market.

ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control] and EFSA are assessing the available data from these countries and preparing a rapid outbreak assessment to be published in the week of 11 Apr 2022. Questions regarding ongoing product recalls should be addressed to national food safety authorities.

[This is a new official report from the European Food Safety Authority. It appears that now 9 countries in Europe are so far involved with the infection from a monophasic variant of _S._ Typhimurium and the case number is up to 134 with many cases requiring hospitalization. The serovar Typhimurium (4,[5],12:i:1,2) is the most frequently isolated serovar in cases of salmonellosis in Europe, and its monophasic variant (4,[5],12:i:-) has been increasingly responsible for salmonella outbreaks in humans. Monophasic _S._ Typhimurium has the Typhimurium O somatic antigens but not a complete set of flagellar (H) antigens.

"Kinder Surprise (Italian: Kinder Sorpresa or Ovetto Kinder), also known as Kinder Egg or Kinder Surprise Egg, is a milk chocolate consisting of a chocolate egg surrounding a yellow plastic capsule with a small toy inside. Manufactured by the Italian company Ferrero since 1974, [...] Kinder Surprise was originally created with children in mind, replicating an Italian Easter family tradition in which adults give children large chocolate eggs with toys inside. However, Kinder Surprise toys have become collectible for adults as well. Since 1974, 30 billion Kinder Surprise eggs have been sold worldwide" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder_Surprise).

The following is a relatively recent review of this organism:

Abstract
--------
"_Salmonella enterica_ remains an important foodborne pathogen in all regions of the world, with Typhimurium as one of the most frequent serotypes causing foodborne disease. However, the past 2 decades have seen a rapid worldwide emergence of a new salmonella serotype, namely monophasic variant of _S._ Typhimurium, whose antigenic formula is 1,4,[5],12:i:-. It has become one of the 2-5 most common salmonella serotypes responsible for animal and human infections in different regions. The global epidemic of monophasic S. 1,4,[5],12:i:- has mainly been characterized by an increase in multidrug-resistant _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:- isolated in Europe since 1997. The unexpected link to swine has escalated monophasic _S._ Typhimurium infections to the status of a global public health emergency. The large-scale application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in the last 10 years has revealed the phylogenetic associations of the bacterium and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. Local and global transmission reconstructed by WGS have shown that different clones have emerged following multiple independent events worldwide, and have elucidated the role of this zoonotic pathogen in the spread of AMR. This article discusses our current knowledge of the global ecology, epidemiology, transmission, bacterial adaptation, and evolution of this emerging salmonella serotype." - Mod.LL
