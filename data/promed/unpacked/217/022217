Re: Correction in 'African swine fever - Armenia: susp., RFI'
------------------------------------------------------------
The last passage in the above, today's posting reads:
"According to latest figures, more than 21 000 pigs have died in
areas bordering Georgia."
The above is erroneous; the correct text is the following:
"The Armenian zones at risk are those bordering Georgia, where --
according to available information -- the number of dead pigs in
Georgia has exceeded 21 000."
