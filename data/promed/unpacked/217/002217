Indonesia: avian influenza situation - WHO Update 13
----------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 14 Aug 2007, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia has
announced a new case of human infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A
29-year-old female from Bali Province developed symptoms on 3 Aug
2007 and was hospitalized on 7 Aug 2007. She died on 12 Aug 2007.
Investigations into the source of her infection indicate exposure to
sick and dead poultry.
The case's 5-year-old daughter was sick with a respiratory illness in
the days preceding the onset of illness in the confirmed case. The
daughter's onset of symptoms was 26 Jul 2007, she was hospitalized on
30 Jul 2007, but died without suspicion of avian influenza infection
on 3 Aug 2007 in the district hospital. The child had contact with
sick and dead poultry before becoming ill.
All of the household and healthcare worker contacts of the confirmed
case have been traced. All remain healthy and will continue to be
monitored for 10 days after their last contact with the case.
Of the 103 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 82 have been fatal.

There is no indication the deadly bird flu virus has been transferred
from human to human, federal Health Minister Tony Abbott says.
A 29-year-old Indonesian woman died of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird
flu at the weekend [11-12 Aug 2007] on the tourist resort island of
Bali. A 2-year-old girl admitted to hospital on Sunday [12 Aug] has
also been confirmed as being infected. [This has not yet been
confirmed by the Indonesian authorities or by WHO. - Mod.CP]
Contact with sick fowl is the most common way for humans to contract
the H5N1 virus. Mr Abbott said there was no reason to believe the
virus had mutated into a form easily spread among humans. "It is a
disease of birds which is very hard for humans to catch," Mr Abbott
told ABC Radio. "At the moment we have no reason to think that there
is human to human transmission."
Mr Abbott said if the virus did spread from human to human it could
lead to a global pandemic with the potential to kill millions. "If
there ever is a genetic shift that enables this disease to pass
easily from human to human then we'll be in a pandemic situation and
that will be a public health disaster of a kind that almost no one
alive has faced," he said. "We haven't got to that stage and
hopefully, we never will."
Australian authorities are closely monitoring the situation in
Indonesia and travel advice warns of the human deaths from the bird
flu. The death of the 29-year-old woman takes Indonesia's overall
death toll from the virus to 82.
