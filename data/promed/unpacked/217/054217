Egypt: New (13th) Human Case of Avian Influenza Suspected
-----------------------------------------------
The Egyptian authorities reported a new suspected human case of the
H5N1 strain of avian influenza on Wednesday [3 May 2006], bringing to
13 the total number of Egyptians who have been infected by the deadly
virus. The Health Ministry said late Tuesday [2 May 2006] that the
new case was detected in a 27-year-old woman who was infected by
poultry from her domestic rearing in the Nile Delta governorate of
Menufiya. [Confirmation by the NAMRU-3 laboratory in Cairo is
awaited. - Mod.CP]
"The tests carried out by the Health Ministry have confirmed that it
was the H5N1 virus," Abdel Sabur Shahin said, adding that the woman
had been hospitalized and was in stable condition. Out of the 12
other human cases that have been reported in Egyptians since
mid-March 2006, 4 were fatal, and 8 people recovered after being
treated with Tamiflu. A total of 205 people worldwide are confirmed
by the World Health Organization to have been infected, out of which,
113 died.
Experts say many cases go unreported. According to Egypt's Supreme
Committee to Combat Bird Flu, 20 out of the country's 26 governorates
have been affected by the bird flu epidemic [i.e. presumably
affecting poultry, since the number of confirmed human cases is only
13 according to this report. Previously, human cases have been
reported from the governorates of Al Qalyoubia, Gharbia, Kefr El
Sheikh, and Al Minufiyah. - Mod.CP].
Egypt, the most populous country in the Arab world, is on a major
route for migratory birds and is the hardest-hit non-Asian country
since the bird flu epidemic broke out in 2003.

Egypt: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 6
-----------------------------------------------
As of Thu 4 May 2006, the Ministry of Health in Egypt has announced
the country's 13th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. Tests conducted by both the national public health
laboratory and the Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit 3
(NAMRU-3) produced positive results. The patient is a 27-year-old
woman from Cairo who was hospitalized with bilateral pneumonia on 1
May. She is presently in stable condition.
Her infection has been linked to exposure to diseased poultry during
a recent visit to the Minufiyah governorate. While there, she stayed
in a household where numerous chickens were slaughtered.
The woman is the first new case in Egypt reported since early April.
Of the 13 laboratory-confirmed cases in Egypt, four were fatal. Eight
patients have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital.

Fifth Egyptian Dies of Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------
A fifth human victim of bird flu died in Egypt on Thursday, the state
news agency MENA said. The 27-year-old woman was hospitalised with
pneumonia on Monday. The World Health Organisation linked her
infection to exposure to diseased poultry during a recent visit to
the Nile Delta, outside Cairo. Health Ministry spokesman Abdel Rahman
Shahin, quoted by MENA, said she contracted the disease 10 days
before entering hospital, by which time the disease was already in an
advanced stage. People who have been in close contact with her have
been tested for the deadly virus and have all been negative, he said.
Egypt has reported a total of 13 human cases of the H5N1 virus in
humans. Five of them, all women, have now died. Essentially an animal
disease, the virus can infect people who come into close contact with
infected birds. It has infected 206 people since late 2003, killing
at least 114 of them, according to the World Heath Organisation.
Scientists say they are worried the virus could mutate into a form
that passes easily from person to person, sparking a pandemic in which
millions could die.
