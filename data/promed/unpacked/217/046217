[1] India: Covaxin
Date: Wed 3 Nov 2021

The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued an emergency use listing for India's Covaxin vaccine against COVID-19.

The jab "is extremely suitable for low- and middle-income countries due to easy storage requirements", the United Nations' health agency said in a statement on [Wed 3 Nov 2021] after its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts found it last month to have 78% efficacy after 2 doses spread over 4 weeks.

"This emergency use listing expands the availability of vaccines, the most effective medical tools we have to end the pandemic," said Mariangela Simao, WHO's assistant director-general for access to medicines and health products. "But we must keep up the pressure to meet the needs of all populations, giving priority to the at-risk groups who are still waiting for their 1st dose, before we can start declaring victory," she added.

Covaxin is the first vaccine completely developed and manufactured in India to receive WHO approval. To date [Wed 3 Nov 2021], the health agency has granted emergency approval to the vaccines made by AstraZeneca and its partner, the Serum Institute of India; Pfizer-BioNTech; Moderna; Johnson and Johnson; and the Chinese pharmaceuticals Sinopharm and Sinovac.

Nearly 29% of people in India have received at least one dose of Covaxin and more than 23% of people have received 2 jabs, according to Our World in Data.

Vaccines approved by the WHO can be used as part of the UN-backed COVAX effort to distribute COVID-19 jabs and to share doses with poorer countries. WHO's emergency use licensing for Covaxin should also mean that millions of Indians immunised with the shot will be allowed to travel internationally by countries that recognise vaccines authorised by WHO, including Britain, member states of the European Union, and Canada.

Covaxin was developed by Indian company Bharat Biotech in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research, the government's apex research body. Bharat Biotech welcomed the WHO approval and said it "validates the international safety and quality standards of Covaxin".

An expert group convened by WHO said there was insufficient data about the vaccine's safety and efficacy in pregnant women, but studies are being planned to address those questions. India's drug regulator authorised Covaxin in January [2021], months before extensive testing in people had been completed, prompting concern from health experts that the shot was given the nod prematurely. Bharat Biotech published results in July [2021] showing the vaccine was about 93% effective in preventing severe COVID-19 and roughly 65% effective against infection with the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus.

Despite India's repeated endorsement of its homegrown vaccine, Bharat Biotech has faced problems scaling up production. In July [2021], India's health ministry said the company was making 25 million doses of the vaccine on average each month and expected to increase monthly production to 58 million doses. The company says it is aiming to reach an annual capacity of 1bn doses by the end of 2021, or more than 80m shots each month, but has not responded to questions about its current capacity. Bharat Biotech said several other countries, including Brazil, the Philippines, Iran and Mexico, had also authorized its COVID-19 vaccine.

[2] US: future scenarios

America has lost the plot on COVID
----------------------------------
We're avoiding the hardest questions about living with the coronavirus long term.

We know how this ends: The coronavirus becomes endemic, and we live with it forever. But what we don't know -- and what the US seems to have no coherent plan for -- is how we are supposed to get there. We've avoided the hard questions whose answers will determine what life looks like in the next weeks, months, and years: How do we manage the transition to endemicity? When are restrictions lifted? And what long-term measures do we keep, if any, when we reach endemicity?

The answers were simpler when we thought we could vaccinate our way to herd immunity. But vaccinations in the US have plateaued. The delta variant and waning immunity against transmission mean herd immunity may well be impossible even if every single American gets a shot. So when COVID-related restrictions came back with the delta wave, we no longer had an obvious off-ramp to return to normal -- are we still trying to get a certain percentage of people vaccinated? Or are we waiting until all kids are eligible? Or for hospitalizations to fall and stay steady? The path ahead is not just unclear; it's nonexistent. We are meandering around the woods because we don't know where to go.

What is clear, however, is that case numbers, the metric that has guided much of our pandemic thinking and still underlies CDC's indoor-masking recommendation for vaccinated people, are becoming less and less useful. Even when we reach endemicity -- when nearly everyone has baseline immunity from either infection or vaccination -- the US could be facing tens of millions of infections from the coronavirus every year, thanks to waning immunity and viral evolution. (For context, the flu, which is also endemic, sickens roughly 10 to 40 million Americans a year.) But with vaccines available, not every case of COVID-19 is created equal. Breakthrough cases are largely mild; 10 000 of them will cause only a fraction of the hospitalizations and deaths of 10 000 COVID cases in the unvaccinated. The more highly vaccinated a community is, the less tethered case numbers are to the reality of the virus's impact.

So if not cases, then what? "We need to come to some sort of agreement as to what it is we're trying to prevent," says CÃ©line Gounder, an infectious-disease expert at New York University. "Are we trying to prevent hospitalization? Are we trying to prevent death? Are we trying to prevent transmission?" Different goals would require prioritizing different strategies. The booster-shot rollout has been roiled with confusion for this precise reason: The goal kept shifting. First, the Biden administration floated boosters for everyone to combat breakthroughs, then a CDC advisory panel restricted them to the elderly and immunocompromised most at risk for hospitalizations, then the CDC director overruled the panel to include people with jobs that put them at risk of infection.

On the ground, the US is now running an uncontrolled experiment with every strategy all at once. COVID-19 policies differ wildly by state, county, university, workplace, and school district. And because of polarization, they have also settled into the most illogical pattern possible: The least vaccinated communities have some of the laxest restrictions, while highly vaccinated communities -- which is to say those most protected from COVID-19 -- tend to have some of the most aggressive measures aimed at driving down cases. "We're sleepwalking into policy because we're not setting goals," says Joseph Allen, a Harvard professor of public health. We will never get the risk of COVID-19 down to absolute zero, and we need to define a level of risk we can live with.

Scientific experts have been reluctant to make that call themselves. For one, there is real scientific uncertainty ahead. We don't know how much immunity may continue to wane, how long the effects of a booster last, the exact incidence of long COVID in the vaccinated, or if a new variant will upend even the best-laid plans.

But the level of COVID-19 risk we can live with is also not an entirely scientific question. It is a social and political one that involves balancing both the costs and benefits of restrictions and grappling with genuine pandemic fatigue among the public. China, for example, has been brutally effective at suppressing COVID cases with strict lockdowns: Residents are barred from leaving locked-down neighborhoods; planes, trains, buses, and taxis in and to locked-down cities are being suspended; even vaccinated travelers are subject to mandatory quarantine. But are we willing to go that far? Currently, no. "This is the point at which we then have to start looking at ourselves and asking the hard question: Exactly how hard do we want to work to help how many people?" says Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard. By we, he means all of us and, in particular, the public officials who represent us. "I can give you a policy, and I can tell you, okay, if you do that, I think you will have that outcome," he says, but public officials need to first define what that policy is supposed to achieve.

One plausible goal is to focus on minimizing COVID-19's impact on hospitals. A collapsed health-care system means more people will die, not just of COVID-19 but from other treatable diseases and injuries. Elsewhere in the world, like in the UK and Germany, leaders have explicitly tied their policies to containing hospitalizations rather than all cases. But in addition to hospitalizations, Gounder suggests we should also consider the risk of long COVID. "I think for people that is the big question. We just don't know enough," she says. Preliminary data suggest vaccines do reduce the risk of long COVID, but exactly how much is unclear given the uncertainties in diagnosing it.

Once we've defined what we are trying to prevent, we can define thresholds for lifting and, if necessary, reinstating COVID-19 measures. This can actually be quite tricky if the goal is minimizing hospitalizations, a lagging indicator that gives you a picture of the past rather than the present. By the time hospitalizations start to rise, a bigger increase may already be baked in with people already infected but not yet sick enough to see a doctor. What to track instead?

Here are some answers I got from scientific experts: hospitalizations and deaths, but stratified by age and vaccination status; a combination of vaccination rate and local transmission; a combination of vaccination rate and hospitalizations; a combination of long COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths; a combination of case growth rate, testing uptake, vaccination rate, and hospitalizations. If this seems confusing, why not consider a real-life example? San Francisco and 7 other Bay Area counties recently set 3-pronged criteria for lifting indoor mask mandates: (1) Community transmission is moderate, as defined by CDC, for at least 3 weeks, (2) hospitalization numbers are low and stable, and (3) 80% of the total population is fully vaccinated or 8 weeks have passed since COVID-19 vaccines have been available for kids age 5 to 11.

If we are in fact going to try keeping hospitalizations stable, one reason to define this goal now is to untangle this mess of what data to track. Then, we can get to outlining specific tactics in the weeks and months ahead. ... -more

[It is recommended that the entire article be read. It is too long to post in ProMED. But it discusses important considerations, for example, how to diminish long term risk. "A Financial Times analysis of data from the U.K. found vaccinating 25 000 children had the same effect on hospitalizations as vaccinating just 800 adults over age 60. Unvaccinated elderly adults are just that much more likely to become severely ill with COVID-19." Therefore, vaccination of young children is a step in the right direction to diminish spread, but it is more important to focus on getting a higher proportion of the elderly population immunized. In addition, ventilation systems need to be updated to filter the virus, and more. - Mod.LK]

[A] Dire situation in hospitals
Date: Mon 1 Nov 2021
Source: 9News [edited]
https://www.9news.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/colorado-bioethicist-hospital-situation/73-f522dd03-adc7-401f-a26d-12ab71c6629d


"I fear that people think that things are OK, and they're not OK right now," Dr Matt Wynia said. "We're not OK." With no mask mandates or capacity restrictions in Colorado, life might seem closer to normal again. But Dr Wynia, the director for the Center of Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado, sees another side. "If you're outside and the sun is out and the glory of fall is all around you, you don't realize that our healthcare system is not just at a breaking point -- there are places where it's breaking," Wynia said.

As Colorado hits its highest number of hospitalizations since December [2020], governor Jared Polis signed an executive order that gives the state control of hospital admissions and transfers.

This order paves the way for crisis standards of care to be activated. "It's not a choice whether to make these kinds of decisions," said Wynia, who was on the team that helped craft Colorado's Crisis Standards of Care during the pandemic. The document details how decisions need to be made when healthcare institutions become overwhelmed. Wynia said hospitals are being forced to use crisis care strategies right now.

"I think that it's correct that no one is saying right now there's a patient who needs a ventilator and can't get one," he said. "That's not happening. What is already happening is that there are patients who really ought to be in an intensive care unit but instead they're in an emergency room. Or they ought to be in a step-down unit but instead they're on the floor. Or they ought to be getting one-to-one nursing, and instead they're getting two-to-one, or three-to-one nursing because we just don't have enough people to take care of all the folks who need care right now."

The biggest ethical issue Colorado faces, according to Wynia, is choosing where to transfer patients and move staff, since hospitals in areas with a less vaccinated population are more overwhelmed than hospitals in areas with a higher percentage of people vaccinated against COVID-19.

"And that's uncomfortable for the ones that have capacity still, because, you know, you don't want to get to full capacity, but when we've got areas of the state, it is our responsibility to balance the load across the whole state," Wynia said. He said load balancing was the reason for the executive orders on Sunday [31 Oct 2021]. Ultimately, Wynia said, people need to remember the actions we took last year [2020] to help ease the burden of healthcare workers.

"And we're doing everything we can," he said. "But we need the public to do their part as well, which means start doing the stuff that you were doing last winter when people were scared of catching this illness. I fear that people think that things are OK and they're not OK right now. We're not OK."

[B] US (Colorado): cases surge
Date: Wed 3 Nov 2021

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/colorado-hospitals-allowed-turn-away-patients-amid-covid-19-surge-n1283161


Hospitals in Colorado are being allowed to turn away patients as the state experiences its worst COVID surge in a year. An order signed on Sunday [31 Oct 2021] by governor Jared Polis gives health care professionals the authority to prioritize crisis care under the direction of the state health department.

While the state has a nearly 80% partial vaccination rate, unvaccinated people with severe COVID-19 are overwhelming hospitals, many of which reported being over 90% capacity, according to Scott Bookman, COVID-19 incident commander for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

"If you are unvaccinated, a regular trip to the grocery store, a night out to dinner are more dangerous than they have been at any point during this pandemic," Polis said Monday [1 Nov 2021] in COVID-19 update. "The delta variant is brutally effective at seeking out the unvaccinated, like a laser-guided missile."

A total of 1358 COVID patients were hospitalized across Colorado on Wednesday [3 Nov 2021], almost a 50% increase from the 909 COVID patients hospitalized on [3 Oct 2021], according to the state's COVID-19 dashboard. COVID hospitalization rates have been steadily growing since a summer low in Colorado, with 455 reported at the start of August [2021]. Polis said the state has the 5th-highest number of COVID cases in the country.

The majority of COVID hospitalizations are among unvaccinated people, "at somewhere between 80 and 90% across Colorado," said Dr Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection control and prevention for UCHealth, the largest hospital in the Denver area. She said the executive order will allow health care workers, "who are obviously stretched," to make calls that prioritize urgency and possibly reduce overcrowding in hospitals.

Doctors and nurses have been taking extra shifts and working overtime to meet the growing need, said Dr Eric Poeschla, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Colorado Hospital, where 85% of all COVID patients are unvaccinated. Besides getting vaccinated, a more holistic approach to COVID-19 prevention might better protect the most vulnerable and reduce hospitalizations, he said. "The most sensible strategy, I think, is a combination of vaccination, boosting, masking, limiting indoor gatherings without masking," Poeschla. "Attention to all those things at once really helps."

Vaccinated people in Colorado are not required to wear masks in most indoor settings, while studies show that a vaccinated person's viral load may be similar to that of an unvaccinated person. Although the state's partially vaccinated rate is comparatively high nationwide, the state must reach around a 90% rate to avoid another surge, he said.

Until more people are vaccinated, each precaution will protect those who cannot get vaccinated or who have serious breakthrough cases, Barron said. While the "vast majority" of COVID-19 patients in Colorado hospitals are unvaccinated, the vaccinated hospitalizations represent the state's most physically vulnerable population. Among the roughly 20% of vaccinated people hospitalized for COVID-19, many are over 65 or have underlying comorbidities that lead to immunosuppression, like cancer patients who need chemotherapy, she said. "When you have a vulnerable host and then you have delta in play, which is much more infectious and much more transmissible, it's the perfect storm where all you need is one community to be vulnerable who can then get impacted and then expose more people, and it just keeps the momentum," Barron said. "Like a wildfire."

[The hospital situation in Colorado is beyond serious. The fact that the "majority of Covid hospitalizations are among unvaccinated people, at somewhere between 80 and 90% across Colorado" could not be a stronger message. Vaccination is critical for protection, especially when masks are not being required for vaccinated people who can still spread the virus to unvaccinated individuals. - Mod.LK]
