Meningitis kills hundreds in Africa
----------------------------------
At least 200 people have died in a meningitis epidemic in the
Nigerian state of Zamfara in the past 3 days. Women, children, and
middle-aged men are the groups most affected by the epidemic.
Last week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that
millions of people across Africa are to be vaccinated against a new
killer strain of meningitis.
The governor of Zamfara state, Mammam Bawa, said that medical teams
with vaccines would be sent to the 4 councils affected by the
epidemic. Mr Bawa said in a broadcast that tents had already been
erected for an isolation camp where patients will be treated to
prevent the epidemic spreading. The BBC's Ibrahim Dossara in Zamfara
says that some rural people are not getting vaccinated because they
do not believe it protects them.
Officials have urged people to go for free consultations in the
nearest health center to check for the first symptoms of meningitis,
which include fever, headaches, and a stiffening of the neck.
Last week, the WHO said it had shipped an initial batch of 100 000
vaccines to Burkina Faso. The decision followed fears of a possible
epidemic across what health chiefs describe as Africa's meningitis
belt, which stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia.
The vaccine will protect against the more common meningitis strains A
and C and also the virulent W135 strain. This strain of the disease
was found in sporadic cases on the continent last year.

UN Distributes Cheap Meningitis Vaccine in Africa
-------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it has begun
distribution of an inexpensive meningitis vaccine in Africa designed
to fight strains of the disease that include a new strain that has
been ravaging Burkina Faso. The ACW135 vaccine will act against
meningitis A and meningitis C, the more common versions of the
illness, and will fight the W135 strain that infected thousands of
people in Burkina Faso in 2002.
The group said that 21 countries in the "African meningitis area,"
from Ethiopia in the east to Senegal in the west, will receive as
many as 3 million doses of the vaccine at prices that reflect their
various levels of financial need. The WHO said that it asked for help
from pharmaceutical companies on the manufacture of the vaccine, and
GlaxoSmithKline responded within just a few months with the vaccine
as requested, while the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation paid for
most of the cost of the project.

Meningococcal disease in Burkina Faso - Update
---------------------------------
In the week of 26 Jan-2 Feb 2003, the Ministry of Health has reported
369 cases and 58 deaths in the country ( see previous report below).
Of the 53 districts in Burkina Faso, 4 districts have reached the
epidemic threshold: Batie, Leo, Sapone, and Manga (in alert phase but
neighboring a district in the epidemic phase); and 7 districts are in
the alert phase: Dande, Nanoro, Reo, Titao, Zabre, and Zorgho.
The Crisis Committee established by the Ministry of Health is
implementing measures to contain the outbreak. WHO, with its partners
in the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for
Epidemic Meningitis Control (ICG) is working to provide Burkina Faso
with the trivalent vaccine recently made available. This vaccine,
which covers _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups A, C, and W135 will
be used to respond to the needs of countries in the African
meningitis belt.

During 1-26 Jan 2003, the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso has
reported 980 cases and 196 deaths (case-fatality rate, 20 percent) in
the country. On 26 Jan 2003, 4 districts, Batie, Kossodo, Manga, and
Tenkodogo, were in the alert phase, although none had crossed the
epidemic threshold.
For more details about the epidemic threshold principle, see the
article, "Detecting meningococcal meningitis epidemics in
highly-endemic African countries" in the Weekly Epidemiological
Record.
<http://www.who.int/wer/pdf/2000/wer7538.pdf>
Of a total of 28 specimens collected in 3 districts (Nanoro, Paul VI,
Pissy), the National Public Health Laboratory has confirmed
_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W135 in 10 samples, _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_ in 8, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b in 4. The
Ministry of Health is implementing control measures to contain the
outbreak, including the pre-positioning of laboratory materials and
oily chloramphenicol at district level, enhanced epidemiological
surveillance, training of health personnel, and social mobilization
in communities.

Several Die From CSM Outbreak
------------------------------------
Several people are reported dead in the Sawla-Kalba area of the Bole
District in the Northern Region following an outbreak of
cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) in the area. Since the beginning of
January 2003 when the outbreak was reported, 3 people die almost
every day, while many of the victims were hospitalized.
The intervention of the Ministry of Health in the area has, however,
brought the situation under control. Mr Joseph Trumah Bayel, Member
of Parliament for Sawla-Kalba, told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) in
Accra on Tuesday that following the outbreak, the Tuna-Wura, Abdulai
Ewuntomah, had placed a temporary ban on the celebrations of funerals
in the Soma area where most of the people are affected.
The MP said even though the situation had been brought under control,
there was the need to take prompt action before the setting in of the
hot weather in the northern regions.
Mr Bayel appealed to the Ministry of Health to send enough vaccines
to the area to contain the situation before it gets out of hand. He
also advised the people to refrain from sleeping in congested rooms
since that was likely to compound the spread of the disease.

3rd Week of 2003 (Week ending 19 Jan 2003) [edited]

A meningoccocal meningitis outbreak is going on in Nebbi district.
The district reported 32 cases with one death in the week, compared
to 9 cases reported in the previous week. Laboratory investigations
isolated _Neisseria meningitidis_ type A as the causative organism. A
total of 18 other districts reported sporadic cases of suspected
meningitis. The ministry of health is working with the Nebbi DHT to
investigate and control the outbreak.

Vaccine Beating Killer Disease
-------------------------------
Cases of meningitis are declining fast in South Devon as a new
vaccine begins to take effect. The meningitis C vaccine [the newer
conjugated serotype C vaccine - Mod.LL] was introduced just over 3
years ago. The latest figures of 40 cases in the last year are less
than half the peak of 82 cases reached in 2000. The news comes as the
peak season for meningitis and septicaemia draws near. Parents are
being warned to remain vigilant for the flu-like symptoms of the
different strains of meningitis. The vaccination program is now
available to everyone under the age of 24, and is routinely given to
babies.

Meningitis Total Dropped by 122
----------------------------------
Speaking at the launch of Meningitis Awareness Month, which runs
through Feb 2003, Ireland's Minister of State for Health and
Children, Brian Lenihan, reported that the total number of
[meningococcal] meningitis cases last year dropped by 122, in large
part because of the success of the [conjugated - Mod.LL] meningitis C
vaccine. In all, there were 274 cases of bacterial meningitis
reported in Ireland in 2002, including 12 cases that resulted in
death.
Most of the cases were caused by group B meningitis, for which there
is currently no vaccine; however, cases of meningitis C totaled just
14 last year, down from 139 in 2000, reflecting the impact of the
vaccine against the strain. Lenihan also called on individuals
between the ages of 18 and 22 years to get immunized against
meningitis C, noting that coverage for this age group was not as high
as had been expected.
