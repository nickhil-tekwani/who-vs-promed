South Korea's quarantine agency said [Wed 20 Dec 2017] at least 2 strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza have entered the nation via migratory birds this winter [2017-18].

The Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (APQA) announced the results of DNA analysis into viruses detected at 2 duck farms in Gochang [North Jeolla province] and Yeongam [South Jeolla Province].

The virus discovered in Gochang on [19 Nov 2017] was the H5N6 bird flu, which arose from the reassortment between a highly pathogenic H5N8 that spread in Europe in late 2016 and a low-pathogenic N6 virus, the APQA said.

It was identical to the one found on the southern island of Jeju from [27 Nov to 2 Dec 2017].

The strain discovered in Yeongam on 10 Dec 2017 was also H5N6, but its viral sequence had a slightly different pattern from the one in Gochang, it noted.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza is due to a variety of viruses that cause severe disease in birds and result in high death rates, according to the World Health Organization.

South Korea has been stepping up quarantine measures in duck farms in its southwestern region as a fresh outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu caused alarm in the major duck producing area.

Quarantine officials culled 76 000 ducks at 5 duck farms located within a 3 kilometer [2 mi] radius of the affected site earlier this month [December 2017] as Jeolla province is the nation's largest duck producing region.

Last year [2016], South Korea slaughtered more than 30 million birds to contain the worst outbreak of bird flu to have hit the country.

[The outbreak in Gochang (North Jeolla) was published reported to the OIE, as published in 20171121.5456037. The 1st OIE report of the outbreak in Yeongam (South Jeolla) is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=25442 and a follow up report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=25483.

The detection of a "slightly different pattern" of the viral sequence in the Yeongam event deserves to be followed-up. This finding reminds the importance of consistent avian influenza surveillance activities, addressing both domestic as well as wild birds. A recent comment by David Thomson (who since 2009 has been consistently advocating in ProMED-mail the importance of AI surveillance) also merits attention. David submitted the following comment in response to posting 20171217.5509581:

"Further to the excellent commentary and summations by Naomi Honhold and the moderator, perhaps an issue that warrants some additional attention is that of local virus-susceptible (not the same as disease-susceptible) host population dynamics, particularly with regard to apparent reassortment and conversion-to-increased-virulence events.

"Most of these events appear to be associated by circulation of AIV's (potentially also if/when masked by inadequately matched vaccines) within comparatively sizeable or dense local host populations, including communal wild bird nesting and fledging sites, communal migratory bird way-sites, live bird and domestic poultry markets and trading chains and, when biosecurity is sub-optimal, comparatively intensive domesticated poultry and other susceptible host species production sites.

"The logical progression from this is the importance of properly structured surveillance, including via molecular typing, of AIV's to detect and respond to them before they are able to "circulate" for too long in any sizeable/dense localized population of susceptible host animals (such as birds, pigs, humans).

"Surveillance must not be sacrificed on the basis of claims of "improved biosecurity" (at least not without very compelling evidence that it is ineffective -- which is not synonymous with simple lack of detection over time)."
