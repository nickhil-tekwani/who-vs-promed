A group of farmers from southern Taiwan's Tainan County [Taiwan
province] seek an increase in government subsidies.

A farmer said he has suffered heavy losses by typhoons. "The disease
of rice blast has also damaged my crops," he said, adding that
government officials did not discover this during their inspections.

The government should help them recover from natural disasters, he said.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ (synonyms
_Pyricularia oryzae_, _P. grisea_). It is one of the most destructive
diseases of rice worldwide with potential yield losses of more than 50
percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, stem rot
and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the
infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at
the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed.
More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by
different strains of the fungus, but most strains isolated from rice
can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is spread by infected plant debris,
mechanical means (including insect activity), water, and wind. Disease
management may include fungicides and cultural practices, but relies
mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable
and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

Severe weather like the typhoons reported above is likely to increase
pathogen spread as well as providing additional entry points for
infections via wounds in the damaged plants.
