SEPTORIA, WHEAT AND BARLEY - FRANCE: (LOWER NORMANDY))

There have been ongoing problems with winter wheat and barley crops
in the St James area of lower Normandy. We do not grow oats or rye
here. The problems started when late sown winter wheat and barley
were hit by the cold which started mid-December 2009 and carried on
all through the winter with snow and temperatures of -10 deg C [14
deg F] and below. The young roots were frozen in the earth and did
not develop properly.

Spring 2010 remained cold until now [13 May 2010] and was very dry
indeed. Plants are stressed. I was asked to collect samples from 6
different farms, all about 1 km [0.6 mi] apart or more, for analysis.
The technician from the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that the
cereals had the fungal infection _Septoria tritici_. However, this is
a fungus that we usually get when it is warm and damp, and it is of
interest to farmers that this fungus should infect these cereals
(wheat and barley) during a period of really cold, dry weather.

Farmers will start spraying against this. This infection may be all
over Normandy/Northern France. Every field we have here is infected,
and nearly every little plant.

[Cereal diseases of the septoria complex are caused by the fungi
_Mycosphaerella graminicola_ (previously _Septoria tritici_) and
_Phaeosphaeria_ (previously _Stagonospora_) _nodorum_. They affect
mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some
grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may
occur at any time during the growth of the plant and on any portion
of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which
reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host with up to 50 percent
yield losses reported on susceptible varieties. Septoria is
considered the most important foliar disease of winter wheat in parts
of Europe (for example, the UK).

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain
splash), and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop
debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management
includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease
becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy,
removal of inoculum sources, and use of resistant varieties.

Septoria infection in winter wheat crops has also been reported
recently from northern Germany (ProMED-mail post 20100428.1370).
