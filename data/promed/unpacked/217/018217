JM Reynes, D Carli, N Boukezia, M Debruyne, S Herti. Tula hantavirus infection in a hospitalized patient, France, June 2015.

Summary
-------
We report an infection with Tula virus in June 2015, leading to hospitalisation, in a patient living approximately 60 km [about 37 miles] east of Paris with no previous remarkable medical history. Clinical symptoms were limited to a fever syndrome with severe headache. The main laboratory findings included thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminase levels. Based on S (small) gene sequence analysis, the strain affecting the patient was closely related to strains detected in Central Europe, especially to a south-east German strain.

Background
----------
In Europe, 5 zoonotic hantaviruses have been described: Dobrava-Belgrade (DOBV), PUUV, Saaremaa, SEOV and TULV. Among these, PUUV and DOBV are responsible for most human infections, causing mild to severe haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The pathogenic potential of TULV in humans is not well known. Although, this virus was found in rodent samples from numerous European countries (including France) after its 1st identification in 1994 from _Microtus_ spp. rodents [voles] sampled in 1987 in Tula (Russia), it has only been reported once in humans, from an immunocompromised patient.

Epidemiological investigation
-----------------------------
The investigation was limited to an interview of the patient. The patient lived in a small rural village, surrounded by flat open fields of corn, wheat and sugar beets, in the west part of the Seine-et-Marne department (ca 60 km east of Paris). He was working as an aircraft engine technician. During the 6 weeks before disease onset, he had often thrown away, barehanded, voles (unidentified species) taken back home by his pet cat. He reported during that period one bite by a live vole. Other potential sources of contamination were not reported.

Discussion
----------
TULV infection in humans without symptoms has been serologically documented. However, evidence of disease in patients is rare with only 3 such cases being reported. Among these, one, which occurred after a wild rodent bite remained controversial, as clinical symptoms were more compatible with rat-bite fever and late seroconversion suggested that although TULV infection may have occurred, it was perhaps not responsible for the symptoms. From the 3 reported symptomatic cases, TULV was detected in only one, who was immunocompromised. The molecular evidence of TULV infection in our patient confirms the pathogenic potential of TULV, as this lead to hospitalisation. Furthermore, we mainly observed a fever syndrome with an alteration of the liver function, whereas the 2 previous non-controversial cases reported, both exhibited a renal and pulmonary syndrome. Reported cases are too rare to draw any conclusions about the main tropism of TULV.

[This interesting case adds another pathogen to rule out when diagnosing febrile disease in Europe. It would be of interest to carry out a serological survey of people living in the region where this case occurred, to determine the proportion of individuals there who have been infected, likely without developing any symptoms or very mild ones.
