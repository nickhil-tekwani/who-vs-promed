The North West has had a spate of serious brucellosis infections, with the Local Land Services (LLS) confirming 3 pig hunting dogs have recently tested positive for the _Brucella suis_ strain of the disease, which originates in pigs.

LLS biosecurity and emergencies manager Shaun Slattery said all 3 dogs tested positive for brucellosis following suspected contact with infected feral pigs in the Moree area [northern New South Wales]. "The dogs presented separately to private veterinarians with clinical signs suggestive of brucellosis infection, including fever, vomiting, back pain, blood in urine, lethargy, and enlarged testicles," Dr Slattery said.

Department of Primary Industries (DPI) pigs and poultry senior veterinary officer Amanda Lee said NSW had seen an increase in the number of dogs presenting to vets with suspected brucellosis infection.

"Brucellosis is a serious infectious disease of pigs that can be passed on to other animals and people through contact with urine, blood, saliva, and reproductive materials," Dr Lee said. "The cases we have seen in dogs in NSW have been either as a result of direct contact with an infected feral pig or pig meat, contact with another infected dog, or as a result of the disease being passed on to a pup at birth."

The DPI recommends that dogs infected with brucellosis be euthanased because of the potential risk to people. Anyone who is concerned that their dog may have signs of brucellosis should contact their local veterinarian to have it assessed.

Veterinarians should notify Dr Lee by phone (02) 4640 6308 or email (<amanda.lee@dpi.nsw.gov.au>).

[According to Australia's annual OIE report for 2013, _Brucella suis_ is a notifiable disease which had been last recorded in domestic animals in 2010 and in wildlife (wild boars) in December 2012. "Animal Health Australia (2010)" reported that _B. suis_ is confined to some populations of feral pigs in Queensland and was detected in a free-range piggery in Queensland in the last quarter of 2010. "The _B. suis_ Accredited Herd Scheme is administered by Biosecurity Queensland on behalf of the industry and currently (2010) has 11 member herds. The scheme aims to ensure piggery freedom from _B. suis_ and to provide a secure source of disease-free breeding stock for pig producers."

_B. suis_ is a public health concern in Australia, being mainly a recreational or occupational disease of feral pig hunters, farm workers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers. According to NSW's Department of Primary Industries (2012), "80 per cent of cases occur in Queensland, with the majority of cases in men aged between 15 and 49 years. Between December 2006 and December 2011, 9 men from NSW were diagnosed with swine brucellosis following regular recreational or occupational feral pig hunting in North West NSW. All men had butchered feral pigs without wearing any protective clothing."

Orchitis is one of the predominant symptoms of _B. suis_ infection in pigs and dogs.
