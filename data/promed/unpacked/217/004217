Cyclospora outbreak investigations are notorious for being very difficult to pinpoint the vehicle and/or the source.

I remember talking to Iowa Dept. of Public Health (IDPH) Medical Director and State Epidemiologist, Dr. Patricia Quinlisk on the radio show during the 2013 outbreak, and listened to her describe the investigation saying she was optimistic that investigators will be able to figure out the source of the outbreak, at least at a certain level. However, they may not be able to pinpoint the exact farm where the tainted veggies came from.

In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say identifying the particular food item/ingredient that caused an outbreak of cyclosporiasis can be very challenging.

Sometimes the food vehicle/source is identified, sometimes not. Since 2000, about 20 Cyclospora outbreak investigations came up empty concerning this information.

The current outbreak of cyclosporiasis in the US has topped 1000 cases year-to-date (1031 to be exact) with a little more than half (578) being locally transmitted from 36 states. As of [Wed 20 Sep 2017], federal health officials report no specific vehicle of interest has been identified, and investigations to identify a potential source (or sources) of infection are ongoing.

Historically, previous outbreaks have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce (e.g., basil, cilantro, mesclun lettuce, raspberries, and snow peas).

[The outbreak is still unfolding with the case numbers increasing from 988 the [22 Sep 2017] to 1031 in this report. Outbreaks of cyclosporiasis are a returning event in the United Stated and have always been linked to some kind of fresh produce as mentioned above. The multistate outbreak illustrates that centralized food manufacture with a wide distribution, probably from a single manufacturer with a contaminated product, can very effectively spread an infectious agent. - Mod.EP
