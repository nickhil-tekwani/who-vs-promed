Mongolian authorities are battling to contain Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD),
which is spinning out of control in the eastern part of the country. The
disease has spread to 11 counties of the Dornod, Suhbaator, and Hentiy
provinces in the east
The central government has decided to expand isolation areas and more
animals would receive vaccination. Meanwhile, the Ulan Bator municipality
has ordered extra measures to fend off the epidemic from the capital.
In Dornod and Suhbaator, some 1.6 million animals had been checked, 300 000
of them vaccinated. In the worst affected areas, some 60 000 livestock were
found infected and are being slaughtered. The government is isolating farms
in Kentiy province after new cases of FMD were reported at the end of last
month.
The spread of FMD is another heavy blow to herders of the landlocked
country. Heavy snowstorms have killed more than 1.4 million head of cattle
so far this year.

Vaccination is Underway in Mongolia to Contain Foot and Mouth Epidemic
--------------------------------------------
An intensive vaccination is underway in the quarantined area affected by
FMD in the eastern provinces in Mongolia, said an official of the State
Emergency Commission of Mongolia on Friday.
According to the official, the first batch of the vaccine imported from
Russia was being distributed to vaccinate 1.4 million livestock, and a
total of 3.4 million ampoules of vaccine will be imported to stop the
disease from spreading.
The Mongolian government declared a quarantine on 10 Feb 2001 in Sukhbaatar
and Dornod provinces in the east of Mongolia, in which more than a hundred
cows have died of the extremely contagious disease and more than 800 tested
positive.
Some newspapers here Friday reported FMD has spread to the Hentii province,
which is near Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolial. The Mongolian
government has declared a quarantine in some counties of Hentii province.

Cattle in the Chelyabinsk region of Western Siberia have been under threat
of being infected with FMD as a result of migration of wild animals from
Mongolia.
Eduard Popov, a duty officer of the Krasnoyarsk regional headquarters for
emergency situations, told Itar-Tass that approximately 3000 rams have
crossed into the Russian territory in search of food [that is scarce in
Mongolia, where incidents of FMD were reported. Although no cases of the
cattle epidemic have been diagnosed in the Chita region yet, an emergency
regime was introduced there.
A ban has been imposed on imports of all kinds of cattle from Mongolia and
exports of all kinds of meat and dairy products from the Chita region.
