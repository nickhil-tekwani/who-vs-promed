Daniele Inc added more than 17 000 pounds of sopressata to an earlier
recall of pepper-coated meats and ended its relationship with the
spice supplier who gave it black pepper tied to a national salmonella
outbreak. The pepper, which was imported from Viet Nam, was found to
be contaminated with the same strain that has been linked to the USA
outbreak, Daniele said late on Sun 31 Jan 2010.

The 3 products recalled on 31 Jan 2010 may have been exposed to the
black pepper during production, Daniele said. The company also said it
has changed the specifications for all its spices, and is now using
only irradiated pepper.

Daniele's latest recall includes 17 235 pounds of 2 bulk Calabrese
Sopressata Flat products produced after 7 Nov 2010. The products being
recalled are: Calabrese Sopressata Flat Bulk, lot 271, with sell by
dates of 16 and 18 Dec 2010; Hot Calabrese Sopressata Flat Bulk, lots
465, 434, 228 and 333; and Boar's Head Hot Sopressata Calabrese,
produced on 28 Nov and 9 Dec 2009.

Daniele International Inc. has recalled ready-to-eat varieties of
Italian sausage products, including salami, which are regulated by the
USDA. Some of the products contain black pepper, which is regulated by
the FDA. Recent test results provided by the Rhode Island Department
of Health revealed that an opened container of black pepper used in
the manufacturing of at least some of the recalled products was
positive for _S._ Montevideo and that the DNA fingerprint matched the
outbreak strain: <http://www.ri.gov/press/view/10647>.

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS),
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the State of Rhode Island
to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_]
serotype Montevideo infections. Investigators are using DNA analysis
of bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing to identify cases of
illness that may be part of this outbreak.

As of 9:00 pm EST on 28 Jan 2010, a total of 202 individuals infected
with a matching strain of _S._ Montevideo have been reported from 42
states and District of Columbia since July 1, 2009. The number of ill
persons identified in each state with this strain is as follows: AK
(1), AL (2), AZ (5), CA (30), CO (4), CT (4), DC (1), DE (2), FL (3),
GA (3), IA (1), ID (2), IL (11), IN (3), KS (3), LA (1), MA (12), MD
(1), ME (1), MI (3), MN (4), MO (1), NC (9), ND (1), NE (1), NH (1),
NJ (7), NM (2), NY (16), OH (9), OK (1), OR (9), PA (5), RI (2), SC
(1), SD (3), TN (4), TX (7), UT (7), VA (1), WA (15), WV (1), and WY
(2). Because this is a commonly occurring strain, public health
investigators may determine that some of the illnesses are not part of
this outbreak.

Among the persons with reported dates available, illnesses began
between 4 Jul 2009 and 11 Jan 2010. Infected individuals range in age
from less than 1 year old to 93 years old and the median age is 37
years. 53 percent of patients are male. Among the 148 patients with
available information, 38 (26 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths
have been reported.

CDC and its public health partners are continuing the epidemiologic
investigation to verify that the outbreak is controlled. CDC,
USDA-FSIS, and FDA continue to work closely to identify the specific
products or ingredients that became contaminated and how the
contamination occurred and to identify any other food vehicles that
may be involved.

The FDA is investigating the supply chain of the black pepper used in
the manufacturing of the recalled meat products. The Agency has
collected and is currently analyzing black pepper samples. To date,
all the samples collected and analyzed by the FDA have tested
negative, however, sample collection and analysis continues.

[The number of cases, states, and recalled products has increased
somewhat. ProMED-mail reminds its readers that a previous 2009
salmonellosis outbreak due to serotype Rissen was associated with salt
and pepper and can be found in the "see alsos" below. Soppressata is a
salami specialty of southern Italy, and often includes pepper. - Mod.LL]
