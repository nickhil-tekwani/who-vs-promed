Subject: Weekly update on the Zika outbreak in Yap State, Federated
States of Micronesia [edited].
The rate of new cases that present at the Yap Memorial Hospital and
the Community Health Center sites has significantly slowed. There was
one new probable case with onset in the past week [9-13 Jul 2007]. No
new lab results have been returned this week. That leaves the total
cases that presented to health care with 60 confirmed cases (by PCR
and IgM analysis) and 67 probable cases. Probable cases have been
identified in the neighboring islands and arrangements are ongoing to
get blood samples for confirmation.
A travel advisory for all in-bound and out-bound passengers to Yap
remains in effect. It asks that individuals visiting Yap avoid
mosquito bites. If a visitor to Yap falls ill while in Yap or after
returning home, they are requested to report to a health
professional. In order to reduce the risk of infecting other islands
or other countries, individuals are strongly advised not to travel if
they are feeling ill. Health professionals who suspect Zika in a
patient (especially with recent travel to Yap) are asked to
immediately inform their local health department and the FSM
Department of Health at (691) 320-2619 or the Yap Epinet Team at
yapepinet@fsmhealth.fm. To reduce the risk of establishing local
transmission, patients should be instructed to avoid mosquito
exposure during their acute illness.
Yap State Department of Health Services' community survey continues
with the assistance of the CDC, WHO, FSM National Government and
Institut Pasteur.
A short revised summary of the Yap Zika outbreak is below:
Zika is a flavivirus that is similar to the dengue virus, causing
similar but milder symptoms. Like dengue, it is transmitted by
mosquitoes. It was 1st identified in 1947 in rhesus monkey serum in
Uganda. In 1978 a small outbreak of acute fever in Indonesia was
caused by Zika virus. From the limited cases reported in the
literature, Zika is not believed to have long term health effects in
people. There is no evidence that this infection has affected
pregnant women or their babies in the past.
On 22 Jun 2007 blood specimens collected by Yap Department of Health
Services and tested at CDC labs showed that the recent illness on Yap
is likely caused by the ZIKA virus.
The Yap outbreak appears to have started in April 2007 and to have
peaked in late May [2007], however cases continue to present. In this
outbreak the symptoms are mild and generally last for 4-7 days. A
probable case is defined as illness in a resident or visitor to Yap
State with onset since 15 Mar 2007 and 2 of the 3 following signs or symptoms:
* a maculopapular rash involving the trunk and extremities that is
sometimes pruritic.
* conjunctivitis; or
* joint pain, that can affect both large joint and the smaller joints
of the hands and feet.
Other symptoms that have been noted in the Yap outbreak include
fever, retro-orbital eye pain, headache, myalgias, lower extremity
edema, lymphadenopathy, and diarrhea.
Traditionally, illness caused by Zika was termed "Zika
Fever." However most fevers have been subjectively reported;
measured fever has been an inconsistent feature of this Zika outbreak.
Rapid tests used in Yap for Dengue have given false positive results
on patients with Zika virus (PanBio and Pentax).

[There have been no indications or even speculations as to where the
Zika virus in Yap came from. It is yet another good example of the
unexpected appearance of a pathogen in what would seem to be an
unlikely place. It makes one wonder if Zika virus infections
elsewhere are misdiagnosed as classical dengue fever or chikungunya
virus infections, underscoring the need for good laboratory support.
ProMED again thanks Dr. Bel for his interesting and timely reports.
It is fortunate that the epidemic is declining. ProMED requests
information as to which mosquitoes are the Zika virus vectors on Yap.
