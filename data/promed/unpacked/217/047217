A 3rd person died this week in Argentina from pneumonia of unknown origin, local health authorities said on Thursday [1 Sep 2022].

Nine people in northwestern Tucuman province have been infected by the mysterious respiratory illness, including 8 medical staff at the same private clinic, and 3 have died since Monday [29 Aug 2022], Tucuman health minister Luis Medina Ruiz told reporters.

Authorities are conducting tests on the illness, but Medina said they have ruled out COVID, flu and influenza types A and B. Samples have been sent to the prestigious Malbran Institute in Buenos Aires.

The 3rd victim was a 70-year-old patient admitted to the same clinic where staff have been infected, ahead of a surgical procedure. Medina said the woman could have been "patient zero, but that is being evaluated."

The 1st patient died on Monday [29 Aug 2022] and the 2nd on Wednesday [31 Aug 2022].

Medina said on Wednesday [31 Aug 2022] the patients were suffering from "a severe respiratory condition with bilateral pneumonia ... very similar to COVID."

Experts were analyzing the local water and air conditioners to see if it was a case of poisoning, while Medina said it could also be due to an infection.

The 1st 6 patients started exhibiting symptoms between [18 and 22 Aug 2022].

Of the last 3 cases, 2 are receiving hospital treatment and 1 is being monitored at home.

Cases of a mysterious pneumonia of unknown origin that has killed 3 people have been reported in Argentina. Experts are rapidly researching what could be causing it and have so far ruled out known viruses such as COVID-19.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 9 cases of the mysterious disease have been reported so far. Of those infected, 8 were health care workers and 1 was an ICU patient. So far all the cases have stemmed from the same health care clinic in Tucumán. When the illness emerged, the clinic was shut down for 7 days.

Pneumonia is an infection that causes air sacs in the lungs to fill with fluid. It can be life threatening, particularly in vulnerable individuals. The cases of pneumonia detected in Argentina are bilateral, meaning both lungs were affected. Certain types of virus, bacteria and fungi can all cause pneumonia. But so far, experts have not managed to find out what is causing the cases in Argentina. They are becoming increasingly concerned as tests for known causes have all come back negative.

COVID-19 and several types of flu have been ruled out, Tucumán Health Minister Luis Medina Ruiz said at a press conference on [1 Sep 2022]. Experts also tested for _Legionella_, a bacterium that can cause severe pneumonia cases. Again, this came back negative.

"What these patients have in common is the severe respiratory condition with bilateral pneumonia and compromise in images very similar to COVID, but that is ruled out," Ruiz said. Severe cases of COVID-19 can cause pneumonia. This happens when the body's immune system attacks the virus when it settles in the lungs, causing air sacs to fill with fluid.

Connor Bamford, research fellow in virology and antiviral immunity at the Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, told Newsweek that there's "very little information known at the minute," about the cases in Argentina and this is worrying. "[It's concerning] over and above the current fatalities -- if it turns out to be caused by a previously unknown virus, which is possible. What is of immediate concern is that this appears to be a serious infection associated with severe pneumonia [and] death in a close group of people; that it may be spread from person-to-person, and that we don't yet know what is causing it and therefore can't specifically track or treat it," he said. "Globally, we need to be better prepared to deal with novel viruses rapidly and effectively, and prevent them becoming devastating pandemics like COVID."

The ICU patient had been in hospital for a gallbladder problem at first, Ruiz said. During her treatment, she came down with the pneumonia at around the same time the other pneumonia patients displayed symptoms. "At first she was considered patient zero, but she is under study based on the deepening of the analyses that are being carried out," Ruiz said. "This situation is unpredictable."

[An outbreak at a hospital in Tucuman, Argentina, which started on 18 Aug 20222, is now reported to involve 9 patients; 8 of the patients are medical staff and 1 is 70-year-old woman who had been admitted for surgery and is being thought to possibly be the index case. All patients have developed bilateral pneumonia. Two medical staff and the 70-year-old patient have now died (case fatality rate of 33%).

We have not been told of any epidemiological linkage between the 8 healthcare workers and the patient, that is, did the healthcare workers develop pneumonia following unprotected contact with this initial patient? We are also not told in detail the clinical characteristics of the disease other than bilateral pneumonia. Apparently the initial patient was not admitted with pneumonia, but developed this infection once in the hospital. We are not told of any travel, occupational or other exposures that could have placed the initial index patient at risk. No cases have been identified among close contacts of any of the patients (https://www.bbc.com/news/health-62764402).

The current situation in San Miguel de Tucumán is reminiscent of the emergence of new respiratory coronaviruses that include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in 2003 (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), which had high secondary attack rates within healthcare facilities among healthcare workers due to unprotected exposure to infected patients and associated with high case fatality rates. However, COVID-19, influenza A and B, hantavirus (rodent-borne infections), _Legionella_, and 25 "other germs" have been ruled out.

More information would be appreciated on the San Miguel de Tucumán outbreak from knowledgeable sources.

San Miguel de Tucumán (pop., almost 550 000 residents in 2010) is the capital and largest city of Tucumán Province, located in northern Argentina 1311 km (815 mi) from Buenos Aires; it is the 5th-largest city of Argentina after Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Rosario and Mendoza and the most important of the northern region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_de_Tucumán).
