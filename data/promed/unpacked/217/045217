AEDES AEGYPTI & AEDES ALBOPICTUS - MEDITERRANEAN REGION (2)
===========================================================
NAMRU-3 had a collaborative program with the Medical Entomology
Institute of the Ministry of Health. NAMRU had an active
surveillance program for Aedes aegypti (and Aedes albopictus)
in Cairo and the Medical Entomology Institute was responsible
for the rest of the country. I do not know if this program
has continued in the past few years.
