Authorities have confirmed the 1st case of West Nile virus in a horse in Delaware since 2015.

The Office of the State Veterinarian said [Tue 15 Aug 2017] the infected horse was an 11-year-old Quarter horse mare in Kent County. Officials say the horse started showing signs of weakness in its limbs on [6 Aug 2016] and was euthanized days later when it was no longer able to stand.

While this is the 1st confirmed horse case this year, officials have detected the virus in sentinel chickens and a wild crow. Eastern equine encephalitis has also been confirmed in a sentinel chicken this year [2017].

So far, neither the West Nile virus nor eastern equine encephalitis have been found in humans in Delaware.

Officials are urging horse owners to have the animals vaccinated.

Over the past 2 weeks, 3 Western Nevada horses have tested positive for West Nile virus, the Nevada Department of Agriculture confirmed [Thu 17 Aug 2017]. None of the horses were vaccinated against the disease.

"Vaccination is the best protection horse owners have for their animals," State Veterinarian Dr JJ Goicoechea said. "With the increased numbers of mosquitoes this year [2017], it's important all horse owners take this precaution to prevent the spread of disease."

Arboviral diseases like West Nile are transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of infected mosquito, ticks, sand flies, or midges. Every year, the state closely monitors several arboviral diseases to protect public health and safety and the agriculture industry. In addition to West Nile, the Animal Disease Laboratory tests for 2 other prevalent arboviral diseases: Saint Louis encephalitis virus and western equine encephalitis virus. Although these diseases cannot be transmitted from a horse, all 3 can cause severe illness and death both in horses and humans.

"Vaccinations, in conjunction with practices that reduce exposure to mosquito, are very effective in protecting horses from WNV," Goicoechea said. "It's not too late to prevent the spread of disease."

West Nile has been prevalent in Nevada since 2004 while the other 2 diseases have been widespread in the Western United States for decades. Since the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito has been found in Southern Nevada this year, the laboratory also monitors and tests for Zika Virus.

All Nevada residents should take precautions such as eliminating mosquito-breeding sites around houses and barns, using insect repellents to fight the bite and keeping horses vaccinated against these 3 diseases.

Vaccination is important. West Nile virus (WNV) is usually combined with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and tetanus. Sometimes the WNV and EEE are also combined with western equine encephalitis as well as tetanus. A lot of bang for the buck for protecting your equine friend.

St Louis encephalitis (SLE) is known to infect horses, but it is very rare that it produces disease in horses. One of the 1st reported cases was in Brazil with neurological signs. Virus isolation was detailed in a November 2013 study (http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002537). A 2nd article was published in The Horse in August 2014 (http://www.thehorse.com/articles/34316/saint-louis-encephalitis-virus-found-in-neurologic-horse).

I am unaware of a St Louis encephalitis vaccine for horses and after calling several distributors and checking some websites for a vaccine for horses, I found none. - Mod.TG]
