The Illinois Department of Public Health [IDPH] has confirmed a human case of tularemia in Cook County. Also known as "rabbit fever," the Cook county case has been tied to rabbit exposure. A wild rabbit found in Tinley Park tested positive for tularemia over the weekend [16-17 Jun 2018 - see prior ProMED-mail post Tularemia - USA (03): (IL) wild rabbit 20180619.5863284 for details.- Mod.MPP].

The state public health department was unable to confirm a specific individual, location or time that could identify the patient, citing federal confidentiality laws. IDPH is prohibited from providing private health information. The patient being treated for tularemia is reportedly from Tinley Park and was handling baby wild rabbits, according to a source.

Cook County Animal and Rabies Control issued an alert to residents over the weekend [16-17 Jun 2018] confirming that a wild rabbit found in Tinley Park underwent testing at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine in Champaign came back positive for tularemia.

The rabbit was found 13 Jun 2018 in the 7500 block of West 161st Place in Tinley Park. According to the CDC, tularemia is a disease of animals and humans caused by the bacterium _ Francisella tularensis_. Symptoms range from mild to life-threatening, and all forms are accompanied by fever, which can be as high as 104 deg F [40 deg C]. Although tularemia can be life-threatening, most infections can be treated successfully with antimicrobials.

Rabbits, hares, and rodents are especially susceptible and often die in large numbers during outbreaks. Tularemia has been reported in every state except for Hawaii. Humans can become infected through several routes, including:
- tick and deer fly bites;
- skin contact with infected animals;
- ingestion of contaminated water;
- inhalation of contaminated aerosols or agricultural dusts;
- laboratory exposure

Tularemia exposure can be prevented by taking the following steps:
- use of insect repellent;
- wearing gloves when handling sick or dead animals;
- avoiding mowing over dead animals

Residents are advised to keep pets and children away from deceased animals, particularly rabbits. Monitor your pets when out walking so they don't approach or eat deceased animals. If you find a dead rabbit or rodent on your property, contact Cook County Animal and Rabies Control at 708-974-6140 for further removal instructions.

Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _D. variabilis_ (dog tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).

The infection does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted.

_F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition. Even before the antimicrobial era, pneumonia due to inhalation of _F. tularensis_ seemed to account for most of the deaths related to the infection (1). A good review of the subject written by Thomas and Schaffner can be found in reference 2.
