Situation summary in the Americas
------------------------------------
Since epidemiological week (EW) 1 to EW 16 [week ending 30 Apr 2017] of 2017, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Suriname have reported suspected and confirmed yellow fever cases.

The following is an update on the situation in Brazil and Peru.

In Brazil, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2016 up to [20 April 2017], there were 2900 cases of yellow fever reported (681 confirmed, 1451 discarded, and 768 suspected under investigation), including 372 deaths (234 confirmed, 103 discarded, and 35 under investigation). The case fatality rate (CFR) is 34 percent among confirmed cases.

According to the probable site of infection, the cases were reported in 386 municipalities, while the confirmed cases were distributed among 115 municipalities in 6 states (Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Pará, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Tocantins). This week [week 24 to 30 Apr 2017], a new state, Tocantins, confirmed a case of sylvatic yellow fever in an unvaccinated resident of the Xambioá, located in the northern part of the state.

With regard to the confirmed fatal cases and their probable site of infection, 165 were in Minas Gerais, 5 in São Paulo, 58 in Espírito Santo, 4 in Pará, and 2 in Rio de Janeiro. In descending order, the CFR among confirmed cases by state is 100 percent in Pará, 50 percent in São Paulo, 35 percent in Minas Gerais, 31 percent in Espírito Santo, and 20 percent in Rio de Janeiro.

Between the release by the Brazil Ministry of Health of yellow fever bulletins on [12 and 19 Apr 2017], the number of cases reported in the state of Minas Gerais remained unchanged at 1130, with the last confirmed case having onset of symptoms on [14 Mar 2017].

In the state of Espírito Santo, following the 2nd increase in the number of cases observed since EW 9 [week ending 9 Mar 2017] of 2017, a number of additional suspected cases continued to be reported; the occurrence of new confirmed cases in the susceptible unvaccinated population that may still be present in the state cannot be discarded. Local and state authorities are continuing to conduct activities aimed at increasing vaccination coverage. The municipalities that report the highest number of confirmed cases are Ibatiba (22 [cases]), Colatina (20), and Santa Leopoldina (18).

In Rio de Janeiro, an increase in the number of suspected cases was observed between [15 and 25 Mar 2017]. Of the 11 confirmed cases, 8 had as probable site of infection the municipality of Casimiro de Abreu, while the remainder had the municipalities of São Fidelis, Porciúncula, and Maricá (1 case in each municipality).

Moreover, in the state of Pará, the number of confirmed cases continued to be 4 in EW 13 [week ending 2 Apr] of 2017, while the state of Tocantins presented a confirmed case during EW 16 [week ending 23 Apr] of 2017.

The confirmed case in the state of Tocantins is an unvaccinated young resident of Xambioá who worked in the jungle area and died in January 2017. This is the 1st death due to yellow fever reported in the state in 17 years.

To date, _Aedes aegypti_ has not been reported to have a role in transmission. However, confirmed epizootics in large cities, such as Vitoria in Espírito Santo and Salvador in Bahia, represent a high risk for a change in the transmission cycle.

Figure 1 shows the trend in the number of reported cases, according to classification (confirmed, discarded, under investigation), in the 4 states that account for 99 percent of all the confirmed cases. Figure 1 [graphs]. Distribution of reported yellow fever cases by date of symptoms onset and probable state of infection. Brazil, 1 Dec 2016 - 13 Apr 2017.

Figure 2 illustrates the municipalities with confirmed cases and cases under investigation, as well as confirmed epizootics, and epizootics under investigation that correspond to the cumulative total in three different dates. Figure 2 [maps]. Geographic distribution of reported human yellow fever cases and yellow fever epizootics, [31 Jan to 2 Mar 2017], and [20 Apr 2017].

Since the beginning of the outbreak up to [20 Apr 2017], a total of 3245 nonhuman primates (NHP) epizootics [cases] were reported, of which 474 were yellow fever confirmed, 1277 remain under investigation, and 88 were discarded. Between the release by the Brazil Ministry of Health of bulletins number 36 and 37 concerning yellow fever, an additional 296 epizootics in NHP were added.

Epizootics in NHP were reported in the Federal District and in the states of Alagoas, Amazonas, Bahia, Goiás, Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Pará, Paraíba, Paraná, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Rondônia, Roraima, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins.

Reports of epizootics currently under investigation in states bordering Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela represent a risk of spread of the virus to the bordering countries, especially in areas with similar ecosystems.

In Peru, up to EW 15 [week ending 16 Apr 2017], 14 confirmed and probable cases were reported, including 2 deaths; a similar figure was reported during the same period of 2016, which is higher than previous years (Figure 3). As in 2016, the department of Junín reported the largest number of confirmed and probable cases followed by the departments of Ayacucho, Cusco, and San Martin (with 2 cases confirmed and probable each); while Amazonas, Loreto, Madre de Dios and Pasco reported 1 case each.

Recommendations
---------------
Given the current yellow fever situation in Brazil and the emergence of cases in areas where cases have not been detected in several years, the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) urges Member States to continue efforts to detect, confirm, and adequately and timely treat cases of yellow fever. To this end, health care workers should be kept up-to-date and trained to detect and treat cases especially in areas of known virus circulation.

PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated, when heading to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.

Vaccination
-----------
The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and provides effective immunity against the disease in the range of 80 to 100 percent of those vaccinated after 10 days and 99 percent immunity after 30 days. A single dose provides life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed. There have been rare reports of serious side- effects from the yellow fever vaccine.

Given the limitations on the availability of vaccines and with the aim of promoting the rational use, PAHO / WHO reiterates its recommendations to national authorities:
- Conduct an assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever in areas at risk at the municipal level to guarantee at least 95 percent coverage among the resident population of these areas.
- Countries that are not currently experiencing outbreaks should not conduct immunization campaign. Priority should be given to the use of vaccines in susceptible populations and to avoid revaccination.
- Ensure vaccination of all travelers to endemic areas at least 10 days before traveling.
- Depending on vaccine availabilities, Member States should have a small stock that allows them to respond to outbreaks.
- Postpone routine vaccination in children in non-endemic areas until sufficient vaccines are available. Once there is availability, catch-up campaigns should be conducted to complete vaccination schedules.

Precautions
-----------
It is recommended to individually assess the epidemiological risk of contracting disease when faced with the risk of an adverse event occurring in people over 60 years who have not been previously vaccinated.
- The vaccine can be offered to individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection with CD4+ counts equal or more than 200 cells/mm3 requiring vaccination.
- Pregnant women should be vaccinated in an emergency situation and following recommendations of health authorities.
- Vaccination is recommended in lactating women who live in endemic areas, since the risk of transmitting the vaccine virus to the child is lower than the benefits of the vaccination of breastfeeding women.
- For pregnant or lactating women traveling to areas with yellow fever transmission, vaccination is recommended when travel cannot be postponed or avoided. They should receive advice on the potential benefits and risks of vaccination to make an informed decision. The benefits of breastfeeding are superior to those of other nutritional alternatives.

The following people are usually excluded from yellow fever vaccination:
- Immunocompromised individuals (Including those with thymus disorders, symptomatic HIV, malignant neoplasms under treatment, and those that are receiving or have received immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments, recent transplants, and current or recent radiation therapy).
- People with severe allergies to eggs and their derivatives.

[It is encouraging to see the total number of human cases of yellow fever declining in Brazil; however its expansion into new states remains a concern, especially into areas near cities where populations of _Aedes aegypti_ occur that could spark an urban outbreak. It is also encouraging to note that no cases of YF in non-human primates (NHP) have been reported in countries bordering Brazilian states that have had NHP cases, including Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela that have areas with similar ecosystems. Unless there is excellent surveillance in these remote, forested areas, this absence of reported NHP cases should be interpreted with caution. The absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence.
