South Florida loses 13 per cent of groves, hurricanes cause tree losses in
6 counties; Polk losses pale by comparison
------------------------------------------
6 hurricane-ravaged counties across the South Florida citrus belt lost
nearly 13 per cent of their commercial grove acreage and more than 4
million trees to the storms and other factors. "This has probably been the
biggest impact to the state that we've ever seen, with maybe one exception
in the freeze years (of the 1980s)," said Robert Terry of the Florida
Agricultural Statistics Service in Orlando on Friday [16 Sep 2005]. "This
was a huge impact." Terry supervised the agency's recount of citrus acreage
and trees in DeSoto, Hardee, Indian River, Martin, Palm Beach and St. Lucie
counties from January to June 2005. The 6 counties account for 40 per cent
of the state's citrus crop.
St. Lucie was the hardest hit, losing 18 560 grove acres, down 22.4 per
cent to 64 427 acres, according to a report released to the Citrus Crop
Estimates Advisory Committee. It lost nearly 2.2 million trees, about half
of them grapefruit.
Polk is the state's largest citrus producer and the only county hit by
hurricanes Charley, Frances and Jeanne in South Florida. Terry said the
citrus losses in Polk were not comparable to the other counties, because
wind speeds had weakened by the time the storms reached here.
Not all of the losses stemmed directly from hurricanes, he said. Among
other factors were loss to diseases and to economic development,
particularly among the Southeast Florida counties.
One major factor was citrus canker [CC], a bacterial disease that has
resulted in the destruction of 15 959 commercial grove acres since August
2004. Officials with the Canker Eradication Program attribute most of that
loss to the spread of CC bacteria across the state by hurricanes. Census
takers did not attempt to determine the cause of the missing trees or
acreage, Terry said. "For our purposes, it was either there or not," he said.
The Statistics Service, part of the US Department of Agriculture, uses the
tree count as a key factor in estimating the size of Florida's orange,
grapefruit, and specialty citrus crops. The initial estimate for the
2005-06 season is scheduled for release on 12 Oct 2005. The citrus crop
estimate plays a major role in determining the farm price growers get for
their fruit.
The losses are significant but still less than acreage lost to major
freezes in 1983 and 1985, said Bob Behr, the chief economist with Florida's
Natural Growers in Lake Wales and chairman of the advisory committee. The
1984 census shows the loss of 86 491 acres, and the 1986 census shows a
loss of 136 873 acres.

[In early September 2005, DeSoto County had 4035 acres of groves already
destroyed and 1994 acres set for destruction, according to a state report.
A total of 490 217 commercial citrus trees affected by CC in DeSoto county
are expected to have been destroyed. Statewide, the total number of
destroyed grove trees is approaching 7 million. CC is now present in 23
Florida counties, spreading widely into new areas following last year's
[2004] hurricanes.
This is Florida's 3rd CC epidemic in the past century, and the same method
of control has been used each time. Previous epidemics were halted, but
this one that began in Miami in 1995 has been especially difficult to manage.
CC is a bacterial disease that causes decreased fruit yield and fruit that
is unmarketable because of the appearance of lesions on the skins of fruit.
CC bacteria are spread by windborne rain. Denise Fieber, spokeswoman for
the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, said that
hurricanes spread the bacteria more than 30 miles, whereas it had been
thought it could only travel 5 to 8 miles. Counties such as Charlotte and
St. Lucie saw their 1st CC outbreaks after hurricane winds spread the bacteria.
There is growing suspicion, also, that animals and birds moving through
infected trees might pick up the bacteria, thus spreading CC further.
