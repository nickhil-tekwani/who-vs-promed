Maize streak hits Kakamega
--------------------------
An acute outbreak of maize streak disease has hit Kakamega and Butere/Mumias
districts. The Western Provincial Crops Officer, Mr. Jacob Odondi, said
yesterday the disease was spreading at an alarming rate.
The disease, which started in Kabras division, [poses] a food security
threat in the province and [Odondi] appealed for assistance in curbing it.
[He] said the disease may have been brought into the area by poor quality
seeds supplied by unscrupulous traders. [The government has] deployed
agricultural extension officers to the affected areas to assess the
situation.
[Odondi] advised farmers to obtain certified seeds from the Kenya Seed
Company (KSC) to [reduce the likelihood of crop losses].

[Maize streak mastrevirus (MSV) is transmitted only by several leafhopper
species in the genus _Cicadulina_, most commonly _C. mbila_. The virus is
indigenous to at least 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and it also occurs
in India, Madagascar, Reunion, and Yemen. The average yield of maize per
hectare in Africa is the lowest in the world (1.7 metric tonnes [mt]
compared to the worldwide average of 4 mt). Yield losses up to 100 percent
are
common when seedlings are infected within 3 weeks of emergence. The virus
has a very wide natural host range which serves as the source for inoculum.
A number of MSV-resistant cultivars have been developed and their use
appears to be a promising means of disease management. The suggestion that
"poor quality seeds supplied by unscrupulous traders" may have brought the
disease to the affected areas is unlikely because MSV is not seed-borne or
seed-transmitted. A useful reference on the disease and its management can
be found at the following URL:
