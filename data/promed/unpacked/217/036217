After discussions with the following -- Allen Preston & Gopi Nayari
(Manitoba), Terry Boldingh (Minnesota), Larry Schuler & Neil Dwyer (North
Dakota), Sam Holland & Connie Gates (South Dakota), and Larry Williams
(Nebraska) -- the situation appears to be as follows:

Manitoba: Five herds in Stuartburn municipality (south-central Manitoba)
have been diagnosed with some 22 deaths; actual numbers lost might be
higher as it is scrubby brush country. So far it has been confirmed on 2 by
ADRI Lethbridge, Alberta. All these herds have been vaccinated, as of 18
Aug 2000. Further vaccination policy will depend on what happens next.
Stuartburn is near to Pembina county in North Dakota and adjacent to the
Minnesota border.

Minnesota: The first affected herd was in Clay County (3rd August) on a
farm owned by the same family for 75 years in a pasture continuously grazed
without a known case of anthrax. 10/28 cows died; during herd vaccination 3
cows had temperatures >102' and were treated with antibiotics and one died.
Survivors will be revaccinated. The second herd lost 1/30 head and is about
1 mile east in Becker County of the first herd and with a flooded slough in
the intervening ground. There were no known contacts between the 2 herds.
This herd has now been vaccinated. These 2 farms are about 30 miles east of
the North Dakota border and some 60 miles SW of the ND cluster of affected
counties.

North Dakota: To date 17 herds in the same general area of the state have
been diagnosed and confirmed; some 100 animals are believed to have died.
The counties affected are Griggs, Steele, Trail, Grand Forks and Pembina.
All are in the north east part of the state; Pembina is somewhat apart from
the others being in the very NE corner. All the herds are responding well
to vaccination. There is also a general vaccination policy in force for the
area. Sick animals have been treated with long acting antibiotics and with
a high level of success; such animals were revaccinated a week later. When
followed this has certainly helped stop losses. On the other hand one owner
who was only casually checking his stock lost a total of 10/15 cows before
the vaccination took effect.

South Dakota: Three herds have been confirmed. The first was confirmed in
Clark County on 28th July with 3/29 losses; second in Day County on 8th
August with 6/16 losses; third in Day county and confirmed on 21 August.
The farms are within 5 miles of each other. The policy in South Dakota is
to first treat the herd with long-acting antibiotics and then revaccinate a
week later.

Nebraska: A herd in north east Nebraska that lost 8/22 cows, as of 18 Aug
2000, has not been confirmed to have had anthrax.

While horse flies (Tabanids) may explain the jumps between nearby herds,
the longer distances are as yet impossible to explain unless one invokes
undeclared intervening anthrax cases or old cattle graves and spores moving
upwards to the surface grazing thanks to the wet weather.
