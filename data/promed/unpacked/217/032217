STRIPE RUST, WHEAT - CHINA

The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) warned of the wide spread of the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_, also known as stripe rust, a wheat
disease that could cause huge losses. It is bad news for China's
summer harvest [of 2009] as the nation continues its war against rare
drought conditions.

The fungus, one of the most dangerous wheat diseases, was likely to
prevail across the nation due to the abnormal climate, MOA said in an
emergency notice. The disease has affected more than 11.3 million mu
(753 000 hectares) of wheat in 7 provinces by 5 Feb [2009], 4.6
million mu more than the same period last year [2008]. The
northwestern Gansu [province] and Ningxia [autonomous region] saw the
worst outbreak in 19 years. The situation in the southwestern Sichuan
and Guizhou provinces was worse than ever before, according to data
released by the MOA on Friday [6 Feb 2009].

The ministry urged local authorities to attach great importance to
disease control while fighting against the rare drought that has
gripped north China. Local government should take preemptive measures
to protect the summer harvest. Disease control knowledge should be
spread via television, radio, text message and print bulletins to
keep every farmer well-informed, MOA said. The ministry will also
enhance crackdown on fake pesticide producers and scams targeted at
desperate farmers.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereal crops is caused by
the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs
mostly in cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of
plants, and reduces grain production with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. It affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale
(wheat-rye hybrids), and a number of grass species. Spores are wind
dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and
volunteer wheat may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for
the next cropping season. Disease management includes the use of
resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer wheat.

Disease monitoring is important so timely action can be taken to
limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum.
Last year (2008), a quarter of the wheat growing area in China was
reported to be affected by stripe rust (see ProMED-mail post no.
20080408.1297), and it appears that the situation has become worse.
New pathogen strains with increased virulence have been reported in
recent years from wheat growing areas in Europe, North America and
Australia, and resistance breeding programmes have been set up to
counteract this trend. It remains to be clarified whether a new
strain may be contributing to the difficulties of controlling the
disease in China.
