Newcastle disease in the United Kingdom/Great Britain
-----------------------------------------------------
(previous outbreak of Newcastle disease in Great Britain reported to the
OIE: April 1997).
Information received on 16 Jul 2005 (dated 15 Jul 2005) from Dr Debby

Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), London:
A clinical outbreak of Newcastle disease was detected on 12 Jul 2005 in
West Horsley, Surrey. The outbreak is in a farm with about 11 000 semi-wild
pheasants reared for shooting.
The causal agent is an avian paramyxovirus, serotype 1 lineage 5B.
Molecular sequencing showed a virulent sequence.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures:
- stamping out;

[Newcastle disease (NCD) is caused by specified viruses of the avian
paramyxovirus type I (APMV-1) serotype of the genus _Avulavirus_, belonging
to the family Paramyxoviridae. (There are 9 serotypes of avian
paramyxoviruses, designated APMV-I to APMV-9). Strains of ND virus vary
widely in the severity of the disease they may produce in birds. The less
pathogenic strains may induce severe disease when exacerbated by the
presence of other organisms or by adverse environmental conditions. The
preferred method of diagnosis is virus isolation and subsequent
characterization.

paramyxoviruses. Rev Sci Tech 2000; 19(2): 443-62. - Mod.AS]
