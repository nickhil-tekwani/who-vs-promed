From: Marjorie P. Pollack <pollackmp@mindspring.com>
Source: El Siglo, 12 March 2000 (three articles translated and summarized
by M. Pollack)

The first article mentions that while the epidemic of hantavirus is not now
under control (defining control as no new cases for a period of four to six
weeks), the CDC experts are returning to Atlanta after having completed
their investigations and assistance to the Ministry of Health. There is
mention of the possibility of the consultants returning to assist further
if indicated in the future. At this point there is confidence in the
systems of surveillance and diagnostics that have been established.
According to the latest data, the total number of cases reported were 12,
with three dead and nine others laboratory confirmed, and diagnosis of two
suspect cases is pending laboratory results.
The Gorgas Institute virology laboratory sent a technician to the CDC in
Atlanta for training. Plans are to train a second technician as well,
leading to the certification of the Gorgas Institute as a reference lab
(for hantavirus studies) for Central America.
Studies as to the type of hantavirus involved are still pending. Estimates
are it will take approximately three weeks before the results are
available. The article mentions there are currently 14 types of hantavirus
identified but the type identified in Panama is not one of the known types,
but rather a new type as yet to be identified.
The second article mentions a new suspect case identified in the past few
days. In addition, there is mention of the economic impact of the
hantavirus outbreak in terms of revenues lost through the cancellation of
Carnival in the affected provinces. An estimated 10 million dollars.
The third article mentions that 308 blood samples were collected during the
CDC assisted investigation and sent to Atlanta. These included specimens
from the suspect cases and family members and neighbors living in proximity
to the suspect cases. The article also mentions the seven localities where
there were cases of hantavirus on the Azuero peninsula: La Enea, Santo
Domingo, San Jose, Tonosi, the suburbs of Bella Vista, and the city of Las
Tablas.

[Had this virus been one that was previously recognized, it likely would
have been identified by now. We await definitive identification (which
should come soon), determination of the rodent host, and results of the
serosurvey. - Mod. CHC
