Proposals relating to beef exports and Specified Risk Material to be sent to
Council
The Standing Veterinary Committee yesterday failed to reach the qualified
majority and such to give opinions on draft proposals on the United Kingdom
Export Certified Scheme and the ban on Specified Risk Materials. The outcome
of the discussions was described by Franz Fischler, European Commissioner of
Agriculture and Rural Development, and Emma Bonino, Commissioner for
Consumer Policy and Health Protection, as most regrettable. They indicated
that the issues would now be sent to the Council of Ministers for a decision
on the 16/17 March. On the other hand, the proposal on the
epidemio-surveillance for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
was approved by qualified majority.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
It will be recalled that Germany had been pressing for a two tier system of
countries (one tier exempt from carrying out any SRM hygiene precautions)
crucially based on the fallacious principle of presence or absence of
"home-bred" (which the Commission refers to as "native") cases. The UK
Government had been led (or had led itself) to believe that in return for
placating Germany on this, Germany would cease to press its strong
opposition to any easing of the ban on export of UK beef from certified
herds in Northern Ireland.
That's what I referred to previously as political "horse trading" and added
"Don't hold your breath". The EU Veterinary Committee actual approved the UK
proposal by 10 votes to 4, but it was lost on qualified majority weighed
voting. No prize for guessing which country led the opposition to the easing
of the ban. I don't think I shall hold my breath for the outcome of the
Council of Ministers meeting on 16/17 March.
