A yellow fever mosquito was discovered in Gainesville for the 1st time since the early '90s. In a Facebook post [Tue 5 May 2020], Gainesville's Public Works Department wrote that a yellow fever mosquito was found downtown this week.

Yellow fever mosquitoes can spread yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses, according to the post.

Rossana Passaniti, a spokesperson for the city of Gainesville, told The Alligator she hasn't heard of any recent sighting of a yellow fever mosquito. She said the mosquito's larva was discovered in November [2019] and didn't show signs of carrying diseases, but its origins are unknown.

While public works said that it's not aware of any active transmission of mosquito-borne diseases, residents should take action by getting rid of potential breeding sites. The mosquitos mainly breed in artificial containers, such as tin cans, bottle caps, tires, vases and gutters that contain water. They can be identified by white markings on their legs and are found in areas where human-mosquito contact is frequent.

The City of Gainesville's website advises residents to drain standing water and any containers where sprinkler or rainwater collects to stop mosquitoes' breeding. Passanti said Gainesville Mosquito Control can supply residents with mosquito-eating fish for ponds.

Dr. Peter Jiang, an entomologist with Gainesville Mosquito Control, declined to comment to The Alligator on [Wed 6 May 2020]. He said he couldn't answer questions regarding the discovery of the mosquito, adding that the information line is intended for questions and concerns about inspections.

[The good news is that there is no evidence that _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes are transmitting dengue, chikungunya or Zika viruses in Gainesville. The not so good news is that the presence of the larva indicates this mosquito is breeding there unless eggs were brought in from elsewhere. This mosquito has transmitted Zika and dengue in Miami-Dade County and dengue in Key West, Florida in past years. These localities are further south than Gainesville. One hopes that no further individuals of this mosquito are found in Gainesville. - Mod.TY
