FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE (TYPE A) (03) - JORDAN, MIDDLE EAST
********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>

ProMED-mail's posting "Foot & mouth disease (type A) - Jordan, Middle East"
of 26 Jan 2007, included the following moderator's observation:
"The new FMDV A lineage, which has been spreading throughout Iran since
2005, moving during 2006 westwards into Saudi Arabia and Turkey (including
Thrace), and probably not (sufficiently) responding to available vaccines,
should be regarded as an imminent animal health threat within the entire
Middle East region and beyond."
Subsequently, we sent the following request for information to the World
reference laboratory for FMD at Pirbright (WRL) and to the FAO European
Commission for the Control of FMD (EUFMD), in Rome.
"1. Are the vaccine strains A22 Iraq 87 and/or A Iran 96 expected to confer
protection against the A Iran 05 FMDV strain (WRL 2005/2006 isolates from
Iran, Turkey, Saudi-Arabia, Pakistan and Jordan)?
2. Are there other vaccine strains which are expected to confer similar or
better protection against the said FMDV A Iran 05 strain?
In case such information is available, could you kindly provide us with its
details, including protection rates? Alternatively, what advice has/is been
given to the regional countries?
The following authoritative replies have been promptly received from both
institutions; Drs Paton and Sumption are gratefully acknowledged.

In the absence of a homologous vaccine strain, our recommendation is to use
A22 Iraq vaccine to provide protection against the "A Iran 05" strain of
FMDV. This is based on serological tests which have and continue to
indicate a moderate match despite the lack of a close genetic relationship.
This recommendation has been supported by subsequent reports that the A22
Iraq vaccine has proved to be effective against the "A Iran 05" strain in
Turkey, in the field. Our serological matching test results do not support
the use of vaccines based on A Iran 96 or A Iran 87 to protect against this
strain. I am not aware that experimental cross-challenge studies have been
performed.
Similar statements to the recommendation made above can be found in our
quarterly reference laboratory reports that are posted on our website at:
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/ref_labs/fmd_ref_lab_reports.htm>.
For example, the report of Jan-Mar 2006 includes a table that provides
details of our 1st serological vaccine matching results on these new
viruses. Subsequent reports carry updates of genetic typing and matching
test results on later isolates. Our findings have been reported and
discussed at several meetings during 2006.
The 2 recent type A viruses from Jordan are genetically very similar to
other "A Iran 05" strains and give similar serological matching results
("little r" value of around 0.5 by both VNT and ELISA, which we would
consider to be an acceptable match) [See explanatory note on "little r"
value in the commentary to this posting. - Mod.AS].

The phrase "and probably not (sufficiently) responding to available
vaccines" would be correct if related to availability within the affected
countries at time of incursion. However, A 22 Iraq is widely offered by
vaccine producers, and in theory therefore available.
I would add that field experience in Iran in 2006 was that the Merial
vaccine containing an A component that the Iranian authorities believe to
be A Iran 87, provided protection against FMD A Iran 05 challenge in a
feedlot, whereas pens of cattle vaccinated with other locally produced FMD
vaccines were [clinically] affected. A possible explanation is that the
Merial vaccine contains a high antigenic payload and therefore provides a
higher level of protection than would be expected from the r value. However
in the absence of a cross-protection challenge study we could not provide a
recommendation on the use of A Iran 87 compared to A 22 Iraq.
The spread in Turkey and Iran in 2005-6 was related to routine use of
vaccines that did not confer adequate protection, but each country switched
the type A component in the routine vaccine as a result (see the Teheran
workshop report, which was a meeting to review vaccination against the A
Iran 05). Continued spread in countries that vaccinate against type A is
more likely to relate to either failure to switch to a suitable type A
component, or inadequate level of coverage if the A 22 Iraq component is used.
The reports of meetings in the Middle-East on FMD circulation are given in
the link below and may help with background:
- Teheran meeting, Jun 2006
- Damascus meeting, Nov 2006

[The following explanatory text on FMD vaccine matching tests is derived
(with some editing) from section C of chapter 2.1.1. FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE
in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals;
see <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00024.htm>.
"The "little r" value expresses the relationship between the reciprocal
titers of the field and the vaccine strain, namely: reciprocal titre of
reference serum against field virus; reciprocal titre of reference serum
against vaccine virus.
At least 2 consistent results are needed for acceptance.
Interpretation of the results:
for 'r' values derived by ELISA, the following guidelines are used for
interpretation:
0.4-1.0: Close relationship between field isolate and vaccine strain. A
potent vaccine containing the vaccine strain is likely to confer protection.
0.2-0.39: The field isolate is antigenically related to the vaccine strain.
The vaccine strain might be suitable for use if no closer match can be
found provided that a potent vaccine is used and animals are preferably
immunised more than once.
<0.2: The field isolate is only distantly related to the vaccine strain and
the vaccine strain is unlikely to protect against challenge with the field
isolate."
The A22 Iraq strain was initially involved in a panzootic which engulfed
the entire Middle- and Near-East during the 60's of the previous century,
eventually reaching western Turkey and Thrace. The current A Iran 05 strain
seems to spread in similar pattern, stretching from Pakistan in the East to
Thrace (Europe) in the west.
Ideally, a homologous vaccine strain should be used to address new virus
strains, provided the field strain demonstrates tangible immunogenicity. A
homologous vaccine against the A Iran 05 strain is not available at
present. The vaccine of choice, according to the recommendation of both
experts, is A22 Iraq. - Mod.AS]
