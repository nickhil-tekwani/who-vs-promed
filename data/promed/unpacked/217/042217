The Virginia Department of Agriculture has confirmed the 1st case of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse this year [2014]. The horse, a 2-year-old Arabian male from Suffolk, was vaccinated for EEE and West Nile virus (WNV) more than a year ago but was not revaccinated this year.

Last year [2013], Virginia had no reported cases of EEE in horses or other livestock. The disease has a mortality rate of around 80 percent, so prevention is a key part of equine health. Generally, EEE is transmitted by mosquitoes.

Prevention methods include vaccination, destroying standing water breeding sites for mosquitoes, using insect repellents and removing animals from mosquito-infested areas during peak biting times, usually dusk to dawn.

In an April 2014 press release, Dr. Richard Wilkes, VDACS's State Veterinarian, encouraged horse owners to work with their veterinarians to plan a vaccination schedule that would protect their horses from EEE and West Nile virus. Available vaccines are generally effective in drastically reducing the incidence of both EEE and WNV in horses.

For the vaccine to be effective, it must be handled and administered properly and be given at least 2 weeks before the horse is exposed to the virus. Additionally, to stimulate full immunity, horses must be vaccinated twice, about 30 days apart, the 1st year of vaccination.

The vaccines are effective for 6 to 12 months, so horses should be revaccinated at least annually. In an area where the disease occurs frequently, such as southeast and Tidewater Virginia, most veterinarians recommend vaccination every 6 months.

Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) state veterinarian, Dr. James Averill, [19 Sep 2014] confirmed 5 cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in 3 horses -- 1 from Oakland County and 2 from Lenawee County -- and 2 emus from Ingham County.

EEE is a serious zoonotic viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The virus mainly causes disease in horses, but can also cause serious illness in poultry, people and other animals, such as deer and even dogs.

Animals sick from EEE are a sign that people should guard themselves against mosquitoes by applying repellent and wearing protective clothing.

MDARD is working with the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) and Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health on an active surveillance program. If horses are showing neurological signs, owners are encouraged to contact their veterinarian, as there is still funding available for EEE laboratory testing.

"EEE is a dreadful illness causing severe swelling of the brain in horses, stumbling, depression and sometimes blindness," said Averill. "Horse owners in southern Michigan counties in or near low lying forest and wetland areas should be especially aware of the risk and take extra measures to protect their animals. Vaccinating at any time against the virus is encouraged, even this late in the year."

Mosquito management is vital in the prevention of EEE and other vector-borne viruses that cause illness in humans and in horses. Owners should eliminate standing water by properly discarding old tires, filling ruts and pot holes and removing water from tarps, pool covers and other items where it may collect.

Changing water in bowls, buckets, troughs, bird baths and wading pools at least once each week, especially during the warmer weeks of late summer, are just a few simple steps to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses.

Additional practices to reduce mosquito exposure include:
- If you are able, keep pets indoors from dusk 'til dawn, when mosquitoes are out in full force.
- Horses can also be stabled during times when mosquitoes are most active.
- Placing fans to blow in stalls and on stabled horses will also help keep mosquitoes from landing and feeding.
- Products are available to repel or kill fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and biting flies from dogs and cats, repellent sprays are available for livestock and a vaccine against EEE is available for horses.
- Owners should consult a veterinarian on specific products and usage.

[Birds are very sensitive to this disease. Some areas set chickens out as an early warning of when the disease is in the area.

If you are an emu or ostrich raiser, check with your veterinarian for methods to protect your birds.

Horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate -- repeatedly. It takes at least 2 vaccines initially and then annually. But for EEE, more frequent vaccination is recommended as the immunity wanes rapidly and boosting the immunity is recommended for best protection.
