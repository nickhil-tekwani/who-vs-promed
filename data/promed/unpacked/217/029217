HANTAVIRUS PULMONARY SYNDROME UPDATE 2004 - THE AMERICAS (06)

ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>
[The CDC web-site
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/index.htm>
identifies hantaviruses in the New World as follows. North America:
Hantaviruses in the New World are associated with hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS). Sigmodontine rodents carry the hantaviruses that cause HPS
and are found throughout the Americas. Sin Nombre virus, carried by
_Peromyscus maniculatus_, is the predominant cause of HPS in the United
States and Canada. Mononghela, New York, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal
viruses also cause HPS and are found in eastern Canada and the eastern and
southeastern United States. In South and Central America, hantaviruses
that have been identified as causing HPS are Andes virus in Argentina and
Chile; Andes-like viruses including Oran, Lechiguanas, and Hu39694 in
Argentina; Laguna Negra virus in Bolivia and Paraguay; Bermejo virus in
Argentina; Juquitiba virus in Brazil; and Choclo virus in Panama. Numerous
other hantaviruses have been identified but have not been linked to human
disease. - Mod.CP]

Alberta: 1st hantavirus case in 2 years
-----------------------------------------
The province is [alerting] Albertans [to the risk of hantavirus infection],
after a man in the Lloydminster area became infected. He is the 1st case in
Alberta in nearly 2 years.
The virus is carried by mouse droppings, urine, or saliva. The mouse
population in the province is high this year [2004] because of a wet summer
and good food supply. Mice droppings should be cleaned up with rubber
gloves and disinfectant.
The health department says that after spending 8 days in the hospital, the
man has fully recovered.
Hantavirus infection can be deadly; roughly 30 percent of all cases result
in death.

New Mexico: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome case in Santa Fe
-----------------------------------------------
The state Health Department says a Santa Fe County man has hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome. The man is hospitalized in critical condition at the
University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The state Health
Department is investigating to find out where he was exposed to hantavirus.
The virus is passed to humans who inhale particles of urine or feces from
infected rodents, especially deer mice. Early symptoms include fever and
muscle aches, possibly chills, headaches, nausea or vomiting, abdominal
pain, and coughing. The symptoms develop from one to 6 weeks after
exposure. A McKinley County woman died from a hantavirus infection earlier
this fall [2004]. 2 other patients in July and January 2004 recovered.
