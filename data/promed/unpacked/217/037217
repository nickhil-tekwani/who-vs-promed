The current wave of lethal bird flu in Turkey that has infected at
least 18 people began in mid November 2005, more than 3 weeks before
an initial report, the World Organization for Animal Health
said. Outbreaks of the H5N1 avian influenza virus affected birds as
early as 21 Nov 2005, Huseyin Sungur, a government veterinary
official, said in a 12 Jan 2006 report to the Paris-based
organization. The report was posted on the organization's Web site yesterday.
Turkey, in a statement on 27 Dec 2005, said outbreaks began on 15 Dec
2005 in Igdir province, bordering Iran. [See:

The delay in reporting the outbreak highlights the need to improve
early detection and reporting systems to help contain infections.
Turkey has reported 18 laboratory-confirmed avian flu cases, of which
3, all from the same family, were fatal.
More than 11 400 poultry and wild birds have died in Turkey's current
wave of the H5N1 virus, which may have started with 3 dead pigeons
found near the village of Caglayan in the eastern province of
Erzincan on 21 Nov 2005.
The H5N1 virus was later reported to have caused outbreaks in the
provinces of Agri, Sanli Urfa, Bitlis, Igdir, Erzum, Yozgat, Bursa,
Van, Ankara and Istanbul, according to the government report. More
than 31 800 fowl have been destroyed in an attempt to stem the
disease's spread, it said.
Turkey reported an initial H5N1 outbreak in its western region in
October [2005].

Turkey's government will consider providing financial help to the USD
3 billion poultry sector following a nationwide outbreak of bird flu,
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener said on Saturday.
"Bird flu has caused many economic problems in the sector," Sener
told reporters ahead of a government meeting with representatives of
the industry. "We are going to listen to the representatives of the
sector and their demands ... We are going to search for the necessary
measures that need to be taken," he said.
Sener said the industry contributed USD 3 billion annually to gross
domestic product, with annual poultry meat output at 914 000 tonnes
in 2004. Exports stood at USD 35 million and imports at USD 21
million. Annual poultry meats consumption stood at 13 kg and 115 eggs
per person.
"If the steps are insufficient, producers will halt output, shut up
shop and lay off workers," said Resat Baytar, whose company is the
biggest egg producer in Turkey's eastern Van province. Van has been
hardest hit by bird flu.
United Nations agencies have reassured consumers that properly cooked
poultry is safe to eat. But they tell people from affected areas not
to eat eggs raw or with a runny yolk.
The biggest material loss so far has been felt by the huge number of
Turkish villagers who keep chickens at home. Newspapers said the
government had offered 8 million new Turkish lira (USD 6 million) in
compensation to the public.

No more tractors idling as ducks waddle across a dirt road. No more
turkeys gobbling in open fields. No more fetching fresh eggs from the
backyard coop. No more roosters crowing at dawn. In Turkey, the
outbreak of bird flu is changing the rural scenery and threatening a
way of life. Yet up to now, there has been no significant discussion
of what Turkey's countryside might look like when the bird flu crisis
passes, or how its impoverished people will get by without the
domestic birds on which many of them rely.
In the midst of the worst bird flu epidemic outside of southeast
Asia, top government officials have warned Turkey is at permanent
risk of outbreaks because it is on the path of several species of
migratory birds.
At least 18 people in Turkey have been confirmed to be infected with
the deadly H5N1 strain, including 3 siblings who died last week.
Because of the [human] risk, Health Minister Recep Akdag has insisted
raising birds in backyards must [become] "history," and the sooner
Turks learn that, the better.
Yet the state has not come up with a long-term plan to compensate
people for what could be a painful upheaval, other than to pay a
basic market rate of USD 3.70 for delivering a chicken or a duck to
authorities, USD 11 for a goose and USD 15 for a turkey. No rules
have been drawn up for the post-crisis period, and it was unclear if
people would be banned from raising poultry altogether or be allowed
to keep birds in enclosed spaces like coops to keep poultry from
mingling with wild fowl -- a costly prospect for poor families.
In parts of the east, where raising birds in backyards is a way of
life for nearly every family and a means of surviving for some, many
scared residents have vowed off poultry, but don't seemed to have
grasped the implications. "We won't eat them, and we won't raise
them," said [a 35 year old male], in the Seslitas village outside of
Dogubayazit, where bird flu has claimed the lives of the 3 siblings.
"If we don't raise chickens and don't die, it will be better for us."
Many believed Turkey would look after them. "The state will take care
of us," said Kahraman Duman, 56, who on Friday gave up 7 geese, 8
chickens and a turkey to men in white protective suits who would bag,
bury and disinfect them. "It's OK if it's forever."
But one official rounding up poultry in Seslitas on Friday seemed to
doubt the government would come through. "They fed their kids with
their eggs. They don't have other money. They'll be ruined," the
official from the Dogubayazit Agriculture Ministry said as he jumped
a stone fence to go from one house to the next. He would not give his
name because Turkish officials are rarely allowed to speak to the media.
Domestic birds have been eliminated from the landscape in towns and
villages where the virus has been found, like Aralik near the
Armenian border, believed to be the starting point of the last series
of outbreaks. They soon will disappear from other towns across the
country. Officials said Friday the virus has been confirmed in 13 of
Turkey's 81 provinces and is suspected in 18 more.
[A 58 year old butcher], stood in his "Meat and Chicken Gallery" in
Aralik and stated proudly: "There are no chickens here." Although the
outbreak started in Aralik, Isik said precautions were taken quickly
and the town had no human illnesses and few bird deaths. On Aralik's
back streets, chicken coops were empty, and aside from wild fowl on
power lines and a pile of feathers here and there, there was no sign
of bird life.
"It's hard, we need to eat. We used the eggs, we used the meat," said
[a 52 year old woman], who said she gave up 30 chickens. "We're
waiting from an answer from the state."
"Almost everyone had them," said [another resident], who was riding a
bicycle home and said he'd given up 7 or 8 chickens. "I don't know
what I'll do. Maybe cattle."

[Various countries and international agencies have been quoted in the
press that at next week's meeting in Beijing that they will pledge
various sums in millions of US dollars in aid. Promises of promises
are one thing, actual delivery another. We can only wait and see what
happens. - Mod.MHJ]
