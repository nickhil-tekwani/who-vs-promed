On Fri 28 June 2019, Walloon [Agriculture] minister Rene Collin closed an area of 7000 hectares (about 17 300 acres) of woodland in connection with the discovery of a new [case] of a wild boar infected with African swine fever (ASF). The new area is located in the southeast of the province of Luxembourg, extending the existing surveillance area further to the border with [the] neighboring [country of] Luxembourg.

In various Belgian media Collin calls the location of new contaminated carcasses a new relatively important focus. The decision takes effect today [1 Jul 2019] and lasts at least until 14 Sep 2019. All traffic is prohibited in the closed area. Systematic searches for carcasses are organized. In addition, boar is actively hunted in the total surveillance area of nearly 20 000 hectares (almost 49 500 acres). As far as Collin is concerned, the "no boar" objective is maintained until 31 Dec 2019.

In Wallonia, 3166 wild boars have been tested as of 24 Jun 2019, of which 823 were found to be infected with the ASF virus.

[Belgium's most recent follow-up report (no. 40) has been submitted to the OIE on 1 Jul 2019, notifying a single new case, a wild boar killed on 21 Jun 2019 in Leglise, Luxembourg province (map included, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=30921).

[2] Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, preventive wild boar hunt

Around 100 hunters and 50 beaters are due to hunt boars in the buffer zone by the Belgian border later this week. The large-scale hunt will take place on 4 and 5 Jul [2019] between Petange and Sterpenich. The hunt will be a type of driven hunt but without dogs aiding hunters.

Ordinarily, these types of hunts are not organised at this time of year, as the forests are too dense and too much young game is on the move. However, Minister of Agriculture Romain Schneider explained that this is an "indispensable" measure in order to eliminate wild boars in the buffer zone.

The hunt has consequently been organised for 4 and 5 Jul [2019] in collaboration with the Nature Conservation agency, the Veterinary Inspectorate, and hunters as a means to protect the Grand Duchy from any potential African swine fever outbreak. The hunt will take place from 9 am to 2 pm over the course of both days. Walkers should avoid the entire zone before 2 pm.

An expert report recommended taking measures before the summer in order to eliminate all wild boars in the buffer zone. The urgency resides in the fact that each year experiences 2 peak disease periods: one in winter and the other in August or September, which is when young game starts to move.

No dogs will take part in the hunt in order to limit agitation within the forest. On Wed 3 Jul 2019, the day before the hunt begins, a drone will fly over the region to locate wild boar populations. This will be a difficult task, even for drones, as it will be tricky to see through the thick growth in the forest.

Next Tuesday [9 Jul 2019], the Ministry of Agriculture will present the results of the hunt alongside the concerned actors, once laboratories have determined whether any infected animals were shot.

A 2nd phase will involve the placement of traps in order to capture any remaining boars, which will be shot and tested. At the announcement, the ministry specified that everything has been in order to extend the fence towards the north for the past few weeks, in the event of the discovery of a contaminated cadaver.

["Driven hunts" are performed by hunters with rifles who shoot the prey that is "beaten" (chased out) into the hunters' way by "beaters"; see details at http://www.fnhunting.at/index.php/en/galerien-en/gal-driven-wildboar (thanks to Sabine Zentis).

The report does not specify the final destination of the hunted boars. In case their meat (and organs?) is to be eventually consumed, how are samples for laboratory tests to be collected?

All Belgium's outbreaks since the start of the event (9 Sep 2018) are presented on Pig Progress' interactive map at https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/African-Swine-Fever/ASF-Belgium/?dossier=35415&widgetid=0 (the new case in Leglise is colored purple).

OIE's summary of the Belgian event, as of 1 Jul 2019, follows:

Total outbreaks = 659 (submitted)
Species / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar / 824 / 799 / 25 / 0

The recently recorded ASF-infected wild boar referred to in item 1 above, in the southeast of Belgium's province of Luxembourg, facing the international border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, has probably not yet been included in an OIE report. - Mod.AS
