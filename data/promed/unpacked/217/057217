There have been 29 cases of dengue 3 infection confirmed in North
Queensland. The majority of cases (24) are linked, having stayed or worked
in the vicinity of a hostel in Cairns. Recently new clusters have been
identified away from this initial area. Control efforts are continuing in
an attempt to limit further virus transmission.
