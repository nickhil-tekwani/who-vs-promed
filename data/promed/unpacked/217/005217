1st detections of citrus black spot in the UK
---------------------------------------------
1st signs of citrus black spot (CBS) during the current South African (SA) citrus season have been observed in the UK. According to unconfirmed reports, 3 cases have been detected by a Spanish citrus importer.

Justin Chadwick of the SA citrus growers' association says that DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) has confirmed 2 cases. The 1st cases were already reported beginning of June 2015 which seems rather early in the season. He says that the current situation should be assessed further before crucial decisions can be taken.

After detection of 5 CBS cases, an investigation of the procedure for introduction of SA citrus must be instigated. Current EU regulations state that, "In case of recurring CBS reports within the same year due to problems with quarantine control and certification schemes, the Commission will review its decisions on import procedures before a 6th detection."

[Citrus black spot (CBS) caused by the fungus _Guignardia citricarpa_ is one of the most serious diseases of the crops in Asia and regions of the southern hemisphere. Symptoms can occur on leaves but are most severe on fruit. They include sunken lesions of varying size, shape, and colour depending on stage of fruit or leaf development. The disease may also lead to post-harvest losses since fruit may not show visible symptoms while on the tree. However, characteristic lesions may develop in storage under suitable conditions. Fungal strains which do not cause symptoms also exist. Black spot causes significant losses due to premature fruit and leaf drop and disfiguration of fruit for fresh markets.

Spores are produced under fallen leaves and sometimes on fruit. Spread occurs by air currents, on contaminated plant material (including nursery plants or scions with latent infections), and by mechanical means. The disease is particularly virulent late in the season, and losses tend to be most severe in late maturing varieties. All commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to varying extents, except for sour orange (_Citrus aurantium_). Disease management includes fungicides, phytosanitation, and pathogen exclusion.

The threat of CBS introduction has been an issue in Europe for several years. The disease has been included in the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). CBS has also recently been introduced into the USA by unknown means (2010; ProMED-mail post 20100412.1183), and this further illustrates the risk to northern hemisphere citrus industries. Once established in a region, eradication of a sporulating fungus such as _G. citricarpa_ is considered impossible.

The EU was alarmed by a large number of quarantine detections in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20131204.2090761) which implied that certification of disease freedom at point of origin in South Africa was not working effectively. An import ban was considered to protect European citrus industries but, instead, the regulations mentioned above were approved. Although there is no citrus industry in the UK and therefore this detection is not a direct threat to the country, CBS detection there implies that these current quarantine and/or certification schemes are still not effective and that incursions in citrus producing areas of southern Europe remain a threat to the region.
