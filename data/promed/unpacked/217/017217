11th outbreak of foot and mouth disease verified
------------------------------------------------
Korea's Food Ministry confirmed a new outbreak of foot and mouth disease
[FMD] yesterday [Fri 7 May 2010] at a cattle farm in Cheongyang, South
Chungcheong, the 11th since the 1st reappearance of the disease here on 9
Apr 2010.

The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said that a cow
at the farm started showing symptoms of the illness, including blisters on
the nose, on Thursday [6 May 2010], and that tests conducted by the
National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service were positive.

An official with the South Chungcheong Province government said quarantine
officials "have culled the 20 animals raised at the farm, as well as some
80 other animals raised at 8 other cattle farms within a 500 metre [547
yard] radius." The location of the latest confirmed outbreak is just 3.2 km
(2.0 miles) from the region's state-run livestock and veterinary science
institute, which confirmed an outbreak just last week. The proximity raises
concerns about Korea's quarantine measures, as experts categorize anywhere
3 to 10 km from an outbreak as an "alert area".

Meanwhile, food minister Chang Tae-pyong told a radio show yesterday
morning, "The FMD virus is known to be transmitted through humans and
vehicles." He vowed to "strengthen restrictions on human and vehicle
traffic in and out of the areas where the outbreak took place."

As of early this week, Korea had slaughtered and buried almost 50 000
livestock from 361 farms, incurring costs of more than 55 billion won (USD
49 million).

FMD affects all cloven-hooved animals including cattle, pigs, deer, goats,
and buffalo. For its high contagiousness and impact on trade, FMD is
classified as a "List A" disease by the Paris-based World Organisation for
Animal Health. [This statement is out-dated; since 2005, all OIE's
notifiable diseases of terrestrial animals are included in one, single
list. Previously, diseases notifiable to the OIE were classified into 2
lists, List A and List B, the former being of higher priority: see
20050715.2016. - Mod.AS]

Late April 2010 the Korean government raised the alert level to red, the
highest in its 4-level system. It was the 1st time the red level had been
used since an FMD alert system was adopted in 2004.

Korea has been hit twice before by the disease in 2000 and 2002, with its
losses reaching 301 billion won and 144 billion won, respectively.
