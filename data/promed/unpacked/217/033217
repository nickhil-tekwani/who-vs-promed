Nematode threatens NY garlic industry
-------------------------------------
A recent nematode outbreak is threatening New York's garlic industry.
_Ditylenchus dipsaci_ has shown up in soils in 17 New York counties to
date. _D. dipsaci_ was first identified by Christine Hoepting, Cornell
Cooperative Extension, in June 2010. Potential signs of this bloat
nematode include stunted growth, yellowing of leaves that may droop
and fall, as well as softening, discoloration, and cracking of the
bulb.

George Abawi, New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, is
currently researching the extent to which the nematode has spread, as
well as determining which seed [bulb] cleaning methods are most
effective. "Garlic growers sometimes exchange seed [bulbs], and that
has been the main way that the pest has been distributed. We are
trying to stop that," Abawi said. Even while in storage, the nematode
can continue to reproduce in the cloves.

While young nematodes typically target the bulb, stem, and leaves,
mature nematodes may move into the soil potentially infecting other
crops and contaminating the soil for many seasons to come. According
to Abawi, the best thing growers can do is to plant clean seed [bulbs]
that have been tested for nematodes into non-infected soil that has
been rotated with crops outside of the allium family for at least 4
years.

Onion industries in the 1940s battled a similar pest. Growers dealt
with the pest by fumigating the soil to kill the organisms. Nowadays
all onions in big production in New York are grown from [true] seed
rather than from [seed] bulbs.

[_Ditylenchus dipsaci_ (stem and bulb nematode) is considered one of
the most devastating plant parasites in temperate regions. Several
pathogen races exist affecting more than 450 plant species, including
important vegetable, cereal, and legume crops. The onion and garlic
race can also affect peas, beetroot, pumpkins, rhubarb, bulb
ornamentals, and several weeds. Symptoms in garlic include yellowing
and necrosis of leaves, bulb scales are loosened, and bulb stems
crack. Young plants can be killed by high infestations. Asymptomatic
bulbs may still contain low nematode levels. Pathogen development
continues during storage of bulbs, which may lead to large crop
losses. Affected tissue is more susceptible to secondary fungal or
bacterial rots.

Young nematodes feed on leaves, stems, and bulbs, adults move into the
soil once plant tissues become too degraded. They can be spread with
water, soil, planting material, or by mechanical means (such as
contaminated equipment). Disease management includes exclusion, long
crop rotation with non-host species, control of potential pathogen
reservoirs, use of certified clean seed bulbs, and soil pre-treatment
with nematicides (drenching or fumigation). Thermotherapy of planting
material and systemic nematicides in seed production are being used in
some areas. Eradication of soil nematodes is extremely difficult and
emphasis is often placed on keeping numbers below economically
significant thresholds.

An outbreak of unknown origin of the related potato rot nematode (_D.
destructor_) has recently been reported on garlic crops in Ontario,
Canada (ProMED-mail post 20110825.2589).
