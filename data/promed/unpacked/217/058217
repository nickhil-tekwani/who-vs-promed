5 people have died and more than 100 have been infected in an
outbreak of the West Nile virus in Volgograd, central Russia, where 2
million people are at risk of catching the mosquito-borne [virus]
disease, officials said Tuesday [24 Aug 2010]. "116 cases of the West
Nile virus have been registered in the Volgograd region between 16
Jul - 23 Aug 2010," the Russian public health watchdog
Rospotrebnadzor said. Of those, "5 have ended in fatalities," its
branch for the region said in a statement posted on its website.

Weather conditions in the region coupled with migrating birds nesting
in the Volga delta in the summer have facilitated the spread of the
disease in the region over the past decade, the watchdog said. But
prolonged rains and a hot summer this year encouraged a spike in the
disease, with birds infecting mosquitoes which in turn pass it on to
people, it said, noting that twice as many mosquitoes have been
infected with the virus this year, compared to 2009. "A sharp spike
in the number of mosquitoes in 2010 is related to the fact that May
and June were unusually rainy," the statement said. Russia is also
now emerging from its severest heatwave on record which baked the
country in July and the 1st half of August [2010].

Of the 2 million people at risk of infection, the 1.5 million who
live in the main regional city Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) and
surrounding areas are in "the high-risk zone," the watchdog said. The
watchdog's branch for Voronezh, also in central Russia, said late
last week 3 residents in that region had also contracted the virus.

The West Nile virus is indigenous to Africa, Asia, Europe, and
Australia and can cause a variety of syndromes, including meningitis
and encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.

[Outbreaks of West Nile (WN) virus infections occurred in Volgograd
in 1999 and in 2007. In the 1999 epidemic, 599 WN virus illnesses
were reported along with 33 deaths. In 2007, a total of 44 cases were
reported as of mid-September of that year, with abnormally hot
weather indicated as a contributory factor then, as well.
