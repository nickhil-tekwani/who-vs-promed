Denmark reports first suspected case of scrapie
-----------------------------------------------
Copenhagen: Denmark has reported its first suspected case of scrapie, an
ailment similar to mad cow disease but found among sheep and goats,
veterinary authorities said on Monday.
The suspected case was discovered during a routine test on a sheep at an
abattoir south west of the capital Copenhagen. The flock of 10 animals was
under observation pending laboratory tests from the Danish Veterinary
Institute (expected on Tuesday), officials said. Denmark, along with all
European Union countries, launched routine testing for scrapie in Jan 2002
in an effort to chart the spread of the disease.
Scrapie, a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system
of sheep and goats, has symptoms similar to bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, but is not thought to be transmitted to
humans.

[The following information on the current world distribution of scrapie is
derived from an information bulletin on scrapie of the UK Department of
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) dated 13 Feb 2002
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/bse/bse-science/scrapie/scrp-q+a.html>:
"Scrapie has been reported in many sheep producing regions worldwide.
Reporting depends on effective surveillance and the availability of
laboratory testing facilities. It has been compulsory to notify scrapie in
European Union member states since 1993 and, in recent times, has been
reported in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the
Netherlands, and Spain. Scrapie is also a notifiable disease in about 50
per cent of non-EU countries and there have been official reports of cases
occurring in the USA, Canada, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Switzerland,
Iceland, Israel, Japan, Moldova, and Norway. There have also been
unofficial reports of scrapie in Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, and Portugal. Australia and New Zealand are widely
regarded as being free from scrapie".
Should the current suspicion be confirmed, a subsequent official
notification to the Office International des Epizooties might be expected.
(Thanks to Dr Christoph Schulze from Frankfurt (Oder), Germany, we can
correct a remark in a previous ProMED-mail posting on scrapie in Hesse,
Germany. "Traberkrankheit", the current German name of the disease, means
"trotting disease" and not, as erroneously translated by this moderator,
"trembling disease"). - Mod.AS]
