Low pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), Mexico
------------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 14 Aug 2015 from Joaquin Braulio Delgadillo Alvarez, [director general of animal health, National Service of Health and Agrifood Quality (SENASICA), Ministry of Agriculture, Stockbreeding, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food], Mexico, Mexico

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 24 Jul 2015
Date of confirmation of the event: 10 Aug 2015
Reason for notification: first occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub- clinical infection
Causal agent: low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: El Risario, El Rosario, Sinaloa
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Jul 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed /Slaughtered
Birds / 433 0937 / -- / 0 / 0 / 0 /
Affected population: commercial layers

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: legal movement of animals
Epidemiological comments: Following the epidemiological surveillance activities carried out by the Veterinary Services of Mexico, avian influenza subtype H5N2 has been identified; the intravenous pathogenicity test revealed that it corresponds to a low-pathogenic avian influenza virus. The virus was isolated in a commercial farm of laying hens in the State of Sinaloa. A corresponding epidemiological investigation was initiated, including sampling in 4 industrial poultry farms and in 33 backyard poultry farms located in the 10-km zone around the outbreak, with a total of 720 samples of blood serum and tracheal and cloacal swabs, without detecting evidence of virus circulation. The production unit has been quarantined and a sanitary barrier has been set up. A humane slaughter of birds programme will be launched even though it is a virus of low pathogenicity. Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian influenza in its low-pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable disease as per Chapter 10.4 on avian influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2015).

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; quarantine; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection/disinfestations; stamping out

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory of SENASICA (National laboratory) / Birds / intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) test / 18 Aug 2015/ Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry: http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453.

LPAI has historically been reported by Mexico. Since low pathogenicity H5 and H7 became OIE notifiable diseases in 2006, Mexico has reported it as present in their annual reports. To date, subtypes that have been reported by Mexico have been H5N2 and H7N3 (See ProMED-mail report 20150410.3288078). Based on the official information that has been submitted, the number and location of outbreaks can be found in OIE's WAHID database under the section "Detailed country(ies) disease incidence" http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.
