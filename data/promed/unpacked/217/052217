Outbreak confirmed as Ebola Fever by Laboratory in Gabon
--------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in the West African nation of Gabon has
been confirmed as the deadly disease Ebola fever, the World Health
Organization (WHO) stated on Sun 9 Dec 2001. It is the world's first
documented outbreak of Ebola fever since last year in Uganda, where 224
people, including health workers, died from the virus. Ebola hemorrhagic
fever is one of the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind,
causing death in 50 to 90 percent of all clinically ill cases.
"It's been confirmed by a laboratory in Gabon," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl
told the Associated Press. "We've had reports that 7 people have died."
Hartl said WHO has already sent a team to help the coastal nation and that
a second team of 4 specialists would leave Geneva for Gabon on Mon 10 Dec
2001.
The outbreak is in remote Ogooue Ivindo province in northeastern Gabon, he
said. Gabon was last afflicted in an outbreak in 1996-97 that killed 45 of
the 60 people infected. "We've had very little information," Hartl said.
"The confirmation came from a laboratory in Franceville, also in eastern
Gabon. A team from the Gabon Ministry of Health and the International
Center of Medical Research in Franceville went to the province last week
when they first received reports of that the outbreak might be Ebola." On
Fri 7 Dec 2001, Hartl said also that there were unconfirmed reports of a
possible outbreak in nearby Congo.
WHO says more than 800 people have died of the disease since the virus was
first identified in 1976 in western Sudan and in a nearby region of Zaire,
now [the Democratic Republic of Congo. The first case in Gabon was
documented in 1994, the agency says. After the 1996-7 outbreak in Gabon it
wasn't documented again until it appeared in Uganda last year.
WHO recommends that suspected cases be isolated from other patients and
that strict barrier nursing techniques be used to shield health workers
from exposure. Gloves and masks must be worn and disinfected before re-use,
the agency says. Patients who die from the disease should be promptly
buried or cremated. The virus has also been transmitted to people from
handling ill or dead infected chimpanzees.

not now considered to be Ebola fever. - Mod.CP
