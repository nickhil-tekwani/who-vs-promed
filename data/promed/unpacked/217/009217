The Georgia Department of Public Health Northwest Health District has concluded that the cause of the foodborne illness outbreak related to a catered Thanksgiving meal employee event at Toyo Tire in White, GA on 14 and 15 Nov 2017 was salmonellosis. The determination is based on multiple positive lab-test results for salmonella from employees who attended the event. There have been 5 hospitalizations due to the outbreak. The specific food source has not been identified by officials.

The permitted Bartow County restaurant in Cartersville, GA that catered the event has voluntarily closed and will remained closed until the week of 27 Nov 2017. Employees of the restaurant have received rigorous training in safe food handling from Bartow County Health Department environmental health specialists. Local media has identified the caterer as Angelo's New York Style Pizza and Bistro, inâ€ˆCartersville.

The Northwest Health District and the Bartow County Health Department continue to work with Toyo Human Resources to gather and compile additional information about the outbreak directly from the approximately 1800 employees who attended the event and potentially may have been exposed.
