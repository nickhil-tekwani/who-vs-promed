The deadly dog disease Alabama rot has spread to the outskirts of the West Midlands after a case in Warwickshire was reported. Veterinary experts are now calling on pet owners across the West Midlands to take precautions. The case is the 11th spotted across the country in the past few weeks. Vets have now called the first ever Alabama rot conference, taking place next Wednesday [10 May 2017] in Reading, Berkshire, where experts will put their heads together as they desperately try to tackle the spread of the disease in Britain.

Vet David Walker, the UK's lead investigator into the condition, said: "It's a dreadful disease and is not specific to any particular age or breed. It's often a disease that affects otherwise young dogs in the prime of their lives. We don't want to create panic, but we want to make people aware of this. When we first recognised it at the back end of 2012, we thought it would be a few sporadic cases, but the disease is definitely persisting. The average time for dying, unfortunately, is just 7 days. It can deteriorate very quickly. From the onset of kidney failure after 3 days - that's just 4 days until they are likely to die. We've done a huge amount of research but still do not know what causes it."

A total of 78 dogs have been confirmed with the disease in the UK since 2012. The mysterious illness, which first appeared in the late 1980s affecting greyhounds in America, has been found in at least 27 counties in England and Wales since 2012.

- How to avoid your dog getting Alabama rot:
Avoid taking your dogs for walks in muddy wooded areas, particularly after a period of heavy rainfall. Wash your dog's paws and legs thoroughly when you get back from the walk.

- What signs should dog owners look out for?
One of the most noticeable signs of the disease early in its onset is skin lesions. This abnormality in the tissue of an organism begins as a slow-healing ulcer. Owners who spot wounds or lesions to the limbs of their pet or on their dog's face that appear to take a long time to heal should make a prompt visit to the vet. Dogs can also appear to become depressed, with a loss of appetite, and they may start to vomit. This can lead to acute injury to the kidneys.

[Similar cases have been addressed by ProMED-mail since their first appearance in the UK, initially (2011) referred to as "undiagnosed". In 2015, the disease was designated "cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy" (CRGV or Alabama rot), close to a condition which has been seen in the USA in greyhounds for almost 30 years.

The following letter to the editor was published in the Veterinary Record of 16 Jan 2016, signed by David Walker and Laura Holm (Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists, Hursley, Winchester) and Rosanne Jepson and Ludovic Pelligand (Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, Hertfordshire):

"It is challenging to know whether an erosive or ulcerative skin lesion of unknown cause is the result of CRGV or something else, as azotaemia is typically absent at initial presentation, and urine-concentrating ability may be retained. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement may allow early detection of pre-azotaemic AKI and thus direct appropriate management.

"We invite veterinary surgeons presented with a dog with skin lesion(s) of unknown cause to contact Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists (medicine@andersonmoores.com; 01962 767920) to discuss GFR measurement. Samples can be collected in their practices, and laboratory testing will be performed at the Royal Veterinary College; results will be available within 24 hours, thus aiding clinical decision making. Aside from blood sampling, all costs will be covered."

This yet unclarified syndrome seems to be spreading; the announced meeting to discuss it is timely. Findings, discussions, and (even if temporary) conclusions are awaited with interest.
