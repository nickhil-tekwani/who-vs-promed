The Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) is facing an unprecedented
crisis, with foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] claiming the lives of 2
mithuns and a blackbuck.

FMD has hit the park for the 1st time. As a precautionary measure,
the authorities have decided to close the herbivore safari to prevent
the spread of the disease, which is caused by an airborne virus.

The Jungle Lodges and Resorts' Bannerghatta Nature Camp will close
its operations from Monday [29 Oct 2007], K.B. Markandaiah, executive
director of the park said.

The blackbuck's death on Saturday [27 Oct 2007] follows that of the
mithun, a wild breed of cattle native to the northeast of the country.

Nine blackbucks and some spotted deer were in the enclosures adjacent
to that of the mithuns.

Suspecting infection, the zoo authorities have shifted the remaining
deer to the Bannerghatta Rescue Centre, which is run jointly by the
Forest Department and Compassion Unlimited Plus Action.

"This is to prevent the spread of disease to other animals," Mr.
Markandaiah said.

On 21 Oct 2007, an 8-year-old mithun was found dead in its enclosure.
Four days later, another one, a 3-year-old, died. The IAHVB confirmed
that they had died of FMD, which has an incubation period of 15 days.

The park personnel have started spraying disinfectants around the
enclosures. Vehicles have been banned inside the zoo, and visitors on
foot will have to step into water containing disinfectants before
entering the zoo. Captive elephants in the zoo have been vaccinated,
according to Dr. Vishwanath.

The zoo authorities have stopped procuring grass from outside. The
animal keepers have been asked to change their dress before entering
the zoo and the safari. "We are trying our best to prevent the
outbreak of the virus in the safari and the forest," Dr. Vishwanath added.

Mithun are susceptible to FMD, which generally infects cattle. "Three
months ago, some mithuns died in the Thiruvananthapuram zoo [in
Kerala], forcing the authorities to close it for a month," Dr.
Vishwanath said. The virus is active during rains. [For an
administrative map of India, see

"Once there is sunshine, it is deactivated" [though FMD virus is
indeed susceptible to UV radiation, it will take considerably longer
than "one sunshine" to inactivate it. - Mod.AS].

The Bannerghatta park authorities are mystified over the origin of
the disease here. The Forest Department has asked the Animal
Husbandry Department to vaccinate the cattle, which are carriers of
the disease.

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) I.B. Srivastava
said the Animal Husbandry Department would undertake vaccination in
about 25 village surrounding the biological park and the Bannerghatta
National Park. "Instructions have been given to forest guards and
watchers to prevent grazing of cattle in the area," he said.

Sources in the Bannerghatta Nature Camp operated by Jungle Lodges and
Resorts (JLR) said that the 15 guests camping on the property will
check out on Sunday [28 Oct 2007] morning.

The decision on its reopening will be taken after assessing the situation.

"Many individual and corporate groups that had booked accommodation
in the nature camp have been requested to take back their money. It
is not a panicky situation, only a precautionary measure, which has
been appreciated by our guests," sources said.

[Laboratory confirmation, serotyping, and -- if possible -- also
genotyping of the causative agent are anticipated.

During July/August 2007, around 50 wild animals, including protected
species (blackbucks, mithun bulls and nilgai), as well as wild boars,
were severely affected by FMD in the zoo of Thiruvananthapuram,
Kerala. Most of them died or had to be culled. Failing to vaccinate
valuable, protected, FMD-susceptible animals in a country where FMD
is known to be endemic and widely spread is deplorable.
Unfortunately, so far, there is no information available about the
serotype involved in the Kerala outbreak. It seems that the FMDV
strain involved in the Kerala outbreak demonstrated specific
pathogenicity for the wild species affected; it will be interesting
to note whether the same genotype is responsible for the current
cases in neighbouring Bangalore, similarly killing mithuns and blackbucks.

According to the data available at the website of the FMD World
Reference laboratory, Pirbright, the current status of FMD in India
is "Endemic," and the following 4 FMDV serotypes were the last ones
reported: O, Asia 1, C (1996), A. (see source at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/ind.htm>).

And, a footnote: the above news article includes a picture,
describing "Visitors to the Bannerghatta Biological Park in Bangalore
being made to step on water containing disinfectants before entering
inside." Since the infection has been identified within the park, it
would be advisable also to disinfect the visitors' footwear on their
way out. - Mod.AS]
