[1] Bacterial leaf blight - Kaduna, Nasarawa

Farms are coming under attack by rice disease, on the heels of the recent floods that destroyed rice farms across the country. According to the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), the disease is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv Oryzae, which results in wilting of seedlings, yellowing and drying of leaves.

In Kaduna State, many of the farms have been attacked by the blight. Unfortunately the blight wiped out all investment and expected gains [of farmers]. [They] called on the relevant authorities to revive the system, where extension workers would be available to farmers for necessary guidance. In Nasarawa State, some farms have also been devastated by the disease.

Syngenta Nigeria advised farmers to always use not only certified seeds but treated certified seeds and observe good agronomy practices to avoid things like this. IRRI has advised farmers to practice good cleaning of equipment and fields between season, use clean seeds and resistant varieties, plant at the same time as your neighbours.

[2] Blast disease - Jigawa

Rice farmers in Jigawa have called on the state government to take urgent action to check the menace of a rice pest popularly known as 'blast', destroying rice farms in the area. The Rice Farmers Apex Association [said], "This year [2018] has been challenging to rice growers in the area due to the devastation caused by flood, blast and quela birds. The [blast] destroys rice seed by making the pod shrink, preventing it from growing fully."

An official advised the farmers to stop buying seeds from unregistered seed dealers and companies, and to use [a] variety of seeds every year to avoid possible infection by the pest. "If you find out that the seed is infected with the disease, change seed next year and destroy the stock to prevent the spread of the pest," he said.

[Leaf blight
-----------
Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ (Xoo). In Asia, millions of hectares of rice paddies are severely affected every year, with reported yield losses of up to 60 per cent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves and wilting of seedlings. Blight lesions caused by severe strains elongate over the entire length of the flag leaf, giving a striped appearance. Severe strains may also affect panicles. Mild strains cause only small leaf lesions and may not lead to any detectable yield loss. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing to the damage. Field patches infested with bacterial blight have a whitish, ragged appearance.

BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water and warm temperatures. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material (such as rice stubble or ratoons) and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting seedlings or by high insect activity).

Disease management usually includes phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers) and use of resistant crop varieties. Control of insect populations by insecticides may help reduce the unspecific spread of bacteria via their scratching and sucking wounds. Antibacterial sprays containing antibiotics are rarely used because they often provide little benefit, and agricultural application of antibiotics is strictly regulated in most countries. The related _X. oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice.

Blast
-----
Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (previously _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed; infection late in the growth cycle generally leads to less severe damage. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170306.4883233 and 20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions, including high humidity. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers). The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence. Use of certified clean seed is essential, and farm saved seed poses a high risk of carry-over of the fungus to subsequent crops.
