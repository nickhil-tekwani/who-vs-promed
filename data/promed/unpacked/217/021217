Six people died and 12 are hospitalized for consuming anthrax-contaminated cattle in the southern Angolan province of Huila, official sources said [Wed 10 Jul 2019].

The incident took place last May [2019] in Mulondo, in the municipality of Matala, the provincial supervisor for Health Promotion in Huila, Julio Madaleno, told Angola Press. The victims may had eaten the meat of dead animals (not processed for human consumption), Madaleno said after clarifying that the situation is controlled by a multidisciplinary team of doctors and veterinarians in the area, who collected samples, vaccinated the animals and treat the sick.

Patients are treated with antibiotics at Matala hospital, the source added.

Since last April [2019], Mulondo has been home to some 60 000 head of cattle from the provinces of Cunene and Namibia, who are looking for water and pasture in that region because of the persistent drought in southern Angola and in the north of the other country.

[For a map of Angola, go to: https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/angola_rel90.jpg. Huila is in the south-east corner of Angola, just north of Cunene which is on the Namibian border.

Anthrax is only reported in cattle in Angola and is of low incidence. The suggestion in this press report is that the affected cattle may have brought the (latent) disease with them from either Cunene or Namibia. Not impossible. - Mod. MHJ
