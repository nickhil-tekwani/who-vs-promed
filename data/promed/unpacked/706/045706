PILCHARD MORTALITY SOUTH AUSTRALIA
On the 7 October 1998, two fishermen from the Spencer Gulf area (South
Australia) reported sighting a significant number of dead pilchards
floating on the surface of the water. Since the weekend commencing 10
October, there have been reports of additional deaths from northern Spencer
Gulf, from the Gulf of St Vincent, and from areas adjacent to Coffin Bay.
Pilchards have also started to wash up on a number of Adelaide's popular
swimming beaches.
Investigations, including plane surveys, are being carried out to assess
the size and the distribution as well as spread of pilchard mortality. As a
precautionary measure, South Australia are closing down the pilchard
fisheries and restricting the movement of pilchard product. Relevant
Australian authorities have been informed.
Water samples taken do not indicate the presence of toxic algae.
Dead animals have been collected for laboratory testing by South
Australia's Veterinary Pathology Services. To date, histopathology
indicates epithelial hyperplasia in gills of affected animals, however,
because of the autolytic state of most of the samples, results need to be
confirmed by examinations of a larger number of fresher samples.
Samples have also been submitted to the CSIRO Australian Animal Health
Laboratory in Geelong, Victoria. Preliminary results - in particular on the
presence of a virus - are expected by the end of this week; in the 1995
mortality event, a herpesvirus was associated with the pilchard kill. The
virus could, however, not be isolated in cell culture; evidence was based
on electron microscopical examinations.
We will provide updates of the situation.
