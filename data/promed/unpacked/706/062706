Health officials have joined forces in search and destroy operations to curb the chikungunya outbreak in Mariveles [Bataan province], which affected over 100 people.

A team from the Provincial Health Office (PHO), Municipal Health Office (MHO), Municipal Environment and Natural Resources Office and barangay tanod [village police] has been staging fogging operations in the 18 barangays of the town.

Based on the latest report from MHO, 144 people were afflicted with the disease from 29 Jul-30 Sep [2013].

With this, Mayor Jesse Concepcion has declared a disease outbreak in 4 villages with the highest number of cases: Camaya, Baseco, Malaya, and Sisiman. The outbreak, raised in the 1st week of September 2013, is still in effect.

"We are continuously doing search and destroy operations against the breeding sites of mosquitoes. Every barangay undergoes fogging," said Concepcion.

According to MHO head Danny Velasco, no casualty has been recorded due to the disease, but they cannot yet lift the outbreak status because many people are still affected, although the trend is declining.

Records show that the 1st week of September 2013 accounted for the highest number of chikungunya cases, as 38 people were diagnosed. In the last week, the figures dropped as 3 people were diagnosed.

"At present, we are doing fogging operations. We have advised all barangays to search and destroy mosquito breeding sites in their respective areas with the assistance of our health workers," said Velasco.

PHO Sanitary Engineer Eugene Ramirez, a member of the team that leads the fogging operations, said all barangays of Mariveles were finished with the fogging except for barangay Ipag, which will be combed on 2-3 Oct [2013].

Chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the same that carries dengue [virus]. It causes fever, severe joint pain, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash. It is often misdiagnosed as dengue as it shares clinical signs with that deadly disease. Though chikungunya [virus infection] has no cure, treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. [It is rarely fatal. - Mod.JW]

[This is the 2nd recent report of the chikungunya virus outbreak in Mariveles, and the number of cases continues to mount. Fogging will provide only short-term mosquito vector control. Health authorities are correct to focus on elimination of breeding sites. The above report does not indicate whether they are applying abate larvicide to breeding sites. The Philippines has had outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in various localities on several islands this year (2013)-- see ProMED archives below. - Mod.JW
