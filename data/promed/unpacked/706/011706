Outbreak of Bovine Paralytic Rabies
-------------------------------------------------
The animal health coordinators from the Ministry of Agricultural
Development (MIDA) confirmed that the samples taken from the area of
Palma Real tested positive for the fatal bovine paralytic rabies.
The outbreak of bovine rabies was diagnosed by MIDA's central
laboratory in Panama City, after obtaining a positive brain tissue
sample from one of the dead animals from a farm in the municipality
of Palma Real.
Enrique Moreno, Director General of MIDA in the province of Bocas del
Toro, informed that prevention measures have been implemented so that
the disease is not disseminated to other farms. Such measures include
the vaccination of animals in a 6-mile radius from the affected farm.
In addition, the tuberculosis program has been suspended so that this
more urgent outbreak may be controlled.
Moreno commented that since this virus may also affect humans, the
Ministry of Health is coordinating the follow-up of all persons
involved in the care of these animals. A case of a dead dog has been
reported and the results of tests for the virus are pending.
Nonetheless, Moreno indicated that they lack the necessary resources
to address the situation, which represents a cost of 500 000 dollars
for 37 farms located within a 6-mile radius from the affected farm.
The entire area has been placed under quarantine.
Carlos Flores, head of the Epidemiology Department of the Social
Security Administration, reported that immunizing people who are not
in contact with the animals is not necessary; therefore, vaccines
were requested only for the 48 workers who will vaccinate the animals.
The Ministry of Health will coordinate the massive vaccination of
domestic animals, specifically dogs and cats, as well as that of all
persons who have had some type of contact with these animals.
Flores noted that there are no vaccines in the area because the virus
has only been detected in the province on 2 occasions, last year in
the areas of Tibite and Balaspid.
Faustino Sanchez, head of the food control division of the Ministry
of Health, stated that 1000 [doses of vaccine] have been requested in
order to begin the prevention campaign in the area of Chiriqui Grande.

[_Desmodus rotundus_, the common vampire bat, is most often
responsible for paralytic rabies in cattle. The attack pattern of
_Desmodus_ on bovines has been studied in Mexico with the use of
night-viewing equipment. Vampire bats are capable of biting any part
of the body of cattle. However, bites are more frequent on the neck,
ears, and around the base of the tail (Flores-Crespo et al., 1974).
Campos-Vela (1972) demonstrated that more than 90 percent of the
vampire bats captured in different regions of Mexico had fed on
domestic livestock.
Other wild or domestic vectors of rabies normally bite only when they
are disturbed, but the members of the Desmodontidae have
blood-lapping habits and must bite to feed. Therefore, when rabid,
these bats are the most effective rabies vectors. They are by far the
most frequent cause of outbreaks of rabies in livestock in Latin
America and some Caribbean countries.
