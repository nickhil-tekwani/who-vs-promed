Rene Collin, the Walloon Minister for Agriculture, Nature and Forests, has received from the Wildlife Surveillance Network in Wallonia a new inventory of tests carried out in the framework of the management of African swine fever in the defined territory of 63 000 hectares (630 square km; 243 square miles).

To date, 106 wild boars have been collected. A total of 80 of them were found within the perimeter. Of these, there are now 44 viropositive cases. The wild boars collected outside the perimeter were all negative. The number of boars tested positive continues to increase. Indeed, while there were 28 [on Tue 2 Oct 2018] and 32 [on Thu 4 Oct 2018], there are now 12 more.

Since 17 Sep 2018, the date the ministerial decree prohibiting traffic in forests to limit the spread of the African swine fever was enforced, within a perimeter of 63 000 hectares (about 244 square miles), the police of Gaume counted several accidents caused by wild boars in the infected area.

"In our police zone, there are about 600 accidents a year; 150 are caused by game," says the divisional commissioner Jean-Yves Schul. "In recent weeks, some accidents caused by wild boars have been noted, including in the commune of Meix-devant-Virton, [but] all may not have been reported."

The commanding officer recommends calling the police so that adequate measures are taken. "If it's a wild boar, it's very important to report it to limit the spread of the virus," he says, "Do not approach or touch the animal. To report the facts and the position of the vehicle, we must wait for the arrival of a police service on site, [and] we recommend not to touch the outside of the vehicle and secure or report its location if is on the road."

The procedure set up in the context of the crisis foresees that a police team will go on site to assess the situation and, if necessary, ask for assistance from the Nature and Forests Division. "If necessary, the vehicle can be decontaminated directly or retrospectively," he concludes, "Virkon is a disinfectant approved by the University of Liege, and the carcass of the wild boar is then analyzed."

In the case where the struck animal is not a wild boar, the user is invited to follow the procedure of declaration of the usual accident at the police station.

[3] Belgium, control measures discussed, regional impact

Belgium will deploy army snipers to slaughter wild boars in a bid to stop the spread of the deadly African swine fever (ASF) virus across Europe, the country's government has announced. Sharpshooters will be sent into the forests of the southern province of Luxembourg, where at least 15 cases of the disease have been discovered, to cull the boar population.

The action was demanded by Belgian pig farmers, who now face mounting import bans on their products, and mirrors a similar response taken by the Czech Republic [see comment]. Authorities in Prague turned to police snipers to control the outbreak there, which involved officers fencing off a large area and hunting 158 wild boars in a 2-month period between October and December [2017].

Belgian officials are increasingly concerned that ASF will be transferred by wild boars to farm pigs, which could decimate the country's agricultural industry. They have quarantined a massive 63 000 hectares (156 000 acres) of land near the southern border to prevent it from spreading further and have already announced a cull of 4000 pigs at farms in the area.

Hendrik Vandamme, chairman of the Belgian farmers' union, the General Agricultural Syndicate, said farmers had been struggling to sell pork products and that the outbreak led to a fall in market prices that was "much deeper than anyone suspected."

"The impact on the pig sector is being felt in all corners of the country despite the highly isolated and remote contamination. We now hear various signals from retailers that sales will be difficult, translating into lower purchase prices," Vandamme said.

Belgian authorities will compensate farmers for some of their losses and are set to ask the European Union to step in with further financial assistance. The outbreak in Belgium has caused alarm among politicians in the Netherlands, which is only 93 miles (150 km) to the north of the new exclusion zone.

Authorities in The Hague have announced they are introducing extra checks on pigs arriving from Belgium and have launched a new program to monitor the health of their own wild boar population. "This is a serious situation for Belgium. To keep the risk for the Netherlands as small as possible, we will monitor the situation continuously and we will look if all the precautionary measures taken are sufficient," said Dutch Agriculture Minister Carola Schouten. "Transporters who transport, for example, pigs from countries where African swine fever is being found on farms, will have to be cleaned extra at the border. In addition, we are monitoring the wild boar population intensively in the Netherlands."

According to the European Food Safety Authority, the disease originally entered Europe from Russia and Belarus in early 2014 via Eastern states, including Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, and Estonia. More than 361 000 wild boar and farm pigs have been reported to the OIE as being infected with the disease so far this year [2018], with 119 000 deaths. The virus is not harmful to humans.

[The ASF event in the Belgian province of Luxembourg, adjacent to the borders of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and France, is continuing in an increased pace, though limited to its initial declared infected zone. As underlined in section [3], the Belgian farmers demand applying a control and eventual eradication policy in line with the Czech policy.

Subscribers are referred to the presentation "African swine fever in wild boars in the Czech Republic -- current situation" presented during the most recent meeting of EU's Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed -- sections Animal Health and Welfare and Controls and Import Conditions, held in Brussels on 19 Sep 2018.

The presentation covered the period between 26 Jun 2017 (start of event) and 18 Sep 2018. In total, 230 cases of ASF were recorded in the wild boar population, of which 212 were found in dead wild boar and 18 hunted wild boar. The last positive cases were found in hunted wild boar on 8 Feb 2018 and in dead wild boar on 15 Apr 2018. All the positive cases were limited to the declared "high-risk area" (only 89 square km/about 34 square miles). There was not a single case in domestic pigs. For additional information, including maps and tables/graphics, please refer to https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20180919_pres_asf_cze.pdf.

The Czech Republic sent its follow-up report No. 35 on the ASF event on 1 Oct 2018. Although no new cases have been recorded since the previous follow-up report (submitted 20 Apr 2018), the event has not been declared "resolved," and is regarded as "continuing."

A summary of the event, including a map and links to all follow-up reports, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=24159.
