1st report of _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ in Argentina
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Mar del Plata area [Buenos Aires province] of Argentina, many kiwifruit orchards composed of only male plants (_Actinidia deliciosa_ cv. Chieftain) have been established for pollen production, since the country was considered unaffected by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (EPPO A2 List). Routine controls have been conducted to verify the absence of the bacterium in the pollen that is produced and commercialized.

In February 2015, some bacterial colonies with morphological features similar to those of _P. syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ were detected. Four of these colonies were further studied (biochemical, molecular, and pathogenicity tests) and the identity of the bacterium was confirmed to be _P . syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_. This is the first time that this bacterium has been detected in Argentina. For the moment, it has been detected only in pollen and not in plants, but extensive monitoring and laboratory analysis are ongoing.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) is caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (Psa). Symptoms may include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, fruit collapse, followed by death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn.

Psa infection is thought to occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means and infected plant material. Spread with pollen is strongly suspected (see link below). Spread with infected fruit can so far not be excluded. Alternative hosts (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160225.4050698) are likely pathogen reservoirs. A number of different biovars (populations) of Psa exist that vary, for example, in geographical origin and/or aggressiveness. A very virulent strain, Psa-V (biovar 3) was detected in central Italy (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207).

Disease management of Psa (and other bacterial diseases) may include cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread, use of clean planting and propagating material (including pollen) and resistant crop varieties. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used to control Psa, but resistant pathogen strains have emerged. For example, a streptomycin resistant strain is emerging in New Zealand (ProMED-mail post 20150430.3332617).

The research reported above provides further evidence for the risk of Psa spread with pollen. The source document explicitly states that at the time the commercial pollen was harvested, Psa could only be detected in the pollen but not in the parental plants. This is particularly concerning since it precludes pre-screening of pollen source plants as a safe way to produce Psa-free pollen. Rather, screening with sufficiently sensitive diagnostic methods and certification of each batch of pollen would be required.
