Fruit rot caused by the fungus _Athelia rolfsii_ is being reported in jackfruit in several districts of Kerala. The new development warrants immediate attention. This is the first time this fruit rot is being reported in jackfruit in the country. A study on how the disease can be managed in jackfruit is being launched.

Another disease which is found in immature jackfruit is rhizopus fruit rot, but it does not affect mature fruit.

[The fruits of the jackfruit tree (_Artocarpus heterophyllus_) can weigh up to 60 kg [132 lbs] with almost 1 m [3 ft] in length and are amongst the largest tree fruits known. Depending on the level of sweetness of different varieties, they are eaten as fresh or preserved fruit, or a vegetable. The crop is grown widely in tropical and subtropical areas.

The fungus _Athelia rolfsii_ (previously _Sclerotium rolfsii_) is soilborne and has a wide host range in warm, humid regions, including many crops. Many wild and weedy species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. The pathogen survives between seasons as sclerotia (hard, protective structures) which then provide primary inoculum for new crops. It does not produce spores but is spread with soil, farm machinery, and plant debris. Disease management may include deep plowing, phytosanitation, crop rotation for several years, and some fungicide treatments.

Jackfruit was first reported as a new host of _A. rolfsii_ in 2021 from Bangladesh (see link below), after an undiagnosed fruit rot had been observed in the country earlier (ProMED post 20160617.4293390). In neighbouring India, the fungus is known to cause rots on several crops; its detection on jackfruit is, therefore, not surprising.

The other fruit rot mentioned above is a common disease of the crop. It is caused by the fungus _Rhizopus artocarpi_ and affects both flowers and young fruit.
