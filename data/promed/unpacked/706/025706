[In July 2017, Swaziland reported one outbreak of African horse sickness (AHS) in a farm in McCreedy, Hhohho (where the current outbreak is located). Serotype 7 was also identified. The event summary and map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=24374.

African horse sickness (AHS) is a highly infectious non-contagious, vector born viral disease affecting all species of Equidae. It is classified as an _Orbivirus_ of the Reoviridae family of which there are 9 serotypes. All serotypes (1-9) are distributed throughout South Africa, although there is a variation in their temporal distribution. It is endemic to (occurs naturally on) the African continent, and is characterised by respiratory and circulatory damage, accompanied by fever and loss of appetite.

Animals affected are, all breeds of horses (mortality rate of 70-90 percent), mules, and donkeys. Wildlife equine species (zebras) are resistant to the disease. The AHS virus does not spread directly from one horse to another, but is transmitted by the _Culicoides_ midge, which becomes infected when feeding on other infected equidae. It occurs mostly in the warm, rainy season when midges are plentiful, and disappears after frost, when the midges die. Most animals become infected in the period associated with sunset and sunrise when the midges are most active (http://www.africanhorsesickness.co.za/about_ahs.asp).
