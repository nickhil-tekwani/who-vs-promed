CHOLERA, IMPORTED - FRANCE, UK: REQUEST FOR INFO
*****************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>

In Notifications received from 11 to 17 September 1998, published in the
WHO WER (Weekly Epidemiological Record), 2 non-fatal cases of imported
cholera are reported, one in France (notified on 14 Sep 1998) & the
other in the UK (notified on 3 Sep 1998).
Can anyone tell us the origin of these infections, and whether they were
typed? Such information is valuable in the detection of cholera in
countries that are not declaring it.
