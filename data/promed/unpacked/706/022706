Confirmed Hepatitis E cases in Omusati stand at 11 and not 10 cases as was recently reported. According to a report released by the Ministry of Health and Social Services, the number of suspected cases also stands at 47 and not 41 as was reported by several newspapers yesterday [Mon 28 May 2018].

So far one person is reported to have died - on [10 May 2018]. The patient is said to have tested positive after delivering a baby at the Oshikuku District Hospital. She later died at the Oshakati Intermediate Hospital. The cases were recorded between [9 Jan 2018] and [23 May 2018].

The report was confirmed by the Omusati Regional Health Director Alfons Amoomo. The report issued by the health ministry also indicated that Tsandi District Hospital recorded the highest number of suspected cases of 23 and 5 confirmed cases. Tsandi is followed by Okahao with 17 suspected cases and 3 confirmed cases of Hepatitis E. Outapi has 5 suspected cases and 1 confirmed case, while Oshikuku has 2 suspected and confirmed cases.

The ministry report further shows that amongst confirmed cases, 7 people have a history of traveling from Windhoek while another traveled from Keetmanshoop. A total of 3 of the confirmed cases have no history of travelling but one is reported to have been in contact with a person from Havana informal settlement in Windhoek.

The virus earlier claimed the lives of 14 people in Windhoek in 2018. Omusati Regional Governor Erginus Endjala said a team from Windhoek is expected to meet with the regional team to give their finding on the investigations they have been conducting.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 per cent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 per cent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 per cent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html).

Omusati region is one of the 14 regions of Namibia, its capital is Outapi. The region's name Omusati, comes from the oshiwamo word 'omusati' which means 'Mopane'. Mopani tree is the dominant species in the region. It can be found in northwest Namibia at:
