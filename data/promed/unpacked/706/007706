"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a severe and highly contagious viral disease. The FMD virus causes illness in cows, pigs, sheep, goats, deer, and other animals with divided hooves. It does not affect horses, dogs, or cats.

FMD is not a public health or food safety threat. It is also not related to hand-foot-mouth disease, which is a common childhood illness caused by a different virus."
