[The total number of chikungunya virus infections in Delhi has
increased from 71 on 11 Nov 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111112.3355) to 95, 2 weeks later, per the above report. The above
report mentions that Delhi is experiencing a mixed chikungunya and
dengue outbreak. Both viruses are transmitted by the same _Aedes_
mosquitoes. The above report mentions increased surveillance to check
the spread of the disease. Halting spread will only be accomplished if
surveillance is accompanied by reduction in mosquito breeding sites in
and around houses.
