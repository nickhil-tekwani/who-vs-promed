Flesh-Eating Disease Kills Staghorn Coral
----------------------------------------
An unidentified flesh-eating disease is killing staghorn coral in the
Florida Keys.
Staghorn coral, so named because of its antler-like branches, is already in
steep demise in the Keys. Since the 1970s, 80 to 90 percent of the island
chain's reef tract has died, according to the Florida Keys National Marine
Sanctuary.
Pollution, algae blooms, sediment, and a host of diseases have been blamed,
among them coral bleaching, black-band and white-band disease, and white
plague. But this coral-tissue-eating disease appears to be a newcomer.
"A lot of very freshly exposed skeletons alerted me," said Dana Williams, a
postdoctoral associate at the University of Miami. "But we have no idea
what it is."
The scientists determined that the disease could be spread by the small
coral snail, which eats coral, but do not yet know whether humans can
transmit it too.
Scientists at the Hollings Marine Laboratory in South Carolina are trying
to identify the unknown disease.
Williams and Margaret Miller, an ecologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, first detected bald patches of staghorn at 2
reefs off Key Largo in April 2003. NOAA sealed off the small reefs for 2
months, fearful that the malady could be spread by boats, divers, and
snorkelers.
In field tests, scientists pressed fragments of healthy coral against
diseased branches, and watched as the 6-8-inch fragments died within 4 to 5
days. The team later detected the disease present in 14 out of 17 sites.
Another survey this past February [2004] revealed that just 10 percent of
each infected colony was alive, Williams said.
