[1] Pakistan WPV1 North Waziristan 2nd case

Pakistan officials report the 2nd polio case of 2022. A 2-year-old girl was paralyzed by the wild poliovirus, she had an onset of paralysis on [14 Apr 2022].

The new type-1 wild poliovirus (WPV1) was confirmed from North Waziristan on [29 Apr 2022] by the Pakistan National Polio Laboratory at the National Institute of Health in Islamabad.

On [22 Apr 2022], a 15-month boy had been confirmed with wild polio with an onset of paralysis on [9 Apr 2022]. Both children are from North Waziristan, Southern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and belong to adjacent Union Councils of Mir Ali. The WPV1 cases are genetically linked and belong to the same virus cluster, further validating the Pakistan Polio Programme's concerns for Southern KP, where continuous virus circulation has been detected.

"It is heartbreaking to learn that a 2-year-old girl will be paralyzed for the rest of her life by a virus that has been eliminated in most parts of the world," said Health Minister Qadir Patel. "This is tragic for her family, for the community and all of us in Pakistan, but mostly for this child, who will live with an incurable disease that was entirely preventable."

Southern KP had been identified by the polio programme as the area most at risk after wild poliovirus was detected in environmental samples in the last quarter of 2021. Following this, an emergency action plan was initiated in January this year [2022] that is allowing the programme to reach more children than ever before and protect them from the paralytic virus before it affects more lives.

The National and Provincial Polio Emergency Operations Centres are already conducting an emergency vaccination campaign following the confirmation of the case last week [see global update below plus Poliomyelitis update (16): WPV1 AFP Pakistan, cVDPV2, AFP, cVDPV3 ES 20220425.8702827]. I strongly urge everyone travelling for Eid to vaccinate their children if they are travelling from one area to another," Health Secretary Aamir Ashraf Khawaja said.

"This is deeply sad for all of us in the polio programme. But we are resilient and unwilling to fail. While we will do whatever it takes to ensure that this little girl is the last child with wild polio, we fear that more children from the same area may be affected as the virus circulates," said National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) Coordinator Dr Shahzad Baig.

As a response to the last case detection, an emergency vaccination campaign was launched on [28 Apr 2022] in South KP. In 2020, the province of Khyber-Pakhtukhwa reported 22 cases, while no wild poliovirus cases were recorded in the province last year [2021]. In 2021, Pakistan reported one case on [27 Jan 2021] in Killa Abdullah, Balochistan.

"I am directly in contact with the Emergency Operations Centre for polio. They remain highly vigilant and are urgently working to ensure that the virus does not spread outside this particular area. I am personally looking into the case and detailed investigations pertaining to it," the health minister said, adding that, "After Eid, I will be visiting the province myself to monitor the situation on ground." The polio programme's health workers on the frontline continue to reach children in North Waziristan despite challenging circumstances in hard-to-reach areas.

Wild poliovirus types 2 and 3 have been eradicated globally, while WPV1 cases are at an historic low. Pakistan remains 1 of only 2 polio-endemic countries along with Afghanistan.

Poliovirus is highly infectious and until this last remaining epidemiological bloc is wiped out, children all over the world remain at risk of life-long paralysis or death.

[This is now the 2nd case of AFP associated with WPV1 infection in Pakistan both with onset during April 2022. Both cases were residents of North Waziristan and from the wording of the media reports while not specifically stated, it appears as though this 2nd child also was unvaccinated. As long as the WPV1 continues circulation, the pockets of susceptible (unvaccinated) remain at risk of infection with subsequent paralysis.

Poliovirus Weekly Update as of 27 Apr 2022, World Health Organisation
New wild poliovirus isolates reported this week:
AFP cases: 1
Environment: 1
Others: 0

New cVDPV isolates reported this week:
AFP cases: 6
Environment: 20
Others: 3

Headlines
- In Pakistan, a new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been reported from North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with onset of paralysis on [9 Apr 2022]. It is the 1st reported WPV1 case from the country since January 2021. The isolated WPV1 is linked to virus isolated from an environmental sample from Bannu, in the same province, collected on [5 Apr 2022]. Detection of low-level transmission is not unexpected at this stage in Pakistan's eradication effort, and despite reporting of these latest isolates, the country continues to have record-low levels of WPV1 transmission in the country, which must be capitalized on. Similar low-level transmission was also seen in other countries during their 'end game' of their eradication efforts, including in Nigeria, India and Egypt. In response to detection of this case, the National and Provincial Polio Emergency Operations Centres have deployed teams to conduct a full field investigation, and have launched emergency immunization campaigns to prevent further spread from the area to other parts of the country or across the border.

- Comprehensive outbreak response in Tajikistan successfully stops outbreak: an outbreak response assessment concluded that a cVDPV2 outbreak that started in January 2021 has been stopped, thanks to comprehensive and rapid response with novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2).

[This week's report has a report on the 1st case of WPV1 associated AFP in Pakistan, multiple cases of cVDPV2 associated AFP involving DR Congo, Nigeria and Somalia, and unfortunately multiple positive environmental samples with cVDPV3 in Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

Unfortunately, both WPV1 and cVDPVs are still occurring. My comment in last week's update (Poliomyelitis update (16): WPV1 AFP Pakistan, cVDPV2, AFP, cVDPV3 ES 20220425.8702827) "Israel seems to have interrupted transmission of cVDPV3" was overly optimistic.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP
