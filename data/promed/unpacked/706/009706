A case of caprine anthrax has been registered with the Ministry of
Agriculture in the village of Mikhailovka in the Pervomaisky district of
the Kharkov region, as of 19 Jul 2005.
The suspicion of anthrax emerged during a veterinary-sanitary examination.
A sick animal was immediately destroyed. Anthrax in a goat has been
confirmed by laboratory investigations at the regional state laboratory.
The affected dead goat, carcass, viscera, and other materials were burned,
the usual actions against anthrax -- carried out according to standing
instructions. Quarantine measures have been applied.
The situation is under the control of the Kharkov region veterinary
management team and the State department of veterinary medicine of the
Ministry of Agriculture. The last case of anthrax in the village of
Mikhailovka was registered in 1975.
In August of [2004] anthrax was registered in the village of Monachinovka
in the Kupjansky district of the Kharkov region. Meat from a sick sheep had
been used for food preparation, putting a significant number of people at risk.

[It would appear that though anthrax was diagnosed in only one animal --
which may have been dead or alive at the time -- a number of animals may
have died and were being butchered for sale when they came to the notice of
the veterinary authorities.
The mention of "Monachinovka of the Kupjansky district" would suggest that
this is an adjoining rural district which had anthrax in 2004. An outbreak
pattern like this is not unusual when a few livestock deaths on adjoining
farms in the previous summer are ignored, missed or hidden: vaccination is
not undertaken, and deaths occur the following summer from grazing
contaminated soil. - Mod.MHJ]
