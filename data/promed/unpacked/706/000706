The death toll from an Ebola virus disease outbreak in northeastern [Orientale province] Democratic Republic of Congo has risen to 14, and the crisis is not yet under control, medical officials have stated. The epicentre of the outbreak, which killed its 1st victim last month [August 2012], is in the busy town of Isiro in Orientale Province, but it has spread to the settlement of Viadana, 75 km away, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in a statement. WHO also called for aid of nearly USD 2 million to help Congo's weakened health sector cope with the disease.

Last month [August 2012], officials confirmed that the epidemic involved a different strain from the one that killed at least 36 people in neighbouring Uganda and had likely been sparked by locals eating infected meat in the forest. As of Sunday [2 Sep 2012], there had been 29 confirmed or probable cases with 14 deaths, a mortality rate of around 48 per cent, Anja de Weggheleire, medical coordinator in the area for the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said. "A week ago, we were a bit optimistic ... but a few days later, we got some more cases ... We have quite a clear picture of what is happening, but I cannot say it is under control," she said.

Officials say that nearly 170 people remain under surveillance to see whether they develop symptoms of the disease, and with the last confirmed case on Saturday [1 Sep 2012], the end of the epidemic remains a long way off, de Weggheleire said.

Ebola is [believed to be] transmitted to humans from monkeys and birds [bats?] and [may] cause massive bleeding in victims. Mortality rates can be as high as 90 per cent.

[Since 28 Aug 2012, the number of cases has risen from 24 (6 probable, 6 confirmed, and 12 suspected) cases and 11 deaths to the current figure of 29 confirmed and probable cases and 14 deaths. 170 people are now under surveillance, although there have been no new cases since Sat 1 Sep 2012. It may be that the outbreak is being brought under control, but the origin of the outbreak remains unknown, and cases have occurred at 2 sites.

It has not been confirmed that the Ugandan outbreak originated from consumption of bush meat. Nor has it been confirmed that Ebola virus is transmitted to humans from monkeys or birds [bats?].
