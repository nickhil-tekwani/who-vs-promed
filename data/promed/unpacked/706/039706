- Tue 17 Sep 2019. Drop in case numbers
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/who-too-early-say-if-drop-ebola-rate-significant
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

According to the latest weekly bulletin from the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office, the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is experiencing a drop in the rate of new cases, but it's too early to say if that drop is a significant trend forecasting the end of the 13-month-long outbreak in the DRC's North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces.

"There are early signs of the outbreak easing, including the decrease in numbers of new confirmed cases in Beni and Mandima and the lack of new confirmed cases for 21 days in Alimbongo and Oicha," the WHO said. "However, it is too soon to know if this is an indication of a decrease in transmission intensity of [Ebola virus disease]."

In the past 21 days, 13 health zones confirmed cases of Ebola, and officials confirmed 37 new cases since [8 Sep 2019]. In September, the virus hot spots have been Kalunguta (22% of new cases) Mambasa (17%), Manama (15%), and Beni (13%).

"A total of 13 294 contacts are under follow-up as of 13 Sep 2019, of which 11 891 have been seen in the past 24 hours, comprising 89% of the contacts, comparable to that during the past 7 days (90%)," the WHO said. As of [13 Sep 2019], 17% of all alerts concerning Ebola were deemed suspected cases.

As of today [17 Sep 2019], the WHO's Ebola dashboard is showing just one newly confirmed case, raising the outbreak total to 3130, including 2096 deaths. A total of 402 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Today the DRC's multisector Ebola response committee (CMRE) offered new details on the 4 cases reported yesterday [16 Sep 2019]. Two were in Kalunguta, with one each in Mambasa and Mandima.

In other news today [17 Sep 2019], the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted priority review for Merck's investigational Ebola vaccine (V920, also known as VSV-EBOV) for preventing disease caused by the Ebola Zaire virus, Merck said in a news release.

"Merck has worked with government partners and the global health community to accelerate development of our investigational V920 Ebola vaccine. FDA's priority review designation underscores our long-standing partnership with the US government toward its development and licensure," said Paula Annunziato, MD, vice president of Merck Research Laboratories.

"A top priority for us remains achieving registration of V920 and regulatory approval of our German manufacturing site, so that licensed supply can be produced over time to support global public health preparedness and health security objectives. We look forward to continuing to work with the FDA throughout the review process."

The vaccine is currently being used in a ring vaccination campaign throughout the outbreak region. As of [13 Sep 2019], a total of 220 529 people have been vaccinated in the past year with the vaccine, which was 1st tested in 2014, during the West African Ebola outbreak.

The vaccine has proved safe and efficacious on the frontlines of the current outbreak, with recent studies published this spring [2019] showing an estimated vaccine efficacy rate of 97.5%.

According to Merck, since May 2018, the company has given the WHO 245 000 one-milliliter investigational doses of the vaccine and has another 190 000 doses available for shipment.

Yesterday [16 Sep 2019] Science magazine reported that Congolese police arrested Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the former health minister of the DRC, on charges of mismanaging USD 4.3 million in Ebola response money.

Kalenga oversaw the outbreak response for the first 11 months of the outbreak, before resigning from his post in July [2019]. At that time, the DRC's president, Felix Tshisekedi, created the CMRE to handle [the] outbreak response.

Kalenga was arrested in Kinshasa, where he was said to have been planning an escape from the DRC. His lawyers have denied the allegations, calling them slanderous.

- Tue 17 Sep 2019. WHO External Situation Report 59
[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/democratic-republic-congo-ebola-virus-disease-external-situation-74

In the past week, from [9-15 Sep 2019], 51 new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases, with an additional 26 deaths, have been reported from 9 health zones in 3 affected provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Throughout the week, localised, minor security incidents have impacted the response, including burial and vaccination activities in Mambasa and Komanda. In addition, there was a major security incident in Lwemba, within Mandima health zone, from [14-16 Sep 2019]. The event was in response to the recent death of a local healthcare worker from EVD. Due to the violence and vandalism that occurred during the incident, all activities have been suspended in the area until further notice. In addition to seriously impacting the response activities on the ground, this could lead to gaps or delays in the reporting of new EVD cases in this hotspot area. Overall, these incidents underscore the need for continued and proactive engagement and sensitizing of local communities, especially in the high-risk areas that may not currently be affected.

In the 21 days from [26 Aug to 15 Sep 2019], 52 health areas in 15 health zones reported new cases. During this period, a total of 149 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Mambasa (19%, n = 29), Kalunguta (19%, n = 28), Mandima (19%, n = 28), and Beni (10%, n = 15). Fourteen health zones that have previously reported cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak have not reported a case in more than 21 days.

As of [15 Sep 2019], a total of 3129 EVD cases were reported, including 3018 confirmed and 111 probable cases, of which 2096 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases with reported sex and age, 56% (1755) were female, 29% (893) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (159) were healthcare workers.

- Fri 13 Sep 2019. MSF: summary of activities
[Medecins Sans Frontieres, abridged, edited]
https://www.msf.org/drc-ebola-outbreak-crisis-update

Current situation
-----------------
As of late August [2019], 28 out of a total of 47 health zones across Ituri and North Kivu provinces have reported cases of Ebola. Of these 28, 18 are considered active transmission zones, meaning that they have notified new confirmed cases in the past 21 days (the maximum incubation period for Ebola). South Kivu has recently recorded cases in Mwenga health zone, becoming the 3rd province in DRC to be affected in the current outbreak.

Five new health zones, Goma (North Kivu), Nyiragongo (adjacent to Goma), Lolwa (Ituri), Mwenga (South Kivu) and Pinga (North Kivu), were recently added to the list. Former hotspots such as Butembo, Katwa and Mandima health zones have been notifying more cases in recent weeks, while Beni continues to record the highest amount of cases. The 1st case of Ebola in Goma, a city of 1 million people, was reported on [14 Jul 2019]; further cases have since been found.

Response to the current outbreak
----------------------------------
The DRC Ministry of Health (MoH) is leading the outbreak response, with support from WHO.

We believe it will not be possible to end this outbreak if there is no trust built between the response and the affected people. Response authorities and workers must listen to the needs of communities, restore people's choice when it comes to managing their health, and involve the community in every aspect of the Ebola response.

MSF believes that Ebola-related activities should be integrated into the existing healthcare system to improve the proximity of services to the community and ensure the system remains functional during the outbreak. We aim to do this with our own Ebola-related activities wherever possible. This would help identify earlier on suspected cases and could encourage people to seek help more promptly at healthcare posts, clinics and hospitals that they know and trust.

MSF response
--------------
MSF has been involved in the outbreak response, working with the Ministry of Health, since the declaration of the epidemic on [1 Aug 2018].

As of late August 2019, we have more than 600 staff working in DRC responding to the Ebola outbreak. We are providing care for confirmed Ebola patients in Goma, North Kivu, Bunia, Ituri, as well as in Bukavu, South Kivu in collaboration with the Ministry of Health.

We continue to provide care to [suspected] cases, and also manage Transit Centres for suspected Ebola patients. MSF is supporting existing health structures including treating common illnesses, and improving water and sanitation, building transit units within existing facilities, and implementing and strengthening triage and infection prevention and control activities (IPC).

In addition, our teams are reinforcing health promotion and community engagement in the areas where we are working. We are also working towards strengthening the disease surveillance system in our regular project areas, including in Goma.

- Fri 13 Sep 2019. Funding Ebola response
[The Hill, abridged, edited]
https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/461284-who-warns-its-running-out-of-money-to-fight-ebola
[Byline: Reid Wilson]

The largest force against the yearlong outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Congo says it only has enough money for the fight to last through the end of the month [September 2019].

The World Health Organization (WHO) said [Fri 13 Sep 2019] that it has received about USD 55 million from governments around the world since [1 Aug 2019], just one-fifth of the amount it needs to implement a strategic response plan meant to contain the virus through the end of the year [2019].

"Currently available funds will close the financing gap up until the end of September 2019," WHO said in its weekly report on the outbreak. "Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019, and WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support."

So far, the outbreak has infected at least 3113 people across 3 eastern provinces in Congo, according to the country's health ministry and the WHO. At least 2077 of those victims have died, though the numbers are likely higher because some families care for victims at home rather than seeking treatment at a medical facility.

The virus has disproportionately struck women in the region, who are more likely to care for sick family members or prepare dead bodies for funeral services, putting them at greater risk. Of the identified cases, 56% have been women. A little under one-third of the cases, 29%, have been children under the age of 18.

The WHO has spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars battling what has become the 2nd-largest outbreak in modern history, and the largest ever to strike Congo. Donor nations and philanthropies have contributed about USD 170 million of that total, including USD 20 million directly from the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

USAID said last week it had spent a total of USD 158 million helping Congo fight the outbreak, both through WHO funding and through regional preparedness efforts in neighboring countries.

The World Bank last month [August 2019] released USD 30 million more from its Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility in the days after the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, its highest warning level.

The WHO, which has 671 trained staffers on the ground in Congo, is the largest of dozens of international groups such as UNICEF and Doctors Without Borders that have tried to contain the spread of Ebola.

There are some positive signs that the outbreak might finally be coming under control. Just 40 new confirmed cases were reported in the last week, the lowest number of cases since March [2019].

Public health officials warned that it remains too soon to tell whether the downward trends are momentary blips or the result of real progress. As of last week, more than 14 000 people were being monitored for signs of the virus, a practice known as contact tracing -- keeping track of those who have come into contact with someone who has contracted the virus, those who are most likely to be infected themselves.

Congolese health officials and those from neighboring countries are on high alert to prevent the virus from spreading across international borders. Those officials are screening tens of thousands of people who regularly travel into South Sudan, Uganda and Burundi, countries that neighbor the North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri provinces.

- Mon 16 Sep 2019. No Time to Lose (Peter Piot)
[The Telegraph, abridged, edited]
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/greatest-threat-lab-says-scientist-discovered-ebola/
[Byline: Sarah Newey]

It is now more than 4 decades since Professor Peter Piot sped from a clinical lab in the bustling Belgian city of Antwerp to a remote rainforest in the heart of Africa to investigate a mysterious epidemic.

Three weeks earlier the microbiology lab where the then 27-year-old worked had received 2 vials of blood transported halfway across the globe in a cheap blue thermos flask filled with ice.

One of the test tubes had smashed, but at the time in 1976 Professor Piot and his colleagues were unaware of the danger lurking inside. The 2 vials contained a new but highly contagious virus that we now know as Ebola -- a disease that has killed more than 2000 people in a 13-month outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The blood samples were from Flemish nuns living in what was then known as Zaire, who had died of a mysterious haemorrhagic fever. Within 3 weeks, the virus had killed 200 people in Yambuku, a small village in the Congolese forest home to a Belgian missionary outpost.

"The discovery itself was an accident, or a coincidence," Professor Piot says, sitting in his directors' office at the London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this autumn [2019].

"We obviously did not know there was Ebola in the samples from Zaire. Looking back, probably the most dangerous moments were working in the lab in Antwerp."

It wasn't long before the team, examining the virus' gigantic worm structure under a microscope, realised this was a new disease and sent the samples to the specialist Centre for Disease Control in the US for confirmation. Within weeks Professor Piot was on a flight -- without so much as a valid passport.

"I'm trying not to exaggerate, but in less than 48 hours I went from Antwerp to the tropical rainforest in northern Zaire," he says. "It was extremely exciting, to be honest."

"I'd never been to Africa, I'd never investigated an epidemic, so I definitely did not qualify and in today's world, I don't think I would be allowed to do this."

As Professor Piot recalls in his book, No Time to Lose, what followed were 2 adventure-filled but exhausting months, predominantly spent in the jungle some 600 miles from Zaire's capital city, Kinshasa. An international team of scientists meticulously investigated the disease, which slowly petered out after killing 280 people.

Instead, Professor Piot thought that outbreaks would be isolated to remote communities with neglected health systems -- in 1976, Ebola was spread when dirty syringes were used.

"But I underestimated the societal amplifiers," says Professor Piot. "I didn't fully appreciate the social, behavioural, political, cultural context that these epidemics thrive in."

In West Africa, Ebola spread for 3 months under the radar before it was detected, by which point it had reached capital cities and slums, making it much harder to control.

"There was the social background of the lack of trust in governments, with countries coming out of civil wars," adds Professor Piot. "And that is what we are seeing now in eastern Congo as well."

[To] bring the outbreak to a close the community needs to be at the centre of the response and a 2nd vaccine should be rolled out to complement the one already in use and the successful new treatment options, Professor Piot says. It won't be easy.

"I think it will be extraordinarily difficult to bring it under control, because of the security environment. The worst case scenario would be that there is an increase in fighting, and then god help us," he says.

And yet, despite his obvious fears about Ebola, it is Disease X -- an as yet unknown pathogen that the World Health Organization has flagged as a priority -- that Professor Piot flags as the greatest infectious threat to humans.

"The biggest concern I have is not Ebola, but a new pandemic flu... that could really kill millions of people, and I'm not scaremongering here.

"With Ebola, mostly the risk here [in the UK] would be for people working in intensive care units. You don't catch Ebola on the bus, on the tube. But the flu, or another new respiratory virus, yes... that's why the world needs to be prepared."

In total, 20 volunteers from the African Union (AU) were trained on the tasks to be performed in the fight against Ebola virus disease in the DRC, on [Wed 11 Sep 2019] in Kinshasa. These are 7 infection prevention and control officers, a laboratory technician, a logistician and a data manager, and 10 epidemiologists.

This number is in addition to the 37 already deployed by the African Union in the east of the country, where this epidemic is rife.

These volunteers were guided and briefed on the issues and challenges that await them in the provinces attacked by Ebola, including those in North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri. And this, in order to strengthen the response operations against this virus.

It should be noted that this training was provided by Africa CDC, a technical institution of the African Union to help Member States respond quickly and effectively to the threat of disease.

- Mon 16 Sep 2019. Tanzania case of Ebola-like death
[The Hill, abridged, edited]
https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/461607-azar-urges-transparency-in-ebola-like-death-in-tanzania
[Byline: Chris Mills Rodrigo]

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on [Mon 16 Sep 2019] called for transparency from Tanzanian officials in the case of a patient who recently died after suffering Ebola-like symptoms, The Associated Press (AP) reported.

Azar told reporters in Uganda that he and others are "very concerned" and urged Tanzania's government to share lab results related to the case.

Congo, which borders Tanzania, is in the midst of the 2nd-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, with confirmed cases now exceeding 3000.

Azar said efforts were underway to secure Tanzania's compliance with international health regulations and obligations to the World Health Organization (WHO) "to protect Tanzanians as well as all people in the region," according to the AP.

Tanzania's government said [Sat 14 Sep 2019] there is no confirmed case of Ebola inside its borders.

According to an internal WHO document obtained by [the] AP, the patient, a 34-year-old woman, died on [8 Sep 2019] and was buried the same day. The victim was a student in central Uganda before returning to Tanzania on [22 Aug 2019], according to the document.

"This mysterious disease has to be investigated and samples have to be tested. We couldn't rule out any of the viral hemorrhagic fevers and the investigation will continue," Dr. Yonas Woldemariam, the WHO representative in Uganda, said [Mon 16 Sep 2019].

- Sun 15 Sep 2019. Tanzania defuses scare
[The Citizen Reporter, edited]
https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/1840340-5273898-9cih1q/index.html

The government yesterday [14 Sep 2019] allayed fears over reports that a Tanzanian medical doctor who was studying in Uganda had died of a viral infection [akin] to the deadly Ebola disease.

Health minister Ummy Mwalimu termed the reports that say 6 other people had developed Ebola-like symptoms as rumours. But she told journalists that there were 2 cases of people from Mwanza and Dar es Salaam who had been suspected to have contracted the Ebola virus.

"We took samples of those 2 cases and I can confirm that the patients were not infected with the Ebola virus," said Ms. Mwalimu at a press conference, emphasising that she was the only authority mandated to announce an outbreak of diseases such as Ebola and other life-threatening epidemics.

The minister's assurance came a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was investigating, "as a matter of urgency", a "rumour" of death from an unknown illness in Tanzania. Some embassies also issued alerts over the WHO warning.

There is heightened vigilance across East Africa over Ebola due to an outbreak of the viral disease in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and a reported case in Western Uganda at the border with the DRC.

Countries neighbouring DRC, including Tanzania, are taking steps to mitigate the risk of spread. Ebola is known to spread from country to country via cross border activities.

"I urge the public to take precautions. We have enhanced screening for suspected cases at key border areas with Uganda and DRC and ports," said Ms. Mwalimu in Dar es Salaam.

A WHO document that The Citizen learnt had been leaked, detailed a case of a 34-year-old Tanzanian woman studying in Uganda who had travelled between Mwanza, Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Songea regions.

She later died on [8 Sep 2019], in Dar es Salaam where she had been brought back for treatment, and her burial was supervised [by] a team of public health workers from the Temeke District, according to the report.

On [28 Aug 2019], she developed headache, fever, rash, bloody diarrhoea, reveals the report. "...following a suspicion of viral haemorrhagic fever, she was transferred to an isolation unit in another referral hospital -- Temeke Ebola Treatment Unit -- for further management, and samples were collected. On [8 Sep 2019], the patient died, and a supervised burial was performed on the same day," said the report.

On [Fri 13 Sep 2019], the WHO officially said in a press statement that it had deployed a technical team in Tanzania to cooperate with the health ministry in investigating a death but did not specifically point to the case in the leaked document.

Reuters quoted the Director for Communication and Policy at the Nairobi office of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mr. Justin Williams, who said the woman who died in Dar es Salaam on [8 Sep 2019] presented symptoms common to several diseases, including dengue or malaria, both endemic in East Africa. He ruled out the possibility of Ebola.

Until yesterday [14 Sep 2019], the medical community in Tanzania was mourning the death of a medical doctor who was studying at Makerere University. She was a medical staff [member] of Bugando Medical Centre in Mwanza.

She travelled back to Tanzania from Uganda through Mwanza, to Dar es Salaam, then Songea where she was carrying out her field work for post-graduate studies. She died in Temeke on [8 Sep 2019] and her burial was immediate and supervised by the health authorities, said sources close to The Citizen.

The President of the Medical Association of Tanzania (MAT), Dr. Elisha Osati, told The Citizen the death of their colleague has left a lot of questions. He urged health workers across the country to remain vigilant as they handle their patients and take all necessary precautions. "Until now, we don't really know what led to her death, but what I can say is that all medical staff should remain cautious as they go about treating their patients," he said.

However, the manner in which the medic died and was buried is not new in Tanzania. In 2016, The Citizen witnessed health workers at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) wearing personal protective gear aboard a special vehicle carrying 2 caskets bearing the bodies of the deceased, headed for burial in Kinondoni.

Authorities said the patients had been diagnosed with viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome, which includes a class of diseases like severe dengue fever, Ebola and Zika fever. But Ebola was ruled out after the deceased tested negative for the virus.

[5] Uplifting story
- Fri 13 Sep 2019. Ebola survivor passes college exam
[Washington Post, edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/congo-ebola-survivor-passes-college-exam-taken-in-isolation/2019/09/13/d63b7396-d640-11e9-8924-1db7dac797fb_story.html

The young Ebola patient who took his college entrance exam while being treated in isolation has passed the demanding test, to the joy of many in Congo where his story is now well-known.

[CM] is among the nearly 3000 people who have been confirmed to have Ebola in what has become the 2nd-deadliest outbreak of the virus in history.

Now the celebrated Ebola survivor looks forward to realizing his dreams and showing other Ebola patients there is hope.

"I was very happy and joyful when I saw the Ministry of Education text message on my phone reassuring me that I have just passed ... despite the precarious conditions," he told The Associated Press. "Being sick in an Ebola center, most people do not come back but also many people lose hope of living."

[CM]'s mother had died of Ebola, and he told the AP in July [2019] that her greatest hope was that he would attend college. That requires passing the secondary school baccalaureate, or "bac."

"I was afraid that I was sick and that I was going to miss the exams, but fortunately the Ebola treatment center officials had appealed for me to take the exams," he said. "I had already lost 6 members of our family, including my mother, who asked me to continue with studies because that is the key to life."

The 21-year-old was able to take the exam after staffers at the treatment center run by the Alliance for International Medical Action, or ALIMA, in the eastern city of Beni came up with a solution.

They found a school official willing to proctor the exam as [CM] took it safely behind a window. The papers were passed to him without touching him. After finishing, he held the pages up one by one to the window so they could be photographed with a smartphone and then emailed to officials for scoring.
