By browsing through the literature, the EPPO Secretariat has
extracted the following new data concerning quarantine pests and
pests included on the EPPO Alert List. The situation of the pest
concerned is indicated in bold [in original], using the terms of ISPM
no. 8.
New records:
Soybean cyst nematode - Iran
----------------------------
In Iran, a survey on cyst nematodes revealed the presence of
_Heterodera glycines_ (EPPO Action List A2). This is the first record
of this species in Iran (Maafi et al., 2004). Present, no details.
Soybean cyst nematode - Paraguay
--------------------------------
In Paraguay, _Heterodera glycines_ (EPPO Action List A2) was found
for the first time in 2002/2003, in the Caaguazu province (Centurion
et al., 2004). Present, first found in 2002/2003, in Caaguazu
province.
Raspberry ringspot nepovirus - Romania
--------------------------------------
During a survey on virus diseases of _Rubus_, the presence of
Raspberry ringspot nepovirus (EPPO A2 list) was detected in Romania
(Isac et al., 2004). Present, no details.
Grapevine rust - Brazil
-----------------------
_Phakopsora euvitis_ (EPPO Alert List) was found for the first time
in Brazil in March 2001, in vineyards of table grapes in the
northwest of Parana. Grapevine rust was later found in other
vineyards in Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso (Tessmann et al., 2004; de
Souza, 2004). Present, first found in 2001, only in some areas
(Parana, Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso).
Soybean rust, Asian strain - Bolivia
------------------------------------
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ (EPPO Alert List) is reported to occur in
Bolivia (Yorinori et al., 2004). Present, no details.
Pear scab - China
-----------------
_Venturia nashicola_ (EU Annexes) is reported as an economically
important disease of pear in China. It infects fruits, leaves and
young shoots, resulting in significant annual yield losses on pears,
especially on traditional Chinese varieties (Li et al., 2005). The
EPPO Secretariat had previously no data on the occurrence of this
fungus in China. Present, no details.
Detailed Records:
Bacterial wilt of beans - Brazil
--------------------------------
_Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens_ pv. _flaccumfaciens_ (EPPO A2 list)
is occurring in the State of Goias and in the Federal District of
Brazil (Uesugi et al., 2003).
False root-knot nematode - Mexico
---------------------------------
_Nacobbus aberrans_ (EPPO A1 list) occurs in the State of Puebla,
Mexico (Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2004).
Soybean rust, Asian strain - India
----------------------------------------
In India, _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ (EPPO Alert List) is reported for
the first time from Rajasthan (Gupta and Kaur, 2004).
Potato wart disease - New Zealand
------------------------------------------
In New Zealand, an isolated outbreak of _Synchytrium endobioticum_
(EPPO A2 list) was found in a domestic garden in Southland (South
Island). Eradication measures are being applied (Anonymous, 2005).
Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus - USA (SC)

South Carolina (US). Symptomatic tomato plants were observed in 2005
at several locations near Charleston (Ling et al., 2006).
