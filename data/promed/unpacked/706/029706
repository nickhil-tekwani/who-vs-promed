The state Department of Public Health is investigating the outbreak
of a skin rash among about 230 New England college cross-country
runners who participated in an Oct. 28 meet hosted by Connecticut
College at Harkness Memorial State Park in Waterford. Health
officials think the rash is "swimmer's itch" or "clam digger's itch"
-- cercarial dermatitis or schistosomiasis -- which is caused by a
water-borne parasite that can penetrate the skin.
They have not, however, completed the investigation nor made a
definitive diagnosis, said Stephen Mansfield, director of
environmental health at the Ledge Light Health District, based in
Groton. The rash can cause oozing and scabs and can lead to secondary
infections, but it is easily treatable and disappears without leaving
permanent scars. Ledge Light, which provides public health services
to several towns including Waterford and New London, sent one of its
sanitarians to Harkness.
The runners are thought to have contracted the rash after running
through about 3 feet of standing water on one portion of the course.
The puddle formed during heavy rains and high tide during the race
and was not there when the course was set that morning, said Ned
Bishop, coach of the women's cross country team at Conn and coach of
men's and women's track and field there. The parasite thought to be
responsible for the rash is found in water containing fecal matter
from birds. The marsh areas of the park attract many migrating
waterfowl in the fall.
About 380 runners participated in the race, and more than 60 percent
contracted a rash. "We all see this as just a really strange
confluence of events that is a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence," Bishop said.
Meaghan Seelhaus, a Conn senior who ran in the race, said the rash
developed about a week after the race, covering her legs with red,
itchy bumps. "It's all cleared up now," she said. "All I have left is
some scars. But there were boils and oozing. It was really itchy and
painful. It was pretty terrible."
Seelhaus sought medical treatment and was prescribed steroids and
antibiotics for a secondary infection that developed. The usual
course of treatment for mild cases is over-the-counter cortisone or
Benadryl, and for more severe cases, prescription steroids.
Seelhaus is one of dozens of students from the colleges in the race
who posted comments about their experiences on a section of the
Facebook Web site called "Victims of the NESCAC Rash." (NESCAC is the
New England Small College Athletic Conference.) Several of the
postings include photos of rash-infected legs and feet.
Along with Ledge Light officials and the Conn coaches, she helped to
develop a survey distributed to all the students who ran in the meet.
The responses are being sent to the state public health department
for its investigation.
Mansfield said "swimmer's itch" is a fairly common occurrence in the
summertime and can be prevented by drying off with a towel after
swimming. Because of heavy rains that day, the runners were wet for
the duration of the race and many did not dry off for hours afterward
because of long bus rides home.

[Swimmer's itch is found worldwide and is caused by cercariae of the
avian schistosomes _Trichobilharzia_ spp. and _Gigantobilharzia_ spp.
penetrating the skin of persons swimming or wading through infected
water. Birds are the main hosts and the cercaria emerge from the
intermediate molluscan hosts living in the water. Humans are the
wrong host and as soon as the cercariae have penetrated the skin,
they die, which causes an intense inflammation seen as a severely
itching rash which lasts about one week and is always self-limiting.
The infection never develops into a Schistosomiasis-like systemic
disease. Prevention of the disease is difficult except avoiding water
known to be infected. Treatment is primarily directed toward relief
of symptoms using antihistamines and steroids. The condition is
recognized as a risk for outdoor athletes (Adams BB. Dermatologic
disorders of the athlete. Sports Med. 2002;32:309-21). In severe
cases one would expect to find an elevated eosinophil !
count and total IgE. - Mod.EP]
