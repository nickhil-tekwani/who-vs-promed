The Indian Delta COVID-19 strain has spread to almost 90 countries across the world, Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing's Head Anna Popova said on Thursday [24 Jun 2021].

"According to foreign experts, the new Delta [COVID-19] strain has spread to almost 90 countries," Popova stated at the 3rd International Scientific and Practical Conference "Global Threats to Biological Security: Problems and Solutions."

The sanitary watchdog's chief also mentioned that Russia managed to withstand the fight against the pandemic in March-April 2021 when Europe saw an increase in COVID-19 cases. "According to experts, we will hear about 70% of new coronavirus cases in the EU countries and the European Economic Area in the next few months," Popova said.

[2] Vaccine booster
Date: Thu 24 Jun 2021 14:28 EDT
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/exclusive-who-estimates-covid-19-boosters-needed-yearly-most-vulnerable-2021-06-24/


The World Health Organization (WHO) forecasts that people most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly, will need to get an annual vaccine booster to be protected against variants, an internal document seen by Reuters shows.

The estimate is included in a report, which is to be discussed on Thursday [24 Jun 2021] at a board meeting of Gavi, a vaccine alliance that co-leads the WHO's COVID-19 vaccine programme COVAX. The forecast is subject to changes and is also paired with 2 other less likely scenarios.

Vaccine makers Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc., with its German partner BioNTech, have been vocal in their view that the world will soon need booster shots to maintain high levels of immunity, but the evidence for this is still unclear.

The document shows that the WHO considers annual boosters for high-risk individuals as its "indicative" baseline scenario, and boosters every 2 years for the general population. It does not say how these conclusions were reached but shows that under the base scenario new variants would continue to emerge and vaccines would be regularly updated to meet these threats.

The UN agency declined to comment on the content of the internal document. A spokesperson for Gavi said COVAX was planning to take a wide range of scenarios into consideration.

The document, which is dated 8 Jun [2021] and is still a "work in progress," also predicts under the base case that 12 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses will be produced globally next year [2022]. That would be slightly higher than the forecast of 11 billion doses for this year [2021] cited by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), signaling that the UN agency does not expect a significant ramp-up of vaccine production in 2022.

The document predicts manufacturing problems, regulatory approval issues and "transition away from some technology platforms" as potential drags on supplies next year [2022]. It does not signal which technologies could be phased out, but the European Union, which has reserved the world's largest volume of COVID-19 vaccines, has bet heavily on shots using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, such as those by Pfizer and Moderna, and has forgone some purchases of viral vector vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson.

The scenarios will be used to define the WHO's global vaccination strategy and the forecasts may change as new data emerge on the role of boosters and the duration of vaccine protection, Gavi says in another document, also seen by Reuters.

So far about 2.5 billion doses have been administered worldwide, mostly in rich countries where over half of the population has received at least one dose, whereas in many poorer countries less than 1% has been vaccinated, according to Gavi's estimates. See graphic of the COVID-19 global vaccination tracker: https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/.

This gap could widen next year [2022] under the WHO's most pessimistic forecast, as the need for annual boosters could once again push poorer nations to the back of the queue. In its worst-case scenario, the UN agency says production would be 6 billion doses next year, due to stringent regulation for new shots and manufacturing issues with existing ones That could be compounded by the need for annual boosters for the entire world, and not just the most vulnerable, to combat variants and limited duration of protection.

In the more optimistic situation, all vaccines in the pipeline would get authorised and production capacity would ramp up to about 16 billion doses to meet demand. Vaccines would also be shared equitably across the world. There would be no need for boosters, as vaccines would show strong efficacy against variants and long protection.

[What we will see will most likely be the middle ground between the most optimistic and pessimistic situations, with some vaccines needing boosters and others possibly not as frequently. New vaccines that are more broadly protective against sarbecoviruses (subgenus that includes SARS-CoV-1 and -2) will come onto the market, e.g., the mRNA-LNP (lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated, nucleoside-modified) vaccine expressing chimeric spikes containing admixtures of RBD and NTD (N-terminal) domains from the Baric lab that demonstrated broad protection in mice (Martinez DR, Schaefer A, Leist SR, et al. Chimeric spike mRNA vaccines protect against sarbecovirus challenge in mice. bioRxiv. 11 May 2021. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.434872), for one. - Mod.LK]

[3] Israel
[A] Delta variant spreads
Date: Fri 25 Jun 2021 09:18 IDT

Israel's Health Ministry reinstated the indoor mask mandate beginning Friday [25 Jun 2021] at 12:00 PM, following a recent rise in coronavirus infections attributed to the delta variant. The Health Ministry also recommends that Israelis wear masks during mass public events, even if they are held in the open air, "like the Pride events that will take place this weekend across the country."

Israel's coronavirus czar Dr. Nachman Ash said Friday [25 Jun 2021] that Israel is seeing a sharp rise in infections, as 227 new cases were diagnosed on Thursday [24 Jun 2021], though he does not believe Israel is entering a 4th wave of the virus." About 0.6% of the tests are positive, indicating an increase in infection rate," he said.

Ash explained that though the number of active cases is doubling every few days, "the rate is high because there are relatively few cases. As more cases are found, we don't expect it to continue at this [exponential] rate."

Ash noted that there is evidence that the outbreak has spread beyond the 2 cities it started in but stopped short of warning of a nationwide outbreak. "My guess is that we will not see a 4th wave," Ash said, though he did accede that there is the "potential" for the wider spread.

Ash said that he would be conducting a situational assessment and that they may reimpose mandatory masks as early as Friday [25 Jun 2021; which has been ordered for indoors]. However, at the moment he said, there would be no further restrictions. When asked why he wouldn't recommend another lockdown, Ash said that the previous lockdowns "failed to suppress the infection rate" and were not effective in halting the spread of the virus.

The northern city of Binyamina has been declared "red" on Israel's so-called traffic light system, reflecting a relatively high rate of coronavirus infection, amid a new uptick in cases. The increased infection is attributed to the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus in the country -- a strain first identified in India. The World Health Organization says it is becoming the globally dominant version of the virus.

[B] New cases explained
Date: Thu 24 Jun 2021
Source: Haaretz [edited]
https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/explained-is-israel-facing-another-covid-19-wave-as-the-delta-variant-spreads-1.9929154


The uptick in the number of new coronavirus cases in Israel in recent days has aroused fears that the country is heading back to social-distancing rules and lockdowns. Yet, in spite of the outbreak in a few parts of the country, such measures don't seem to be in the offing [but see above].

It appears that the rise in new cases is due to the delta variant of the coronavirus. The variant, which is also known as B.1.617, was first identified last October [2020] in the Indian state of Maharashtra and from there spread to the rest of India and then on to other countries.

According to the World Health Organization, the delta variant is now the dominant form of the coronavirus globally and is found in more than 80 countries. In Britain, for example, the rate of contagion has risen from 24 cases per million people to 126 in the last month due to the arrival of the delta variant.

The rate of complete inoculation (2 doses of the vaccine) in Britain stands today [24 Jun 2021] at 45%, compared to Israel's 65%, including those who became immune by contracting the virus. Under the circumstances, Israeli officials are worried that without restrictions being reimposed, the arrival of the variant to Israel might spell a similar jump in new cases among unvaccinated people and even among those who are.

How did the delta variant become dominant?
The most prominent characteristic of the delta variant is its fast spread: Estimates are that the variant is 1.5 times more contagious than the alpha variant, which was first seen in Britain. To illustrate the difference, the R [naught] -- the average number of people each coronavirus carrier infects -- for the coronavirus cases first identified in China's Wuhan was 3. The alpha variant has an R [naught] of about 5, whereas the delta variant's number stands between 6 and 8.

What makes the delta variant so highly contagious?
Based on what we know so far, the delta variant is no different in its basic structure than other variants of the coronavirus. Like the others, it can be identified by certain genetic changes in its spike protein that covers the virus. The spike protein gives the virus its signature crown-like appearance and enables it to attach to target cells.

The delta variant involves 2 mutations to the spike protein. One, called L452R, is also found in the California variant of the virus. The 2nd, which is called E484Q, is found in the same place on the spike protein (location 484) as other genetic mutations of the virus, for example, the South African and Brazilian variants. Scientists say these mutations enable the virus to attach more easily to the host's cells, in particular lung cells. The better a virus' ability to attach, the fewer viruses are required to transmit the disease and infect the host.

In the 2nd half of last year [2020], quite a few variants were identified, but fewer than 8 of them have reached Israel. Some of these prompted concerns that they would become more contagious, more virulent and resistant to vaccines. In practice, only the alpha variant has become a significant factor in Israel and other places; the others remain marginal.

Scientists believe that the genetic changes in its spike protein make the delta variant more contagious than other variants, as well as more resistant to the vaccine. Scientists say the variant might have other features that are not yet known.

How effective are vaccines against the delta variant?
Research findings, including those by British health authorities published in the medical journal Lancet, show that 2 weeks after the 2nd dose is administered, the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is 88% effective against the delta variant. That is only slightly less than the 93% for the alpha variant.

As far as preventing the need for hospitalization for COVID carriers, data published last week by British health authorities, based on an analysis of about 14 000 cases, shows 96% efficacy following 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine.

How do vaccinated people get infected?
The vaccine does not provide 100% protection, including against the original version of COVID-19 that can be traced back to Wuhan. In regard to the delta variant, inoculations have so far been shown to be slightly less effective than against the Wuhan and alpha variants, but it is still high.

The effectiveness of a vaccine involves additional factors apart from the contagiousness of the virus itself, such as the extent of people's exposure to the virus and the quantity of the virus that enters their body, as well as how well their immune system functions and the antibodies it produces. Exposure to large amounts of the virus, especially those with the features of the delta variant, can penetrate vaccine defenses.

How common is infection among people who are vaccinated?
Based on what we have seen over the past few months, vaccinations have led to a dramatic drop in new coronavirus cases, serious cases and deaths. Nevertheless, the data also show that vaccination does not eliminate the prospect of infection. According to Israeli Health Ministry figures that were provided to Haaretz last month, 564 new cases were reported between 22 May and 20 Jun [2021]. Of those, 385 were of people who had not been vaccinated against COVID, 13 of people had taken just the 1st dose and 165 of people who had 2 doses. In other words, 29% of those who contracted COVID had been inoculated.

What does the delta variant mean for herd immunity?
The higher Israel's vaccination rate is, the fewer opportunities there are for the virus to spread and replicate itself. A certain rate of vaccination creates herd immunity, meaning contagion is suppressed enough that the entire population is protected, including those who have not been vaccinated. If a variant is better able to find and exploit paths of contagion, more of the population needs to be vaccinated in order to reach that threshold.

Why are experts recommending that 12-to-15-year-olds be vaccinated?
At the beginning of June [2021], when Israel's coronavirus rates were still very low, health authorities approved inoculating the 12-to-15-year-old age-group with the Pfizer vaccine. However, reports have emerged of an uptick in cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) among people aged 16 to 30 who have been vaccinated. The great majority of the cases were minor and passed quickly.

Weighing that risk against the coronavirus risk, experts decided in favor of approving vaccination for 12-to-15-year-olds. Today, with a rise in coronavirus infections and with the millions of vaccinated children around the world already inoculated, Israeli experts have decided to recommend -- not just approve -- that children be vaccinated against the virus.

Is Israel on its way to another coronavirus wave?
There are many reasons to assume not. The development of vaccines has marked a turning point in the war against the virus globally; vaccination campaigns are moving the world closer to the point where the pandemic is contained. Even if theoretically, a new more virulent and contagious form of the coronavirus emerges that exhibits greater resistance to the vaccine, the road to developing a tailored vaccine for it will be shorter and faster than the 1st time around.

Beyond that, recent COVID outbreaks in Israel have so far been geographically confined, even though Israel has lifted all restrictions, people are no longer wearing masks and 40% of the population has yet to be vaccinated. For now, the Health Ministry is not rushing to reimpose coronavirus restrictions that would impinge on the public's day-to-day life [again, see above]. Instead, it is relying on contact tracing, expanded testing and stepped-up monitoring of people leaving and entering the country through Ben-Gurion International Airport.
