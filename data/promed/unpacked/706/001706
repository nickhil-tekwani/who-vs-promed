LISTERIOSIS, FATAL, MEAT PRODUCT - CANADA: UNCONFIRMED

Health officials in Quebec now say they cannot confirm that the
listeriosis death of a man in January 2009 was linked to the 2008
outbreak tied to tainted meat from Maple Leaf Foods.

The Monteregie public health agency had told the CBC's
French-language network, Radio-Canada, that the 75-year-old Quebec
man's death was the 21st in Canada tied to the listeriosis outbreak
that originated at Maple Leaf. The health officials later said while
the man's death was from a strain of the bacterium _Listeria
monocytogenes_ that was also found in some Maple Leaf foods, they
could no longer definitively say the death was linked to the company.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has yet to confirm the cause of
the man's death.

[The last ProMED-mail posting in October 2008 on the Canadian
listeriosis outbreak reported 20 deaths linked to a strain of
listeria that was identified at a Toronto plant run by Maple Leaf
Foods Inc. (see Listeriosis, fatal, meat product - Canada (04)
20081005.3147). The incriminated Maple Leaf Foods products were
recalled in late August 2008. With an incubation period for
listeriosis of up to 70 days, more cases related to the outbreak
could be expected to have occurred up to November 2008, but people
may continue to have been exposed to product inadvertently retained
on shelves or refrigerators with best-before dates that extended to
21 Jan 2009 (see ProMED-mail post Listeriosis, fatal, meat product -
Canada: alert, recall 20080821.2605).

It is difficult to tell how they decided that death of a man in
January 2009 was not linked to the 2008 outbreak tied to tainted meat
from Maple Leaf Foods. Although not specifically stated in the above
news report, perhaps genotyping of the patient's isolate failed to
establish linkage of the patient to the outbreak, or perhaps the
patient died of a cause unrelated to listeriosis.

A detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail
archive 20071230.4186.
