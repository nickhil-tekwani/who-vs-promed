An Egyptian boy has contracted the bird flu virus, the state-run news
agency quoted the Health Ministry as saying on Sunday [8 Feb 2009],
the 2nd such case in the last week and the 55th case since the virus
reached Egypt in 2006. The 18-month-old boy from the province of
Minia in central Egypt 1st showed symptoms on Friday [6 Feb 2009]
after coming into contact with dead birds and was admitted to
hospital on Saturday. He was administered the antiviral drug Tamiflu
and is now in a stable condition, the health ministry said.

On Wednesday [4 Feb 2009], the ministry reported a 2-year-old boy in
the Suez province was in hospital after contracting the virus.

Egypt is one of the only countries affected by bird flu that does not
offer compensation for farmers when poultry is destroyed, which many
experts say is the best way to ensure rapid detection of new
outbreaks. Some 5 million Egyptian households depend on poultry as a
main source of food and income.

Since 2003, the virus has infected 404 people in 15 countries and
killed 254 of them. It has killed or forced the destruction of more
than 300 million birds. Egypt has had the most cases outside of Asia.

A baby from southern [central?] Egypt has contracted the bird flu
virus, which brings the number of human cases to 55 in the country,
the Health Ministry announced Sunday [8 Feb 2009]. The
one-and-a-half-year-old boy showed symptoms on Friday [6 Feb 2009]
after he had contact with infected birds, the ministry said in a statement.

The boy from the Upper Egyptian governorate of Minia, some 220 km
south of Cairo, is now in a stable condition after being treated with
the antiviral drug Tamiflu, according to the statement.

Egypt is the most affected country by the deadly avian influenza
outside Asia. It reported its 1st H5N1 virus in dead poultry in
February 2006 and the 1st human case in March of the same year. The
death toll of the human cases of bird flu in the populous country is 23.

The World Health Organization (WTO) has said that as of 5 Feb 2009,
some 405 people in 15 countries have contracted the virus, and 254 of
them died of the disease.
