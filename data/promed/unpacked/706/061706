Since May 1998, Rwanda has been suffering from a cholera outbreak with a
total of 2,900 cases and 55 deaths, most of which were reported in
September. All these cases have been in Cyangugu prefecture, but there is
great concern about further spread to other areas of the country. WHO is
providing cholera kits to Kigali, Rwanda and with other international
organizations is working closely with the Ministry of Health on
prevention and control measures.
