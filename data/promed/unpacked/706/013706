Chronic wasting disease emerges in northeast, dead deer discovered near
Love tests positive for brain-wasting disease
-----------------------------------------------
A new case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) has emerged in an area
previously untouched by it, Saskatchewan Environment has confirmed.
A white-tailed deer, found dead for no apparent reason about 8 km south of
Love, tested positive, after it was submitted as part of the province's
regular testing program, said Saskatchewan Environment wildlife specialist
Merv Hlady.
It's the 1st confirmed case of the brain-wasting disease for the area,
located about an hour east of Prince Albert.
"When we're developing our strategy for this fall [2005], which is not
finalized yet, we're going to have to definitely consider the new positive
case in the Love area," Hlady said. "It's a new area, so it will create
some additional challenges, but we'll work with it, and we'll involve local
people in those discussions."
Hlady said it's still too early to tell how they'll address the new situation.
Another deer, located in the Swift Current creek area, which has already
seen a number of CWD cases, also tested positive at the same time, Hlady said.
Finding the disease in a wild population presents a "more difficult"
situation than finding one in a domestic herd, he said, because wild
animals have more mobility to spread the disease.
"We've had CWD in wild deer for a number of years now, and we have programs
trying to address and control the spread of the disease," he said. "This
just (adds) another layer basically to our management strategy."
Hlady said the province has seen 68 wild animal cases since 2000, 34 of
them confirmed since October 2004. Animals in known problem areas are
intensely tested for the disease, he said.
Reducing deer populations is a regular way of controlling CWD, Hlady said,
and it's not something they're ruling out with the new case.
"It'll be considered, definitely. The sooner you can act upon a positive,
the more chance you have of actually being successful," he said. "I think
with CWD, what we're trying to do is manage it and hope that, with the
offset of new information, we can have a better chance at beating this thing."
The disease exists mainly in 3 areas of Saskatchewan: the South
Saskatchewan River corridor near Swift Current, a portion of the Bronson
Forest and the Manitou Sand Hills.
Although there are suspicions the disease is spread through saliva and
bodily fluids, the science is not conclusive.

[Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is disease in the family of diseases
collectively known as the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE).
It is a neurological disease that leaves holes in the brain. Other diseases
in this category are Bovine Spongiform Encephaloapthy, Scrapie, and Mink
Encephalopathy. CWD is not known to affect humans nor is it known to be
transmissible to humans. - Mod.TG]
