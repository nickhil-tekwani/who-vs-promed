Here is a follow-up story by Roger Highfield in today's (10 February
Telegraph, plus a commentary by Polly Toynbee in this week's "Radio Times"
on the new BBC2 series of four programmes starting this coming Sunday.
Chief scientist [sic defends delay in BSE cases By Roger Highfield,
Science Editor
THE veterinary scientist at the heart of the row over whether the risk of
passing BSE to the public could have been cut if he and his colleagues had
acted sooner to identify mad cow disease answered his critics yesterday.
Dr Gerald Wells, of the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge, said
there were two cases in the archives that predate the first official report
of the disease in November 1986, notably one by Carol Richardson, a
pathologist, that was part of an outbreak that anecdotal evidence suggests
dates back to 1984.
Dr Wells, the senior neuropathologist at the laboratory, based his
identification of BSE on a later outbreak in Kent, first reported in
November 1986 and written up in an article that appeared in The Veterinary
Record in 1987. The article steered away from the term bovine scrapie,
which would have suggested the epidemic among cows was as widespread as
among sheep, and plumped for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE.
Yesterday Dr Wells said that he had agreed with Carol Richardson's
diagnosis of spongiform changes in bovine brain tissue from Pitsham "that
did look like those that one would see with scrapie", but he said that
there had been a range of clinical problems on the farm, ranging from
metabolic disease to nervous disease and kidney problems.
By contrast, in November 1986 he was provided with "an excellent case
history of several examples of a clearly definable neurological problem,"
by an old friend, Colin Whitaker, a vet from Ashford, Kent, who was puzzled
by strange behaviour in the dairy herd at Plurenden Manor Farm that dated
back to the end of April 1985. Even when it came to this first officially
recorded case, there was a nine-month delay in getting a sample of brain to
the ministry labs. The first cow that was sent to the abattoir ended up in
the wrong place, while the second did make it to the abattoir but the head
of the animal was mixed up with others.
But Dr Wells, who discussed the crucial issue of the origins of the
epidemic at the BSE public inquiry in March, is adamant that the timescale
to the discovery of BSE could "not have been altered that much" without
waiting for many more confirmed cases of the disease that showed
well-defined symptoms or by boosting surveillance of veterinary disease to
unrealistic levels.
"If, with hindsight, we had recognised the Carol Richardson case was a
scrapie-like disease and, what is more important, we had recognised what
the cause was, we might have been able to take action," said Dr Wells. But
he said that the Pitsham case would have been thought sporadic until more
had been confirmed from the same farm.
"If we reacted on the evidence of sporadic forms of new diseases, then we
would be telling Government about them every few months," he said.

And here is Polly Toynbee's commentary in the "Radio Times". It is an
idiosyncratic mixture of newly emerging facts dealt with in the first of
the BBC 2 series of programmes (of which doubtless she has had a preview),
and Polly's personal opinions, but worth noting.
THE BBC SAGA IS A TALE OF HUMAN FRAILTY, ACCIDENT, MISCHANCE AND A FAIR
AMOUNT OF BUNGLING AND COWARDICE by Polly Toynbee
[Then it goes along loudly in the same stream for a while. Eventually there
are these relatively calmer paragraphs.
The strongest impulse in officialdom is to prevent public panic. So too
little was done about some early fears of the possible dangers to humans
while officials waited incontrovertible evidence. When scientists first
said publicly that there might be a danger, but they didn't know for sure
because no one could know, the men from MAFF went ballistic. A scientist's
duty is to say loudly what they do and don't know, but one of them explains
bitterly that riot knowing is not a message politicians can accept.
Scientists deal in doubt, possibility, uncertainty, but politicians and
their officials in certainties. This culture clash continually dogged the
story.
[Ms Toynbee seems unaware that MAFF scientists are there primarily to
advise the Minister and are subject to the Official Secrets Act.
I await the next three episodes of the story eagerly, particularly the
revelations about how the public machine works or doesn't. For example, in
1988 the health official who wrote the first report of the Southwood
committee investigating BSE evidence was so worried her work would be
suborned by MAFF that she sent her draft round by hand to committee members
on Christmas Eve, when she knew most of Whitehall wouldn't be working. From
the start there was a culture clash between the ministries of health and
agriculture - one concerned with public health, the other worried about the
fate of the farming industry.
Another revealing vignette: the Southwood committee recommended from the
start that farmers should be compensated for the full market value for
every mad cow they had to destroy. A cow was worth 500 pds on the open
market, but only 30 pds if it was sent to the knacker's yard. Southwood
feared farmers would hide the disease unless paid in full. What does that
tell us about farmers? If some industry is found to be producing poison,
they are banned from doing so. We did not have to pay drug companies to
stop producing thalidomide, so why are farmers any different? This raises
the question of our overprotection of agriculture that dogs all of European
policy. Farming is a business like any other, and if they produce poison
because they have used a cheap unnatural animal feed, why should the
taxpayer bear the cost to ensure he doesn't cheat?
[clip
End of Polly Toynbee's article.
Ralph commented in relation to farmers' compensation:
Leaving aside the use of the word "cheat" for farmers in good faith
following Government advice, this is a false analogy. The crucial
difference is that if we ban the production of a substance newly discovered
to be harmful, we do not also destroy the company's factory. The
compensation to farmers was not for the ban on ruminant feed, but
specifically for the destruction of their cattle.
This is the beginning of a saga that will run and run, especially when the
open hearings and the Web-published daily transcripts of them start in March.

[In a separate BSE-L posting Holtz de Barr commented concerning compensation:

If you want to have a system you can believe in, then make it worthwhile
for a farmer to declare cases he is suspicious about, rather than send them
off early when unskilled people can't easily be sure of what it is. [He had
earlier commented on how very subtle the early signs of BSE can be.
Abandon the absurd whole herd culling policy, which is mere window
dressing, and institute over-generous compensation for new cases. I very
much doubt that any country actually wants to know how much BSE it really
has, however. A cynic might think that these regulations were drawn up for
exactly this purpose.

[There are many decades of MAFF experience in engendering farmer support,
positive and negative, and generous and rapid compensation is the most
efficient and the most economic. I have always been impressed with how
public spirited the great majority of UK farmers are, though of course
there are always some villains. During the '67-'68 FMD epidemic they
universally reported their suspicions fairly promptly even when it meant
their herd would be slaughtered almost within the hour. Out of the 2500
herds affected only a handful were delinquent. - Mod.MHJ

The MAFF Web site is actually quite impressive though they have not gotten
around to, updating the chronology. They provide very interest summaries
of 75 completed and 60 ongoing research projects, without listing principal
investigator, at:

I wrote Louise Pinkey, the webmaster, l.pinkney@ahbse.maff.gov.uk, to see
how the reports can be obtained after they are completed, choosing (among
many interesting titles):
SE1803 Transmissibility of BSE to pigs by oral exposure to brain homogenate
[became SE1817 31/03/95
SE1804 Transmissibility of BSE to cattle by oronasal exposure to placentae
of affected cattle [became SE1818
These are to be completed by the end of March 98:
SE1801 BSE: Embryo transfer studies
SE1805 Transmissibility of BSE to domestic fowl by injection with brain
homogenate
These are a long way off:
SE1828 The exposure of British sheep and cattle to mites
SE1829 Replication of scrapie and BSE prions in mites
