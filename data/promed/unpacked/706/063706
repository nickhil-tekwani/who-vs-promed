One man died and 5 others were hospitalized after contracting anthrax
at a farm in the Omsk region that supplied horse meat for pelmeni
sold in Moscow and other regions, Interfax reported Monday [3 Aug 2010].

All 6 victims fell ill after being hired to cut meat from diseased
animals, said Gennady Onishchenko, head of the Federal Consumer
Protection Service. Horses started dying at the farm in June [2010],
but the farm's owners hid the deaths, he said.

Lifenews.ru said about 2.5 tons of horse meat with anthrax were
supplied to Darina, a prominent pelmeni producer. The meat was
confiscated, as were shipments of the company's pelmeni in the
Moscow, Omsk, Tyumen, Sverdlovsk, and Tver regions, the Novy Region
news agency reported.

[Pelmeni are small flour and water dumplings. The 'pastry' is rolled
very thin and is stuffed with mushrooms, onions, and whatever meat is
available including horse, cut up fine. They are a Siberian dish,
probably a left over from Ghengis Khan! They are boiled and are eaten
in soup or by themselves. Very popular with hunters as they can be
carried. There is no sweet version of pelmeni. These men were
infected butchering sick horses. But read on. - Mod.MHJ]

Doctors in the Siberian city of Omsk examined 127 individuals who are
possibly suffering from anthrax.

According to the local health minister, between 28 and 30 Jul 2010, 6
people from the province of Omsk were hospitalized with a preliminary
diagnosis of anthrax, and 2 of them with confirmation of this
diagnosis. On 1 Aug 2010 one of them died.

It was established that all the possibly infected individuals work in
a meat production plant and could have been infected by some animals.
All 127 people threatened by the disease, including 83 residents of
the city of Omsk, must undergo medical observation.

As explained by the Omsk province prosecutor general's office, the
cause of the outbreak of anthrax was a violation of health and
biosafety rules. Meanwhile, [authorities] are investigating whether
infected meat has already been sold.

More than 100 people are under quarantine after a deadly anthrax
outbreak in the Omsk region of Siberia. While doctors are trying to
contain the disease, the investigation has found out that all of
those infected worked for a horse farm and took part in the latest
slaughter of -- as it turned out -- ill animals.

"In the course of our check, we found out that there were violations
of sanitary regulations in this household," Larisa Boldinova, from
the prosecutor general's Office, told RT. "Moreover, the workers in
the slaughterhouse were not vaccinated against anthrax." The owner of
the farm where the infected meat came from has already been charged
with sanitary violations.

"The farm is in a very bad state -- we have started disinfection,"
said Gennady Onishchenko, Russia's chief medical health officer. "And
the area it is located in, Tukalinsk district in Omsk region, has a
bad history of anthrax outbreaks. Since 1929, a lot of infected
animals have been buried there."

According to local media, the infected horses could have been
illegally brought from Kazakhstan.

About 2.5 tons of horse meat have already been sent to a "Darina"
meat factory that produces a range of products, including pelmeni and
pancakes, which are sold in a number of Russian regions.

[(This last report has been edited extensively as the machine
translation was difficult at best. - Mod.MPP/Sr. Tech.Ed. MJ). All in
all some 2.5 metric tons of contaminated horse meat were processed.
While not all made its way to dumplings, it would seem to have been
widely distributed, possibly even to Moscow.

To see a recipe for pelmeni, go to <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelmeni>.

As my colleague SB comments: "They [pelmeni] are not difficult to
make and I make them to eat in the winter, they are very good I
think, but whether a Russian would recognise my efforts I do not
know. Some make them with mixed meats, and it is quite possible that
the horse meat was to mix in with say lamb and pork or whatever meats
were available." - Mod.MHJ]
