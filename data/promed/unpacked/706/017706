North Carolina H1N1v flu infection linked to swine exposure
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today [26 Mar 2021] reported a variant H1N1 (H1N1v) case, which involves a North Carolina resident who had daily contact with pigs.

In its weekly FluView report, the CDC said the patient's sample was collected in 2020, but H1N1v wasn't identified until 2021. Thus, the case marks the nation's 1st case for 2020.

An investigation found no instances of human-to-human transmission related to the case. The US reported its last H1N1v case in 2019, which involved a patient from Michigan who had no contact with swine. The CDC said swine flu viruses, including H1N1, sporadically infect people, causing symptoms that are similar to seasonal flu.

[The CDC FluView (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm) reports:
"One human infection with a novel influenza A virus was reported by North Carolina. This person was infected with an influenza A(H1N1) variant (A(H1N1)v) virus in 2020. The patient is an adult >18 years of age, was not hospitalized, and has recovered from their illness. An investigation into the source of the infection revealed that the patient worked with and had daily contact with swine. No human-to-human transmission has been identified in association with this patient. While this variant virus infection was not identified until 2021, it represents the 1st influenza A(H1N1)v virus identified from a specimen collected in the United States in 2020 (during the 2020-21 season). No influenza A(H1N1)v virus infections have been identified in specimens collected in 2021 thus far."

Human infections with classical swine influenza A(H1N1) viruses that circulate in pigs continue to occur in the United States following exposure to swine. "Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be more fully understood and appropriate public health measures can be taken. Additional information on influenza in swine, variant influenza infection in humans, and strategies to interact safely with swine can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/index.htm.
