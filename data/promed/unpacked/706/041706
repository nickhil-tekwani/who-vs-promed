Meatpacker to shut down in wake of massive recall
-------------------------------------------------
Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co, which issued the biggest meat recall in
US history last week [17 Feb 2008], probably will shut down permanently,
the company's general manager told the Wall Street Journal. "I don't see
any way we could reopen," Anthony Magidow said in a telephone interview
from the meatpacker's plant in Chino, California, late on Friday [22 Feb 2008].

The meatpacker voluntarily suspended operations in early February [2008],
after the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) began investigating how it
treated animals. The USDA has said the slaughterhouse might be able to
resume operating if it met certain conditions. But Mr Magidow said, "we are
a small private company," and cash has become tight. Among other problems,
some customers stopped payment on checks they had sent the company for meat
that is part of the recall of 143 million pounds [about 65 000 tons] of
beef, he said.

Federal food-safety regulators said Thursday [21 Feb 2008] that they intend
to require that Hallmark/Westland, a leading supplier to the National
School Lunch Program, pay for the costs associated with destroying and
replacing meat submitted to the program. "If the USDA wants payment back,
we're dead meat. We're done," said Mr Magidow, 46 years old, who has worked
at the company for more than 15 years. "There's no way we could pay it all
back."

[This article has been pruned extensively but interested members are
advised to read it in full. Apparently the company has installed some 15
video cameras throughout the slaughterhouse to help monitor activities.
Lawmakers in Washington and Sacramento have scheduled hearings starting
this week to explore how the problem occurred despite the presence of
federal inspectors, and whether the meat supplied to the school lunch
program is safe. The US Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee
plans to hold a meeting this coming Thu 28 Feb 2008, on "serious questions
on risks posed to children by the recalled beef." The Secretary of
Agriculture and the president of the American Meat Institute Foundation are
expected to attend. - Mod.MHJ]
