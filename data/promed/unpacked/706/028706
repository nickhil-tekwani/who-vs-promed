A fish farm in North Yorkshire has been hit by a deadly infectious disease.
Up to 50 000 infected fish have been slaughtered and movement
restrictions have been put in place along the River Ouse catchment
area in Yorkshire.
The outbreak of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) at the trout
farm in the Yorkshire Dales is being investigated by Defra
scientists. Fish farms in the area and others which may have had
contact with the infected premises have been inspected, but none so
far have shown evidence of disease, officials said. The affected farm
has been cleared of all fish and plans are in place to disinfect the
site.
VHS affects mainly farmed rainbow trout and can cause up to 80
percent death rate.
Government officials said the disease posed no risk to human health.

The presence of Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (VHS) has been
confirmed at a trout farm in North Yorkshire. VHS is a notifiable
disease which affects mainly farmed rainbow trout, and can cause
significant fish mortality.
Due to the serious nature of VHS, it is standard policy to place
controls on entire river catchments on confirmation of the disease.
Defra has issued an Order under the Diseases of Fish Act 1937,
prohibiting movements of fish to and from the catchment of the River
Ouse.
Cefas [Defra's Centre for the Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture
Science] is currently undertaking an epidemiological investigation to
determine the source of infection and whether any spread has occurred.
Wild and farmed fish are being sampled within the catchment to
determine the extent of spread of the infection. The site has been
cleared of fish (which have been sent for disposal at an approved
rendering plant) and the site is now being prepared for disinfection.
Once the disease situation is fully under control certain fish
movements may be allowed to take place in the affected area with the
supervision of the Cefas Fish Health Inspectorate.
The UK is currently designated by the EU as an 'Approved Zone' free
of VHS which allows safeguards to be placed to minimise the risk of
introduction of the disease through trade. This outbreak requires
that this status be suspended until it can be redefined to exclude
the affected Ouse catchment area. Currently the UK will be unable to
trade live fish with VHS free 'Approved Zones' throughout the EU
Community.
The live fish movement restriction does not apply to the movement of
ornamental fish to or from pet shops and aquaria.
VHS has no implications for human health.
Notes for Editors:
On 22 May 2006, Fish Health Inspectors from the Centre for
Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), acting on
behalf of Defra, inspected a trout farm in Yorkshire following a
report from the farm manager of high levels of mortality in the farm
stock. Samples were taken and analysed at the Cefas Weymouth
laboratory, and the presence of Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (VHS)
has been confirmed.
VHS is a notifiable disease which affects mainly farmed rainbow
trout, and can cause significant mortality.
This is the first outbreak of VHS recorded in mainland Great Britain,
although there was an outbreak of the marine form of the disease in
farmed turbot in the Isle of Gigha in 1994.
The Diseases of Fish (Designated Areas) (England) Order 2006
restricts the movement of any live fish or live eggs of fish into or
out of the designated area without the prior written consent of Defra.
The designated area is defined as: "The geographical area from where
the water drains to form the Yorkshire River Ouse catchment,
extending to the upper tidal limit." [Map at
<http://www.scubamom.com/travels/britain/walscot2.gif>].
Further information on VHS and other serious freshwater diseases can
be found on the Defra website and in its "Combating Fish Disease"
publication. Our sister site, <http://www.efishbusiness.co.uk/> also
provides information on fish health matters.
To organise a fish health inspection on suspicion of an outbreak,
contact the CEFAS Fish Health Inspectorate on 01305 206673/74 or by
sending an email to: <fish.health.inspectorate@cefas.co.uk>.
This Designated Area Order (DAO) will come into force on 1 Jun 2006.
