Authorities have again blamed moldy rice for causing a mysterious skin disease that has returned to a central mountain district after a year's reprieve, killing one girl and infecting at least 4 others.

Test results from the Ho Chi Minh City Institute of Hygiene and Public Health showed that most rice samples taken from Ba To District in Quang Ngai Province were positive for fungi, news website VnExpress reported. The samples contained up to 100 times the amount of aflatoxins permitted by Vietnamese health standards.

[Tests in] family members of the deceased girl showed high amounts of aflatoxin B1, which is considered a highly toxic fungus.

The victim, 14, died on 17 Apr 2014 of the disease which has sickened some 250 people in Ba To and Son Ha districts [Quang Ngai province] and killed 26.

Local health officials said a family member of the deceased girl is likely to end up the same as he has refused to remain in the hospital and receive treatment.

The disease begins with high fever, loss of appetite, and causes the skin on one's palms and feet to thicken and swell. It can cause fatal organ failure, which typically begins in the liver.

The condition is thought to be caused by chronic poisoning, but the toxin responsible for it has yet to be identified, although a few factors have been suspected like heavy metals in the soil and moldy rice.

In May 2012, local officials brought in 60 tons of rice to the area after a Health Ministry study suggested rice mold as a possible cause for the illness.

Le Huy, a spokesman for Quang Ngai's health department, said he had the samples sent to Ho Chi Minh City after noticing that many ethnic minorities in the affected areas continue to eat fungus-covered rice as a traditional food.

The locals bury wet rice and dig it up to eat the black grains. Health checks in April [2014] found at least 35 locals suffered from high levels of liver enzymes.

But local officials said that they suspect there's another cause related to the weather, as the disease tends to recur between February and May every year.

In an interview with VnExpress last year [2013], Dr Babatunde Olowokure from the World Health Organization (WHO) in Viet Nam said the disease bears no resemblance to any disease or illness that has ever been known in the world.

No effective method of treatment has been established, despite several visits to the area by the ministry officials and WHO experts.

[While aflatoxin in grains can cause problems, the issues mentioned here are not consistent with those of aflatoxicosis. This particular syndrome may be related to a grain fungus, but it is not aflatoxin. Some of the clinical signs resemble those of aflatoxin, but most mycotoxins may have some of these signs in common.

Further, the article mentions that the levels found are 100 times the allowable limit by standards in Viet Nam. There are standards and guidance documents established in the European Union, the United States, Australia, and a few others, but I was unable to find the guidance documents or allowable levels in human foodstuffs in Viet Nam.

Years of research in aflatoxin do not indicate it produces thickened skin or any other type of skin lesions.

Information regarding the investigation and confirmation of the cause of this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.TG
