A total of 3 new cases of H5N6 bird flu have been identified after analysis at the National Veterinary Office (SVA). They were a sea eagle, a pigeon and a buzzard found in the areas surrounding Morrum and Bromolla in southern Sweden. This virus has not been found to present a risk to humans, unlike the H5N6 virus that circulates in Asia.

"In order to avoid spreading to poultry, it is important that poultry producers and hobby farmer owners have good contingency routines," said Karin Ahl, chairman of the unit for horse, poultry and game at the Swedish Agriculture Agency.

The H5N6 is still circulating in wild bird populations in the country and we do not know how extensive the spread is. It is likely that new cases of wild birds will be detected, and there is still a risk of infestation of the bird of birds. Therefore, we would like to remind you that it is always important to protect your domestic birds from direct and indirect contact with wild birds, "says Karl Stahl, Deputy State Psychologist at SVA.

The virus is closely related to H5N8, which circulated among wild birds in Sweden in 2016 and 2017, and also caused outbreaks in poultry. While the H5N8 has been massive in large parts of Europe, the H5N6 has not been reported to the same extent, nor has it been associated with the same mortality.

In February 2018, a H5N6 bird flu was detected at a sea eagle and a buzzard on the Blekinge coast. Thereafter, additional cases have been found in a crew in Uppsala County and 2 other wild birds in Blekinge.

Bird flu exists in many varieties and is highly contagious between birds. Milder variants of the virus are found naturally among wild birds, especially in marine birds. Protection level 1 applies in Sweden, which means that poultry may go out, but feed and water should be given under roof or under outdoor protection.

It is important to have good care routines and to prevent direct and indirect contact with wild birds as far as possible. Animal owners should pay attention and contact the vet if poultry show increased mortality, changes in feed and water consumption, egg production reduction or impaired general condition.
