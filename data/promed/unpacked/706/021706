Avian influenza in Africa: Statement by the Director-General of WHO
-----------------------------------------------
The confirmation of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in Africa is a
cause for great concern and demands immediate action. This is the 1st
reported incidence of this highly pathogenic virus on the continent,
where people are already enduring the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other
serious infectious diseases. The H5N1 virus now confirmed in Nigeria
poses a risk to human health and livelihood.
The single most important public health priority at this stage is to
warn people about the dangers of close contact with sick or dead
birds infected with H5N1. The vast majority of all human cases and
deaths from H5N1 have occurred in previously healthy children and young adults.
Experience in Asian countries and most recently in Turkey underscores
the fact that immediate, clear public information is critical to help
protect human health. Slaughtering, defeathering or butchering
infected, sick or dead birds can put people at risk. The home
slaughter and consumption of birds which appear to be sick is
high-risk behavior. Ideally, people culling and disposing of birds
should have protective equipment.
WHO is offering support to the Government of Nigeria's national
public information campaign. This campaign may include delivery of
messages to communities during the nationwide house-to-house polio
immunization campaign beginning on Saturday [18 Feb 2006]. The polio
eradication infrastructure in Nigeria is also being mobilized to
support other essential surveillance and protective measures, such as
monitoring for human cases, support for "early warning systems," and
logistic support for containment, treatment, and laboratory functions.
This latest outbreak confirms that no country is immune to H5N1.
Every country is at risk. Every country must prepare. There is a risk
that outbreaks of H5N1 infection in birds could spread within Nigeria
and into neighboring countries. Nigeria is one of several African
countries located on the Black Sea-Mediterranean flyway used by
migratory birds. Human and animal health services must be on high
alert, sharing information and quickly reporting any signs of disease
in birds or humans that could be due to H5N1 avian influenza.
African health systems are already struggling to cope with children
and adults suffering from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria,
respiratory infections and other infectious conditions. Human cases
of H5N1 may be difficult to distinguish from other illnesses. We
simply do not know what the impact of exposure to avian influenza
will be on the many people who may be already immunocompromised and
in a fragile state of health. Health workers must be fully alert, and
samples must be taken and sent to laboratories. When human cases of
H5N1 are identified, coordinated human and animal health
investigations will be essential.
If the H5N1 virus changes to allow it to pass easily from person to
person, and it goes unchecked, this could trigger an influenza
pandemic. H5N1 is spreading rapidly across the world. All countries
must take measures to protect human health against avian flu, and
prepare for a pandemic.
There is no time to waste. We are ready to help all African countries
take measures to reduce the risks of H5N1.

Nigeria: 2 Children Are Suspected Avian Influenza Cases
-----------------------------------------------
Nigerian doctors are testing blood samples from 2 children they
suspect may have been infected with the deadly H5N1 strain of bird
flu, a senior health ministry official said on Sunday [12 Feb 2006].
"We've taken their samples, which are now undergoing some laboratory
tests," said Nasidi Yakubu, a director from the Federal Health
Ministry deployed to northern Nigeria to monitor Africa's 1st
outbreak of the disease.

Nigeria: 2 children are H5N1 Virus Infection Suspects
-----------------------------------------------
Nigerian health officials waited anxiously on Sunday [12 Feb 2006]
for test results on 2 children feared to be the 1st Africans infected
with the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus.
The virus [appeared] in early January 2006 among poultry in Nigeria,
Africa's most populous country, but the H5N1 diagnosis was confirmed
only last week, and authorities are struggling to contain it as it
spreads rapidly to farms across the north. The father of the 2
children -- a 4-year-old boy and a baby boy of 4 months -- said they
had a very high temperature and coughed up blood 2 weeks ago when all
250 of his geese, turkey and chickens died suddenly. "The 2 of them
were coughing, and if they sneezed, blood came from their nose and
throat," Isaac Achi told Reuters. "I took them to the hospital, and
they recovered. It happened when all the birds in our surroundings
died. My wife also complained of chest pains," he said, adding that
the elder boy was now back at school. The Achi family home is close
to a farm where the H5N1 virus was confirmed.
Health Ministry official Abdulsalam Nasidi visited the children on
Sunday [12 Feb 2006] and took away a blood sample, which is due to be
analyzed at a specialist laboratory in nearby Plateau state. People
can catch the virus, which has killed at least 88 people in Asia and
the Middle East since early 2003, from contact with infected birds,
but it cannot yet be spread from one human to another.
The outbreak of H5N1 in Nigeria is the 1st known appearance of the
virus in Africa. Although only 4 farms in 3 northern Nigerian states
have confirmation of H5N1, officials believe more than 20 farms have
been hit in Kano state alone. Farmers in 3 other northern states have
also reported mass deaths of poultry, local media reported. Farmers
have received little information on how to handle the disease, and
workers have been using their bare hands to dispose of thousands of
sick birds, raising fears of a large number of human infections.
"This is an emergency situation, and it is very important to stop the
handling, trading and movement of birds," said Mohammed Belhoecine,
Nigeria representative of the World Health Organization.

Indonesia: 2 Suspected Fatal Cases Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
A Hong Kong laboratory recognized by the World Health Organization
has confirmed 2 more human avian influenza deaths in Indonesia,
raising the toll from the virus in the country to 18 [i.e. 25 cases
and 18 deaths - Mod.CP], a Health Ministry official said on Sunday
[12 Feb 2006]. Although the 2 latest confirmed cases are not related,
they both came from the suburb area of Bekasi, just east of the
Indonesian capital.
Hariadi Wibisono, director of control of animal-borne diseases at the
ministry, also said local tests showed a 23-year-old man who died on
Friday [10 Feb 2006] had the H5N1 bird flu virus. "The man worked in
a traditional market transporting chicken eggs that might have had
droppings on them. His samples have been sent to Hong Kong for
confirmation," he said. [If confirmed, this will increase the number
of cases to 26 with 19 deaths. - Mod.CP]. The WHO has urged that
hygiene and sanitation standards in Indonesian traditional markets be improved.
While the virus mostly affects birds, the H5N1 strain of avian flu
has killed at least 90 people in 7 countries since 2003, according to
the WHO. Experts fear the virus will mutate to become easily passed
between humans, triggering a pandemic. The current H5N1 strain of
bird flu has not mutated. The highly pathogenic strain of bird flu
has affected birds in 2/3rds of the provinces in Indonesia, an
archipelago of about 17 000 islands and 220 million people. The
country has millions of chickens and ducks, many in the yards of
rural or urban homes, making it likely more humans will become
infected with the virus. For financial, social and political reasons,
Indonesia has been reluctant to undertake the mass culling of fowl
seen in some other countries, concentrating instead on selective
culling and on public education and hygiene measures aimed at prevention.

[5] China - H5N1 multiple sublineages

Report Depicts China as Launching Pad for Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
An analysis of influenza viruses collected from thousands of wild and
domestic birds in China and Hong Kong suggests that H5N1 serotype
viruses have been circulating in southern China for nearly a decade
and have spread repeatedly from there to spark outbreaks across Asia.
The study by 27 researchers from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Viet
Nam, and the United States provides strong evidence that migratory
birds can spread the virus for long distances, a contention that has
been controversial in recent months. The report was published online
by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on 10 Feb
2006; 10.1073/pnas.0511120103. [The paper by H. Chen and 27 others is
entitled: "Establishment of multiple sublineages of H5N1 influenza
virus in Asia: implications for pandemic control." The reference for
the print version is Proc Natl Acad Sci, 21 Feb 2006, vol. 103, no.
8, 2845-2850].
Perhaps more surprising is the group's discovery of H5N1 viruses in
some apparently healthy chickens in live-bird markets in southern
China. Ducks are known to be capable of carrying the virus without
appearing sick, but the virus has been regarded as almost invariably
pathogenic or lethal for chickens.
"We have shown that H5N1 virus has persisted in its birthplace,
southern China, for almost 10 years and has been repeatedly
introduced into neighboring (e.g., Viet Nam) and distant (e.g.,
Indonesia) regions, establishing colonies of H5N1 virus throughout
Asia that directly exacerbate the pandemic threat," says the report,
written by a team that included leading flu expert Robert G. Webster
of St. Jude Children's Research Institute in Memphis.
The scientists took more than 13 000 samples from migratory birds in
Hong Kong's Mai Po Marshes and at Poyang Lake in southeastern China
over 3 winters from 2002 to 2005. Among these, they found 6 H5N1
viruses, all collected from apparently healthy migratory ducks at
Poyang Lake just before their migration north.
The team also tested samples gathered from more than 51 000
apparently healthy birds in live-poultry markets in southern China
from January 2004 through June 2005. Testing detected 512 H5N1
viruses, including isolates from 58 of the 22 390 chickens tested,
with most of the rest found in ducks.
The analysis also included viruses recovered from the outbreak in
migratory birds at Qinghai Lake in north-central China in 2005, along
with isolates collected from poultry in Indonesia, Viet Nam, and
Malaysia in the past 2 years.
To trace the relationships among H5N1 samples, the researchers
sequenced the genomes of 69 viruses recovered in China since January
2004 and 59 isolates gathered in Indonesia, Viet Nam, and Malaysia
from August 2003 through May 2005. This enabled them to construct a
phylogenetic chart, or family tree, of the viruses. [2 phylogenetic
trees were constructed; one for the hemagglutining (HA) gene and one
for the nucleoprotein (N) gene, which are largely congruent -
Mod.CP]. Among other things, the analysis revealed that the
hemagglutinin (HA) protein of all the viruses stemmed from the
patriarch of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, a strain found in geese
in China's Guangdong province in 1996. It also showed that viruses
from particular regions formed "distinct sublineages," which, the
authors say, demonstrates the long-term persistence of the viruses in
those regions.
Parts of southern China represented an exception to this picture of
regional "sublineages," in that the strains there were more diverse,
falling into 4 different genotypes, the report says. "Because the
precursor of these H5N1 viruses ... was originally detected in
southern China in 1996 and because H5N1 viruses in this region have
the greatest genetic diversity, southern China is the most likely
source of the emergent and re-emergent HPAI [highly pathogenic] H5N1
influenza viruses," it states.
The phylogenetic analysis also showed that one May 2005 virus from
Viet Nam was much more closely related to a January 2005 Chinese
strain than to other strains from Viet Nam, indicating that the virus
probably had been recently introduced to Viet Nam from China via
poultry. In fact, the authors say their findings suggest that H5N1
strains spread from southern China to Viet Nam 3 times; in 2001,
2003, and 2005.
"Therefore, control of this regional epizootic and its attendant
pandemic threat requires that the source of virus in southern China
be contained," they assert.
The researchers found that viruses from the Qinghai Lake outbreak
matched up with those from migratory ducks at Poyang Lake, more than
1000 miles away, which "strongly argues that migrating birds can
transfer the virus over long distances." The team found further
support for this notion when they exposed a number of ducks and geese
to H5N1 viruses and found that most of the ducks survived; the
surviving ducks shed the virus for as long as 7 days after infection.
The report says only 6 of the isolates that were sequenced had a
mutation in the M2 protein that confers resistance to the older
antiviral drug amantadine; the rest all had structures indicating
sensitivity to the drug. US officials recently recommended against
using amantadine and rimantadine to treat flu patients this winter
[2006], because most of the circulating viruses had become resistant
to them. Also, previous evidence of H5N1 resistance to the 2 drugs
has led to a general assumption that they would be of little use if
that virus evolves into a pandemic strain.
The authors say the diversity they found among H5N1 samples
"challenges the wisdom" of relying on just one strain to make a
candidate vaccine for pandemic preparedness. The strains used to
develop human vaccines "must reflect the antigenic diversity observed
across this wider region," they write.

[The abstract <http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0511120103>
of the Chen et al. paper reads as follows: "Preparedness for a
possible influenza pandemic caused by highly pathogenic avian
influenza A subtype H5N1 has become a global priority. The spread of
the virus to Europe and continued human infection in Southeast Asia
have heightened pandemic concern. It remains unknown from where the
pandemic strain may emerge; current attention is directed at Viet
Nam, Thailand, and, more recently, Indonesia and China. Here, we
report that genetically and antigenically distinct sublineages of
H5N1 virus have become established in poultry in different
geographical regions of Southeast Asia, indicating the long-term
endemicity of the virus and the isolation of H5N1 virus from
apparently healthy migratory birds in southern China. Our data show
that H5N1 influenza virus, has continued to spread from its
established source in southern China to other regions through
transport of poultry and bird migration. The identification of
regionally distinct sublineages contributes to the understanding of
the mechanism for the perpetuation and spread of H5N1, providing
information that is directly relevant to control of the source of
infection in poultry. It points to the necessity of surveillance that
is geographically broader than previously supposed and that includes
H5N1 viruses of greater genetic and antigenic diversity."
In the view of the moderator, the analysis of the data demonstrates
convincingly that sublineages of the H5N1 HPAI virus exist, that
migratory birds may have played a significant role in the long
distance spread of HPAI H5N1 virus, and that the sublineages exhibit
a degree of antigenic drift which suggests that a single vaccine may
not be sufficient to protect domestic poultry worldwide. This is a
question that should be addressed urgently. This monumental piece of
research has revealed a great deal about the evolution of
H5N1-associated disease in wild and domestic avians, but it does not
allow any prediction about the imminence of a human pandemic. - Mod.CP]
