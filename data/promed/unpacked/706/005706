Salmonella enteritidis: Canadian Travellers to the Dominican Republic
In the week of March 19,1999, LCDC noted an increase in _Salmonella
enteritidis_ isolations in 4 different provinces. With the cooperation of
provincial and local public health officials, LCDC has documented 24
confirmed cases (one co-infected with Shigella sonnei), and 15 suspect
cases among travellers to the Dominican Republic between February 6 and
March 28, 1999. Suspect cases are defined as those who experienced similar
symptoms to their travel companions with laboratory confirmed _S.
enteritidis_, but were not tested. Cases were documented in British
Columbia, Alberta , Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island. The age of the cases ranged from 9 to 66 years, and 58% were
female. An additional 12 cases of gastroenteritis were reported, 7 with
laboratory confirmed infections with other enteric pathogens including
_Shigella sonnei_, _Campylobacter jejuni_ and 2 other _Salmonella_
serotypes. Of the 39 confirmed and suspect cases of _S. enteritidis_, 23
(59%) visited a resort in Rio San Juan. In addition, 4 cases of
gastroenteritis of unknown etiology were reported from the same resort,
along with 4 cases of _Shigella sonnei_, and 3 cases of infection with
other _Salmonella_ serotypes, both confirmed and suspected. Another resort,
near Puerta Plata, was the destination of 11 of the 39 _S. enteritidis_
cases (28%), and 3 cases of _Campylobacter_ infection. Another 6 cases of
_S. enteritidis_ had frequented 4 different resorts. Isolates of
_Salmonella enteritidis_ cases have been sent to the National Laboratory
for Enteric Pathogens for further subtyping and molecular comparison,
results are pending. LCDC will consult with public health authorities in
the Dominican Republic about this outbreak.
