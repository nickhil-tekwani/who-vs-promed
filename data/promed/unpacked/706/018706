The Lesotho Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security said they had
discovered bacterial wilt in potatoes in the Maseru and Thaba Tseka
districts, 174 km from the capital. Senior Crops Production Officer,
Mphasa Rampeta, said the disease was not common in the country. He
allayed farmers' fears, saying the ministry has since embarked on
control measures by destroying the affected potatoes.

He warned farmers from the affected areas not to plant any crops of
the potato family such as tomato, eggplant [aubergine] and green
pepper for the next decade, as the bacteria causing the disease are
able to survive in the soil for a long time.

Rampeta advised farmers to always use new potato seed [tubers] when
planting and refrain from the practice of using potato seeds which are
likely to be infected. The disease can spread through contact with
garden tools that were used for harvesting the affected potatoes.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (at higher elevations of the tropics)
or race 1 (prevalent at lower elevations). These pathogens can also
affect tomato and other solanaceous plants. Different races and
biovars cause lethal wilting diseases on more than 200 known hosts
including many important crops.

Brown rot symptoms include internal staining and rotting of tubers,
wilting and death of plants and may result in substantial yield losses
of up to 75 percent. However, there may also be latent infections. The
pathogens can survive in potato tubers during storage posing a high
risk for introduction of the pathogen to new areas.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insects),
contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed
potatoes), soil and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or
roots of hosts. Some weeds and unharvested potato plants may serve as
pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly
on exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods (such as crop
rotation) and limited genetic resistance may be used.

Both races 1 and 3 have been reported previously in neighbouring South
Africa (see distribution maps below). Molecular diagnosis would be
required to confirm the race involved in the outbreak in Lesotho.
