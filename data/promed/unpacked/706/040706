Avian Influenza H7N7, human, Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy
---------------------------------------------------
The National Institute of Health had recorded a positive [diagnosis] for H7N7 avian influenza virus in a person suffering from conjunctivitis and occupationally exposed to sick birds belonging to the farms in the region of Emilia Romagna,where this viral infection is prevalent. The H7N7 avian influenza virus is not easily transmitted to humans, who can become infected only if there is direct contact with a sick or dead animal. Unlike other avian viruses (such as H7N9 or H5N1), avian H7N7 influenza virus tends to result only in man a mild disease (such as conjunctivitis), as has been observed previously in a human outbreak that occurred years ago in the Netherlands. Since transmission from person-to-person is rare, human outbreaks tend to self-contained, so the risk to the community is extremely low or even non-existent. The Emilia Romagna Region authorities, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, have already identified outbreaks in poultry, and appropriate measures have been taken to control the outbreak.

[2] News report of possible second human case
Date: 2 Sep 2013

There could be two [human H7N7 cases] in the Emilia Romagna infections of the H7N7 virus in humans: was reported, in fact, another suspected case, after the "person suffering from conjunctivitis and occupationally exposed to sick birds belonging to a herd of Mordano, Emilia-Romagna." In this case it was a factory worker employed with the role of collector of eggs. But "there is a second suspected case, under investigation - said Emilia Roma Region in a note - and a worker who works in the same breeding."

The Region of Emilia Romagna, in agreement with the Ministry of Health, following the identification of outbreaks in animals, immediately adopted all the necessary procedures to control the infection. "Overall, the exposed personnel for professional reasons at risk of contracting the virus - and controlled - and 'about 110 units', including employees of the farms and operators activated for felling operations. Of these, 61 workers, between Ferrara and Mordano, undergo active health surveillance (i.e., to monitor and control daily), as exposed before finding the outbreak."

"As was also recognized by the European Union, and in the light of the current situation - said the Councillor for the health of the Region of Emilia-Romagna Carlo Lusenti - we can say we managed to improve the situation of outbreaks that have developed."

[In the H7N7 outbreak in The Netherlands in 2003 it was concluded that that human-to-human transmission of A/H7N7 (HPAI) can occur within household contacts of an infected person in the absence of contact with infected poultry. Monitoring of clinical symptoms alone in household contacts of confirmed A/H7N7 cases underestimates the extent of human-to-human spread. It was suggested that cloth handkerchiefs, having indoor pet birds at home or having at least 2 toilets at home could be risk factors for household transmission of A/H7N7. It was recommended that during an outbreak of avian influenza: 1) Household members should be encouraged to use paper handkerchiefs instead of cloth handkerchiefs; 2) Household members of poultry workers exposed to A/H7N7 should be advised on enhanced general hygiene measures; 3) In the case that oseltamivir prophylaxis is offered to exposed poultry workers in future A/H7N7 epizootics, this should also be considered for household members of A/H7N7 cases; 4) Indoor pet birds of poultry workers should be screened and monitored during future outbreaks of avian influenza in order to determine the role of indoor birds in household transmission of the virus; and 5) Further seroprevalence studies among contacts of asymptomatic persons with positive H7 serology should be conducted in order to assess the risk of person to person transmission, and consequently the potential for a new pandemic strain, in the absence of symptoms.

It is not known in the current situation in Italy to what extent there has been any indication of onward transmission of infection, or whether there have been any signs and symptoms of infection other than conjunctivitis. - Mod.CP]
