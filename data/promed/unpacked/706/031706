As of 7 Apr 2014, a total of 524 individuals infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica serotype] Heidelberg have been reported from 25 states and Puerto Rico since 1 Mar 2013. Most of the ill persons (76 percent) have been reported from California. Since the last update on 3 Mar 2014, a total of 43 new ill persons have been reported from [6] states: Arizona (2), California (34), Michigan (1), Oregon (3), Texas (2), and Washington (1).

Among 518 persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 1 Mar 2013 to 18 Mar 2014. Ill persons range in age from less than one year to 93 years, with a median age of 18 years. 51 percent of ill persons are male. Among 437 persons with available information, 162 (37 percent) reported being hospitalized. 13 percent of ill persons have developed blood infections as a result of their illness. Typically, approximately 5 percent of persons ill with salmonellosis develop blood infections. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that began after 8 Mar 2014, might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods consumed and other exposures during the week before becoming ill. 310 (86 percent) of 361 ill persons interviewed to date report consuming chicken in the week before becoming ill. Among those who had brand information available, 119 (74 percent) of 161 ill persons reported that they had consumed Foster Farms brand chicken or another brand likely produced by Foster Farms.

CDC and state and local public health partners continue to focus the investigation on interviewing ill persons about foods eaten and other exposures before becoming ill, continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons who have infections with outbreak-associated strains, and testing recent outbreak strains for antibiotic resistance. CDC is working closely with USDA-FSIS, which is assessing interventions implemented at Foster Farms facilities to prevent future illnesses.

CDC's NARMS laboratory continues to conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing on clinical isolates collected from ill persons infected with any of the 7 outbreak strains. Of 61 isolates tested to date, 38 (62 percent) exhibited resistance to one or more antibiotics. 19 (31 percent) of the 61 isolates were multidrug resistant. To date, isolates collected from ill persons were resistant to combinations of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Although these antibiotics are not typically used to treat Salmonella bloodstream infections or other severe Salmonella infections, antibiotic resistance can be associated with a higher risk of hospitalization in infected individuals. Isolates collected from ill persons reported in 2014 have exhibited similar patterns of antibiotic resistance as isolates collected from ill persons reported in 2013.
