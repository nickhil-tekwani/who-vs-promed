H1N1 virus outbreak in Keetmanshoop
-----------------------------------
Of 6 blood tests sent in for testing 5 came back positive for the H1N1
swine flu virus [that is, pandemic 2009 influenza A/(H1N1) virus] in
Keetmanshoop last week [week of 2 Nov 2010]. Between Mon 1 Nov and Sat 6
Nov 2010 some 1300 people have shown the same flu symptoms, with a [large
proportion] of those being schoolchildren. According to Dr Jack Vries,
chairman of the National Committee For Health Emergencies, only the
Caprivi, Omaheke, and Kavango regions remain unaffected by the flu
outbreak. People showing symptoms, which include headache, high fever, a
sore throat, and persistent coughing should visit a clinic or their doctor
for a check up. In spite of the high number of people infected, no deaths
have been reported and there is no cause for panic.

[Previously on 3 Nov 2010 (see ProMED-mail Undiagnosed illness,
schoolchildren - Namibia: (KA), RFI 20101105.4012) it was reported that
this outbreak of febrile illness affected about 90 people, most of whom
were schoolchildren. One of 6 diagnostic samples had tested negative for
influenza A/(H1N1) virus. It now transpires that the other 5 pending
samples have tested positive for influenza A/(H1N1) virus, and about 1300
people have now contracted this infection. Fortunately, as elsewhere, the
2009 pandemic (H1N1) virus is causing relatively mild disease.
