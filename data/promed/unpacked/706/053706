Health officials are reminding all children and adults to make sure
their immunizations are up to date after an outbreak of 47 cases of
mumps in the eastern Fraser Valley, most of them in Chilliwack.
"Certainly, the number of cases is unusual," said Dr. Nadine Loewen
of the Fraser Health Authority. She said last year [2007], there were
11 cases in the area but none in 2003 and 2005, and the 2nd-largest
outbreak of 34 cases dates back to 1997.

The virus, which affects the salivary glands and causes swollen
cheeks, among other symptoms, has affected all ages, from a
2-year-old to a 59-year-old, said Loewen. It's likely a person who
wasn't immunized against mumps picked up the virus in Alberta, where
there is also an outbreak, and spread it to others who weren't
immunized. There are also sporadic cases in Abbotsford, Agassiz and
Mission, and officials are determining whether they're connected to
the Chilliwack outbreak. She said the high number of cases this year
[2008] compared with the last 10 years is due to the fact that the
virus can take hold and then pick up speed if those affected spread
it to others who aren't immunized.

The virus is spread through saliva and can be picked up by sharing a
water bottle, glass or cigarette, or through coughing. About 90 per
cent of the population is immunized, and anyone born after 1956 and
likely after 1970 has a natural immunity to it because of exposure to
mumps as a child, said Loewen.

Symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches and pains, and coughing. Those
with the mumps are infectious generally for 9 days after the swelling
begins and should stay at home, she said. It can cause swollen
testicles or ovaries and lead to sterility and, in rare cases, cause
inflammation of the brain. For more information on immunization, go to

[Five laboratory-confirmed cases of mumps in Chilliwack were reported
in ProMED-mail on 14 Mar 2008 (see: Mumps - Canada: (BC)
20080311.0980. This outbreak appears not to have been contained.

Mumps virus, the causative agent of mumps disease, is a paramyxovirus
classified in the genus_ Rubulavirus_ of the sub-family
_Paramyxovirinae_. It is possible that a outsider initiated this
outbreak in a community containing a few partially vaccinated or
unvaccinated individuals.

Mumps vaccine has had a checkered history. It is now normally
administered as a component of the triple MMR (Mumps, Measles and
Rubella) vaccine. The current vaccine is effective, and children
should be given the 1st dose of MMR vaccine soon after the 1st
birthday (12 to 15 months of age). The 2nd dose is recommended before
the start of kindergarten. The current "Jeryl Lynn" strain of mumps
vaccine was developed by Dr. Maurice Hillman from the mumps virus
that infected his 5-year-old daughter (whose name was Jeryl Lynn).
Originally, just one dose of the MMR vaccine was recommended. In
1989, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy
of Pediatrics, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, changed the
recommendation to 2 doses, primarily to immunize the small percent of
people who do not respond to the measles component of the MMR
vaccine. Immunity to mumps virus infection is important for adults at
high risk of exposure to mumps infection, including college students
and health care workers. People born before 1957 are generally
considered immune to mumps through environmental exposure in their youth.

Throughout Canada, there have been occasional outbreaks of mumps in
university students and others of the same age (see references
below). In the event of a mumps outbreak, students may not be allowed
to remain in school unless they are vaccinated or have other proof of
immunity. Those who remain susceptible should be excluded from school
until at least 26 days after the onset of mumps in the last infected
person at that school.
