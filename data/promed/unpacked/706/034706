The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [Fri 21 Oct 22] closely monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in the Mainland, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The case involves a 3-year-old boy living in Nanning, Guangxi. He developed symptoms on [1 Sep 2022] and was admitted for treatment on [11 Sep 2022]. He is in serious condition.

From 2014 to date, 81 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.

"All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the CHP said.

- Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.

- Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.

The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:

- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;
- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;
- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;
- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and
- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel.

[Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) have also been reported. The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death.

People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illnesses have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection. This is the 81st case of H5N6 avian influenza reported from China since 2014. - Mod.UBA]

Deputy Director of the Department of Preventive Medicine, Ministry of Health, Dr. Nguyen Luong Tam announced today that a 5-year-old female patient from Phu Tho, in northern Vietnam, tested positive for influenza A(H5). This is the first human case of influenza A(H5) in Vietnam since February 2014. From 2003 to the present, Vietnam has recorded 128 cases of influenza A(H5) infection, including 64 deaths.

Deputy Director of the Central Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology Tran Nhu Duong said that as soon as the case was identified, the Institute sent a mobile prevention team to Phu Tho, the area where the patient lived, to coordinate with the Department of Animal Health - Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and localities to conduct epidemiological investigations.

The team took 65 samples of the patient's contacts (both distant and close contacts), and the test results showed that all were negative for influenza A(H5). Currently, the health status of those in contact with the patient is completely normal.

To prevent influenza from spreading from poultry to humans, the Department of Preventive Health recommends that people take the following measures:

1. Do not kill, slaughter or use poultry that are sick or dead for unknown reasons.
2. Do not trade or use meat, eggs and poultry products of unknown origin.
3. Do not eat blood pudding, do not eat meat poultry or eggs that have not been thoroughly processed.
4. When detecting sick or dead poultry, they must promptly notify the local authorities.
5. If flu symptoms related to contact with poultry appear, immediately go to a health facility for timely examination and treatment.

[Since 2003, Vietnam has recorded 128 human cases of A/H5, all of them infected with the H5N1 virus, and 64 people died, according to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology. In 2014, there were 2 cases of H5N1 in the southern provinces of Binh Phuoc and Dong Thap, and both of them died. They've had contact with poultry beforehand .This is the first human case of Avian Influenza A/H5 reported since 2014.

According to additional details reported by VN Express [https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/girl-contracts-avian-flu-after-ingesting-sick-poultry-4526255.html]:

"The patient, a 5-year-old girl in the northern Phu Tho Province, had consumed the meat of sick chickens and ducks beforehand. On (5 Oct 2022), she began to cough and suffered a fever, with family medicines proving ineffective. Two days later, her skin and eyes began to turn yellow and she began to vomit. She was taken to the Thanh Ba District medical center, where doctors diagnosed her with acute liver and kidney failure, the cause of which has yet to be confirmed.

"She was then taken to the Phu Tho obstetrics and pediatric hospital, where doctors confirmed the previous diagnosis. On (8 Oct 2022) she was transferred to the National Hospital of Pediatrics, where she tested positive for A/H5 avian flu 2 days after. A 2nd test by the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology on (17 Oct 2022) confirmed the result.

"The girl is now suffering from respiratory failure, as well as acute liver and kidney failure, septic shock and A/H5 avian flu. She is continuing treatment at the National Hospital of Pediatrics.

"The Phu Tho Center for Disease Control (CDC) said it has not found sick poultry living near the area where the girl lives, and there was no one with avian flu. However back in March (2022), the Phu Tho Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sub-department had recorded bird flu cases among the local poultry population. All poultry in communes with infected cases have been vaccinated. The exact A/H5 strain that infected the girl has not been confirmed" [as yet]. - Mod.UBA
