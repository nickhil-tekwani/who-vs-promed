[1] Scientists warn of new form of stem rust

US-based scientists say a new form of stem rust has moved from eastern
Africa into Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula. Researchers with the Global
Rust Initiative and the Agricultural Research Service of the United States
Department of Agriculture say there's also evidence the disease has spread
into Sudan, but more tests are needed to confirm the finding. Until the new
findings, the strain of stem rust known as Ug99 had only been seen in
Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia. The last major epidemic of stem rust occurred
in North America during the early 1950s and destroyed as much as 40 per
cent of the continent's spring wheat crop. Scientists plotting the probable
trajectory of the new fungus say its spores can be carried over long
distances by winds. Models predict that if the fungus crossed from eastern
Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, it could easily spread to the vast
wheat-growing areas of North Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan, and India.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
countries in the predicted, immediate pathway grow about 25 per cent of the
Earth's wheat.

[2] Dangerous wheat disease jumps Red Sea

A new form of stem rust, a virulent wheat disease, has jumped from eastern
Africa and is now infecting wheat in Yemen in the Arabian Peninsula.
Researchers with the Global Rust Initiative (GRI) and the Agricultural
Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-ARS)
have confirmed conclusively the existence of the disease in Yemen. There is
also evidence that the disease has spread into Sudan, but more tests are
needed to confirm the finding. Until this discovery, this new strain of
stem rust, known as Ug99, had only been seen in Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia.
The last major epidemic of stem rust occurred in North America in the early
1950s, when a strain of stem rust destroyed as much as 40 per cent of the
continent's spring wheat crop. Out of this crisis came a new form of
international cooperation among wheat scientists worldwide, spearheaded by
Nobel laureate wheat scientist Norman Borlaug. This international alliance
of scientists led to the development of wheat varieties which resisted the
onslaught of stem rust for more than 4 decades. But in 1999, a new strain
of stem rust was discovered in Uganda and Kenya capable of destroying most
previously disease-resistant wheat varieties.
A year and a half ago, geographic information systems specialists working
at CIMMYT plotted the probable trajectory of the fungus, whose spores can
travel large distances on the wind. The wind models predicted that if the
fungus crossed from eastern Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, it could
easily spread to the vast wheat-growing areas of North Africa, the Middle
East, Pakistan, and India.
There is precedence for this, from a virulent strain of another wheat
disease, called yellow rust, which emerged in eastern Africa in the late
1980s. Once it appeared in Yemen, it took just 4 years to reach wheat
fields of South Asia. On its way, this new strain of yellow rust caused
major wheat losses in Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and
Pakistan, exceeding USD one billion in value.
There is every reason to believe the new Ug99 strain of stem rust
represents a much greater risk to world wheat production. Annual losses of
as much as USD 3 billion in Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia alone
are possible. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO), countries in the predicted, immediate pathway grow
more than 65 million hectares of wheat, accounting for 25 per cent of the
global wheat harvest. "If we don't control this stem rust threat," says ME
Tusneem, chairman of Pakistan's Agriculture Research Council, "it will have
a major impact on food security, especially since global wheat stocks are
at a historic low."
Experiments conducted over the past 2 years by international researchers in
the Global Rust Initiative in Kenya and Ethiopia demonstrate clearly that
most of the world's wheat varieties are susceptible to the new Ug99 strain
of stem rust. "This is a problem that goes far beyond wheat production in
developing countries," warns Borlaug. "The rust pathogen needs no passport
to cross national boundaries. Sooner or later, Ug99 will be found
throughout the world, including in North America, Europe, Australia, and
South America."
GRI scientists have already identified promising experimental wheat
materials with resistance to Ug99. But from the 1st breeding trials to
growing new, rust-resistant varieties in farmers' fields on millions of
hectares takes time and a massive effort. "If we fail to contain Ug99, it
could bring calamity to tens of millions of farmers and hundreds of
millions of consumers," says Nobel Laureate Borlaug. "We know what to do
and how to do it. All we need are the financial resources, scientific
cooperation and political will to contain this threat to world food security."

[The cereal crop plant wheat (bread wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and durum
wheat, _Triticum turgidum_) develops symptoms of stem rust when infected
with the fungus _Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici_. Severe losses due to
wheat stem rust have been held at bay worldwide due to effective resistance
breeding.
A strain of stem rust, now called Ug99, was found in Uganda in 1999, and it
has since spread to Kenya and Ethiopia. It is thought to have the potential
to seriously damage wheat production there and elsewhere. This is because
it can overcome resistance in wheat offered by the commonly deployed Sr31 gene.
The 2 reports in this posting document the spread of Ug99 across the Red
Sea to Yemen and possibly Sudan, and the consequences of that are spelled
out in the 2nd report, which is well written and is included as a
substitute for annotations I would have made here, so please read it
carefully. The information was obtained from a press release from the
Global Rust Initiative, and a link to their pdf file is in the 2nd item in
"Links" below. This new outbreak of a major pathogen of a major food crop
has to be seen as a very serious plant disease alert.
This posting provides an opportunity to point out that a reported find of
Ug99 in 2006 in the coastal areas of Sindh, Pakistan (20060514.1366) was
never confirmed to the best of my knowledge. The current report provides
new information that would strengthen the prediction that reports from
Pakistan may be possible in the future.
