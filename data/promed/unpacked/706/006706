Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Scare: Re-use of Instruments in a UK hospital
-------------------------------------------------
Officials have said that 29 patients at a hospital in northern England may
have been exposed to the deadly brain disease sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD) after infected equipment was used during surgery. The
patients at Middlesbrough General Hospital all underwent operations using
instruments that had been used on a person who had a brain operation in
July 2002. The patient was diagnosed a month later with sporadic (CJD), an
extremely rare but fatal brain-wasting condition. A hospital spokeswoman
said on Wed 30 Oct 2002 there was only a "very, very low" theoretical risk
the patients had been exposed. "We have been working closely with the CJD
Surveillance Unit to look at any possible risk to these patients, though it
must be stressed it is extremely low," a hospital statement said.
Only about one in a million people contract sporadic CJD. Unlike variant
CJD, the human form of "mad cow disease," which scientists suspect is
contacted by eating beef contaminated with BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy), sporadic CJD occurs randomly, usually in older people, and
has no known genetic or environmental cause. Hospital guidelines specify
that any equipment used in operations in any suspected CJD cases should be
quarantined. But the Middlesbrough Hospital said there had been no reason
to suspect the original patient had CJD, and so there was no cause not to
use the equipment, which was withdrawn after the discovery was made. "It
was due to the diligence of one of our pathologists that a sample of tissue
was sent to the CJD Surveillance Unit [in Edinburgh] to rule CJD out rather
than confirm it," medical director Paul Lawler said. "Once sporadic CJD was
diagnosed we followed the procedure set down by the CJD incidents panel."
The hospital said it had delayed contacting the patients until Tue 29 Oct
2002 because it had been waiting for further guidance, in accordance with
National Health Service practice. "We appreciate the distress and concern
this news may cause to these patients, their families, and the public at
large," the hospital statement said.
The UK official guidance on 'Management of Possible Exposure to CJD through
Medical Procedures' is available at the following web site.

[The following quotations are taken from the Guardian Newspaper, whose
reporter first disclosed the incident: "The Department of Health (DoH)
claimed the instruments should have been quarantined as soon as it became
clear there was a potential risk of transmitting CJD. But Dr Paul Lawler,
clinical director for South Tees hospitals National Health Service (NHS)
trust, said the equipment was not quarantined after the first operation
because CJD was never suspected. Dr Lawler said: "It is a terrible incident
but nevertheless it could still happen tomorrow in this hospital or indeed
in any other hospital. CJD was never suspected. The procedures we were
carrying out are regular procedures carried out in the NHS every day. On a
patient not suspected of having CJD we would do exactly the same thing, as
indeed would any other hospital in the UK." He added that it was impossible
to use disposable surgical equipment for most neurosurgical procedures.
"The idea we should use disposable instruments is not possible for
neurosurgery. They cannot be provided in a disposable form," he said."
Professor Peter Smith, chairman of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee, which advises the government on BSE, said on BBC Radio that
there were only 5 recorded cases of CJD being transmitted through
neurosurgery. "So one can probably say the risk is not enormous, but at the
same time one would not want to say that it was negligible," he added. -
