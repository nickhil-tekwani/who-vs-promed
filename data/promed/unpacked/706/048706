2003/066 EPPO report on notifications of non-compliance (detection of
regulated pests)
-------------------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance (as
they are now called by FAO ISPM no. 13) for 2003 received since the
previous report (EPPO RS 2003/048) from the following countries: Algeria,
Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Malta,
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
When a consignment has been re-exported and the country of origin is
unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the
occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance made
because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications of
non-compliance due to prohibited commodities or missing or invalid
certificates are not shown. It must be pointed out that the report is only
partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent their notifications.

[Bacterial and fungal detections, as usual, are the major ones. The
transport of plant parasitic nematodes in soil adhering to heavy excavators
being shipped from Japan to the UK is a good example of how soilborne
microorganisms get around. - Mod.DH]
