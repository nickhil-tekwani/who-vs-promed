Cyprus has been reinstated as a state free of foot and mouth disease
(FMD), having eradicated the disease from its territory, after
successfully dealing with the outbreaks recorded in 2007.

"The Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases of the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has recommended to the
International Committee of the OIE to reinstate the FMD-free status
of the UK and Cyprus as of 19 and 21 Feb 2008, respectively. The
United Kingdom and Cyprus have eradicated FMD from their territories
after they successfully dealt with the limited number of outbreaks
recorded in 2007," according to a European Commission press release.

It notes that, "in 2007, the FMD-free status of the UK and Cyprus was
suspended following the notification of outbreaks of FMD in the
county of Surrey in Great Britain on 4 Aug 2007, and in the village
of Dromolaxia in Cyprus on 6 Nov 2007, respectively. Both member
states controlled and eradicated the disease on the basis of Council
Directive 2003/85/EC on Community measures for the control of FMD,"
the Commission points out.

In addition, the European Commission "adopted protection measures
that elapsed on 31 Dec 2007 and 31 Jan 2008 for the UK and Cyprus
respectively," according to the press release.

It furthermore notes that "both Cyprus and the UK submitted for
evaluation by the Scientific Commission of the OIE documents
demonstrating the absence of infection in their territories and
compliance with the recommendations of the Terrestrial Animal Health
Code."

[OIE's Scientific Commission was founded in 1946, composed of 5
specialised members. This Commission assists in identifying the most
appropriate strategies and measures for disease prevention and
control. It also examines Member Country submissions regarding their
animal health status for those countries that wish to be included on
the OIE list of countries "free" of certain diseases. The Commission
is elected by the International Committee for a 3-year term.

The current Commission is composed of Prof Vincenzo Caporale
(president), Dr Alejandro Schudel (Vice-President), Prof Preben
Willeberg (Secretary General), Dr Kenichi Sakamoto (member) and Prof.
Salah Hammami (member). The decision to reinstate the FMD-free status
of UK and Cyprus was reached during the recent Commission's meeting,
19-21 Feb 2008, in Paris (the headquarters of the OIE).

All data pertaining to FMD-free status of Member Countries is
available at the website
<http://oie.int/eng/info/en_fmd.htm>.
It includes, currently, the following notification:

"Restoration of "FMD free zone without vaccination" status
-----------------------------------------------
Cyprus:
The Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases evaluated the
documentation concerning the control of foot and mouth disease in
Cyprus following an outbreak of FMD in the Dromolaxia village in the
province of Lanarca on 6 Nov 2007. The Scientific Commission in
accordance with Resolution No. XVII Restoration of recognition of
foot and mouth disease status of Member Countries, recognised that as
from 21 Feb 2008, Cyprus has regained its FMD-free status without
vaccination as addressed in a letter from the Delegate of Cyprus to
the Director General on 6 Feb 2008.

United Kingdom:
The Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases evaluated the
documentation concerning the control of foot and mouth disease in the
United Kingdom following an outbreak of FMD in the province of Surrey
on 4 Aug 2007. The Scientific Commission in accordance with
Resolution No. XVII Restoration of recognition of foot and mouth
disease status of Member Countries, recognised that as from 19 Feb
2008, the United Kingdom has regained its FMD-free status without
vaccination as addressed in a letter from the Delegate of United
Kingdom to the Director General on 31 Dec 2007."

Contrary to the UK, where the recent outbreak involved several farms
affected by the FMD virus (emitted from the Pirbright laboratories
complex and identified as the FMD virus strain "O1 BFS 1860"), in
Cyprus no virus could be detected, and the diagnosis -- and
notification -- were based upon serological findings only.

The final report of Cyprus to the OIE on FMD in Cyprus carries the
date 13 Nov 2007 but was resolved 22 Feb 2008 (see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6827>.
According to this report, the 1st "outbreak" started 22 Oct 2007, was
confirmed 1 Nov 2007, and its "immediate notification" was submitted
to the OIE on 6 Nov 2007. The 2nd outbreak in the same village was
confirmed by the national laboratory applying the ELISA 3ABC test on
2 Nov 2007, which was found positive. The dates and results of
laboratory tests in samples from the suspected sheep, forwarded to
the OIE reference laboratory for FMD (IAH, Pirbright, UK) and tested
there, were as follows:

Virus neutralisation test (VNT), 8 Nov 2007 - positive.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 9 Nov 2007 - negative.

In light of the negative PCR and the lack of clinical disease or
serological reactions in cohabitating cattle and pigs (as reported by
Cyprus to the EU; see references), the application of the term
"outbreak" in this event is somewhat questionable. The true cause(s)
of the positive serological tests in Cyprus sheep remain(s)
speculative; one of the possible explanations is past vaccination of
local or introduced sheep. One wonders whether data that may help in
clarifying the issue have been included in the dossier forwarded by
Cyprus to the OIE when applying to regain its freedom from FMD, which
probably should not have been lost anyway.

meeting). - Mod.AS]
