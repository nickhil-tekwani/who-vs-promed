Health experts investigating an _E. coli_ outbreak in north Cornwall
believe that its most probable cause was pollution from cattle
grazing in fields near a stream.
Warning signs were put up at Watergate Bay, near Newquay, after
12 people were reported to be suffering from an _E. coli_ O157
infection. Soil samples are now being taken from the area around
the bay. The people who became infected included several children
who had all paddled in the same stretch of a stream.
Nick Hibbet, head of environment and health for Restormel Borough
Council, said that the incident appeared to be the result of an
unusual chain of events. He said that "what we're seeing with this
particular case is that, over a period of 3 days, there was very
heavy rainfall at the same time as the Boscastle incident." [There
were flash floods in the Boscastle area. - Mod.LL]. "There were
massive amounts of cattle manure finding their way into the stream.
It doesn't happen on a daily basis, although you get the odd animal
defecating in the stream, so it is an ongoing problem. But, it is not
normally something that would produce such a problem as this."

[Although _E. coli_ O157 is most often associated with under-
cooked ground beef, or contaminated food, the disease can also
be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. In the
spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario,
an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6
adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area
hospitals. Swimming-associated transmission is illustrated in the
references.
