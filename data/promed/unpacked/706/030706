Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Statistics; As of Mon 6 Oct 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health issued on Mon 6 Oct 2003 the latest information
about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This
includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as (vCJD) or CJD (new var.)] -- the form of the disease thought
to be linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The position is as
follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:

Total/1760/677/44/39/20/137/917
(*Provisional as of Mon 6 Oct 2003)
Summary of vCJD cases
Deaths:
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 101

Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 137
Alive:
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 143
The precise definitions of the terms: Referrals, Deaths, Definite cases,
Probable vCJD cases, Sporadic, Probable sporadic, Iatrogenic, Familial,
GSS, variant CJD, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health web-site or by reference to a preceding ProMED-mail
post in this thread [CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693].
The next monthly statistics will be published on Mon 3 Nov 2003.

[Since the previous monthly statistics released by the Department of Health
on Mon 1 Sep 2003, the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases
(dead and alive) has increased by 3, and the number of deaths has increased
by one. The number of probable vCJD cases still alive has increased by
2. The death toll continues to rise, but overall the data are not
inconsistent with the continued decline in vCJD incidence reported during
the preceding 6 months.
In view of the experimental evidence from transmission experiments in mice
reported by Asante et al. (MRC Prion Unit, University College, London) in
the EMBO Journal, Vol. 21, No. 23, 6358-6368, 2002 that: "Some patients
with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD may have a disease arising
from BSE exposure" (see: CJD, possible association with BSE 20021129.5921),
the figures for sporadic CJD cases now have added significance in relation
to the course of the vCJD outbreak and will continued to be presented here.
<http://emboj.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/23/6358?etoc>
vCJD has been recognized to date only in individuals homozygous for
methionine at PRNP codon 129, and Asante et al. reported that transgenic
mice expressing human PrP methionine 129, inoculated with either bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or variant CJD prions, may develop the
neuropathological and molecular phenotype of vCJD, consistent with these
diseases being caused by the same prion strain. However, BSE transmission
to these transgenic mice, in addition to producing a vCJD-like phenotype,
also resulted in a distinct molecular phenotype that was indistinguishable
from that of sporadic CJD with PrP\Sc type 2. These data suggest that more
than one BSE-derived prion strain might infect humans; it is therefore
possible that some patients with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD
may have a disease arising from BSE exposure.
Since Mon 1 Sep 2003 the number of deaths attributed to sporadic CJD has
increased by 10. - Mod.CP]

Belfast: Small Improvement Seen in Teenager with vCJD
-------------------------------------------------
Neurologists have expressed cautious optimism about small improvements and
lack of toxicity in a UK teenager with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD] treated with an
experimental drug, pentosan polysulphate. The patient, a 19-year-old male
from Belfast, Northern Ireland, has been treated with pentosan polysulphate
by injection into the brain since a decision by the High Court during 2002
that the potential benefits outweighed the risks (see: BMJ 2003;326).
Neurologists meeting in Belfast last week to review the early results of
treatment considered that the drug seemed to be well tolerated and that it
might have improved his condition. After 8 months' treatment, the patient
had shown some improvement in neurological functions, including regaining
the ability to swallow. His parents claimed that he had become more alert,
responding to verbal instructions, and attempting to speak. Monitoring of
his heart rhythm showed less variation -­ thought to be associated with
brain stem damage ­- than before starting treatment.
Nikolai Rainov, of the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery,
Liverpool, said: "The question of efficacy is still very much open.
However, we believe that the brain stem now functions better than it did 6
to 8 months ago." He reported: "Some neurological functions have improved
significantly over the course of treatment. The patient is even able to
obey commands -­ something which was not the case 6 months ago." He
considered that pentosan polysulphate might have a role in prolonging
survival in patients with vCJD and in improving their quality of life. He
added: "I believe that instigating treatment at an early stage could
achieve significant extension of the life span of these patients."

[In an additional article in the British Medical Journal (BMJ, vol 125, 4
Oct 2003) Susan Mayor wrote the following: "Pentosan polysulphate, the drug
used for the last 8 months to treat a UK teenager with variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), was reviewed by the Committee on the
Safety of Medicines last year. In its review (October 2002), the Committee
felt unable to recommend its use in vCJD because of the absence of in vitro
or in vivo data relevant to vCJD and the lack of information on the basic
pharmacology of the drug, including its mode of action in this indication.
In particular, the committee considered that it could not recommend the
intraventricular infusion of pentosan polyphosphate to be used as a
treatment in humans for established vCJD disease. It recommended that the
drug should be evaluated in models resembling human disease as closely as
possible, including mouse BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and sheep
BSE models. The CJD Therapy Advisory Group agreed with this opinion but
'acknowledged that healthcare professionals may be more risk averse than
patients or their families when considering potential treatments for
incurable diseases such as CJD.'"
<http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/327/7418/770-b>
Pentosan polysulphate (poly-b-xylose-2,3-disulphonate) is a large
polysulphonated polyglycoside. The drug is relatively inexpensive -­ made
from beechwood -­ and has been used since the 1960s as an anticoagulant, in
a similar way to heparin, also a polysulphonated polyglycoside. It is
currently used in North America for treating interstitial cystitis but is
not licensed in the United Kingdom.
It has not been used previously to treat human vCJD, although animal
studies have shown that injecting the drug into the brains of animals
infected with scrapie, a disease closely related to CJD, slowed the
accumulation of prions -­ the infectious particles implicated in
transmission and progression of CJD. It has been suggested that pentosan
binds to heparan binding sites on infectious prion proteins, potentially
inhibiting further prion production. The drug has to be given directly into
the brain because it is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier.
