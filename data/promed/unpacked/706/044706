September 2013's voluntary recall of the popular yogurt product Chobani has resulted in more than 200 complaints from sickened customers, according to a new report from the FDA. FDA spokesperson Shelly Burgess told OregonLive.com Mon 16 Sep 2013, that the administration has received 223 complaints following the product recall. The number rose sharply from the previous 118 complaints reported by the FDA on 12 Sep 2013. But despite the hundreds of complaints of nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and headaches, Burgess claims it is still not known whether the yogurt was the cause of the illnesses. "We're looking into it," she said. "This is an open investigation."

[There has been a growing number of gastroenteritis-type illnesses which are temporally linked to the ingestion of this brand of Greek style yogurt. It is still the case that it is not likely that the cause of the illnesses is invasive infection due to this mold, but rather an undetected toxin produced by the mold or else another co-contaminant or toxin. It is not clear from the descriptions what the incubation period range is between ingestion and onset of symptoms nor if fever is part of the symptom complex. - Mod.LL
