The General Directorate of Public Health has detected an outbreak of hepatitis A that has affected 33 people in a restaurant in the center of Palma and has reported that it is already controlled. Director Maria Ramos has indicated that no case has presented complications although there have been some hospitalizations for a short period of time.

Ramos has indicated that the outbreak began in mid-December 2017 when a family doctor reported that he had detected 2 patients infected in the same restaurant. After this, an investigation was initiated and finally the 1st affected, a worker in the same restaurant, as well as other 25 related cases that occurred during the Christmas holidays. In this way, the Food Safety inspectors carried out an inspection in the premises. There, a series of deficiencies that could favor the expansion of the outbreak were detected and they were given a deadline to correct them.

In addition, they were asked to requisition and destroy all food and to have the premises completely disinfected and all workers to be studied. Thus, the restaurant was closed between [Wed 10 and Fri 19 Jan 2018], pending the completion of a study of it.

As Ramos explained, 3 more cases were detected and once the premises fulfilled all the requirements and requirements it was reopened. "We do not rule out more cases but they would not be related to the restaurant but would be tertiary cases," she said. Also, the health system is warned and is vigilant when it comes to detecting this disease that is transmitted via the fecal/oral route.

[As the 1st to be affected was a food service worker, the worker may well have been the source. If this is the case, the secondary cases should have occurred after an incubation period of 14-35 days with a mean of 28 days. If, however, diners developed symptoms in a shorter time period, the diners could have been co-primary cases from previously tainted food.

Vaccination of food handlers for hepatitis A will dramatically decrease the risk of transmission from a food worker.

Palma, often called Palma de Mallorca, is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands in Spain.
