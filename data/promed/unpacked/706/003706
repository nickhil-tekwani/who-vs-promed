Scientists have found the deadly Marburgvirus in one type of African
fruit bat, the 1st time it's been detected in an animal other than a monkey.
The bats were collected in the West Africa countries of Gabon and the
Republic of Congo, but the test results support a theory that bats
caused 2 recent Marburg hemorrhagic fever cases in nearby Uganda,
health officials said.
Scientists are not sure how Marburgvirus is transmitted to humans,
but for years they have suspected bats have something to do with it.
"It's a big step in pointing us in the right direction," said
Jonathan Towner, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) microbiologist investigating the Uganda outbreak.
Towner also is co-author of the paper containing the tests results
from Gabon and the Republic of Congo. The paper appears in PLoS ONE
(Public Library of Science), an online medical journal.
Two-dozen investigators from the CDC, the World Health Organization
and other health agencies have been in a remote part of western
Uganda, following the death last month of a 29-year-old man who
worked in a lead mine there.
The man died of Marburgvirus infection, a rare cousin of Ebola virus
that can cause a rapid and gruesome death in which patients may bleed
from the eyes, ears, and elsewhere. A 2nd miner is also believed to
be a Marburg case.
Since Marburgvirus was 1st identified in 1967, large outbreaks have
been reported in Congo, Angola, and other countries. It can spread
from person to person and international health responses to outbreaks
are common.
"It's very scary," said Dr. James Steinberg, a professor of
infectious diseases at Emory University's School of Medicine.
In the new paper, scientists say they tested over 1100 bats
representing 10 species. They found Marburg in only one species,
_Rousettus aegyptiacus_, a common type of fruit bat that lives in
caves. 4 bats tested positive for the virus, and 21 tested positive
for at least low levels of antibodies to the virus, Towner said.
Scientists believe the virus normally "hangs out" in some kind of
animal, Steinberg said. Finding that animal reservoir could help lead
to a better understanding of how the virus works and better
strategies to combat it, he said. It's not yet clear if bats are that
reservoir. They could be getting infected just like people, Towner said.
In Uganda, investigators have noted the ceiling of the cave's tallest
chamber is just 10 feet (3 m) high, and miners' hands and feet are in
constant contact with bat guano, Towner said.
At least 2 kinds of bats have been found in the cave, including the
one found with the virus, he said. Test results on the Ugandan bats
are expected to take a couple of months, he added.

[It has yet to be determined whether humans contract Marburgvirus
infection from fruit bats, or whether both bats and human contract
infection from another as yet unidentified source. The rarity of
human infection in the most recent outbreak in Uganda suggests
caution in attributing the source of infection to a common species of
fruit bat. - Mod.CP
