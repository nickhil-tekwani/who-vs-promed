[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

Checking the OIE detailed anthrax outbreak events for 2013 just have the single outbreak in Orebro, listed below. The map for this 2016 outbreak in Ostergotlands shows the affected land to be the county to the immediate south of Orebro. Something was missed apparently as this report of this outbreak having it typically to be on a farm with a recent prior case and probably in cattle no longer vaccinated. That persistent contaminated site -- ? grave site -- needs to be found and fenced off. - Mod.MHJ
