1st hantavirus case
-------------------
A teenager from Beaverhead County is the 1st person in 2005 to have a confirmed
case of hantavirus, a [Montana] state health official announced.
The young man was hospitalized for a couple of days but has fully recovered,
according to Jim Murphy, communicable disease surveillance officer with the
Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services. The department was
unable to release the youth's name because of state and federal health privacy
laws.
The state Public Health Laboratory confirmed the hantavirus diagnosis this week.
This was the 25th case of the deadly disease reported in the state since it was
first identified in 1993, Murphy said. 6 Montanans have died of hantavirus,
which is contracted by inhaling airborne particles from dried droppings, urine
or saliva of infected deer mice. It is not contagious from person to person.
"This young man was very lucky to have a relatively mild form of the disease
compared to many of our previous cases," Murphy said. "The local health
department conducted a prompt review of the case and determined that he most
likely contracted the disease doing ranch work. He lives and works in a rural
setting with numerous outbuildings -- many with small-rodent populations."
Murphy said the youth is the youngest hantavirus victim in Montana so far and
the 4th in Beaverhead County.
Hantavirus is characterized by fever, muscle and body aches, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue. Eventually, the victim's lungs begin to fill
with fluid, making breathing difficult and causing shortness of breath.
There is no specific treatment, cure or vaccine for hantavirus, but if
infections are recognized early and patients receive medical care in an
intensive care unit, they are more likely to do well. In intensive care,
patients are given oxygen therapy to help them through the period of severe
respiratory distress.
Most cases of hantavirus have been associated with:
- Prolonged exposure to rodent-infested vacant cabins or other dwellings.
- Cleaning barns or other outbuildings.
- Disturbing rodent-infested areas while hiking or camping.
- Planting or harvesting fields.
- Living in or visiting areas where there has been an increase in rodents.
Murphy said people can help prevent hantavirus by keeping mice out of their
homes and workplaces. "You should seal all openings in your foundation, even
those as small as the diameter of a pencil," he said. "Keep food, pet food, and
garbage in rodent-proof containers, and keep firewood at least 100 feet from
your home and raised up off the ground."
He recommended that people take the following precautions when cleaning up
rodent droppings or urine:
- Do not sweep or vacuum rodent droppings or nests. This will disperse virus
particles into the air, where they can be breathed into the lungs.
- Wear rubber or plastic gloves.
- Spray droppings and urine with a disinfectant or a mixture of bleach and
water. Make sure to wet them thoroughly and wait 5 minutes for them to soak.
- Use a paper towel to wipe up the droppings or urine and seal it in a plastic
bag before disposing of it.
- Mop or sponge the area with a disinfectant or bleach solution.
- Wash gloved hands with soap and water or spray a disinfectant or bleach
solution on gloves before removing them. Drop the gloves into a plastic bag,
seal it and discard.
- Wash hands with soap and water after removing the gloves.
People working in enclosed places that may hold rodent droppings, such as crawl
spaces, should wear an air-purifying respirator mask with an N-100 filter.
