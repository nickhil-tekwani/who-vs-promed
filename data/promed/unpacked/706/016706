[1] UK CJD surveillance as of 3 Sep 2012
Date: Mon 3 Sep 2012
Source: UK National CJD Surveillance Unit, monthly statistics [edited]
http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm


The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of Mon 3 Sep 2012 remains 176. No definite/probable patients remain alive, so the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead) remains 176.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in 2010, 5 in 2011, and none so far in 2012.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in 2012
-----------------------------
During 2012 so far [as of 6 Aug 2012], there have been 72 referrals, 45 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, one case of GSS [Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease], 3 cases of familial CJD, no cases of vCJD or of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2960 referrals, 1352 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 176 cases of vCJD, 97 cases of familial CJD, 68 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 47 cases of GSS.

Summary results of the 2nd national survey of abnormal prion prevalence in archived appendix specimens:

In April 2008, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) considered available prevalence data for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in the British population and advised that a 2nd appendix survey using the same approach as a previous appendix tissue survey [1] on samples from the 1941 to 1985 birth cohort be undertaken to further refine the estimate for the prevalence of subclinical infection [2]. The 2nd unlinked anonymous survey of the prevalence of abnormal prion protein in archived appendix tissues has now been completed, and this summary provides an update to the interim results published in September 2011 [3,4].

The survey examined appendices by immunohistochemistry from operations conducted between 2000 and 2012 and collected from 41 hospitals throughout England. Abnormal prion accumulation was detected within the follicular dendritic cells of 16 appendices out of 32 441 suitable samples examined. None of the positive appendices have come from the 176 known vCJD cases in the UK. In line with the interim findings, the final overall prevalence estimate, 493 per million (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 282 to 801 per million), remained statistically consistent with results from the earlier appendix survey (237 per million, 95 percent CI 49 to 692 per million), which examined samples from operations performed between 1995 and 1999 [1]. The prevalence estimates by birth cohort were 733 per million (95 percent CI: 269 to 1596 per million) in those born between 1941 and 1960 and 412 per million (95 percent CI: 198 to 758 per million) in those born between 1961 and 1985: these results were also in line with the interim findings [3,4].

The survey was conducted by a collaboration of the HPA, the Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases at the UCL Institute of Neurology, the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, the National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Research and Surveillance Unit, the Histopathology Department of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, and the MRC Prion Unit.

The final survey results have been considered by the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies Risk Assessment Sub-Group of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, the successor to SEAC [5]. In summary, the estimated prevalence range largely overlaps that from the 1st survey but is narrower with a higher central estimate (around one in 2000 compared with around one in 4000). The new survey also demonstrates the presence of prion protein across a wider birth cohort than previously estimated.

The hypothesis that the prevalence of abnormal prions found in both appendix surveys to date is linked to the epidemic of BSE in cattle in Britain can be tested directly by studying further appendix samples archived prior to the BSE outbreak and samples from those born in 1996 or later by which time measures had been put in place to protect the food chain [5].

A new report highlights the risks of contracting the deadly brain condition Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD).

According to the study, about 24 000 people in the UK are carrying the agent that can cause the disease, twice the number previously estimated by scientists. The latest figure is based on a study of 30 000 appendixes removed in operations which were tested for the presence of the prion, or misfolded protein that causes the condition linked with eating infected meat [derived from bovine spongiform encephalopathy-affected animals].

More than a decade ago, health ministers assured the public that beef was safe to eat and then had to eat their words when, in March 1996, it was announced that a new disease, variant CJD (vCJD), had been discovered in humans. It had come from eating meat from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a similar disease caused by the now discontinued practice of feeding ground-up animal carcasses to cows as part of their diet. BSE became known as mad cow disease, and in humans CJD is characterised by rapidly progressive dementia and death.

However, only a small proportion of people who carried the prion developed the clinical disease. There have been 173 [176 as of Aug 2012] cases in the UK since it was 1st identified in 1996. The number of carriers of the prion is significant, because there is a theoretical risk they could spread the disease through blood transfusions or surgical instruments which may not properly sterilised between operations. Tough measures are in place to minimise these risks.

The Health Protection Agency, which published the new figures [posted above], said one in 2000 of the adult population of Britain were carriers of the condition, compared with one in 4000 shown in a smaller survey in 2004. Older people, born before 1961, were twice as likely to be carriers as younger people, yet less likely to develop the disease.

Professor Sheila Bird of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Biostatistics unit in Cambridge said: "Our dietary studies suggested older people were more exposed (to BSE infected meat) but they weren't turning up as clinical cases. Professor Hugh Perry, chair of the MRC's Neuroscience and Mental Health board, said: "These figures reinforce the importance that our efforts to prevent, diagnose, and treat this devastating disease progress as rigorously as possible."

A UK Department of Health spokesman said: "These findings relate to people's potential to develop vCJD, not additional cases; in fact, there have been no new UK cases for nearly 2 years. We have one of the safest blood supplies in the world, but experts will consider the Health Protection Agency study, and any additional measures to reduce the potential risk of transmission through blood transfusions will be put into place."

Position Statement on occurrence of vCJD and prevalence of infection in the UK population:

Preface
----------
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a fatal human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). This is a type of neurological disorder associated with the presence of an abnormal, misfolded form of prion protein, making vCJD one of a small number of prion diseases. It almost certainly 1st spread to humans via cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease. To date, 176 patients in the UK have died from vCJD. They have typically been young, with a median age of about 28 years at onset of symptoms.

Earlier fears of large numbers of vCJD deaths have fortunately not been realised, and the number of new cases each year has been in decline for several years. However, there is evidence that many more people might be infected, while not showing any symptoms. If these people are infective, the risk of secondary (person-to-person) transmission could be greater than implied by the small number of cases seen so far. In particular, there have been concerns about the risks of vCJD being spread via blood transfusion, and possibly through the re-use of surgical instruments. A number of precautionary steps are in place to reduce these risks, though it appears impossible to eliminate them entirely. [For an overview of risk reduction measures related to blood, see http://www.transfusionguidelines.org.uk/index.aspx?Publication=DL&Section=12&pageid=794, and for surgical risk reduction measures, see http://www.dh.gov.uk/ab/ACDP/TSEguidance/index.htm.

Meanwhile, there remain great scientific uncertainties around the disease and its behaviour. A key question is how the evidence on prevalence of infection in the population is to be reconciled with the small number of symptomatic, clinical cases diagnosed. Scientific advice to the Department of Health on risk assessment is provided by the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) TSE Risk Assessment Subgroup. Prompted in part by the emergence of new evidence on the prevalence of infection, the Department requested the Subgroup to set out a brief, high-level summary of what is known and not known about the incidence and prevalence of vCJD within the UK population. The result is the following Position Statement, discussed at the Subgroup's meeting on 13 Jul 2012 and finalised through subsequent correspondence. Its aim is to make available a summary of current thinking on some key scientific issues aimed primarily at professional audiences. The intention is that this statement should be revisited and updated as appropriate as new evidence becomes available. The Subgroup will continue to provide scientific advice on the effectiveness of further precautions.

Occurrence of vCJD -- ACDP Position Statement
---------------------------------
As of July 2012, 176 patients in the UK have been found to have definite or probable clinical vCJD, and over 220 cases have been reported worldwide. As with other prion diseases, development of disease is influenced by genetic factors, in particular at position (codon) 129 of the prion protein gene. At this position, healthy individuals have the amino-acid methionine (termed methionine homozygous, or MM), valine (valine homozygous, or VV) or both amino-acids (methionine-valine heterozygous, or MV). These groups comprise approximately 40 percent, 10 percent and 50 percent of the UK population respectively. All those probable and definite vCJD patients who have been genetically tested have been MM homozygous at codon 129.

The UK vCJD patients comprise a single wave of clinical cases: numbers of known onsets peaked in 1999, and deaths and diagnoses both peaked in 2000. The most recent onset of symptoms in a UK patient was in September 2010, and there are currently no living vCJD patients in the UK.

There is strong evidence that 3 of the 176 UK patients were infected through red cell transfusions from donors who themselves went on to develop vCJD. No other secondary cases have been identified to date, but the possibility of some of the other 173 patients having been infected though person-to-person transmission cannot be ruled out. In addition, abnormal prion protein was found in spleen samples from 2 further patients who died of unrelated causes, one having had a red cell transfusion from a donor who developed vCJD and another having received fractionated plasma products partly sourced from such a donor. Though neither patient showed any symptoms of vCJD, these may well represent further transmission of infection.

There is evidence of disease amongst the other codon 129 genotypes, making it plausible that further clinical cases may appear in the remaining 60 percent of the population. One MV heterozygote patient has been classified as a possible clinical case, though the diagnosis of vCJD could not be designated as probable or definite due to insufficient evidence.

Case ascertainment can never be regarded as perfect, and some clinical cases may have been missed or misdiagnosed (perhaps amongst elderly patients). However, there is no indication of large-scale under-reporting of clinical vCJD.

Prevalence of infection
-------------------
The most recent study of prevalence of abnormal prion protein tested 32 441 appendix samples collected during surgery on patients born between 1941 and 1985. Of these, 16 samples were judged to be positive. This indicates a central prevalence estimate very close to one in 2000 in the age cohort covered, with a 95 percent confidence interval running from approximately one in 3500 to one in 1250.

The previous Hilton et al study published in 2004 tested appendix samples from a narrower cohort of patients, almost all born between 1961 and 1985. This found 3 positive samples from 11 247 tested, suggesting a central prevalence estimate of approximately one in 4000 with 95 percent confidence interval running from roughly one in 1400 to one in 20 000. Although the confidence intervals of the 2 studies overlap, the new study thus narrows the range considerably as well as providing a higher central estimate.

Abnormal prion protein has previously been found in tissue samples taken from all codon 129 genotypes rather than being confined to MM homozygotes. Two of the positive appendices from the Hilton et al survey were from VV homozygotes, while the 2 asymptomatic recipients of blood products referred to earlier were both MV heterozygotes. The new findings confirm that all genotypes are susceptible to vCJD infection.

Interpretation
-----------
The positive samples found in these prevalence surveys have been compared with samples taken from vCJD patients and from individuals with known exposure to vCJD. Unless and until there is any evidence to the contrary, positivity in these tests should be seen as indicative of vCJD infection. The recent appendix survey, therefore, provides the most reliable available indication of the prevalence of asymptomatic vCJD infection within the UK population.

There is thus an increasingly marked divergence between the estimated prevalence of vCJD infection and the observed number of clinical cases. This divergence would be even greater were the test procedure used in the survey considered to have a sensitivity significantly below 100 percent.

The observation that clinical cases have so far been confined to MM homozygotes is insufficient to explain this divergence. For example, if exposure to BSE had infected one person in 2000 in the 1941-85 birth cohort, and if all infected MMs had had incubation periods similar to those seen so far, some thousands of MM cases would already have appeared.

The working assumption is that the bulk of the infections identified by the appendix survey would have been caused by dietary exposure to BSE in cattle. The fundamental linkage to BSE can be tested by examining samples collected prior to the BSE outbreak.

Given the assumed significance of exposure to BSE, prevalence of vCJD infection should be much lower amongst those born from 1996 onward, given the measures by then in place to protect the food chain. This proposition can also be tested directly, by studying tissue samples from this post-1996 birth cohort.

Like the Hilton et al study, the new appendix survey used immunohistochemisty (IHC) to screen samples. A large scale prospective survey of tonsil samples found no positives in 95 672 tested using a high throughput enzyme immunoassay technique (Frosh et al, 2004; Clewley et al, 2009). However re-testing of 9672 samples using IHC revealed one specimen with a strongly positive follicle (de Marco et al, 2010). It is, therefore, considered that IHC provides the more reliable method of detection.

This can be illustrated by a rough calculation considering infections solely in the 1941-85 cohort. At the height of exposure to BSE, circa 1990, this cohort comprised about 30 million people, 40 percent (12 million) of them MM homozygotes. A prevalence of one in 2000 (if due to primary infection) implies that 6000 of these individuals would have been infected through BSE exposure. Collectively, they would have had life-expectancy normal for their age, so there would have been only a small number of deaths due to other causes. Had the incubation periods seen in the actual MM cases been typical of this larger MM group, most of these 6000 infections would already have appeared as clinical cases. This takes no account of additional infections in other genotypes or in other age cohorts.

The possibility of some of the positive appendix samples having arisen from secondary, person-to-person transmission cannot be excluded, but this appears relatively unlikely. These samples were typically taken from fairly young patients less likely to have received blood transfusions or to have undergone prior neurosurgery. Taken together, the evidence on prevalence of infection and clinical case numbers implies that even amongst MMs, only a minority of those infected develop clinical symptoms within about 20 years of primary infection. The remainder go into a long-term, asymptomatic state.

There may be many reasons for differences in individual response to vCJD infection, and these have yet to be fully understood. One suggestion is that cross-species transmission (as when vCJD originated from BSE), generates multiple strains of the infectious agent with different characteristics. In any case, the development of disease following infection is likely to depend on a complex interaction between the infective agent and the individual. Key factors may include the dose and route of infection, while individual characteristics affecting susceptibility to clinical disease include codon 129 genotype and possibly other genetic factors. Onset of prion disease may also be triggered, or inhibited, by other conditions. The understanding needed to disentangle the possible causal factors does not yet exist.

Whatever the reasons for infected individuals entering a long term asymptomatic state, much depends on whether this could be expected to last indefinitely or eventually lead to clinical symptoms. This is presently an open question, given the single wave of MM cases observed. The precautionary assumption is that further clinical cases may appear after much longer incubation periods than those seen so far, though their number could be significantly reduced by intervening deaths from other causes.

Moving onto the risks of secondary (person-to-person) transmission, the precautionary assumption is that presence of abnormal prion protein is indicative of vCJD infectivity, that positivity of an appendix sample implies that blood and other peripheral tissues would be infective. Those with long-term asymptomatic vCJD infection would thus be potential sources of secondary infection, in particular though donation of blood or tissues and via the re-use of surgical instruments.

It is also reasonable to assume that all those exposed to the vCJD agent by such routes would be susceptible to infection, given the detection of abnormal prion protein in all codon 129 genotypes (though the degree of susceptibility to infection and to the onset of clinical disease may well vary markedly between individuals).

Given the available evidence on key factors such as the infectivity of blood and tissues and on the efficacy of instrument decontamination and measures such as leucodepletion of blood, one would expect some hundreds of secondary infections to have occurred every year, from the mid-1990s onward. As already noted, 3 of the 176 known vCJD patients are believed to have arisen from blood-borne infection (all through transfusion of non-leucodepleted red cells prior to 1999), whilst no clinical cases have been linked to surgery.

It remains possible that a few further vCJD patients could have been infected by secondary transmission, whist the expected numbers of secondary clinical cases would be significantly reduced by the limited survival and life expectancy of patients undergoing blood transfusion or neurosurgery.

Nevertheless, the contrast between predicted numbers of infections and the appearance of clinical cases that might be attributed to secondary transmission is again striking. A number of explanations are possible, perhaps in combination. For example, infectivity in tissues may be lower than currently assumed, or appear at these levels only close to the onset of clinical symptoms. Surgery may turn out to be a relatively inefficient route of infection. Leucodepletion may have had a substantial impact on blood-borne transmission risks. Nevertheless, it remains plausible that secondary infections are occurring in significant numbers and that (as with primary infection) many infected individuals enter a long-term asymptomatic state.

As before, it is an open question as to whether or not these individuals would eventually develop symptoms or are non-susceptible to development of clinical vCJD. In either case, the precautionary assumption is that while asymptomatic, they would represent possible sources of further onward infection.

Conclusions
----------
Clearly, many scientific uncertainties remain, and it is challenging to interpret case numbers and prevalence estimates when so much remains to be known about the course of the disease and the factors that affect it.

While fundamental research into prion diseases continues, it is essential to ensure that consistent, long-term surveillance of the population continues. This should include development of methods to characterise the disease and if appropriate differentiate between strains.

Despite the welcome fall in vCJD diagnoses, the indication of relatively widespread, albeit silent, vCJD infection necessitates continued attention to the risks of secondary, person-to-person transmission, and for applied research to support the development and implementation of risk management strategies.

Gaining further information on prevalence of infection also remains a key area, especially through the investigation of tissues from groups unexposed to BSE and of the feasibility of surveying the prevalence of abnormal prion protein in blood.

[5] Iatrogenic prion disease update

Abstract:
Although Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was 1st identified in 1920, prevention of transmission raised particular concern all over the world when a new variant of the disease was 1st described in 1996. There is good evidence of iatrogenic transmission of this new variant among human beings through blood, blood components, tissues and growth hormone. Furthermore, 4 cases of iatrogenic transmission of CJD through fertility treatment with human pituitary-derived gonadotrophins have been reported.

It is important to distinguish the categories of infectivity and categories of risk, which requires consideration not only of the level of infectivity of a given tissue or fluid but also the amount of tissue/fluid to which a person is exposed, the duration of exposure, and the route by which infection is transmitted.

The potential presence and infectivity of prion proteins in human urinary gonadotrophin preparations is a matter of debate. Differences in the sensitivity of bioassay methods are of paramount importance when considering the infectivity of a tissue. Some new methods might detect small amounts of agent in some tissues currently thought to be free of infectivity.

No cases of human prion disease due to the use of urinary gonadotrophins have been recognized to date. However, the detection of prions in the urine of experimental animals and in some urine-based preparations, and the young age of fertility drug recipients, require the application of the precautionary principle to urinary preparations.

[Comment on parts [2], [3] and [4]: Great uncertainties remain about the nature of vCJD. Previously, a large scale prospective survey of tonsil samples found no positives in 95 672 tested using a high throughput enzyme immunoassay technique. The new findings from surveys of archived appendix tissue by different technology now establishes that all genotypes are susceptible to vCJD infection. There is also an increasingly marked divergence between the estimated prevalence of vCJD infection and the observed number of clinical cases.

In the 2nd national survey of abnormal prion prevalence, the estimated abnormal prion prevalence range largely overlaps that from the 1st appendix survey but is narrower with a higher central estimate (around one in 2000 compared with around one in 4000). The new survey also demonstrates the presence of abnormal prion protein across a wider birth cohort than previously estimated.

The hypothesis that the prevalence of abnormal prions found in both appendix surveys to date is linked to the epidemic of BSE in cattle in Britain can be tested directly by studying further appendix samples archived prior to the BSE outbreak and samples from those born in 1996 or later, by which time measures had been put in place to protect the food chain.

Abnormal prion protein has previously been found in tissue samples taken from all codon 129 genotypes, rather than being confined to MM homozygotes. Two of the positive appendices from the Hilton et al survey were from VV homozygotes, while the 2 asymptomatic recipients of blood products referred to earlier were both MV heterozygotes.
