Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Kosovo - WHO Update 4
----------------------------------------------------------------
For the period 18 to 19 Jun 2001, 3 new suspected cases were registered.
From 18 May 2001 to 19 Jun 2001, 57 suspected CCHF cases were registered,
of whom 4 have died. Of these 57 cases, 12 have been classified as
confirmed (10 laboratory and 2 on clinical/epidemiological grounds). In
total, 27 cases are laboratory negative and 18 further suspected cases were
still under investigation. Of the 12 confirmed cases, 5 were infected
through contact with a single case with hemorrhagic disease. The remaining
7 are likely to be primary infections (Source: Institute of Public Health,
Pristina, Kosovo).
Most of the primary infections have occurred in areas of Kosovo that have
had CCHF activity in previous years. CCHF infections are expected to
continue throughout the summer and autumn months while ticks are active.
The WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus and Haemorrhagic Fever Reference
and Research in Ljubljana, Slovenia, continues to provide support in the
field by extending the stay of their staff member. In addition the North
Manchester General Hospital, Department of Infectious Diseases, has
provided a clinician with specific expertise in hospital infection control
who is working to strengthen procedures at the isolation unit.
A 2-person WHO rapid assessment team carried out a mission to Kosovo from
12 to 15 Jun 2001. The team worked with the epidemic response committee,
the Institute for Public Health, the Clinic for Infectious Diseases and WHO
Kosovo to support the outbreak response in epidemiology, laboratory
support, case management, hospital infection control, environmental control
measures, and health education.
