[1] Japan: rules for Olympic Games
Date: Wed 3 Feb 2021

No singing, no dancing and masks at "all times" -- these are some of the measures unveiled by the organisers of the Tokyo Olympics as part of a COVID-19 plan seeking to ensure the event goes ahead in a safe way. The roll-out of the first of a series of "playbooks" on [Wed 3 Feb 2021] was aimed at assuring athletes and sports officials, and an attempt to convince the Japanese public that the Olympics should not be postponed again (https://www.olympic.org/tokyo-2020-playbooks).

Opinion polls across the country show up to 80% want the games -- which are scheduled for July [2021] -- postponed or cancelled, despite Japan having controlled the pandemic better than most countries. It has [had] fewer than 6000 deaths, but a recent surge in cases forced it to close its borders to non-resident foreigners and declare a state of emergency in some parts of the country.

"There are indeed a lot of questions in the public domain about how the games will take place this summer. And today is a preliminary review of how things will be done," Olympic Games executive director Christophe Dubi said in a video news conference with Tokyo officials.

The playbook introduced on [Wed 3 Feb 2021] is aimed at international sports federations and technical officials, with guides for athletes, broadcasters, and the media set to come in the next few days. The 32-page document deals with hygiene, testing, immigration, and states that officials will be allowed to skip quarantine as long as they monitor their health for 14 days after arriving in Japan.

It bans singing and chanting during events and mandates participants to wear masks at "all times" except when eating, sleeping or outdoors. It also requires delegations and staff to appoint a COVID-19 liaison officer, who will be responsible for ensuring the participants follow the guidelines, and advises against shopping at the airport upon arrival in Japan.

Rule breakers will face "consequences that may have an impact on participation" at the games, the guide warned, with "repeated or serious failures" potentially leading to offenders being kicked out. The rules are set to be updated in April [2021] and again in June [2021].

Pierre Ducrey, the director of Olympic Games Operations at the International Olympic Committee (IOC), told [Wed 3 Feb 2021]'s joint press briefing that the event would be a "different experience". "There will be a number of constraints and conditions that the participants will have to respect and follow, which will have an impact on their experience, particularly when it comes to social aspects," he said.

While details on rules for athletes are still being finalised, officials said they would be tested for COVID-19 at least every 4 days - in addition to being tested before leaving their country and again on arrival in Japan. A decision on the number of overall spectators that would be allowed at the events will be made by spring, they added.

The playbook roll-out comes 2 weeks after a British newspaper, citing an unnamed Japanese government official, said the Olympics would be cancelled. The IOC and Japanese organisers have pushed back for 2 weeks, and the playbooks offer some concrete plans after months of vague talks. "No matter what situation would be with the coronavirus, we will hold the games," Yoshiro Mori, the president of the Tokyo organising committee and former Japanese prime minister, told legislators on [Tue 2 Feb 2021]. "We should pass on the discussion of whether we will hold the games or not, but instead discuss how we should hold it."

Olympic officials have documented thousands of sports events that have taken place in the past 10 months - some with fans, some without - and they believe they can do the same on an Olympic scale at dozens of venues spread across a Tokyo metropolitan area of about 35 million people. "Sports events are taking place, athletes are training and competing, but we know that we are facing a huge challenge - that is to create a bubble for all athletes," Lucia Montanerella, head of IOC media operations, told a panel discussion a week ago. "One thing is to create a bubble for 200 athletes, and a very different thing is to create a bubble for thousands of athletes of different sports."

The IOC has said 60% of the qualification spots for Tokyo are filled. Of the remaining 40%, 15% will be filled by rankings, as in tennis and golf, and the remaining 25% will come from test events, if they can be held. The IOC and the Japanese government will not require "participants" to be vaccinated to enter the country. Vaccination will be voluntary, and the IOC says it will hold the games as if no vaccine were available and rely on physical distancing, masks and testing.

Japan's government approved a month long extension of its state of emergency on [Tue 2 Feb 2021], with measures now running through [Sun 7 Mar 2021] in parts of the country. Tighter border restrictions imposed after infections surged have already forced the postponement of some sporting fixtures in Japan, including this year's 1st Olympic test event, an artistic swimming qualifier that was scheduled for March [2021].

The nationwide Olympic torch relay is due to begin on [25 Mar 2021].

[Mass gatherings such as a large number of participants and particularly crowds attending sporting events likely increase risk of transmission of COVID-19. There are some sports (such as golf and time trial cycling) where social distancing is possible, and others (for example, football and rugby) where it is not practical. Travel (use of airports and hotels) can also increase risk, although this may be no different from travel on other business. If professional sports events are to be resumed in the near future, event organisers must accept that assessment of risk must be undertaken and measures put in place to ensure any risks from the event are identified and minimized.

The WHO highlights 5 key factors in determining risk :
- Will the event be held in a country that has documented active local transmission of COVID-19 (community spread)?
- Will the event be held in a single venue or multiple venues/cities/countries?
- Will the event include international participants (athletes and spectators) from countries that have documented active local transmission of COVID-19 (community spread)?
- Will the event include a significant number of participants (athletes or spectators) at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease (such as people over 65 years of age or people with underlying health conditions)?
- Will the event include sports that are considered at higher risk of spread for COVID-19 (for example, contact sports)?

WHO has an assessment tool titled 'Mass gathering risk assessment for COVID-19: addendum for sporting events' is available at; https://www.who.int/publications /i/item/10665-333187. - Mod.UBA]

[2] COVID19 associated mortality in ICU patients
Date: Mon 1 Feb 2021
Source: Anaesthesia [edited]

ref: Armstrong RA, Kane AD, Kursumovic E, et al. Mortality in patients admitted to intensive care with COVID-19: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Anaesthesia. 2021 Feb 1. doi: 10.1111/anae.15425. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33525063.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause critical illness and deaths internationally. Up to 31 May 2020, mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with COVID-19 was 41.6%. Since then, changes in therapeutics and management may have improved outcomes. Also, data from countries affected later in the pandemic are now available. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane databases up to 30 Sep 2020 for studies reporting ICU mortality among adult patients with COVID-19 and present an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. The primary outcome measure was death in intensive care as a proportion of completed ICU admissions, either through discharge from intensive care or death. We identified 52 observational studies including 43 128 patients, and 1st reports from the Middle East, South Asia, and Australasia, as well as 4 national or regional registries. Reported mortality was lower in registries compared with other reports. In two regions, mortality differed significantly from all others, being higher in the Middle East and lower in a single registry study from Australasia. Although ICU mortality (95% CI) was lower than reported in June (35.5% (31.3-39.9%) vs. 41.6% (34.0-49.7%)), the absence of patient level data prevents a definitive evaluation. A lack of standardisation of reporting prevents comparison of cohorts in terms of underlying risk, severity of illness or outcomes. We found that the decrease in ICU mortality from COVID-19 has reduced or plateaued since May 2020 and note the possibility of some geographical variation. More standardisation in reporting would improve the ability to compare outcomes from different reports.

[The management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection has been updated with multiple experimental therapies introduced at various times. Most therapeutic agents have shown limited or equivocal impact except dexamethasone and monoclonal antibodies. Data are evolving describing outcomes from COVID-19 in critically ill patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1). Mortality appears lower than that in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The mortality from COVID-19 appears driven by the presence of severe ARDS, and ranges widely, from 12 to 78 per cent with an average of 25 to 50 per cent (https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-critical-care-and-airway-management-issues).

Mortality may be decreasing as the pandemic progresses; In an analysis of patients during a resurgence of COVID-19 in Houston, Texas, in-hospital mortality was lower during the 2nd surge compared to the 1st surge (5 versus 12 per cent) but the difference in ICU mortality was not significant (23 versus 28 per cent) (2). In another French cohort of over 4000 critically-ill patients, mortality also decreased from 42 to 25 per cent over a 4-month period during the pandemic (3). In a United States analysis of 468 patients with COVID-19-related critical illness from 1 Mar 2020 to 11 May 2020, the mortality decreased from 44 to 19 per cent (4). The observed reduction in mortality could be reflective of many factors; a patient population that is younger and has a lower comorbidity burden during the 2nd surge, reduced burden of institutions, and/or growing expertise with COVID-19 care and management.]

Abstract
--------
Epidemic models do not account for the effects of climate conditions on the transmission dynamics of viruses. This study presents the vital relationship between weather seasonality, airborne virus transmission, and pandemic outbreaks over a whole year. Using the data obtained from high-fidelity multi-phase, fluid dynamics simulations, we calculate the concentration rate of Coronavirus particles in contaminated saliva droplets and use it to derive a new Airborne Infection Rate (AIR) index. Combining the simplest form of an epidemiological model, the susceptible-infected-recovered, and the AIR index, we show through data evidence how weather seasonality induces two outbreaks per year, as it is observed with the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. We present the results for the number of cases and transmission rates for three cities, New York, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro. The results suggest that two pandemic outbreaks per year are inevitable because they are directly linked to what we call weather seasonality. The pandemic outbreaks are associated with changes in temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed independently of the particular season. We propose that epidemiological models must incorporate climate effects through the AIR index.

[ProMED thanks Roland Hübner for this contribution. Many infectious diseases present an environmental pattern in their occurrence. Environmental factors, such as climate and weather condition, could drive the space and time correlations of infectious diseases, including influenza. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through large droplets or direct contact with secretions (or fomites). Several factors affect the transmission of disease, which include host, virus, and environmental factors. The stability of the virus is affected by meteorological conditions such as humidity, wind speed, and temperature. There is emerging literature regarding the environmental pattern in COVID-19 incidence.

A recent study by Pahuja and colleagues in India concluded that increasing ambient temperature is associated with decreased infectivity, in terms of reduction in basic reproduction number and increase in doubling time. Humidity and wind speed did not affect infectivity of COVID-19 significantly. (https://journals.lww.com/joem/Fulltext/2021/01000/Weather_Parameters_and_COVID_19__A_Correlational.10.aspx).

A systematic review by Briz-Redon and colleagues concluded that "governments should remain vigilant and maintain the restrictions in force against the pandemic rather than assume that warm weather and ultraviolet exposure will naturally reduce COVID-19 transmission" (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0309133320946302). More data are required to fully understand the impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 transmission. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (123 110), Brazil (53 164), Spain (31 596), and France (26 362) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 14 642 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 2 Feb 2021 to late 3 Feb 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Spain, France, UK (19 202), Russia (16 464), Peru (15 621), Italy (13 182), India (12 917), Germany (12 546), Indonesia (11 984), and Colombia (11 025). A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 28 of the 56 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 16.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 8.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 15.8% decrease in daily reported cases and a 6.3% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases just over 500 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 104.88 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.27 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.UBA]
