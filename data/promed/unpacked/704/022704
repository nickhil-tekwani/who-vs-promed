At least 25 cattle have died, and 3 people are being treated for anthrax due to an outbreak of the bacterial disease in the Zhukwe area in Gwanda, Zimbabwe, according to a Bulawayo 24 report Friday [3 Oct 2014].

The Department of Veterinary Services provincial officer Enart Mdlongwa said they have since quarantined the affected area and vaccinated animals against anthrax, adding that the situation is now under control. Officials warn the public about eating meat from sick cows as they may have anthrax.

The recent anthrax outbreak that hit Zhukwe area in Gwanda killing at least 25 cattle left about 3 people under medical care, the state broadcaster ZBC reported today [3 Oct 2014].

The Department of Veterinary Services provincial officer Enart Mdlongwa said they have since quarantined the affected area and vaccinated animals against anthrax, adding that the situation is now under control.

Chief Mbiko Masuku of Matshetshe bemoaned the continued loss of livestock due to drought and diseases and encouraged farmers to look after their animals well by vaccinating them against diseases.

Reports state that the area was last hit by an anthrax outbreak 42 years ago, hence most villagers did not understand the health hazards of eating meat infected with anthrax.

The veterinary official also warned people against eating infected meat saying those exposed to anthrax should look out for symptoms which include headaches, fever and skin lesions. Anthrax can be fatal to both people and livestock, and humans contract it through eating meat from animals that succumb to the disease.

Matabeleland South is not a major generator of anthrax reports in Zimbabwe. Checking my records, it had 5 bovine outbreaks in 1995, and one in 2007. This part of the province has been without reported cases for 42 years, apparently, but unless these cattle were fed contaminated dairy feed -- from the photograph they are a bunch of pregnant heifers -- the spores had to be on the farm already in order to be a source. 42 years without outbreak soil recontamination is not very persuasive. It is more frequently reported in Matabeleland North. - Mod.MHJ
