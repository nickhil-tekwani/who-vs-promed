European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N8) in Germany -- 13 Nov 2014. Stockholm: ECDC; 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Main conclusions and recommendations
------------------------------------
On 6 Nov 2014, German authorities reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H5N8) at a turkey holding. Culling of the turkeys at the affected holding has started, protection and surveillance zones have been established, and investigations initiated to establish how the birds became infected.

This virus has been detected among wild birds in south-east Asia where it has also caused several outbreaks on commercial poultry farms in South Korea and China. However, this is the 1st time it has been detected in Europe. It remains unclear how this virus was introduced into a turkey flock at a German holding.

The public health threat from this event is considered very low. To date, no human infections with this virus have ever been reported world-wide and the risk for zoonotic transmission to the general public in the EU/EEA countries is considered to be extremely low. The ability of this highly pathogenic avian influenza virus to sub-clinically infect wild birds increases the risk of geographical spread and subsequent outbreaks, as observed in South Korea. The ongoing monitoring and testing of wild birds and domestic poultry in the EU therefore plays an important role in the possible detection of further virus occurrences.

In order to prevent virus spread the Directive 2005/94/EC requires that member states have contingency plans detailing measures for the killing and safe disposal of infected poultry, feed and contaminated equipment as well as the procedures and methods for cleaning and disinfection. Persons at risk are mainly people in direct contact/handling diseased turkeys and other poultry, or their carcasses (for example: farmers, veterinarians and those labourers involved in the culling). It is further required that contingency plans for the control of avian influenza in poultry and birds be developed in collaboration with public health authorities to foresee that persons at risk are sufficiently protected from infection.

Poultry workers exposed at the affected holding should be monitored for 10 days in order to document possible related symptoms. Local health authorities may consider actively monitoring these groups.

[The route by which this HPAI H5N8 virus strain has been introduced into Germany remains unclear. In case its genotype is found similar to the south east Asian strains, migrating birds become plausible candidates for further studies addressing their possible role as transmitters. ProMED-mail post 20141106.2934925 included the following query: "Is this time of the year characterized by bird migration into the area? In case affirmative, which species and from where?" This request for information remains pending.

On 11 Nov 2014, a media source informed that "German researchers said on Monday [10 Nov 2014] that according to the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI), the virus found in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern appeared related to a H5N8 strain discovered in South Korea" (see http://www.gulf-times.com/uk-europe/183/details/415938/german-bird-flu-linked-to-korean-strain). So far, we have not been able to detect a confirmation of the said information -- in particular, a mention of genotyping -- elsewhere.

The information currently available on the website of FLI says that "scientists from the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) participate in the studies into the origin of this outbreak". It further describes the situation in China, Japan and South Korea, underlining the major proportions the epizootic had, since January 2014, in South Korea, affecting chickens, ducks and geese and causing high mortality. It further mentioned that various species of wild birds, especially Baikal ducks, were encountered in South Korea in the wake of these outbreaks with H5N8 infection (see the original, in German, at http://www.fli.bund.de/de/startseite/startseite/startseite/gefluegelpest-in-mecklenburg-vorpommern.html). - Mod.AS
