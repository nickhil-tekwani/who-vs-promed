Newcastle disease in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on 19 Oct 2005 from Dr. Sloboden Cokrevski,
Chief Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water
Economy, Skopje:
Report date: 19 Oct 2005.
One outbreak of Newcastle disease was reported in the village of
Mogila, Bitola.
Reason for immediate notification: re-occurrence of a listed disease
in a country following a report declaring the outbreak(s) ended.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 18 Oct 2005.
Date of start of the event: 14 Oct 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory
(serological test for Newcastle disease virus antibody detection
carried out at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary
Institute, Skopje).
Number of susceptible animals in the outbreak: 15 000 (poultry kept
extensively in the village).
Number of deaths: 450.
Number of animals destroyed: 5500 birds have been destroyed to date.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken:
- it was ordered that the whole poultry flock in the village be
destroyed; killing and destruction of all poultry in the village will
continue in the next days;
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- compulsory vaccination against Newcastle disease was prescribed in
the whole country;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishments.
Other details/comments:
As part of the increased danger of avian influenza (AI) outbreaks,
and in relation to the time period, which poses greater danger of
introducing AI virus via migratory birds, as well as for differential
diagnosis, all sera were tested with an antibody test kit for AI
virus strains H7N2, H1N7, H7N3, H13N6, H5N9, H11N6, H3N8, H9N2, H5N2,
H4N8, H10N7, H2N2, H8N4, H14N5, H6N5 and H12N5. One serum gave a
positive result to the serological test.
Immediate control measures were applied in the field in accordance
with draft European Union Council Directive No. CNS/2005/0062,
replacing Council Directive No. 92/40/EEC.
Samples will be sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory for AI, VLA
Weybridge, United Kingdom for confirmation. In the meantime, the
control measures imposed remain in force.

[It is good to see such vigilance and awareness of the possibility
that this is avian influenza. The United States Animal Health
Association "gray book" on foreign animal diseases emphasizes this
possibility by indicating that "highly pathogenic avian influenza is
easily confused with VVND [Viscerotropic Velogenic Newcastle
Disease], because the disease signs and postmortem lesions are
similar." (This book is dedicated to Chuck Mebus, who taught so many
people at Plum Island. As the introduction states, he is indeed a
gentleman and a scholar.) Moreover, this disease is well known in the
region, with Macedonia reporting 2 outbreaks in 2004 and 9 in 2003.
Other countries in the region have had Newcastle recently. For
example, last year [2004], Greece and Albania reported one outbreak,
Cyprus 2, and Russia had 12, while Serbia and Montenegro had 16
outbreaks in 2002. Thus, an outbreak of Newcastle (NCD or END) is not
unexpected in this region, and in fact, this report is cited as a
reoccurrence of a disease that was previous occurring but "thought to
be ended" in this report.
However, given what is going on in the region and a single
serological positive out of all of those tests, it is good that the
animal health authorities are being cautious and sending the serum to
the World Reference Laboratory. I just hope the WRL can cope with so
many requests in such a short time. Clearly, their work is critical
and very much appreciated by everyone involved. We will keep you
posted. - Mod.PC]
