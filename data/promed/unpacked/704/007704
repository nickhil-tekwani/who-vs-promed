The deaths of 4 persons from fever in Gothri village of Alwar [a city and the administrative headquarters of Alwar district in Rajasthan state] have put the health authorities on alert. A team of doctors was sent to the affected area to find out the cause of deaths and the kind of fever they were suffering from.

Over the past week, 4 persons, including 3 children, have died of the fever in Gothri village.

Alwar's chief medical health officer Dr RK Meena said: "We have constituted a team of doctors, which is investigating the matter." Dr Meena said that the cause of the deaths is yet to be ascertained, as the report of the doctors is awaited.

According to the sources, children aged 7 years, 7 months and 4 years were among the patients who died of fever.

The doctors are busy finding the cause of deaths, as at least 8 more patients are suffering from similar symptoms, including fever and throat pain, the sources said. Some of the patients were undergoing treatment at different hospitals in the area; 2 of them were referred to Jaipur.

The team of doctors will interact with the doctors of hospitals where the patients are undergoing the treatment. A doctor in the team said that they were still in the village till late on Saturday [25 Oct 2014] evening. He said that they will check details including the diagnostic tests conducted on them, their admit tickets and discharge tickets. He said that they will check the history of patients to know more about the fever. The patients are suffering from fever and throat pain, which are symptoms of various diseases.

It is to be mentioned that it was Alwar where the 1st cases of scrub typhus were reported from the state.

[The news report says there are 12 patients with an undiagnosed febrile illness, including 4 deaths in Alwar, Rajasthan; 3 of the deaths occurred in children. There have been several ProMED-mail posts on the occurrence of scrub typhus in Rajasthan in the past 2 months. However, patients in the current outbreak were said in the news report above to have sore throats in addition to fever, and sore throat is not a prominent symptom of scrub typhus. For a discussion of scrub typhus, see prior ProMED-mail post: Scrub typhus - India (04): (RJ) fatal, update 20141001.2821553.

The description of the current undiagnosed febrile illness in Alwar is too vague to venture a differential diagnosis. A ProMED-mail post in May 2014 reported that Alwar is one of 2 districts reporting the highest number of cases of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in Rajasthan (Febrile illnesses - India: (RJ) 20140511.2461722). More information on this outbreak in Alwar from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.
