A case of vesicular stomatitis (VS) has been confirmed in a horse in Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA). State Veterinarian Dr. Dennis Hughes said today [11 Sep 2015] that the horse and other livestock on the farm have been placed under quarantine.

VS is a viral disease which primarily affects horses and cattle, but can also affect sheep, goats and swine. The virus that causes VS, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), typically harbors in southern Mexico in the winter months and periodically moves north into the United States. At this time, VSV has affected horses and cattle in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota. In affected livestock, VSV causes blister-like lesions to form in the mouth and on the dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves and teats. As a result of the lesions, infected animals may refuse to eat and drink, which leads to severe weight loss.

Hughes is urging producers with animals that might be experiencing these signs to contact their veterinarian immediately.

"Vesicular stomatitis is typically transmitted in 2 primary ways, biting insects and midges, and nose-to-nose contact between a non-infected and infected animal," said Dr. Hughes. "The best ways to reduce the chance of VS infection are to reduce the population of flies, mosquitoes and other biting insects as much as possible and to isolate infected animals from uninfected animals."

In recent months, there have been several reported cases of VS confirmed in areas of Wyoming, Colorado and South Dakota that border the Nebraska Panhandle. Nebraska's last confirmed cases of VS were last Novembe [2014] in 2 cows in Wheeler County. Nebraska's last major outbreak of the disease was in 2005. According to Hughes, the positive diagnosis might trigger animal import regulations in other states. Producers moving livestock from Nebraska into another state are encouraged to contact the state veterinarian's office in the state of destination to learn about specific import requirements.

Hughes said that due to the VS finding, he and officials for the AKSARBEN Stock Show and Rodeo, scheduled for 24 -27 Sep 2015 in Omaha, have agreed to put in place new requirements for horse and cattle exhibitors. Horses arriving at the show from anywhere within Nebraska will need to have seen a veterinarian within 48 hours. The 48-hour rule also will apply to any cattle coming to the show from the Nebraska Panhandle counties. These counties include Banner, Box Butte, Cheyenne, Dawes, Deuel, Garden, Kimball, Morrill, Scotts Bluff, Sheridan and Sioux.

Hughes is encouraging managers of other upcoming horse and cattle exhibitions or shows in the state to consider enacting similar requirements.

"Until the weather gets cold, eliminating transmission vectors like flies and mosquitoes, there is still a chance that we could see a spread of the disease," Hughes said. "Requiring a health check within 2 days before shows where animals comingle will help protect against such spread."

[Owners should remember:
- Strict fly control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of the disease.
- Avoid transferring feeding equipment, cleaning tools, or health care equipment from other herds.

How vesicular stomatitis spreads is not fully known; insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and movement of animals are all factors. Once the disease is introduced into a herd, it may move from animal to animal by contact or exposure to saliva or fluid from ruptured vesicles. Humans rarely contract vesicular stomatitis, but they can become infected.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. Humans can also become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. Vesicular stomatitis has been confirmed only in the western hemisphere. It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, but outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically.

In people, the disease causes an acute influenza-like illness with symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache, and malaise. To avoid exposure to this disease, individuals should use personal protective measures when handling affected animals.
