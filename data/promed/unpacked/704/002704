Ebola haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak in Uganda - WHO Update 4
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported 122 cases and 47 deaths. As
reported to WHO on 16 Oct 2000 by the WHO Collaborating Centre, the National
Institute for Virology (NIV) in South Africa, test results had confirmed
that Ebola virus was cause of the disease. NIV has now characterized the
virus strain as similar to, but not identical to Ebola-Sudan.
The Ebola-Sudan strain [subtype of Ebola virus was associated with a
case-fatality rate of between 50-70% in disease outbreaks in southern Sudan
in 1976 and 1979. This strain [subtype appears to be somewhat less virulent
than the Ebola-Zaire strain [subtype, which has caused epidemics in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), and Gabon with a
case-fatality rate of between 70-90%.
Both Ebola strains [subtypes and the [less closely-related Marburg virus
are found in the central region of Africa. While this is the first
recognized outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) in Uganda, it is
possible that the strain from the present outbreak has been in Uganda for
some time.
Infection control and case management in Gulu district are continuing. A
Community Alert System has been established for actively seeking cases and
tracing contacts. Health education messages are also being widely
disseminated and public health awareness about EHF has greatly increased in
the community. Mobile teams of epidemiologists and trained health care
workers are investigating all suspected cases reported to the Operations
Centre in Gulu and are transporting persons who meet the case definition for
the disease to one of the two hospital isolation units. These mobile teams
are also tracing contacts of cases. Control efforts are progressing well. At
present, the measures taken in the hospital isolation wards make it unlikely
that any virus transmission will occur in this setting. Many of the sick
persons and their contacts in the community have been identified and are
receiving appropriate care. However, new cases are likely to occur in
persons who may have been infected but who have not yet become ill, and who
have not yet been identified by public health authorities.
