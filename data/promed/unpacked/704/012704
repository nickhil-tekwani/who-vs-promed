Anthrax cases at Hook Lake
--------------------------
I have just spoken with Brett Elkins in Yellowknife who tells me that last
week they discovered 11 dead bison in the Hook Lake area, just north of the
Wood Bison National Park. This was on the last surveillance flight of the
season. But these bison had been dead for some 2-4 weeks -- that is, since
the beginning of August. The area was carefully re-searched using heat
seeking sensors to find any further carcasses but without success. Samples
have been sent to the Lethbridge laboratory but they do not expect
confirmation for a few days. If confirmed, as is expected, this will be the
first time that anthrax has been confirmed at Hook Lake since 1978.
This season the Hook Lake area had been overflown regularly using
helicopters but without seeing any cases. These cases were missed in
previous flights this month, which goes to confirm suspicions that the
disease can be readily missed in this area. In this instance a couple of
bison carcasses were in under the trees but the rest were in plain view.
For example, in the past, maternal antibodies have been found in young
bison calves from around Hook Lake captured for hand rearing at Fort
Resolution and in the absence of overt cases. If these experienced wildlife
experts can miss a dead wood bison (larger than a mature cart horse), we
shouldn't feel so bad when we miss dead white-tailed deer, which are about
the size of a large dog.
These 2500 lbs carcasses were burnt using napalm. It was found to be
advantageous to add some timber as this extended the burn time by a few
hours and reduced the carcasses more efficiently than just using napalm.
But it was still markedly more efficient than just using timber.
