RABIES (21): ASIA (NEPAL) DOG, HUMAN

On 12 May 2022, a 27 year old unmarried woman was admitted to Sukraraj Tropical & Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) with a history of painful arm, aerophobia, and hydrophobia. She had been bitten on her right palm by her pet puppy a month ago [April 2022]. According to her brother, the puppy was adopted (stray dog) a couple of months [before] and had been living with their family. The puppy died 5 days after the bite, but after falling into a water tank. Thus, a veterinary doctor did not suspect any infection, particularly rabies, as a cause of death, and even suggested against rabies vaccination. [The woman] consistently refused to get vaccinated, despite her brother's suggestion. She died of rabies complications 2 days after admission (on 14 May 2022).

In this case, it seems that the patient believed or was influenced by her veterinarian's suggestion, although a laboratory test was not performed (from deceased dog) to rule out rabies virus. Thus, careful counseling and suggestion (from a veterinarian) is essential in order to avoid death from this vaccine-preventable disease, especially where burden of rabies is high (or in rabies-endemic areas/districts).

Nepal has committed to end dog-mediated rabies by the year 2030. Despite this commitment, it is, however, unfortunate that the number of human deaths from rabies has not decreased, but instead has increased gradually over the years. In the past 6 months, nearly a dozen patients have died of rabies at STIDH (2 deaths per month), which shows that between 2015 and 2022, rabies cases rose by nearly 100% (when compared to the same time period) [see ProMED post 20150323.3249257]. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy need to be identified and addressed simultaneously to achieve the 2030 dog-mediated rabies elimination goal in Nepal.

[Dr Pun informed us of this case using the ProMED-mail "submit info" form; the tag is on the main ProMED page at http://www.promedmail.org. We are very grateful to him for this report.

This tragic case should serve as reminder of the crucial piece of information: stray puppies, including the ones that look sad and needy, in rabies-endemic countries are notoriously known to be a common source of human infection, particularly of children. Dogs can get infected from their earliest age if their mothers were not vaccinated, threatening the life of contacts. The serious hazard of rabies in puppies, including those brought home from vacations, has been repeatedly addressed in ProMED's postings; 3 of many examples are included in the 'see also' list below (20210921.8691951, 20181027.6115565, 20171001.5351923).

Rabies in puppies may, at times, lead to a large number of human exposures combined with delayed recognition, with potentially fatal outcomes. Do keep in mind that the clinical signs in puppies may be easily missed. This is due to atypical disease signs or even their absence during the initial stages of the disease, while the animal is already infective. Collecting stray puppies may pose a life-endangering threat, in particular for children who commonly deal with them.

If you find a stray animal you are not familiar with, approach it only if it is safe to do so and absolutely necessary. In the event of being bitten or scratched, immediately wash the area very well using soap, flush under running water, and immediately seek medical attention.- Mod.AS
