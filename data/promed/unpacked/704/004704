The Public Health Ministry yesterday [17 Mar 2008] declared tularemia an
emerging disease in Thailand after its 1st victim was diagnosed in Prachuap
Khiri Khan. Disease Control Department director-general Thawat Sundarachan
said a 37 year old woman who suffered from cancer was Thailand's 1st
tularemia, or rabbit fever, fatality. Tularemia is a disease borne by
rodents and rabbits, and is endemic in North America and Europe.

Dr Thawat said the woman, whose name was withheld, had kept a number of
rabbits in her house and could have been infected by _Francisella
tularensis_, the bacterium that causes the disease, probably through an
aerosol of body secretions from her infected pets. Dr Thawat dismissed
concerns about an outbreak, saying that there is no threat of
human-to-human transmission and that relatives of the dead, who live under
the same roof, should not worry. Cancer might have made the woman too weak
to fight the disease, he said.

The ministry is waiting for the results of another lab test from the USA to
see if the rabbit fever is of strains A or B which are more dangerous. The
results are expected in 2 weeks.

The chief of the public health office in Prachuap Khiri Khan, Pipop
Janesuthivejjakul, appeared unshaken by the news of the disease. He said
the public should not panic over the news of the woman's death which took
place in Kui Buri district last October [2007]. The provincial office knew
of no other victims in the country.

Tularemia killed a woman in Thailand, marking the country's 1st reported
case of the disease. The 37 year old from Prachuap Kiri Khan province,
about 320 kilometers (200 miles) south of Bangkok, died late last month
[Feb 2008] and the cause of her death was confirmed by laboratory tests in
the USA, said an official at the Public Health Ministry today. Tularemia,
also known as rabbit fever, is caused by a bacterium found in animals,
especially rabbits and hares, and is treated with antibiotics.

Tularemia is endemic in many parts of the world, including North America,
Eastern Europe, China, Japan and Scandinavia, according to the World Health
Organization in Geneva. Tularemia can be contracted through the bite of an
infected tick, deerfly, or other insect, handling infected animal carcasses
or through inhaling the bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. It's not known to spread from person to
person.

[More information is needed about this case, including whether these were
locally bred rabbits or imported from an endemic area. Tularemia pneumonia
can be fatal if not recognized quickly. Although tularemia is a category A
bioterrorism disease which can be transmitted with a low inoculum of
organisms and unlike plague pneumonia, the disease does not seem to spread
from person to person. One post says the case occurred in October 2007 and
the other in February 2008. Likewise, one post says it is the 1st fatality
due to tularemia in Thailand (implying that other cases have occurred) and
the other post says it is the 1st case.

Thailand's Prachuap Kiri Khan province is located on the Kra Isthmus, the
narrow land bridge connecting the Malay Peninsula with mainland Asia. It
