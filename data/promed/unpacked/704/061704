A confirmed positive avian influenza (AI) serotype H5N8 was found in a wild gadwall in Butte County, California. The pathogenicity of the AI strain is still being confirmed, but [according to] the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) report it is consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The bird was collected as a part of enhanced surveillance by USDA Wildlife Services and is not a surprise due to given migratory patterns. This particular strain is not considered a public health threat and has not been found in commercial poultry.

Increased biosecurity and keeping birds housed away from open water sources that attract wild waterfowl is advised during this time. If you observe signs of illness or increased mortality, please call your private veterinarian.

A wild duck in Butte County in northern California has tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, adding to a string of unprecedented West Coast bird flu cases.

The US Department of Agriculture on [Wed 7 Jan 2015] confirmed that a hunter-shot duck in Butte County was infected with highly pathogenic H5N8. The USDA detected the virus on [31 Dec 2014], but didn't make an announcement until [Wed 7 Jan 2015].

The wild duck was found as part of the USDA's increased surveillance on the West Coast and increased outreach to backyard poultry enthusiasts, according to the USDA.

Highly pathogenic bird flu had never been detected in California, Oregon, and Washington until the past month [December 2014].

Low pathogenic bird flu was found last spring [2014] on a quail farm in Stanislaus County in central California. China still restricts all poultry and poultry products from birds slaughtered, processed, and shipped from California.

Unlike British Columbia, Canada, where some 245 600 birds were culled at 11 poultry farms between 1-17 Dec 2014, highly pathogenic bird flu has not been found in US commercial poultry.

The virus in wild birds and backyard flocks in Washington and Oregon has still meant export restrictions for the US poultry industry.

"It's possible every additional finding prolongs the situation," USA Poultry and Egg Export Council President Jim Sumner said [Wed 7 Jan 2015].

Some countries, such as South Korea and South Africa, have imposed bans on all US poultry. The USDA says those bans are unwarranted.

Many countries have limited their bans to poultry and poultry products from Washington and Oregon.

Federal and state officials [Tue 6 Jan 2015] euthanized approximately 500 birds in a backyard flock in Benton County in south-central Washington. The flock had been exposed to highly pathogenic H5N2 bird flu by domestic ducks moved from another flock 9 miles [14.5 km] away. The 140 ducks, chickens and turkeys in that flock were euthanized [Mon 5 Jan 2015], according to the Washington Department of Agriculture. Also in Whatcom County, Washington, a wild duck and a captive gyrfalcon fed wild duck were infected with highly pathogenic bird flu in December [2014]. Also that month, highly pathogenic bird flu broke out among a 100-bird flock of guinea fowl and chickens in Douglas County, Oregon.

Officials suspect migratory waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway are carrying the disease. Highly pathogenic bird flu cases also have been reported in Asia and Europe within the past 2 months.

No human cases of the viruses have been reported, according to the USDA.

The several strains of avian influenza may well have come from the migratory pathways, as the sequencing of the viruses appear to be the same as some of the strains in other countries.

Officials are clearly hoping to safeguard commercial flocks by attempting to contain the virus to wild fowl and by eliminating any spread from the back yard flocks by the euthanasia of infected birds. - Mod.TG]
