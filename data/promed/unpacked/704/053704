"Mad cow disease" in Italy: now 41 cases
----------------------------------------
ROME, 28 Nov 2001. The 41th [case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) has been detected [in Italy -- for the first time in an animal
slaughtered in Italy's southern region of Campania, a local livestock
research institute in Italy said on Wednesday.
The institute stressed that, although the animal was slaughtered near
Caserta, it came from a farm in Vicenza in the north. It said tests on the
5 year old animal's brain tissue at the national BSE research lab in Turin
had confirmed preliminary BSE-positive findings. The managers of the
institute, Domenico Fenizia and Antonio Limone, said: "This episode
demonstrates the rigor of our testing procedures, and we can say without
doubt that Campania livestock is so far free from BSE."
The Italian Health Ministry later confirmed that a total of 41 cases of BSE
had now been detected in Italy since it launched its testing program for
the disease in January, in compliance with European Union regulations.
Almost 400 000 BSE tests have been carried out so far .
The Italian government recently lowered the mandatory testing age for
cattle from 30 months to 24.
