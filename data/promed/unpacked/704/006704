Hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Northern Uganda not yet contained
---------------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of hemorrhagic fever is centered on the northern town of Gulu.
Ugandan health authorities are battling to contain an outbreak [suspected
to be caused by the deadly Ebola virus which has killed at least 31 people
in the north of the country. The highly contagious disease, which broke out
in the district of Gulu, causes its victims to bleed to death. A further 57
people are known to have contracted the disease but doctors fear that many
in remoter villages may have died before they could get medical help.
Efforts to tackle the outbreak have been hampered by the lack of adequate
medical facilities, and the effects of a rebel activity in the region. The
government and the World Health Organization have sent fact-finding
missions to Gulu to investigate the outbreak, but so far have given little
practical help. Symptoms of the mystery illness include fever, muscle pains
and bleeding from the mouth, nose and anus.
This is the first recorded [suspected Ebola outbreak in Uganda and medical
officials say they do not yet know how the disease reached Gulu. But there
has been intense speculation in the local press that the virus could have
been passed by Ugandan soldiers who have recently returned from postings in
the Democratic Republic of Congo. One of the first victims, who died on 17
Sep 2000, was reported to be a soldier who had recently returned from such
a posting. Days later, a woman bled to death after giving birth in a
hospital in Gulu. During the following weeks, 7 of her family and friends
who attended her burial service were also dead. Doctors believe they could
have contracted the disease after washing their hands in the same water at
her funeral. So far 10 people have died in hospital, including 3 nurses
treating the sick. The other victims have succumbed in their villages
before they could get to medical help. New arrivals continue to arrive at
Gulu's 2 hospitals with 5 more people admitted on Saturday alone. Hospital
staff are struggling to deal with the outbreak, but lack basic necessities
like adequate protective clothing. The situation is made worse by the fact
that Gulu is at the heart of a 12-year insurgency by rebels based in
neighboring Sudan.

[The Ugandan authorities have designated this outbreak of acute hemorrhagic
fever as Ebola fever. However, as yet there has been no official
confirmation of the identity of the agent responsible. In fact, the recent
outbreak of acute hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, suggested in this report as the possible source of the outbreak, has
been attributed to Marburg virus infection. Marburg virus and Ebola virus
are genetically and antigenically distinct members of the family
_Filoviridae_. - Mod.CP
