The president of the Yaracuy [State] Fruit Growers Association stated that only 5% of the 35 000 hectares planted with citrus in Venezuela continued to exist. The massive reduction in citrus cultivation was due to Huanglongbing, also known as citrus greening. The bacterium is transmitted by the _Diaphorina citri_ vector insect. The plantations that haven't been affected are in colder areas, such as Merida, Tachira and Zulia [states].

He insisted that they must control the vector insect to stop the contagion. "There was a struggle to enact the legal framework on which to act, but no measures were implemented. The trend is that [processing] industries are going to disappear," he said.

[Greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas; Asian greening; huanglongbing), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening) or americanus (South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods. Several phytoplasma species have been reported to cause symptoms similar to greening disease in citrus and coinfections of phytoplasmas with CaLas have also been recorded (see ProMED-mail posts 20180214.5629251, 20190329.6392077). Further research is needed on symptomatology, epidemiology and host impact of both single and mixed infections of these pathogens.

Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves, as well as small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit. The diseases are restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both pathogens and vectors can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, as well as chemical or biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting with non-host crops, is being trialled. In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of greening outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

Antibiotics as leaf sprays, seed treatments or trunk injections are being used occasionally to treat citrus greening (see for example, ProMED-mail posts 20181119.6154764, 20190320.6377319), but are subject to strict regulations in most countries due to their associated risks of facilitating the emergence of antibiotic resistances in other crop, animal and human pathogens. Furthermore, beneficial soil microbes may be killed off as collateral damage, making the plants weaker and more susceptible to other diseases. Residues of antibiotics may also lead to rejection of exported produce by some countries.

The observation stated above that citrus in colder areas has been less affected, may possibly be due to vector insects being less active in colder temperatures or that numbers remain lower because they can't overwinter there and must invade these areas again every season. Further research may be needed to clarify this.
