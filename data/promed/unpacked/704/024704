FMD strain in Kyrgyzstan infects vaccinated livestock
-----------------------------------------------------
A new strain of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] poses a serious threat to the livestock industry in Kyrgyzstan as a significant number of livestock have already been infected.

The unknown strain of FMD discovered in the republic of Kyrgyzstan, bordering the northwest side of China, even infects vaccinated cattle.

According to Global Meat News, farmers affected by the disease are searching for a way to treat their animals. Minister Ravshan Jeenbekov has called for the government to address the issue and purchase a new vaccine for the animals.

Surrounding countries are worried the disease could invade their herds. Samples of the new strain of FMD have been sent to Russia to determine a solution. Preliminary data show the FMD outbreak led to deaths of 3000 to 4000 cows in Kyrgyzstan this year [2012].

[According to the recent annual OIE report from Kyrgyzstan, during 2011, FMD serotypes A and O were present in the country, causing 66 outbreaks in bovines (5839 cases, number of susceptible animals 134 593). No outbreaks in sheep/goats were reported. Mass routine vaccinations were applied in 1 739 300 cattle and 1 153 100 sheep/goats. "Ring vaccinations" (carried out around new outbreak sites) were applied in 732 752 cattle. FMD control measures in Kyrgyzstan (where FMD is endemic), do not include stamping out. Available information on the FMD strains currently circulating in Kyrgyzstan and on the vaccine strains applied will be appreciated.

No samples are known to have reached the WRLFMD at Pirbright since 2007; consequently, no recent genotyping results from the circulating strains are available (WRLFMD is exemplary transparent). In case samples have been submitted to the regional FMD reference laboratory (FGI All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health, 60091 Yu'evets, Vladimir, Russian Federation), available details, and particularly results of serotyping and genotyping of the Kyrgyz strains, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
