Pests and diseases continue to threaten the sustainable production of cassava in Southeast Asia, and extreme changes in the climate set a favorable condition for them to thrive and spread more aggressively.

Serious attention needs to be focused particularly on cassava witches' broom disease in Cambodia, where hundreds of hectares of crops have been devastated, affecting millions of farmers in the region. Disease symptoms of the cassava witches' broom and the cassava mealybug have infested at least 67 per cent and 70 per cent of fields, respectively.

The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) assessed 430 sites across the region. A number of pests and diseases have been plaguing cassava in the Philippines, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand [see link to survey below].

Dr Ignazio Graziosi, CIAT, said: "Increased climate variability, intensification of cropping systems, and poor crop management are aggravating disease outbreaks, as well as the crop's ability to withstand emerging threats."

[Two phytoplasmas have been reported to be associated with witches' broom disease of cassava (CWBD) in different areas: in South East Asia, cassava witches' broom phytoplasma (synonym cassava phyllody phytoplasma; _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris group 16SrI); and in Brazil a phytoplasma of the 16SrIII-B (X-disease) group, which also contains the cassava frogskin pathogen from the southern Americas (see ProMED-mail post 20071130.3864).

Symptoms may include excessive proliferation of branches ('witches' brooms'), small leaves, shortened internodes, purple discolouration of 'brooms', stem oozing, stunting, and loss of plant vigour. Characteristically, shoot distortion or leaf chlorosis are not normally observed. Tubers are reduced in size with rough textured skin and brown streaks in the flesh. The disease can seriously affect starch content of tubers. Total crop losses have been reported as well as up to 30 per cent reduction in starch content of harvestable roots. CWBD also leads to loss of planting material. Disease development is favoured by moderate temperatures, symptoms become less obvious or even disappear at higher temperatures.

CWBD is mainly spread by vegetative propagation of the crop, and mechanical transmission (for example with agricultural tools) has also been reported. No insect vectors have been identified so far, but research on CWBD epidemiology is continuing. Disease management relies on the use of certified clean planting material. Thermotherapy followed by meristem tip culture may be used to obtain phytoplasma-free tissue culture lines for propagation.
