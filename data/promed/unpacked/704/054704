Health officials said 14 people were exposed to rabies after coming in contact with a kitten that tested positive for the disease in Anderson County [South Carolina]. According to the Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC], this is the 1st animal to test positive for rabies in Anderson County this year [2014], with positive tests confirmed on Tuesday [19 Aug 2014].

DHEC spokesperson Jim Beasley said the kitten that exposed the people to the viral disease was originally injured by a wild animal. Beasley said the person who rescued the kitten was then potentially exposed by the wild animal. He said other people caring for the kitten were subsequently exposed. According to Beasley, the people were exposed to the disease between 29 Jul and 15 Aug [2014]. They were referred to doctors to undergo treatment for the contact.

DHEC said the exposure is under investigation and other animals are quarantined as a result, but health officials have not released further details about the case.

South Carolina law requires pet owners vaccinate their dogs, cats and ferrets regularly. Though younger animals may not be vaccinated, pet owners are urged to use caution and monitor their pets' contact with other animals -- especially outside.
