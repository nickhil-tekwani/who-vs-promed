Fish virus concerns called unfounded
------------------------------------
A fish virus discovered at Clear Fork Reservoir
near Mansfield, Ohio, has some worried about
viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) contaminating
Ohio's fish hatcheries, rivers, and reservoirs
and the virus racing to the Mississippi River.

It is the 1st time VHS has been detected outside
of the Great Lakes, but the worries are
unfounded, said Ohio hatchery coordinator Elmer
Heyob of the Ohio Division of Wildlife.

Wildlife crews took eggs from at least 2 infected
muskies at Clear Fork last spring [2008] for its
London Hatchery, not knowing the fish would test
positive weeks later for VHS. Rainbow trout being
raised at London have since been shipped to
Ohio's premier steelhead trout facility, the Castalia State Fish Hatchery.

Because of VHS and other viruses, precautions are
routinely taken to prevent the spread of VHS
around Ohio, especially between hatcheries, Heyob
said. Salmonid eggs -- including rainbow and
steelhead trout -- are treated with 50
parts-per-million of an iodine solution that is
absorbed by the fish eggs to kill any virus. The
young muskies hatched from the Clear Fork
Reservoir eggs have been healthy, and will be
tested again before their release into Ohio reservoirs.

The virus has devastated fish hatcheries in
Europe, but the VHS strain found in the Great
Lakes is far less virulent, said Heyob.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia, a fish-killing
virus thought to be confined to the Great Lakes,
has been discovered in north-central Ohio's Clear
Fork Reservoir -- a Mohican River watershed that
is not connected to the Great Lakes.

Clear Fork Reservoir is west of Interstate 71
near Mansfield, Ohio, about 170 miles (about 275
km) northeast of Cincinnati. The virus was found
in April [2008], according to the Ohio Department
of Natural Resources. No related fish kill was reported.

Kentucky's fisheries officials say there is no
evidence the virus has reached anywhere near the
Ohio River or Kentucky, but they are still
worried about its potentially devastating effects.

"I think there have been major kills associated
with VHS in the Great Lakes," said Gerry Buynak,
assistant director of the Kentucky Department of
Wildlife Resources. "We don't have any known VHS
here. But I think there is concern. And when you
hear of it spreading that causes even more concern."

Precisely how the virus is spread is unknown,
although transport of infected fish or fish parts
from one body of water to another is one way,
said Robert Durborow, a professor and fish
pathologist for the Division of Aquaculture at Kentucky State University.

According to the 30 Jun [2008] edition of The
Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch, the virus was first
identified in Lake Ontario after a 2005 fish kill
and is suspected of having been in Lake St. Clair
2 years earlier. The virus was first discovered
in Europe. How it arrived in the Great Lakes is unknown.

"Now there's a strain of the VHS virus and it
affects 29 different species of fish," including
many found in Kentucky, Durborow said.

The virus kills fish by causing both internal and
external hemorrhaging, he said.

The virus is not harmful to humans, but there's
very little that researchers, wildlife officials,
or sportsmen can do to protect fish from the
disease aside from taking measures to stop its spread, Durborow said.

"A (fish) virus is a special concern because,
like a virus that affects humans, there's no
treatment for it," he said. "Much like a cold, it
has to kind of run its course."

Federal and state wildlife officials are
empowered to prevent fish or other game from
being transported to or from a state where a
disease has been found. Durborow said these
layers of projection are already in force in and
around much of the Great Lakes region.

Durborow said Kentucky anglers who travel to the
Great Lakes and return with fish that have been
cleaned and dressed would pose virtually no
threat of transporting the disease, unless the
fish offal was dumped into Kentucky waters. Even then the risk would be tiny.

Kentucky's best defense against the virus may be
its climate, which means summertime water
temperatures across the state typically approach
the mid 80s [deg F/30 deg C] or warmer.

"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia thrives in cool
water," Durborow said. "ÂŠ We're pretty far south,
and we don't have much cool water. But we do have
colder water during parts of the year, so we don't want (VHS) in the state."
