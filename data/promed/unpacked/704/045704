Parents panicked when their 3-month-old baby suddenly became sick and ended up in the hospital. He was diagnosed with botulism, a potentially deadly condition, and getting the treatment wasn't easy. "All you want is your baby to be back to normal," said the baby's mother.

But the 3-month-old was lethargic, losing muscle tone, and getting worse. And on 2 Jul 2014, he ended up in intensive care at St. Barnabas Medical Center [Essex County, New Jersey]. "His cry was weak, he wouldn't eat, he was miserable," the mother said. The baby had no fever, normal blood work, and wanted to eat but couldn't.

Chief of Infectious Disease Dr. Uzma Hassan says those are clues that led her to diagnosis of botulism. "Botulism is a very serious illness. Botulism toxin is the most potent neurotoxin known to man," said Dr. Uzma Hassan, of St. Barnabas Medical Center. The toxin paralyzes muscles, leaving babies unable to eat or breathe. There is a treatment, baby-BIG (botulism immune globulin), but you can only get it from the California Department of Public Health and it costs USD 45 000.

For that antitoxin to work, it has to be given within a few days. But the test to confirm the diagnosis can take up to a week. That means doctors have to act fast and make a decision before it's too late. "He needed to get this as soon as possible. He was deteriorating and he was deteriorating really quickly," the mother said. After the treatment, the baby immediately started to get better. Soon after, the test results came back confirming that he had botulism. The condition affects about 100 babies a year.

Dr. Hassan says construction and dust may play a role. "It may be that the soil turning around could have triggered a release of spores in the environment," Dr. Hassan said. Botulism spores are also found in honey. That's the reason new parents are told to never give their baby honey.

[The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

As was done in the case above, botulism immune globulin (BIG) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.
