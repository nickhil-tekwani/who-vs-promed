An outbreak of _E. coli_ [O157] claimed its 1st fatality on Tue 24 Jul 2012, a longtime area school superintendent known for his dedication to children.

The man, 73, of Germantown, was one of at least 75 people sickened after consuming food served at a 3 Jul 2012 customer appreciation picnic at Neff's Lawn Care in German Township. He retired in 2010 as superintendent of Trotwood-Madison City Schools and had also been superintendent at Valley View and Mad River schools.

Two others remain hospitalized, a 4-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. A total of 14 people have been hospitalized, and health officials still do not know the cause [sic: source] of the contamination. Lab tests confirmed the same strain of _E. coli_ in 18 people.

The number of people sickened is "unusually large" for an _E. coli_ outbreak, said Bill Wharton, health department spokesman.

The man was hospitalized after developing hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication in which a toxin produced by [certain strains of] _E. coli_ destroys red blood cells, leading to anemia and kidney damage. It can cause kidney failure. An autopsy was scheduled.

Tracing the source of the outbreak is a major undertaking, Montgomery County Health Commissioner Jim Gross said, because of the sheer number of people who brought in food and the number of people who became ill.

An estimated 300 people attended the picnic, and many carried in food to share. The hosts also supplied and cooked some of the meat served that day.

"It's not like an outbreak involving a specific food service establishment," Gross said. "It's completely different. In addition to the people who are sick, there are all the people who prepared the foods. There are so many different variables, and it's extremely important that we are as thorough as we can be. And if we reach a conclusion, we want to reach the correct conclusion. At this point in time, thoroughness is more important than rushing to a conclusion."
