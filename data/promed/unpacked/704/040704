10-year-old being treated for rabies after bat bite in Spencer. Several may have touched bat

Health officials are warning anyone who may have touched a bat found at Luther Hill Park on Tuesday to consult with their doctor immediately, as the bat had rabies.

A 10-year-old child who was bitten by the bat is undergoing treatment but, Health Agent Lee Jarvis said, there were reports that several other children may have touched it and could have been exposed to the deadly virus.

"What we were told was that the bat fell from a tree into the water," Mr. Jarvis said. Someone retrieved the bat and brought it to shore where several children gathered around. Some of the children reportedly were "petting" the bat.

The bat was sent out for testing and was found to have rabies.

Mr. Jarvis said he placed a reverse call to every residence in Spencer yesterday but there may have been people who did not receive the message.

Treatment for exposure to rabies includes a series of injections over a period of several days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Rabies is transmitted through the saliva or the tissue from the brain or nervous system of an infected animal and a person can only get rabies by coming in contact with these specific excretions or tissues, the website states.

There have been cases of bats with rabies in the 48 contiguous states in the United States, according to the CDC, whose website states, "Recent data suggest that transmission of rabies virus can occur from minor, seemingly unimportant, or unrecognized bites from bats. Human and domestic animal contact with bats should be minimized, and bats should never be handled by untrained and unvaccinated persons or be kept as pets."

The CDC recommends a series of shots for anyone who has a "bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure to a bat, unless the bat is available for testing and is negative for evidence of rabies."

Mr. Jarvis urged anyone who came in contact with the bat at the beach to speak with their doctor as soon as possible.

He said time is of the essence when treating for rabies exposure.

Rabid cat attacks people, animals in Vermont

A cat has tested positive for rabies in Vermont after attacking 4 people and a dog.

[A woman] said the cat bit her on her face, on her sides and on her arm after she called for it Tuesday when she arrived at the Coventry Landfill, where she cleans the offices. The cat also scratched her 14-year-old son and ripped his shorts before they could drive away with the cat giving chase to their pickup truck.

WCAX-TV reported that the cat struck again the next day, 2 miles up the road when it went after 2 men and a dog. Joe Cody told the station they were eventually able to hold down the cat with a shovel and kill it with a rifle.

Grayson Co. confirmed case of rabies in cow

A show cow in Grayson County tested positive for rabies near the end of June. Rabies is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system and is rarely ever seen in cows.

Each year, the Texas Department of State Health Services reports the number of animals tested for rabies. Of the state's 232 counties listed last year, only nine counties had rabid bovine including Grayson.

Texas Department of State Health Services out of Arlington notified Grayson County Health about the infected cow just a few weeks ago.

The show heffer was a beloved family pet from southwest Grayson County.

In all likelihood this bovine pet caused human exposure.

If there are show animals, whether the animal is bovine, or horse or other animals, it is important to vaccinate these animals against rabies. We are around these animals all the time, this is a protection for our animals and especially for ourselves.

Vaccinating your pets, regardless of their size is cheap insurance to help protect your life and the life of your pet.

Most large animals (horses, cattle, goats etc) are curious animals. So when a skunk or raccoon or some other rabid animal is in the pasture, the farm animal will go and investigate this strange creature in their habitat. The animal puts its nose down to investigate this odd visitor and receives a bite on the nose for its trouble. We may not notice the bite, and certainly if this occurs at night, we may never see the rabid animal. Nevertheless, our pet has been exposed to rabies, and may expose us.

Please vaccinate your pets, your horses and yes your show animals. - Mod.TG]
