One hundred and four cases, 35 of whom died, were identified from 1 Apr to
1 Aug 2000 in an outbreak of severe illness and deaths among injecting drug
users (IDUs) in Scotland, Ireland, and England and Wales (1). _Clostridium_
species [_C.novyi_ & _C.perfringens_ were isolated from 8 cases, which
suggests that the drugs or other materials they used were contaminated. The
table [see website summarises data from each of the affected countries,
collated by a coordinating team with representatives from their national
surveillance centres.
This outbreak of severe systemic sepsis related to soft tissue inflammation
appears to have been confined to IDUs in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The coordinating team would, however, welcome any information from
colleagues elsewhere in Europe should they ascertain similar cases.
