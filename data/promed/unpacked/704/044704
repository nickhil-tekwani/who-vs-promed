Caterpillar killing unborn foals
--------------------------------
Horse breeders could be suffering untold losses in aborted foals due to the
spread of the poisonous progressionary caterpillar [ProMED-mail would be
grateful to know whether this is the same creature as the processionary
caterpillar and wheter it is related to the eastern tent caterpillar. -
Mod.SH].

A silent killer, the progressionary (or hairy) caterpillar has spread from
the Geelong region to central Victoria, where it is believed to have caused
foal abortions.

A breeder from Spring Hill, between Kyneton and Trentham, lost 7 of her 15
foals this spring [2010] after seeing the caterpillars on and around her
property. All of the losses came after the mares were in foal.

"A lot of breeders won't talk about it because they are frightened people
won't bring their mares to their stud," Ms Chesson said. "But there's
nothing you can do, you find them (the caterpillar) everywhere; on the
roads and on bare ground.

"If we've got them here, I'm sure there would be a lot around and no one is
saying anything." Department of Primary Industries animal health manager,
Tony Britt, described the problem as "sporadic" but significant for those
affected. "Abortion in mares is not uncommon and there can be a range of
possible causes: infection, problems with the foal and placenta in the
uterus, twins . . . and this may well be a further possible cause," he
said. "But in terms of this being a widespread problem, it hasn't come to
the attention of the department, but that doesn't in any way reduce (its)
significance."

Dr Britt urged concerned breeders to liaise with their vet. But for Ms
Chesson, it's already too late. "We've just got to cop the loss," she said.

[This caterpillar sounds like it has a cousin, the tent caterpillar that
affects pregnant mares in the Eastern region of the United States. The
syndrome is called mare reproductive loss syndrome. The toxic agent of the
caterpillars has not been identified. However, the culprit caterpillar in
the US is the eastern tent caterpillar.

The US syndrome includes early fetal loss, late fetal loss, uveitis,
pericarditis, and encephalitis, [from] tissue penetration by septic barbed
setal fragments (septic penetrating setae) from eastern tent caterpillars
(_Malacosoma americanum_). Once ingested, these barbed setal fragments
migrate through moving tissues, followed by rapid hematogenous spread of
bacteria, bacterial emboli, and/or septic fragments of setae (septic
penetrating setal emboli), collectively referred to as septic materials.

One wonders if the Australian situation is similar. - Mod.TG
