Two new polio cases were confirmed from Lakki Marwat district, which also happens to be the constituency of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Minister Hisham Inamullah Khan.

An official of the Polio Virology Laboratory at the National Institute of Health (NIH), who is not authorized to speak on record, said both cases were reported from Lakki Marwat. "A 6-month-old male, resident of Kotka Mushkalam, Tehsil Serai Naurang, District Lakki Marwat, has been confirmed with the poliovirus." he said. "The 2nd child is an 18-month-old-male, resident of Kotka Bazee Sheikh, Tehsil Serai Naurang, District Lakki Marwat," he said.

"Because of the recent cases, the total number of polio cases has increased to 50 in the province and overall cases across the country has reached 66, as compared to 12 cases in 2018 and 8 cases in 2017," he added. "During the current year [2019], 6 cases have been reported from Sindh and 5 each from Balochistan and Punjab," he said. Total number of cases this year tops 66.

The official said it was worrying that after Bannu, cases were being reported from Lakki Marwat. "Thousands of refusals and missed children are also being reported from the district during every anti-polio vaccination campaign," he said.

The health minister could not be contacted despite repeated attempts to get in touch with him by Dawn. But Prime Minister's Focal Person on Polio Babar Bin Atta spoke to Dawn and explained the possible reason for the increase in polio cases in district Lakki Marwat. "Bannu and Lakki Marwat are adjacent to each other. Whenever cases start to increase in Bannu, they also start increasing in Lakki Marwat," he said. "However, we have decided to give special focus to Lakki Marwat so that no more cases are reported from there. During every polio campaign, it would be ensured that no child is missed," he said.

The focal person also told Dawn about the way the campaign was being sabotaged by parents. "It is unfortunate that people have kept markers in their homes, and on the very 1st day of the anti-polio vaccination campaign, they mark the fingers of their children to avoid vaccination," he said.

Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of 5. Repeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only 2 countries in the world where poliovirus continues to persist.

[While these cases have not as yet been posted on the End Polio Pakistan website (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces), the sources of information cited in the media report are reliable sources, and I suspect they will be posted imminently, unless they are still waiting for genetic studies of the viruses to be completed.

As stated, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province has been hardest hit with polio cases this year (2019) with the addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases raising the total to 50. It's an area where there has been civil unrest with outside influences and has seen violence directed at the vaccination workers including fatalities. Adding to this has been the global anti-vaccination movement that has entered the Pakistani social media space.

That being said, taking a step backwards and looking at the polio activity in recent years in Pakistan, the pattern resembles a pattern seen in the early vaccination days in the USA, with outbreaks occurring on 3-5 year cycles, taking that period of time to accumulate enough susceptibles to sustain epidemic transmission of the virus. If that is some of the engine behind this year's increase in activity, we would expect to see reduced transmission (fewer cases) in the coming 1-3 or 5 years), that is unless a way to overcome the impact of the anti-vaccination activities is successfully found.

The End Polio Pakistan website has a breakdown of reported cases by district for this year (not including these 2 newly reported cases as yet). To date, there have been 19 districts reporting cases since 1 Jan 2019 (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019).

[2] Philippines, 7 suspected cases (Zamboanga Península) - media report
Date: 23 Sep 2019

Seven suspected polio cases were reported in Zamboanga Peninsula, according to the Department of Health (DOH)-Region Nine, according to the report of Maki Pulido on State of the Nation with Jessica Soho.

The agency is currently waiting for the results of the samples taken from the affected children and sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.

According to DOH-Region Nine, only 71 percent of the children in their area were vaccinated against polio in 2018, far from the 95-percent target of the DOH. The remote locations of some houses, lack of knowledge and awareness of residents, and fear brought about by the Dengvaxia controversy were some of the reasons the DOH identified as being behind the low percentage of vaccinated children.

[3] Philippines, 7 suspected cases (Zamboanga, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay) - Philippines News Agency
Date: 23 Sep 2019

The Department of Health (DOH) has recorded 7 suspected cases of poliomyelitis (polio) since January this year [2019] in Region 9.

Dr. Dennis Dacayanan, Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (RESU) head, disclosed Monday [23 Sep 2019] that the 7 are among the 15 cases of suspected acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) that they have recorded in the region. Dacayanan said 8 of the cases later yielded negative for polio virus.

AFP is defined as a sudden onset of paralysis or weakness in any part of the body of a child less than 15 years of age. Dacayanan said the results of 7 suspected cases are still pending with the DOH's Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

He said 4 of the 7 suspected cases were recorded in this city, 2 in Zamboanga Sibugay and 1 in Zamboanga del Sur.

Following the discovery, the DOH official said they have strengthened surveillance after the DOH central office declared a polio outbreak on 19 Sep 2019, after confirming the re-emergence of the disease 19 years after the Philippines was declared polio-free by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Polio can be prevented through vaccination; 3 doses of oral polio vaccine and one dose of inactivated polio vaccine are needed.

Signs and symptoms of polio include headache, fever, stiff neck, vomiting, fatigue, and sudden onset of floppy arms or legs.

Proper hygiene must also be practiced by defecating in toilets, proper handwashing, making sure water is safe for drinking, and preparing and cooking food thoroughly.

[A good map showing the regions can be found at http://mapsof.net/philippines/philippines-regions-and-provinces. The Zamboagan peninsula is located in the southwestern part of the Philippines on Mindanao, to the west of the Davao region where cVDPV2 has been documented in sewage sampling.

One expects to have AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases identified as part of the necessary surveillance activities with the goal of polio eradication. While the 7 cases are still pending laboratory confirmation, it is curious that the official government press release mentions 8 of 15 AFP cases have been ruled out, somewhat suggesting the other 7 are going through secondary testing for confirmation (including genetic testing).

The estimated population of Region 9 in the Philippines was 3 629 783 in 2015, according to the Philippines Statistics Authority (https://psa.gov.ph/content/population-region-ix-zamboanga-peninsula-based-2015-census-population-and-housing).

We await further information as it becomes available.
