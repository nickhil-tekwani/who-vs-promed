The controversy began a few weeks ago when a small, cream-colored mutt named Sheila bolted unexpectedly from under a beach hammock and bit a 10-year-old Australian girl in the leg.

Kuta Beach, the most popular spot on the getaway island of Bali, is well known for good surfing, cold beer, loud music and mangy-looking beach dogs. The dogs are something of a tourist attraction and generally harmless, except when they are not.

Sheila's bite on 27 Jan 2015 set off a chain of events that has once again plunged this community into a vigorous debate about the island's canine cohort and what some residents say is the government's draconian effort to control them, with prime tourist season only a few months away.

Minutes after the bite, witnesses said, members of Kuta Village's security team, armed with clubs, arrived at the beach and surrounded the dog, which in a panic ran to the surf.

"One man chased her with what looked like a large paddle and started repeatedly hitting her on the head, and intermittently drowning her," said Praveen Elango, a tourist from India. "Another man approached with a brick and started whacking her with it."

Tourists gaped in horror. Sheila escaped and was taken away by a surfing instructor. The Australian girl was rushed to a nearby clinic.

But the next day, the other dogs of that section of Kuta Beach, where about half a dozen strays usually roam, were gone. People who work at the beach say the government rounded them up overnight and killed them.

"Usually, the dogs are there every day, but since this happened, we have not seen any dogs on Kuta Beach," said Dedi Suherman, 35, a surfing instructor who also said he witnessed Sheila's beating. "People are pretty angry."

Two days later, Bali's governor, I Made Mangku Pastika, invited the public to join the government in killing every stray dog on the island, which he estimated to be 500 000 animals.

"Please help," he said, according to a report in Kompas, a prominent Indonesian daily newspaper. "If you see a stray dog, just kill it, eliminate it. Don't let them hang around spreading the disease. It's dangerous and makes people scared."

Bali's government provides free medical treatment, including vaccination shots, to any resident bitten by a street dog, but the governor said the province had run out of money to buy the vaccine.

On average, more than 4000 people a month were bitten by dogs on Bali, an island of 4 million people, from 2010 to 2012, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. While few of the dogs are rabid, it is not always possible to know whether one that bites is, so treatment is usually prescribed. If not treated immediately, people can die of rabies.

The governor 1st called on the public to kill street dogs in 2008, after rabies appeared on this island.

He did so again last July [2014], complaining about the expense of the vaccines and noting that dog owners were violating the law by letting their pets run free.

"There is no need to catch them -- put them in a shelter or something," he said then, according to The Jakarta Post. "Just cull them. It is the dog owners' fault for letting their dogs stray."

The local news media reported that more than 120 dogs were culled, mostly by animal control officers, in 2 remote districts in December [2014] and January [2015].

The most common methods the government uses include shooting dogs with strychnine-laced darts or administering fatal injections, a practice that has been denounced by animal rights groups and documented in gruesome videos on YouTube.

"It's a terrible way to die," said Janice Girardi, an American resident of Bali for more than 30 years and the founder of the Bali Animal Welfare Association, which has campaigned against culling. "It's like torture."

Animal rights groups denounced the governor's comments as "an appeal for a pogrom," one as likely to kill healthy vaccinated pets as rabid strays.

At Kuta Beach, locals share pictures on cellphones and by email of their missing beach dogs wearing the special collars proving that they have been vaccinated for rabies. Moreover, village officials say there has not been a reported case of rabies in dogs or humans at Kuta Beach.

Economic and religious themes also play into the debate. This being Bali, where tourism and related industries account for about 80 percent of the economy, news reports of dog bites and rabies outbreaks undermine the image of a tropical island paradise.

"Many people don't like the idea" of killing stray dogs, said Wayan Suarsa, the chief of Kuta Village, "because it affects our image. But in some cases, they disturb tourists, and we clearly want to expand our tourism industry."

But other residents argue that dogs are an important part of the culture on this historically Hindu island, as noted in the Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic, and are worthy of respect.

Putu Sumantra, the head of Bali's animal husbandry department, said the governor's comments about "inviting" the public to kill stray dogs had been taken out of context.

"It was the public that asked the government to do it, either during local meetings or through government offices," he said in a written reply to questions.

He said that the government would continue to cull dogs "selectively," including unvaccinated semiferal dogs, but that vaccination was the government's primary rabies-eradication strategy. The government has carried out mass vaccination operations and has plans for another one from April to July [2015].

That is the right path, public health experts say.

"Vaccination is the most effective way to stop rabies," said Eric Brum, a rabies expert and chief technical adviser for the United Nations agriculture agency, which financed the rabies vaccination program in Bali until last year [2014] and has trained the dogcatchers there.

Culling, on the other hand, is counterproductive, he says.

Killing dogs does not reduce contact between sick and healthy animals, while vaccinating the majority of dogs -- 70 percent is thought to be effective -- can provide herd immunity. Without other susceptible dogs for rabid animals to pass the disease to, the disease will ultimately die out.

"We're trying to flood the environment with immune animals," he said. "We want vaccinated dogs to go out and meet the virus."

Rabies cases have dropped rapidly in Bali since the virus 1st appeared, a fact Mr. Brum attributes to the vaccination campaign, which inoculated more than 2 million dogs from 2008 to 2014, according to provincial government data.

In 2010, there were 421 confirmed animal cases of rabies and 84 human deaths, according to United Nations data. Last year [2014], there were only 132 canine cases and no human deaths.

"The problem is not the dogs -- it's the virus," Mr. Brum said.

Not for the Australian girl, however, who underwent treatment as a precaution but was probably never in danger of contracting the disease. Sheila had been vaccinated and was wearing her collar proving it, even as she was being beaten by village security.

The dog, who has been in hiding with a local family, should not be marked for death, advocates say, but instead should be back on the beach, her immunity helping to keep the virus from spreading.

"They are our warrior dogs," said Ms. Girardi, the animal welfare advocate.

[Bali was free of rabies for decades when the fatal zoonotic virus reportedly returned to the island in November 2008. In response to 4 human deaths believed to be caused by rabies transmitted through dog bites in Ungasan village, Uluwatu, Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika ordered, on Saturday, 29 Nov 2008, the Balinese people to conduct a mass culling of stray dogs on the island "to help the administration prevent a rabies outbreak" (ProMED-mail posting 20081204.3821). Since then, the rabies control activities have undergone several cardinal changes, moving to an attempt to eradicate the disease by a program recommended by international organisations, combining stray dog population control, vaccination of all dogs having owners, and public education. When the island-wide dog sterilization campaign was initially launched at the end of 2011, Bali's dog population was estimated to be larger than 300 000 and the experts agreed that the ideal size of dog population on the resort island should become somewhere between 150 000 and 200 000. It will be interesting to obtain information on the current size of the dog population, 4 years later, and on the current vaccination coverage. Though considerable achievements have been attained, the complete eradication of the disease is not yet in sight. According to OIE's data, during 2013 there were 119 deaths (humans) in Indonesia, out of 69 136 "cases" (this probably refers to number of exposures). During 2011 the numbers were 157 and 80 558, respectively. Data for 2012 were not provided; for 2014, not yet available. Information pertaining specifically to Bali will be appreciated.

Similar situations prevail in considerable parts of the globe. A 4-year rabies control program, implemented in 2007 in Colombo City, Sri Lanka, has recently been analysed in an exhaustive paper (Ref 1). Its abstract follows:

"Background: One Health addresses complex challenges to promote the health of all species and the environment by integrating relevant sciences at systems level. Its application to zoonotic diseases is recommended, but few coherent frameworks exist that combine approaches from multiple disciplines. Rabies requires an interdisciplinary approach for effective and efficient management.

"Methodology/Principal Findings: A framework is proposed to assess the value of rabies interventions holistically. The economic assessment compares additional monetary and non-monetary costs and benefits of an intervention taking into account epidemiological, animal welfare, societal impact and cost data. It is complemented by an ethical assessment. The framework is applied to Colombo City, Sri Lanka, where modified dog rabies intervention measures were implemented in 2007. The 2 options included for analysis were the control measures in place until 2006 ("baseline scenario") and the new comprehensive intervention measures ("intervention") for a 4-year duration. Differences in control cost; monetary human health costs after exposure; Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost due to human rabies deaths and the psychological burden following a bite; negative impact on animal welfare; epidemiological indicators; social acceptance of dogs; and ethical considerations were estimated using a mixed method approach including primary and secondary data. Over the 4 years analysed, the intervention cost USD 1.03 million more than the baseline scenario in 2011 prices (adjusted for inflation) and caused a reduction in dog rabies cases; 738 DALYs averted; an increase in acceptability among non-dog owners; a perception of positive changes in society including a decrease in the number of roaming dogs; and a net reduction in the impact on animal welfare from intermediate-high to low-intermediate.

"Conclusions: The findings illustrate the multiple outcomes relevant to stakeholders and allow greater understanding of the value of the implemented rabies control measures, thereby providing a solid foundation for informed decision-making and sustainable control."

During 3-5 Mar 2015, the 2nd International Conference on Dog Population Management was held in Istanbul, Turkey. The conference theme was "inter-sectoral collaboration, innovation and evidence-based solutions for dog population management." For the program, see http://www.dogpopulationmanagement2015.org/programme.html.

The International Companion Animal Management Coalition (ICAM), which convened the conference, "will be uploading all the films of the talks shortly."
