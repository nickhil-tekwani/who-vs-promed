The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) reports that laboratory tests
have confirmed that a stallion in Texas is infected with contagious equine
metritis (CEM), a highly contagious venereal disease of horses.

The Texas-born quarter horse had spent the 2008 breeding season in
Kentucky, where CEM was detected in a stallion during routine testing in
mid-December 2008. As of 15 Jan 2009, a total of 9 infected stallions have
been detected: 4 in Kentucky, 3 in Indiana, and one each in Wisconsin and
Texas. All of the infected stallions have epidemiological links to one or
more CEM-infected equines during the 2007 or 2008 breeding season. State
and federal authorities are continuing to seek the source of the infection.

At least 38 states are involved in a nationwide epidemiological
investigation and testing of about 275 horses that may have been exposed to
CEM through natural breeding or artificial insemination. The disease can be
spread among stallions if strict biosecurity measures are not maintained
during the collection of semen.

CEM is not routinely spread through casual contact or shared boarding
facilities, and horses can be treated with disinfectants and antibiotics to
wipe out the infection. Potentially exposed and infected equine animals are
being held under movement restrictions by state animal health authorities
until they test negative for the disease or they complete veterinary
treatment and are certified as CEM-negative.

Currently, the TAHC is working with accredited private veterinary
practitioners to test another stallion and 21 mares with potential exposure
to CEM. In some cases, CEM may cause infected mares to abort.

CEM is not known to affect humans. The equine disease was 1st detected in
the U.S. in 1978 and then again in 1979. In both instances, the limited
outbreaks were eradicated.

[Contagious equine metritis (CEM) is a transmissible, exotic, venereal
disease of horses caused by the bacterium _Taylorella equigenitalis_.
Thoroughbred horses appear to be more severely affected by the disease than
other breeds. Because animals may be asymptomatic, the disease is difficult
to detect and control. There is no evidence that CEM affects people.

Initial exposure to the disease usually results in infertility. An infected
mare may fail to conceive (revealed by an early return to estrus after
breeding), or she may spontaneously abort. Abortions related to CEM are
rare, however. Stallions exhibit no clinical signs but can carry the CEM
bacteria on their external genitalia for years.

There are 3 general degrees of infection in mares:
Acute: active inflammation of the uterus causes an obvious thick, milky,
mucoid vulvar discharge 10 to 14 days after breeding.
Chronic: milder uterine inflammation causes less obvious vulvar discharge,
and infection may be more difficult to eliminate.
Carrier: the bacteria are established in the reproductive tract. The mare,
though asymptomatic, is still infectious and can remain a carrier for
several months or longer.

CEM is a serious disease because it is highly contagious. When coupled with
the fact that mares can be bred only during certain seasons, CEM can have a
devastating effect on equine reproductive efficiency. Should CEM become
established in the United States, the horse industry would suffer great
economic losses.

Two of the most common genital infections in mares are caused by
_Klebsiella_ and _Pseudomonas_ spp. bacteria. Differentiating these
infections from CEM cannot be reliably done except by laboratory isolation
of _T. equigenitalis_. Swabs for bacteriologic cultures from mares are
taken from the cervix or endometrium of the uterus during estrus, clitoral
fossa, and clitoral sinuses. Swabs from stallions should be taken from the
penile sheath, fossa glandis, and urethral sinus. Bacterial samples must be
delivered in Aimes transport medium (with charcoal) under refrigeration (4
to 6 C) to an approved laboratory within 48 hours. In mares, various blood
tests may be used to detect antibodies to the CEM bacteria. In stallions,
detectable antibodies do not develop.

The mare cannot be successfully treated until the CEM bacteria clear from
the uterus, a process that may take several months. The external genitalia
of the mare and stallion can be treated with disinfectants and antibiotics.
Once daily for 5 consecutive days, the external genitalia should be gently
scrubbed with 2 per cent chlorhexidine in a mild detergent solution and
rinsed with a warm saline solution. The external genitalia should then be
coated with an antibiotic ointment, such as nitrofurazone. Due to the
effectiveness of this treatment, surgical removal of the clitoral sinuses
is rarely required.
