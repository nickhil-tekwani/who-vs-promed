Ker Munthivuth, Department of Plant Protection [of Cambodia], said the ministry has acknowledged presence of the [cassava mosaic] virus in Cambodia. "We confirm that the cassava mosaic disease is present in Ratanakkiri and Tboung Khmum provinces, but there is no sign of the virus in the western provinces that share a border with Thailand," he said.

"After we found the virus in Ratanakkiri and Tboung Khmum, the ministry issued a statement to farmers with guidelines to stop its spread. The virus is very difficult to destroy, and we don't have any pesticide that can help us. The best way is to burn contaminated produce, but this is obviously not a sustainable solution in the long run."

Thailand said it is considering imposing a ban on imports of Cambodian cassava. The virus has never been found in Thailand.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has triggered food emergencies in the past by destroying cassava crops throughout whole regions. It is caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ which seem to be associated with it in different areas (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20160623.4304471). Co-infections as well as genetic recombination between strains have also been reported, and recombinant strains can be particularly virulent.

CMD symptoms include leaf mosaic, distortion, and stunting of plants leading to severe reduction of tuber yields. The CMD viruses are spread by whitefly vectors and with infected plant material (including seed tubers). At least one of them (_African cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in an alternative host (soybean) suggesting that these viruses may have a wider host reservoir and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Disease management for begomoviruses usually relies on control of their vectors as well as pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants, but these methods have proven unsatisfactory in developing countries.

Because most traditional cassava cultivars are susceptible to CMD, varieties resistant to different viral strains are being developed for local use. In Africa, this has alleviated the problem in some areas, but in others, the new varieties are being wiped out by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; genus _Ipomovirus_ and transmitted like CMD). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742).

Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in cassava growing regions worldwide (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643) since development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult (ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463). The different viruses can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains, and different crop varieties are likely to be needed which are geared towards local viral populations.

The CMD detection above appears to be the 1st report of the disease in Cambodia.
