Public and Environmental Health officials in Humboldt County, California, are working to contain local cases of the gastrointestinal illness shigellosis after 3 lab-confirmed cases and 2 more suspected cases infected Eureka residents during the past month. The cases span multiple households, infecting school-age children and adults, including a person experiencing homelessness. Officials believe the bacteria may have been spread through one or more Eureka laundromats after an infected person washed contaminated clothing at the facility.

Environmental Health officials are working closely with the operators of the 2 laundromats, the Self-Serve Laundromat on Summer Street and Eureka Laundromat on Little Fairfield Street, to make sure their facilities are cleaned and disinfected properly.

_Shigella_ bacteria are found in stool, and infection is spread by eating food or drinking liquids contaminated by an infected person, or when a person touches a contaminated surface or object and then touches their mouth or puts the object into their mouth. People infected with shigellosis typically experience a fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, which may be bloody. Onset of shigellosis symptoms usually occurs 1-2 days after exposure -- but may take longer -- and lasts around a week. Most people with shigellosis recover completely without severe complications. In rare cases, _Shigella_ may cause bloodstream infections, seizures, kidney failure, or arthritis.

[In late 2021, an outbreak of shigellosis occurred in San Diego County in Southern California. This cluster is in Humboldt County, which is in the far north of the state.

_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea). - Mod.LL
