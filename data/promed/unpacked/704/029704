Quarantine officials in East China's Jiangsu Province recently killed 94
flamingos because they carried the zoonotic disease psittacosis. An
ecological tourism company in the province imported 100 flamingos from the
Netherlands in late September. After 6 died during the transportation, the
remaining 94 were found to be infected with chlamydiosis, which can be
easily be transmitted to human beings. The place where the flamingos
temporarily stayed was disinfected.

[Psittacosis (ornithosis) is the clinical disease in humans caused by
_Chlamydia psittaci_. Chlamydiosis is the clinical disease in birds caused
by an avian strain of _Chlamydia psittaci_.
Many birds can carry _Chlamydia psittaci_ and not have the clinical
disease. Signs of chlamydiosis, which vary from bird to bird, include nasal
discharge, red eyes, depression, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing,
diarrhea, and sudden death.
The disease can be passed to humans, but the risk is low. The elderly and
people with compromised immune systems are at an increased risk. Symptoms
include those characteristic of pneumonia, such as fever, chills, cough,
and shortness of breath. A prominent headache is common. - Mod.TG]
