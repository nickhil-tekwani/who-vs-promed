One possible case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was reported in Herrera province after a 32 year old patient, resident of the Monagrillo neighborhood, presented with symptoms of the disease [probably hantavirus pulmonary syndrome].

Francisco Rios, regional health director of the province, stated that tests on the patient to determine if he had this disease were negative. Despite these results, the man was moved to the capital city where the tests are being done again by the Gorgas Memorial Center.

It is worth noting that 2 family members of this man are currently in hospital, having presented with the same symptoms. Because of this, authorities of the Ministry of Health have carried out an inspection of the house of the patient, where they determined that there were various risk factors for the disease within the home.

[If these cases from late July, 2012, are indeed due to a hantavirus infection, the hantavirus most likely responsible for these illnesses is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20081027.3389, hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in Panama include Rio Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda (cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving results of the tests conducted by the Gorgas laboratory, which must have been completed by now.
