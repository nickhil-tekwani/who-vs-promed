Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Affairs and Human
Welfare] office in Primorsky Krai [territory] has given details of 2
fatal cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). Both victims were
unemployed men who went into forested areas in search of wild berries.

Last year [2009] there were 7 fatal TBE cases in the Primorsky Krai.
This year [202], 4833 people, including 1005 children, have
experienced tick bites. In total 3202 ticks were tested for carriage
of TBE virus. In 255 cases of TBE virus infection immune globulin was
administered, and 68 people were hospitalized because of suspected
TBE (15 of whom were children). In 13 cases (of whom 4 were children)
a diagnosis of TBE was confirmed by laboratory analysis.

TBE vaccine coverage was 76 percent of those individuals judged to be
at high risk of infection, representing 5 percent (46 499 people) of
the total population.
