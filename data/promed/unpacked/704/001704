[The UK Department of Health web-site has been revised, and the monthly new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics are now appended to the table
"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the UK by Calendar Year (since 1990)" which
can be accessed at
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/10/53/47/04105347.pdf>
The definition of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD
cases, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the Department of
Health web-site or by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in this
thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693)
The incidence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, abbreviated CJD (new
var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail, in the UK appears to have plateaued, or
perhaps to be in decline. Therefore, since many of the reports appearing in
the update are only peripherally related to the situation in the UK, the
opportunity is being taken to drop the designation UK from the title of
this thread. - Mod.CP]
Monthly Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Statistics as of Fri 4 Mar 2005
--------------------------------------------------
The UK Department of Health is today [Tue 8 Mar 2005] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the form
of the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The position is as follows:
Definite and probable vCJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD cases - Deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 106
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 42
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 149
Summary of vCJD cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
------
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 154

<promed@promedmail.org>
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 7 Feb 2004, the
number of deaths from definite vCJD is unchanged at 106, and the total
number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD has increased by one to
149. The number of probable vCJD cases still alive has fallen from 6 to 5.
Therefore the overall total number of definite or probable vCJD cases
remains at 154.
As of 4 Mar 2005, so far in the UK for the year 2005 there have 18
referrals of suspected CJD; and there have been 5 deaths from sporadic CJC,
one from GSS, one from vCJD, and none from familial or iatrogenic CJD. -

Test Could Improve Detection of Prion Disease in Humans
-------------------------------------------------------
A highly sensitive post-mortem test could help scientists more accurately
determine if a person died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a human
neurological disorder caused by the same class of infectious proteins that
trigger mad cow disease, according to a new study supported in part by the
US National Institutes of Health (NIH). The finding opens the possibility
that such testing might be refined in the future so it can be used to
detect prion disease in living people and animals before the onset of symptoms.
The test, called conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI), was originally
developed to detect various forms of disease-causing proteins called prions
in cows, sheep, deer and other animals. In the new study, researchers led
by Jiri Safar, M.D., Bruce Miller, M.D., Michael Geschwind, M.D., Stephen
DeArmond, M.D., and Nobel Laureate Stanley B. Prusiner, M.D., of the
University of California, San Francisco, found that CDI not only identifies
prions in human brain tissue but is faster and far more precise than the
standard immunological detection methods, which detect only a small
fraction of the infectious prions that may be in the brain.
The finding appears in the 1 Mar 2005 issue of the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, <http://www.pnas.org>. 2 components of the
NIH, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)
and the National Institute on Aging (NIA), supported the study. Additional
support was provided by the John Douglas French Foundation for Alzheimer's
research, the McBean Foundation, and the Alzheimer's Disease Research
Center of California.
"The findings of this NIH-funded research are an important step forward for
the detection of prions," said Michael Nunn, Ph.D., NINDS program director
for prion research. "It has been very difficult to generate diagnostic
tests in this area, and these results are a significant improvement for the
diagnosis of CJD in living people."
In the study, Prusiner and his colleagues extracted brain tissue from 28
people who had died of CJD. They tested these samples using CDI, which uses
highly specific antibodies that bind to all disease-causing prions in the
brain. They also used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to measure only the prion
proteins that are resistant to an enzyme called protease.
Protease-resistant prions are abnormal and usually infectious, meaning they
can cause CJD and other neurodegenerative diseases. CDI detected abnormal
prions in all of the sampled brain regions. In contrast, the researchers
found that IHC detected abnormal prions in less than 25 percent of the
sampled brain regions. The findings, according to the researchers, suggest
that CDI could be used to establish or rule out the diagnosis of CJD with
greater accuracy than IHC, particularly when a small number of samples are
available. Prusiner and colleagues are exploring the possibility of using
CDI in living tissue, like blood or muscle,!
to detect and diagnose prion diseases, such as CJD or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease) while people or animals are still alive.
"This research not only is an important advance for the detection and
diagnosis of prion diseases, but, with the identification of
protease-sensitive infectious prions, will lead to a better understanding
of the underlying disease processes," said Andrew Monjan, Ph.D., Chief of
the NIA's Neurobiology of Aging Branch.
Prusiner received the 1997 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his
discovery of prions. Unlike viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, prions
contain no DNA or RNA. Instead, prions are an altered type of protein
normally found within cells in humans and other organisms. These abnormal
prion proteins appear to convert other, normal prions to an abnormal shape.
Many scientists now believe this conversion process leads to several
dementia-causing diseases in humans, including CJD. Similar diseases in
animals include bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" disease) in
cattle and scrapie in sheep. Abnormal, misfolded proteins contribute to
other age-related neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
diseases. According to Prusiner and his colleagues, CDI testing might
eventually have a role in the diagnosis of other neurodegenerative
diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, in which normally shaped
proteins are structurally altered.

Japan: Blood Donation Ban May Have to be Reviewed
-------------------------------------------------
Japan may review its new ban on blood donations from people who stayed in
Britain or France -- 2 countries hit by mad-cow disease in the 1980s and
1990s -- for one day or longer between 1980 and 1996 if donated blood is in
short supply, Health, Labor and Welfare Minister Hidehisa Otsuji said on
Tue 8 Mar 2005. "We have to take the strictest possible measures to ensure
the safety of the people in the country," he said at a press conference but
added, "We will examine the situation and think about what to do next."
Japan announced the ban on Mon [7 Mar 2005] when a health ministry panel
concluded that a deceased Japanese man confirmed last month [February 2005]
to have been infected with variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease was likely to
have contracted the human form of mad cow disease during a 24-day stay in
Britain in 1990. The Ministry said the man also stayed in France for 3 days
at around the same time that France was hit by an outbreak of mad cow disease.
However, the Japanese Red Cross Society warned that the expanded ban would
cut potential blood donors by several hundred thousand people per year and
may have a serious impact on blood supply. The new ban will be put into
effect following sufficient notifications, the health ministry said. The
previous ban covered those people who had stayed in Britain for at least
one month and in France for at least 6 months between 1980 and now.
