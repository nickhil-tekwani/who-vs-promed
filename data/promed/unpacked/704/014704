German officials were culling about 160 000 geese Sunday [26 Aug
2007] after the deadly H5N1 bird-flu virus was found in a poultry
farm near the southern city of Erlangen. The slaughter was ordered
after 400 geese were found dead in their compound on Friday [24 Aug
2007]. Tests by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute of Veterinary
Medicine found the lethal strain in 5 of the birds.
The area around the farm was sealed off as officials investigated
reports that the infected animals came from another poultry farm in
the northern state of Lower Saxony.
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza is fatal to humans but cannot yet
be transferred between humans. It has hit wild water-birds [swans,
ducks, geese, grebes, coots. - Mod.AS] and some domestic poultry [in
fact, a single domestic goose in a small holding. - Mod.AS] in other
parts of Germany this year [2007].

German health officials slaughtered 160 000 geese over the weekend
after the deadly H5N1 bird-flu virus was found in a poultry farm near
the southern city of Erlangen. The cull was ordered after 400 geese
were found dead.
A team of 8 vets and poultry workers at the farm in Wachenroth,
Bavaria, started what officials called the biggest ever culling
operation in Germany late on Saturday [25 Aug 2007]. The birds were
placed in 3 large containers where they were either gassed or
electrocuted, officials said, after the operation ended on Sunday afternoon.
Tests by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute of Veterinary Medicine had
found the lethal strain of the virus in 5 of the birds.
A 3-km exclusion zone was set up around the farm near the city of
Erlangen, which is about 200 km (120 miles) north of Munich, as
officials began tracking down the cause of the infection. Initial
reports said the infected animals came from another poultry farm in
the northern state of Lower Saxony, but this was later denied.
"We have not been able to pinpoint the source of outbreak," said
Bavarian Health Secretary Otmar Bernhard. Experts are expected to
keep trying to determine how the virus entered the farm.
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has killed nearly 200 people in
recent years, mainly through direct contact with poultry. Most of the
victims have been in Asia. There have been no human deaths from bird
flu in Europe, where outbreaks [in animals] were reported recently in
several countries, including Germany and the Czech Republic.
Bird flu hit wild birds and some domestic poultry in other parts of
Germany this year [2007]. Wild birds can infect domesticated birds
with the highly pathogenic strain, and it is feared that it could
mutate into a strain that could be transmitted among humans.

The only other case of H5N1 affecting domestic fowl in Germany during
2007 was also recorded in a goose, namely in July 2007 in Thuringia
(see 20070710.2194). It will be interesting to see whether there is
an epidemiological background to this coincidence. - Mod.AS]
