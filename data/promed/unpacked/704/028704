DENGUE/DHF UPDATE (32): FRANCE ex COTE D'IVOIRE

We usually post dengue/DHF updates as a weekly
update given the high volume of reports of
dengue/DHF activity worldwide. Given the
importance of the information provided to us by
GeoSentinel, we have decided to depart from the
usual weekly update and post this report now.- Mod.MPP]

GeoSentinel, the global surveillance program of
the International Society of Travel Medicine
(ISTM) wishes to report what we believe to be the
1st case of Dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) from
West Africa. A sentinel case in a returned
traveler from Cote d'Ivoire may herald the
beginning of a local outbreak and indicate the
need for enhanced surveillance locally.

Dr. Philippe Parola at the Marseilles France
Geosentinel site (MRS) has reported the molecular
detection of a dengue 3 virus strain from the
blood of a 53-year-old French expatriate living
in Abidjan, the capital. He arrived in France on
[17 Jul 2008] and was hospitalized 4 ([21 Jul
2008]) days later because of high fever (40
degrees C), headache, and a rash. At the time
platelets were (103 000 /L), leukocytes (2.41 X
10Â´9 /L); no malaria was found. At admission, IgM
and IgG assays were negative for dengue and
Chikungunya. However, PCR confirmed DENV-3
viremia. The patient recovered by hospital day 6
without complication or haemorrhage. The virus is
currently being characterized by Professor X. de Lamballerie in Marseille.

In Africa, recent reports of epidemic or endemic
dengue activity are usually from East Africa and
dengue 2 (DENV-2) is usually isolated. Dengue is
infrequently reported in West Africa. In 2000, a
Dengue virus Type 1 had been isolated from a
French soldier in Ivory coast (Emerg Infect Dis.
2000;6(1):83-4.). Of importance is that DENV-3
such as is reported here has recently caused
unexpected outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) in Sri Lanka, East Africa and Latin America
(Emerg Infect Dis. 2003 Jul;9(7):800-9.).

We have recently reported on the use of returned
travelers as sentinels in the early detection of
local outbreaks of dengue (Emerg Infect Dis.
2008;14(7):1081-8.) in other parts of the
world. GeoSentinel sites and network members
have intensified surveillance for further suspect
cases, and we would appreciate hearing from
others if they encounter such cases.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank our colleagues
at GeoSentinel, Drs. Parola, Gautret and Freedman
for this very complete report on the confirmation
of this laboratory documented dengue type 3
infection from an expatriate returning to France
after living in Cote d'Ivoire. We look forward to
further information as it becomes available.
Thirty plus years ago, many dengue outbreaks were
confirmed by infections in travellers returning
to their home countries and not through country
reports of dengue activity. In many instances,
the travellers were returning tourists from
Island beach holidays in countries that feared
announcing an outbreak would result in "scaring"
away tourism with a resultant negative economic
impact. In other regions, the lack of
infrastructure resulting in inability to perform
laboratory confirmation of infections most likely
contributed to the lack of reports.

This moderator has attempted a review of
ProMED-mail archived postings on dengue/DHF
(almost 1000 postings since 1994) looking for
reports on dengue outbreaks in African countries.
There was one posting on a suspected outbreak of
dengue in Somalia in 2005 (see Dengue/DHF update
2005 (08)] 20050423.1139), and another posting,
earlier this year (2008) on an outbreak in
Reunion, an Island in the Indian Ocean just east
of Madagascar (see Dengue/DHF update 2008
(17) 20080429.1477). There was also a case
report of a returning Taiwanese national who had
been travelling in Madagascar prior to the onset
of illness in 2006 (see Dengue/DHF update 2006
(31) 20060911.2577). There were no reports on
dengue fever cases with known infection in West
African countries, albeit dengue is known to be
present. So this current report is the 1st report
ProMED-mail has carried related to dengue virus
transmission in West Africa. Interestingly our
archives reflect the observations mentioned by
Drs. Parola, Gautret and Freedman -- no reports
of outbreaks of dengue in West Africa, 2 reports
of outbreaks in the East Africa region (Somalia
and Reunion), and now 2 reports of dengue in
returning travellers from Africa (one from
Madagascar, and this present one from Cote d'Ivoire).
