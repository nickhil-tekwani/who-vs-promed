[In February 2017 Israel reported an outbreak of FMDV-O in the district of HaDarom (Southern). See further details of this February 2017 event at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=22775. This event was reported as resolved on 7 Mar 2017. - Mod.CRD

Ein Saala (Ayn-al-Sahla), where the current FMD outbreak reportedly started in late May 2017, affecting cattle, is situated just 1.2 km (0.75 mi) from the demarcation line between Israeli and Palestinian (West Bank) territories, where several FMDV outbreaks were reported earlier in May, affecting sheep and cattle (see 20170516.5039513; note that serotyping was pending). In the meantime, those earlier isolates have been serotyped O, and genotyped EA-3, similar to earlier outbreaks in the Gaza Strip (Palestinian Authority) and one Israeli dairy cattle farm adjacent to the Gaza Strip. This East-African strain is known to be widely spread in Egypt. Its spread from Egypt to the Gaza Strip, then eastwards to the West Bank, is notable. It will be interesting to obtain genotyping results of the current case in Ayn-al Sahla (map at http://tinyurl.com/yahev4ro).

The initial genotyping of the virus strains in the Gaza Strip and southwest Israel, as FMDV 'O EA-3' was carried out by the Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan; this has later been confirmed by the WRL FMD (Pirbright), where the strains from the West Bank (Yatta) have been found to be of the same East-African/Egyptian genotype.

FMDV serotype A of an Asian topotype has been recently identified in Israeli cattle on the Lebanese border, and a secondary outbreak of the same strain, recorded on the Golan Heights, has been reported to the OIE. Past experience in Israel showed that in most cases, serotype O strains were more likely to spread than serotype A strains, clinically affecting both large and small ruminants, while serotype A strains seemed more likely to affect cattle. - Mod.AS
