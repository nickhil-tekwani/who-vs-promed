Tickborne pathogens increasingly widespread in Central Canada
-------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Tickborne pathogens, known for causing illnesses such as Lyme disease, are on the rise in Central Canada -- presenting new risks in areas where they were never previously detected. The findings demonstrate the need for more comprehensive testing and tracking to detect the spread and potential risk of tickborne pathogens to human and wildlife populations throughout Canada.

"Most people know that diseases can be transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. Ticks can carry and spread several disease agents, called pathogens, that can make people and animals sick," explains Kirsten Crandall, a PhD candidate under the joint supervision of McGill University professor Virginie Millien and University of Ottawa professor Jeremy Kerr. "While the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is the most common tickborne pathogen in Canada, other tickborne pathogens are moving in," she adds.

To investigate the presence and prevalence of several emerging tick-borne pathogens, Crandall and her team analyzed small mammals and ticks collected in Ontario and Quebec. The researchers found that 5 emerging pathogens were present across their study sites in Central Canada, including the pathogens causing Lyme disease and babesiosis, a malaria-like parasitic disease.

They discovered that 2 pathogens, _Babesia odocoilei_ and _Rickettsia rickettsii_, were detected outside of their historic geographic range in Quebec. These pathogens [cause] babesiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, [respectively]. "The presence of these pathogens changes the risk of disease for Canadians and animals in some densely populated areas of Canada," says Crandall.

Transmission spread in different ways
-------------------------------------
Typically, pathogens are transmitted to a tick after feeding from the blood of an infected host, like a small mammal. However, the researchers found evidence of pathogens that could spread in other ways. _B. odocoilei_ and _R. rickettsii_ can also be directly transmitted from adult female ticks to larval ticks. Also, small mammals like mice can transmit parasites [of the genus] _Hepatozoon_ after ingesting an infected insect, spider, or tick.

"It's challenging to assess the spread of certain emerging or re-emerging tickborne pathogens, as many of them are not reported to public health agencies in Canada," says Crandall. "Only two tickborne pathogens are listed as nationally notifiable diseases in Canada: Lyme disease ([caused by] _Borrelia burgdorferi_) and tularemia ([caused by] _Francisella tularensis_). However, we are seeing increased cases of diseases like anaplasmosis [caused by _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_), and babesiosis in humans in Canada."

Detecting the spread and potential risk
---------------------------------------
According to the researchers, the spread of emerging tickborne pathogens has steadily increased in Canada because of climate change, habitat fragmentation, and changes in the abundance of tick populations and their hosts. "If we don't know that pathogens are present, we can't equip Canadians with the information they need to protect themselves. COVID-19 has diverted public health resources away from challenges like this one, and we need to remember that these tickborne diseases are on the move too," adds Jeremy Kerr.

"It's an immense endeavour to track in real time the emergence of these pathogens across Canada, and this is when field research like ours can contribute significantly. The work of our student is a beautiful reminder that fundamental research matters, and in this case, can play a role in public health," says Virginie Millien.

Abstract
--------
"Background
The spread of emerging tick-borne pathogens has steadily increased in Canada with the widespread establishment of tick vectors and vertebrate hosts. At present, _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the bacterium causing Lyme disease, is the most common tickborne pathogen in Canada and is primarily transmitted by _Ixodes scapularis_. A low prevalence of other emerging tickborne pathogens, such as _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, _Babesia_ species, _Borrelia miyamotoi_, and _Francisella tularensis_ have also been detected through surveillance efforts in Canada. Although _Rickettsia rickettsii_ has been historically detected in _Haemaphysalis leporispalustris_ [the rabbit tick in the Ixodidae family] in Canada, the current prevalence and geographic extent of this pathogen are unknown.

"Material and methods
In this study, we assessed the presence and prevalence of several emerging tickborne pathogens in ticks and hosts collected through tick dragging and small mammal trapping in Central Canada [Ontario and Quebec].

"Results
Nested PCR testing detected three pathogen species in ticks, with _Babesia odocoilei_ and _B. burgdorferi_ in _I. scapularis_ in addition to _R. rickettsii_ in _H. leporispalustris_. 3 pathogen species were detected in small mammals by nested PCR including _B. odocoilei_ in _Blarina brevicauda_ [shrew], _Babesia microti_ in _Peromyscus leucopus_ [white-footed mouse], and a _Hepatozoon_ species [obligate intraerythrocytic protozoans] in _P. leucopus_ and _Peromyscus maniculatus_ [deer mouse]. _B. burgdorferi_ and _Babesia_ species were the pathogens most often detected in our samples, suggesting they are widely distributed across Central Canada. We also detected _B. odocoilei_ and _R. rickettsii_ beyond their known geographic distribution.

"Conclusions
Our results provide evidence that emerging tickborne pathogens may be present outside defined risk areas identified by current surveillance efforts in Canada. As a result, emerging tickborne pathogens introduced by the dispersal of infected ticks by migratory birds or maintained by hosts and vectors through cryptic transmission cycles may go undetected. More comprehensive testing including all tick life stages and additional tick-borne pathogens will help detect the spread and potential risk of emerging or re-emerging tick-borne pathogens for human and wildlife populations throughout Canada."

Ticks by themselves unlikely travel far; travel over greater distances is achieved by the ticks attaching themselves to migrating mammals and birds (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150706143251.htm). Ticks can only climb the short distance on vegetation to a height at which they are most likely to contact their preferred host and wait (known as "questing") for a host to pass by. Nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long). Climate change, with warmer winter temperatures, very likely contributes to the geographic expansion of diseases caused by tick-borne pathogens, facilitating the survival of ticks during the winter season (https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/environment/2017/05/06/threat-of-moose-killing-tick-infestation-looms-as-far-north-climate-warms/). - Mod.ML
