Epidemiology

Epidemiological comments
The presence of BTV serotype 8 has been demonstrated in 2 bovine
animals on this premises. However, there is no evidence yet available
to prove circulation of the virus between ruminants and the vectors
of the disease.
Control measures
Measures already applied
- movement control inside the country
- screening
- stamping out
- zoning
- control of arthropods
- vaccination permitted
- no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: none specified

[2] Bluetongue, DEFRA press release

Bluetongue detected in Suffolk
------------------------------
Since 22 Sep 2007, laboratory tests have detected the presence of
bluetongue in 2 cattle on a premises near Ipswich, Suffolk, in a 3rd
animal at a premises near Lowestoft, and in a 4th animal at a 3rd
premises near Ipswich, Suffolk.
The premises where bluetongue has been found are under restrictions,
the infected cattle have been culled, and epidemiological
investigations are being carried out to assess the situation. This is
not a confirmed outbreak unless further investigation demonstrates
that disease is circulating between the local animal and midge populations.

[The strategy for movement control to prevent further spread of
bluetongue disease is integrated with the foot-and-mouth disease
control strategies. Details can be found at the DEFRA website at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070925c.htm>.
A map of the bluetongue outbreak farms can be obtained by consulting
the OIE's WAHID report referenced above.
It is indeed unfortunate that the UK has to deal with simultaneous
animal health emergencies, particularly since we lack an effective
vaccine for the BTV-8 type of bluetongue reported here and the
results from the continent have not been encouraging in terms of
limiting spread of this vector-borne disease. I am sure they have
trained for such emergency situations, but ensuring a harmonized,
effective response is challenging when there are 2 targets. We wish
them good luck. - Mod.PC]
