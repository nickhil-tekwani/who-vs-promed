ANTHRAX, GLOBAL BACKGROUND ACTIVITY: REQUEST FOR INFO
*****************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Mon, 30 Mar 1998 15:36:13 -0500 (EST)
From: Jack Woodall <woodall@wadsworth.org>

A check of the ProMED-mail archives shows that anthrax cases in animals and
humans have been reported from many countries in the past 3 years. In just
the past 12 months we have carried reports of human anthrax in Russia &
Thailand, and animal anthrax in Australia, Ghana, Indonesia, Jordan,
Kazakhstan, Namibia, Scotland, Tanzania, Ukraine, USA (New Mexico & Texas),
Zambia & Zimbabwe.
In the present climate of concern about possible terrorist attack using this
biological agent, it would be valuable to determine the background level of
sporadic cases, for two reasons. One, it would assist disease analysts to
know what is currently occurring around the world in terms of cases of
natural origin, and two, it could unmask preliminary trials by terrorists.
We should remember that both the Aum Shinrikyo sect in Japan recently, and
the sect in Oregon in the 1980's, made small trial attacks before their
major attempts with sarin and Salmonella, respectively.
Please send recent reports of cases of human or animal anthrax that come to
your knowledge to: promed@usa.healthnet.org, NOT to me since I'm travelling
and may be sporadically offline.
