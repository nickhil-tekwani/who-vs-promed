England is seeing a resurgence of scarlet fever with the number of cases reaching a 24-year high, data reveal. Public Health England (PHE) says there have been 868 notified cases in the 1st 8 weeks of 2014, compared to 591 in the same period in 2013. This figure is at its highest for this time of year since 1990.

The bacterial illness causes a distinctive rash, high temperature, and sore throat as well as a white coating on the tongue.

The number of cases normally increases during the winter because scarlet fever bacteria [_Streptococcus pyogenes_, also called Group A streptococci (GAS)] is found in mucus and saliva -- which can be spread through coughing and sneezing. Cases are more common in children although adults can also develop scarlet fever.

Symptoms usually clear up after a week and in the majority of cases remain reasonably mild providing a course of antibiotics is completed to reduce the risk of complications [that is, acute rheumatic fever, acute otitis media, mastoiditis, sinusitis)

Children or adults diagnosed with scarlet fever are advised to stay at home until at least 24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment to avoid passing on the infection. Dr Theresa Lamagni, PHE's head of streptococcal infection surveillance said: "We will continue to closely monitor these increases and work with healthcare professionals to try and halt the spread of infection."

[ProMED-mail recently posted 4 reports on outbreaks of scarlet fever in diverse regions of the UK in the past several weeks: One in Dundee, a city in the Tayside region of Scotland, which lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay (Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (04): (Scotland) RFI 20140306.2317827); a 2nd in the counties of Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset in the South West Region of England (ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (03): (England) RFI 20140304.2311992); a 3rd in the East Midlands Region of England that extends to the North Sea coast (ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (02): England 20140302.2308816), and a 4th in Cumbria in the North West Region of England (ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK: England, alert 20140215.2279072.) The report above suggests that the outbreak may be more generalized, but does not name additional locations, or mention if there are any links among the various regional outbreaks.

Genotypic characterization of outbreak isolates by molecular typing methods such as multilocus sequencing, ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), or random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis will be necessary to see if there is commonality among the outbreak strains. ProMED-mail would appreciate updated information on the epidemiology of the outbreaks in the affected regions, as well as information on the molecular characteristics of the strains of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ involved.
