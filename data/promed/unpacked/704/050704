Mystery Disease Kills 7 in Brazil
----------------------------------
The mayor of a small city [Japeri is considering quarantining 2
neighborhoods where a mysterious illness has killed 7 people and left 43
seriously ill, local media reported Tuesday [14 Jun 2000.
Luiz Barcelos de Vasconcelos, mayor of Japeri, a small municipality on the
outskirts of Rio, said he was waiting for test results on blood samples
sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta,
before deciding whether to isolate the neighborhoods.
A spokesman for the Atlanta agency, Tom Skinner, said it [CDC expects to
receive the blood samples Wednesday [15 Nov 2000 and will then begin
analyzing them.
The first victim was a 15-year-old boy who died on 12 Jun 2000, 5 days
after he was hospitalized complaining of sharp head pains. The next 6
victims died between June and September [2000. All except one of the
victims lived in just 2 neighborhoods -- both without running water.
Symptoms of the disease include sharp muscle pains, headaches, fever,
diarrhea and hemorrhaging. The majority of the deaths occurred less than 5
days after the symptoms first appeared.
Repeated calls to the Japeri mayor's office went unanswered Tuesday. Health
officials said because of a holiday, no one would be available to comment
on the report until Thursday.

[Given the numerous possibilities with the limited clinical information
available, it would be of little help to speculate on the etiology of this
outbreak. With the information above, the GIDEON program identified over 20
infectious agents able to produce a fatal outcome compatible with these
symptoms that are known to have occurred in Brazil. We await further
information. - Man. Ed. DS
