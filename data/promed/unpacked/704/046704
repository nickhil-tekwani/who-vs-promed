At least 81 people fell ill from suspected salmonellosis after eating guinea pig meat and other foods from a vendor at a Minneapolis street festival earlier in August 2013, health officials said. The vendor had a city permit but sold unapproved food and handled it improperly, according to a city spokesman.

The outbreak happened at the Ecuadorean Independence Day celebration at the New York Plaza Produce grocery on 11 Aug 2013. Scores of people went to Hennepin County Medical Center and Children's Hospital of Minneapolis with severe gastrointestinal symptoms after eating the tainted food.

Bill Belknap, a spokesman for Hennepin County Public Health, said some of those who fell ill ate a traditional Ecuadorean dish that contained guinea pig, but others who didn't eat that dish also were sickened. The Minnesota Department of Health said a number of them tested positive for _Salmonella_. Everyone who fell ill was treated and released.

"It was most likely a bad food item or items being poorly handled," Belknap said. "The diseased organism that originated somewhere got spread to other food items by cross-contamination."

The Minnesota Department of Agriculture, which licenses the grocery, took samples of several food products sold at the festival and is testing them to pinpoint the cause of the contamination, said Margaret Hart, a spokeswoman for the department.

[The guinea pig, _Cavia porcellus_, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig), also called the cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family _Caviidae_. Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family, nor are they from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggested they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as _Cavia aperea_, _C. fulgida_, or _C. tschudii_ and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild.

The animals were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cows. Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animal may be served fried, broiled, or roasted, and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume 'sopa' or 'locro de cuy', a soup dish. 'Pachamanca' or 'huatia', a process similar to barbecuing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (chicha) in traditional settings.

As early as 1927, if not earlier, salmonellosis has been recognized to cause infection in guinea pigs (1). Although some infections have been related to common serotypes of _S. enterica_ such as Enteritidis and Typhimurium, more unusual serotypes have been described including Amager (2), Narashino (3), and Limete (4). Salmonellosis spread from guinea pigs to humans is certainly recognized (5, 6) but the moderator could not find English language reports of spread from guinea pig as a foodstuff. It is possible that contamination of the rodent occurred during processing and did not originate in the guinea pig(s) in vivo as has occurred with outbreaks of salmonellosis from fish (see ProMED-mail Salmonellosis, serotype Paratyphi B - USA: raw tuna 20100428.1371).
