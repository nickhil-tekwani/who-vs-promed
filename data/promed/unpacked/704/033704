Having worked for two years recently at the Universiti Putra Malaysia
teaching dog and cat medicine may I please comment on the most recent
report of Nipah positive dogs from the Ipoh region (geographically distant
from the Nipah-affected areas)?
The positive serology in these dogs is consistent with exposure but there
does not seem to be convincing evidence that dogs develop disease from my
reading of the ProMED-mail postings. A number of dogs were identified as
showing "distemper-like" neurological signs during the early reports of the
Nipah virus outbreak, but it should be remembered that canine distemper is
endemic and very common in Malaysia. It is unlikely that any of those farm
dogs were vaccinated - have the distemper serology results been made
available on these dogs? Perhaps it is going to be a case of the more
animals that are tested, the more that will turn out to be positive, but is
that justification enough to destroy them?

[We shall all have to await the release of data that clearly have been
accumulated but not released. I have not information as to the specificity
of the tests being used, at least with respect to whether they are
type-specific or antigenic complex-specific. Until we know this we cannot
judge whether the tests are adequate but with Tom Ksiazek involved in the
testing, I am confident the tests are good ones. One should keep in mind
that whereas canine distemper virus is a member of the family
Paramyxoviridae and Hendra and Nipah viruses are also members of that same
family, the latter two are members of a different genus within the family.
How much if any cross-reactivity occurs between members of different genera
of the family Paramyxoviridae is unknown to me. I do not know whether dogs
become ill after infection with Nipah virus but I wouldn't bet against it.

The state government has banned the unauthorised movement of pigs, dogs and
cats in Kuching, Serian and Sibu districts [of Sarawak, which have been
declared Nipah virus-infected areas. State Secretary Tan Sri Haji Hamid
Bugo said in a government gazette notification that there was reasonable
cause to believe that the Nipah or Hendra-like virus existed among these
animals in the three districts.
Following the coming into force of the Kuching, Serian and Sibu Districts
(Nipah Virus Infected Areas) Order, 1999 on May 14, he said the removal of
the animals into or out of the affected areas was prohibited unless the
animals had been inspected and certified free from Nipah virus infection by
a competent authority. The order took the Kuching and Samarahan Division
Livestock Breeders Association by surprise.
On May 17, state Environment and Public Health Minister Datuk Amar James
Wong Kim Min told the State Assembly that Sarawak had been spared the Nipah
virus and [sic that there were no confirmed cases of JE associated with
commercial pig farms in the state. However, Wong said that health
education on the danger of Nipah virus infection and the need to observe
personal protective measures by pig farm and abattoir workers and those
transporting the animals should be stepped up.
