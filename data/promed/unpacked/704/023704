The Commission today [14 Sep 2010] approved the national programmes
of the 27 Member States to improve the production and marketing of
apiculture products for the period 2011-2013. The EU contribution to
the financing of the programmes has increased by almost 25 percent
compared to the previous period (2008-2010), from Euros 26 million to
32 million [USD 40.6-50 million] per year.

The health of the beekeeping sector is a sensitive issue, given the
fundamental role of bees for pollination. For several years, the
sector has been facing an unprecedented mortality of bees [see
commentary]. This not only makes the economic situation difficult for
beekeepers but also poses a threat to biodiversity. The national
programmes are currently the only tool available to partially offset
the loss of bees. Member States have been satisfied with the benefits
provided by these programmes, and the positive effect of measures
funded under national programmes on the sector is also widely
recognized by the beekeepers.

Against this background, the Commission decided to increase the
overall annual budget allocated for the co-financing of the national
programmes to 32 million Euros [USD 50 million] per year for 2011,
2012 and 2013, compared to the level of EU co-financing that was
available during the period 2008-2010 (26 million Euros). This will
increase the effectiveness of the programmes and demonstrate the
proactive approach of the Commission towards resolving the problems
of a highly sensitive sector.

All Member States have communicated their national beekeeping
programmes to the Commission. The programmes relate to different
measures: Control of varroasis, rationalisation of transhumance,
support for laboratories, restocking of hives, applied research
programmes and technical assistance. All 27 programmes are eligible
for co-financing.

[Although not mentioned by name, the described program addresses the
European aspects of the syndrome which obtained, since 2006, in the
US the title "Colony collapse disorder of honey bees, CCD." A
somewhat milder syndrome in Europe has initially been coined "Honey
Bee Depopulation Syndrome (HBDS)." The etiology of the said, serious
syndrome(s) is not yet satisfactorily understood/clarified.

According to the annex of the above EU press release, the total
number of bee-hives in the 27 Member States, in 2010, is 13 985 091.
The leading states are Mediterranean, namely: Spain (2 459 373 bee
hives), Greece (1 502 239), France (1 338 650), Romania (1 280 000),
Italy (1 127 836) and Portugal (1 123 356). - Mod.AS]
