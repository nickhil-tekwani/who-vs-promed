[The presence of West Nile Virus (WNV) in Europe was 1st recorded in 1958. Since then, the virus has caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of human and equine disease, predominantly in southern countries. In general, WNV circulates silently in resident and migratory birds present in Europe, presumably reflecting co-evolution of virus and some avian hosts over a long period (Gould et al. 2006 EID 12: 549-555). However, there are sporadic outbreaks or isolated cases in native bird species. - Mod.PMB
