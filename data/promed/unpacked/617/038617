Camels may be a carrier of the mysterious virus that has infected at least 94 people in the Middle East and killed half of them, scientists are reporting.

The virus, first detected last year [2012] in Saudi Arabia, causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which begins with flulike symptoms and can progress to severe pneumonia. Because the virus belongs to a family called coronaviruses, often found in bats, researchers suspect that it originally came from bats. The bats might infect people through droppings or saliva, but they might also infect other animals that could then transmit the virus to humans. But which animals? Researchers have been scrambling to find out.

Now, a scientific team from a dozen universities is reporting that dromedary camels (the kind with one hump) from Oman and the Canary Islands show signs of past infection with the MERS virus or one very much like it. Researchers tested blood samples from 50 female retired racing camels in Oman, and 105 used in the tourist industry in the Canary Islands. The blood tests did not find the virus itself, but did find antibodies to it ­- highly specific proteins that the immune system makes to fight off an infection ­- in all the camels from Oman, and 14 percent of the ones from the Canary Islands. Other animals were also tested ­- sheep, goats, camels, llamas and alpacas ­- but none had MERS antibodies.

Writing in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, the researchers say their findings need to be verified by other studies, but meanwhile, detailed case histories should be taken of people who have had MERS to find out if they had been exposed to camels or their milk or meat.

Some researchers praised the study. Dr W Ian Lipkin, a virus expert at Columbia University who has been studying MERS, said, "I think it's compelling evidence that dromedaries are infected with MERS or a related coronavirus." The study does not prove that the animals have infected humans, he added, but he said it was plausible because people in the Middle East have a great deal of contact with camels as racing animals, pets, and sources of food.

William Karesh, a veterinarian and executive vice president of EcoHealth Alliance, a group also studying MERS, said that finding the virus itself in an animal would be stronger and more convincing evidence. But he said the new research was well done and added, "All the clues in a mystery are valuable."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
----------
A new betacoronavirus -­ Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ­- has been identified in patients with severe acute respiratory infection. Although related viruses infect bats, molecular clock analyses have been unable to identify direct ancestors of MERS-CoV. Anecdotal exposure histories suggest that patients had been in contact with dromedary camels or goats. We investigated possible animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock.

Methods
-------
We took sera from animals in the Middle East (Oman) and from elsewhere (Spain, Netherlands, Chile). Cattle (n=80), sheep (n=40), goats (n=40), dromedary camels (n=155), and various other camelid species (n=34) were tested for specific serum IgG by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S1 subunits of spike proteins of MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human coronavirus OC43. Results were confirmed by virus neutralisation tests for MERS-CoV and bovine coronavirus.

Findings
--------
50 of 50 (100 percent) sera from Omani camels and 15 of 105 (14 percent) from Spanish camels had protein-specific antibodies against MERS-CoV spike. Sera from European sheep, goats, cattle, and other camelids had no such antibodies. MERS-CoV neutralising antibody titres varied between 1/320 and 1/2560 for the Omani camel sera and between 1/20 and 1/320 for the Spanish camel sera. There was no evidence for cross-neutralisation by bovine coronavirus antibodies.

Interpretation
--------------
MERS-CoV or a related virus has infected camel populations. Both titres and seroprevalences in sera from different locations in Oman suggest widespread infection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 2 Aug 2013, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 94 human cases ­- with most having severe respiratory disease; 46 of these patients have died. Cases have been reported in Jordan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Tunisia. All cases detected outside the Arabian Peninsula were linked to one of the Middle Eastern countries, either as a result of travel to those countries or through transmission from a person thought to have acquired the infection there.

The high similarity of MERS-CoV to virus sequences detected in bats suggests that it originates from bats. However, no one with the disease reported having direct contact with bats and bat-to-human transmission seems unlikely. The large geographical area of the MERS-CoV outbreak across the Arabian Peninsula, the sequence variation between isolates, and the projected date of emergence some time before the 1st human cases were reported, suggest multiple zoonotic introductions of MERS-CoV and could indicate the involvement of an intermediate host.

In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Chantal Reusken and colleagues provide some insight into one potential animal reservoir that might be involved in the emergence of MERS-CoV in people ­- for the 1st time since the discovery of the virus a year ago [2012]. They detected neutralising antibodies in 100 percent of serum samples from 50 dromedary camels collected in Oman in March 2013. Surprisingly, 15 (14 percent) of 105 of dromedary camels from the Canary Islands (Spain) also had such antibodies. Serum samples collected from various other livestock species did not contain MERS-CoV-specific antibodies, although they were not collected in the same area as the camels, thereby potentially indicating geographical rather than host restriction.

Whether the camels were infected with MERS-CoV itself or with a closely related virus is unclear. No human cases of infection have been reported in Oman so far, despite its proximity to countries with human cases and the high prevalence of neutralising antibodies against the virus in the local camel population. The detection of sequences similar to MERS-CoV in bats in Africa, the Americas, and Eurasia, and the presence of neutralising antibodies in camels from the Canary Islands suggest that MERS-CoV-like viruses have a wide geographical distribution. The absence of an association between the high prevalence of neutralising antibodies and morbidity or mortality in camels suggests that circulation of MERS-CoV-like viruses in camels might go undetected. This fact begs the question of whether the detection of MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies in camels from both Spain and Oman is a result of unrelated cross-species transmission events or whether the virus has been circulating in camels for a long time. Regardless, a change in the ecology of MERS-CoV must have occurred to enable emergence in people. This change could have been genetic, enabling the virus to efficiently replicate in the human respiratory tract, as happened with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which acquired the ability to bind to human ACE2. Alternatively, an environmental or agricultural change could have enabled the introduction of MERS-CoV into a new host species, similar to the establishment of pig farming in Malaysia that enabled cross-species transmission of Nipah virus into pigs and subsequent spillover to people.

The report by Reusken and colleagues stresses the urgent need for an integrated, one health, approach by public and veterinary health stakeholders in all involved countries, combined with the rapid dissemination of data. Extensive serosurveys should be done across the Arabian Peninsula, in people, livestock, and wild animal species, combined with virological testing where possible, to identify the potential reservoirs of MERS-CoV. In the absence of prophylactic or therapeutic treatment options for MERS-CoV, blocking zoonotic and human-to-human transmission could be the most promising and cost-effective method to prevent further human fatalities. However, doing so requires knowledge of the virus' hosts. Although the study by Reusken and colleagues leaves many questions unanswered, it is an important step to a more comprehensive understanding of the emergence of MERS-CoV.

[The following passage (excluding references) is derived from the discussion chapter of the paper (item 2 above):

"The high prevalence of MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies in dromedary camels from Oman suggests circulation of MERS-CoV or a closely related virus in this population. However, attempts to identify viral sequences in Spanish camel sera and faecal samples using pancoronavirus and specific betacoronavirus 2C PCR methods were unsuccessful (unpublished data), as was untargeted amplification followed by deep sequencing of faecal samples (unpublished data). These results imply that the camels were not actively shedding the virus at the time of sampling.

"Less than 10 percent of the animals in the Canary Islands had MERS-CoV neutralising sera with titres up to 1/320. This low seroprevalence means either that exposure of the animals to other putative reservoirs is rare or that the virus is absent in this closed-off population of roughly 2000 animals. We cannot rule out that the population might have once had an outbreak but that by the time of sampling, antibody titres had waned and no new introductions of the virus had occurred. The camels have contact with wild rodents, rabbits, pigeons, and doves and possibly also with bats. 7 insectivorous bat species, including 3 _Pipistrellus_ spp, are native to the Canary Islands, while Egyptian fruit bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) have been introduced.

The 100 percent seroprevalence with high titres in Omani camels from different owners and locations suggests a different situation in the Middle East, with widespread circulation of MERS-CoV or a closely related virus. This difference of epidemiology might be because the virus circulating in the Middle East is different to that circulating in Spain, with increased animal transmissibility and human infections. In addition, the Omani camels were once racing camels now held for breeding and might be kept in circumstances that favour virus transmission. For cattle, a relation has been established between the incidence and effects of respiratory diseases, management practices, and animal transport.

To our knowledge, the camel populations in Oman and the Canary Islands are not connected. Camels on the Canary Islands were originally imported in the 15th century from the Horn of Africa for labour and transport. Nowadays, import of animals from Africa is banned because of the risk of foot-and-mouth disease. Only 3 camels in our study were originally imported from Morocco, more than 18 years ago. Because the closest relatives of MERS-CoV were identified very recently in _Neoromicia zuluensis_ bats from Africa, the introduction of MERS-CoV or related viruses into some African camel populations could have occurred decades ago, giving a possible explanation for MERS-CoV antibodies in camels from the Canary Islands. In the Middle East, huge numbers of camels are imported from Africa to meet the demand for meat. The top 5 camel breeding countries are all African, and Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are in the top 5 camel meat producing countries. This increased turnover of animals in the Middle East compared with the Canary Islands could also affect the epidemiology of a virus, through more frequent influx of immunologically naive animals."

".... In the meantime we recommend a detailed case history of people with MERS-CoV, with review of any animal exposures including animal products, and targeted, prospective serosurveys to establish whether camels or their products are a potential source of human infections."

Since the tested Omani camels "were once racing camels", it would be interesting to note if (and when) they had visited racing events in foreign territories (probably, within the Arabian Peninsula) in the past. No other species were sampled/tested in Oman.

According to the original full text, the origins of the "foreign" tested sera were from the Netherlands (reportedly, 40 cattle, 40 goats, 40 sheep, 2 llamas, 6 alpacas and 2 Bactrian camels _Camelus bactrianus_), Chile (2 Bactrian camels, 18 alpacas, 5 llamas, 2 guanaco), and Spain (40 goats).

The animal population of Oman (OIE's 2012 data) is the following:
Species / population / density (units per square km)
Cattle / 346 224 / 1.63
Goats / 1 799 850 / 8.47
Camelidae / 134 274 / 0.63
Sheep / 403 196 / 1.90

As de Wit and Munster rightly state in their comment, the demonstration of 'protein-specific antibodies against MERS-CoV spike' in Omani (and some Canary Islands') camels potentially indicate geographical rather than host restriction. It would be useful to obtain information on the serological situation in Omani small and large ruminants.

The described, commendable, initial surveillance project should be accompanied (as the commentators suggest) by extensive serosurveys across the Arabian Peninsula, in people, livestock, and wild animal species, combined with virological testing where possible, to identify the potential reservoirs of MERS-CoV.
