[1] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 6 new cases

Six more polio cases have surfaced in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, after which the 2019 tally in the province has mounted to 97.

The Health Ministry said the new cases, 4 girls and 2 boys, have emerged from Lakki Marwat and Torghar districts. As the samples of the affected children were taken in December 2019, therefore, the tally will be counted in the 2019 cases. The overall 2019 toll in the country stands at 141 after emergence of fresh polio cases. This has made 2019 one of the worst years for Pakistan polio eradication efforts.

The main cause behind the emergence of so many polio cases is refusal of parents to cooperate with the vaccination teams. According to media reports citing Health Ministry data, over a million parents refused to cooperate with vaccination teams in 2019. Most of the refusal cases were reported in April last year [2019] when rumours spread in Peshawar that many children had fainted after consuming vaccination drops.

A total of 1 089 087 parents refused to give vaccination drops to their children in 2019. In April last year [2019], 694 984 refusal cases were reported.

The emergence of so many polio cases in Pakistan, particularly in KP, has brought the federal and provincial governments under pressure over their performance and strategy to control the spread of disease.

Experts believe that polio vaccination efforts cannot succeed completely until the refusing parents are convinced to cooperate with vaccination teams. They say Ulema can play a crucial role in removing misconceptions about vaccination. The EOC Coordinator Abdul Basit says provision of vaccination to each and every child below the age of 5 years is a must to eliminate the disease from the country.

Currently, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only 2 countries in the world that have not fully eradicated polio. The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has declared 2019 a horrible year for the Pakistan polio eradication programme, mainly due to politicisation of the programme.

The fresh polio cases have surfaced in KP 4 days after emergence of 6 cases in the country, including 2 in KP, i.e. Lakki Marwat and Dera Ismail Khan.

[The addition of these 6 newly confirmed cases will bring the tally for WPV1 associated polio in Pakistan during 2019 to 141, and the global total of WPV1 associated cases during 2019 to 169.

A team of doctors on Monday [13 Jan 2020] took blood samples of an 8 [month] old girl suspected to have polio virus in Tando Allahyar district.

According to doctors, the 8-month-old [girl] from Chambar taluka of Tando Allahyar district was suspected to have polio virus.

On receiving the information, a team consisting of 5 doctors visited the village and took samples of the affected baby.

The doctors have sent these samples to Islamabad laboratory for further confirmation.

They said the girl seemed to have been affected by polio virus but could only be confirmed after receiving the report from Islamabad laboratory.

[I do not usually flag articles on suspected cases of polio, as there are many other etiologies for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), the key syndrome that is used for surveillance for polio worldwide. What is unusual here is that there is an article in the local press about a suspected case, signaling a heightened awareness for polio surveillance. It is quite unusual to find articles on suspected cases in Pakistan or Afghanistan. Countries that have interrupted transmission of the wild poliovirus (WPV) will periodically have media reports on suspected cases.

There are no details on this suspected case other than age and location of residence. Date of onset of paralysis will be important to determine whether this case occurred in 2019 or 2020, as well as vaccination history.

We await further information on whether the child has laboratory evidence of poliovirus infection (either WPV or cVDPV -- circulating vaccine derived poliovirus -- which was identified in Pakistan during 2019). - Mod.MPP
