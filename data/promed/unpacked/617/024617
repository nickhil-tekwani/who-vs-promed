Hundreds of dead seabirds washed ashore this week and dozens more were
found dying on beaches spanning almost the entire Florida east coast.
No one knows why, but scientists suspect starvation. Frantic
beachcombers dropped off about 130 greater shearwaters -- gull-like
birds that prefer the open ocean -- to Brevard County rescue centers
in the past 3 days. The die-off of birds ranged about 300 miles
(about 483 km), from Hobe Sound in Martin County to South Ponte Vedra
Beach in St. Johns County.
Scientists suspect recent winds and currents disrupted the birds'
food fish supply. But they also plan tests to rule out algal toxins,
bird flu, parasites, metals, and other common causes of seabird
deaths.
"The preliminary findings indicate starvation," said Wendy Quigley,
spokeswoman with the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute in St.
Petersburg. "We're basically seeing emaciated birds."
The institute received reports of at least 200 carcasses along the
East Coast since Saturday [16 Jun 2007].
"As only one species appears to be affected, and the sick and dead
birds have similar symptoms, we believe the seabirds are suffering
from the same ailment," said Dan Wolf, research biologist at the
institute.
A similar but much less severe shearwater die-off happened in 2005.
Shearwaters are one of the few birds that breed in the south and
migrate north. They loop the Atlantic, 1st breeding on South Atlantic
islands, then heading up the eastern seaboard of South America and
North America around this time of year, ultimately crossing the
Atlantic in late summer. Storms at sea can weaken, dehydrate, sicken,
or kill them. They feed on fish and squid, diving from great heights
to chase their prey underwater with partly open wings and paddling
feet.
Local birders have been chatting online this week about all the
shearwaters they see flying south -- the wrong way for the birds'
usual summer migration -- in what the observers believe is a
desperate search for food. "There's been a lot of buzz," said David
Simpson, a state park service specialist at St. Sebastian River
Preserve. He suspects sparsely scattered tuna may be contributing to
the die-off. Fishermen in South Florida recently have reported
difficulty finding schools of tuna because strong easterly winds
dispersed the fish. The shearwaters follow the schools of tuna
because the larger fish scare smaller bait fish to the surface, where
shearwaters can snatch them.
People have been flooding animal rehabilitation centers along most of
Florida's East Coast with dying shearwaters. At least 120 in 3 days
were brought to the Florida Wildlife Hospital and Sanctuary in Palm
Shores. Half were dead days later.
"It's difficult to test enough to isolate the problem," Sue Small,
the hospital's director, said over squabbles from about 50
shearwaters in the sanctuary's cages. About 10 shearwaters were
brought to the Wildlife Care Center in Canaveral Groves in the past
few days. All died. The center fielded calls about 10 other sickly
shearwaters that it referred to state wildlife officials.
"This has got to be something big with all of them dropping dead,"
said Jennifer Sypien, president and director of the Wildlife Care
Center. She recently treated birds with botulism and heartworm-like
parasites but didn't know if that's what's killing the shearwaters.
"I haven't heard of any of them surviving," she said. "It's a
tragedy. One after another is just dropping dead." Small said usually
only 10 to 15 percent can be saved. "We hate not to try," she said,
"even though we don't have a very good success rate."
The die-off is reminiscent of March 2003, when about 200 gannets
washed in either dead or starving on Brevard beaches. The cause was
never determined, but some fishermen guessed a temporary lack of bait
fish.
Harmful algae blooms also can cause bait fish declines or can emit
toxins that kill birds. No such blooms have been detected this week
in Florida. And no beach advisories or warnings of high bacteria
levels have been issued this week in Brevard.
Nonetheless, Mendy Gaither of Salisbury, N.C., worried Tuesday [19
Jun 2007] about the water off Satellite Beach. "We kept seeing the
dead birds," Gaither said. "There doesn't seem to be that many birds
here."

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) has
received reports of more than 200 dead or sick greater shearwaters, a
gull-like bird, since Saturday [16 Jun 2007], along Florida's east
coast. The birds have been found from Hobe Sound in Martin County to
South Ponte Vedra Beach in St. Johns County.
Local wildlife rehabilitators report receiving numerous emaciated and
dehydrated birds as well. FWC biologists are examining the dead birds
to investigate the cause of this die-off. Researchers with FWC's Fish
and Wildlife Research Institute are calling the die-off of birds
significant and have collected some of the birds for testing. Initial
necropsy results are not definitive; however, preliminary findings
indicate starvation during the migration process played a role.
Additional test results are pending.
"As only one species appears to be affected and the sick and dead
birds have similar symptoms, we believe the seabirds are suffering
from the same ailment," said Dan Wolf, research biologist. "In 2005, a
similar, but less severe shearwater die-off occurred." [Not reported
by ProMED. The 2004 Florida die-off was of multiple species -- see
ProMED refs. below. - Mod.JW].
According to the Peterson Field Guide for Eastern Birds, shearwaters
spend their lives at sea, well offshore in the open ocean except for
when they breed, nest, and rear young. Greater shearwaters breed
primarily on Tristan da Cunha Island in the South Atlantic and wander
the sea north to Greenland and Iceland, and back. Storms at sea can
weaken the birds and cause them to become sick, dehydrated, and die.
The public can assist the investigation by reporting sick, injured,
or dead birds online at <http://myfwc.com/bird/>. The public is asked
not to handle birds and to contact a local wildlife rehabilitative
facility for assistance with sick or injured birds.
The online wild bird mortality database is a cooperative program
between FWC and the Florida Department of Health to monitor bird health.

[If the preliminary necropsy results indicate starvation, then likely
the final results will too. Birds that stay out at sea face adverse
weather conditions making feeding difficult to impossible.
