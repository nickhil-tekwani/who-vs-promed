A deadly fish virus spreading through upstate New York has been
detected in 3 new locations and for the 1st time has been found in
rainbow trout, one of the state's top game fish, state scientists
said Monday [23 Jul 2007].
Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) was found in fish taken from the
Little Salmon River in Oswego County and the Seneca-Cayuga Canal, as
well as an isolated farm pond in Niagara County, the state Department
of Environmental Conservation (DEC) said.
Fish infected with VHS have been previously documented from Lake
Ontario, Lake Erie, the Niagara River, the St. Lawrence River,
Conesus Lake, and Skaneateles Lake.
"It's perplexing because we can only guesstimate at this point as to
where it's going to pop up next," said Doug Stang, chief of the New
York DEC's Bureau of Fisheries, which is monitoring 40 bodies of
water to track the spread of VHS.
The virus, which causes internal bleeding in fish but poses no threat
to humans, was discovered in the United States in 1988 in Coho and
Chinook salmon in the Pacific Northwest. VHS made its 1t known
appearance in the Great Lakes in 2005, killing freshwater drum and muskellunge.
In New York, VHS has been identified in nearly 2 dozen species since
1st appearing last year [2006], including muskellunge, the state's
No. 2 sport fish.
In May [2007], the DEC finalized regulations to help prevent the
spread of VHS and other diseases into New York's inland waters. The
regulations restrict the movement of baitfish and the stocking of
fish into New York's waters.
Despite the measures, though, VHS continues to spread. There is no
known cure for VHS, which has caused fish kills in New York ranging
from a few to thousands of fish.
"We haven't seen it east of Syracuse yet, and that's good. We are
hoping that the steps we are taking will keep it from spreading," Stang said.
In the Little Salmon River, which empties into Lake Ontario, a single
rainbow trout tested positive for VHS, the 1st detection of the virus
in rainbow trout found in New York. The canal is separated from Lake
Ontario by a series of locks along the Oswego and Erie canals.
VHS-positive sunfish were collected during a fish kill in the
Seneca-Cayuga Canal, which is separated from Lake Ontario by a series
of locks and dams.
Sunfish and koi were found to be VHS positive at a 1-acre (0.4
hectares) farm pond in Ransomville. The property owner reported that
all the fish in the pond died. However, Stang noted that the owner
had transferred fish from nearby Twelve Mile Creek during the summer
of 2006 as part of a fish rescue operation. The transferred fish were
the likely cause of VHS being introduced to the pond's fish population.
"We still haven't identified the transport mechanism but we know
transferring fish from one waterway to another is a sure way to
spread it," Stang said.

[Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) virus is an extremely serious
pathogen of fresh and saltwater fish, and is causing an emerging
disease in the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada.
VHS has been found specifically in the waters of Lake Huron, Lake St.
Clair, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the St. Lawrence River. Due to
its high mortality and severe economic consequences, VHS is
classified as a reportable disease by the World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE).
How VHS was transferred to the Great Lakes or how long it has been in
the ecosystem is not known.
The disease transmits easily between fish of all ages. Mortality is
highest at low water temperatures between 37 and 54 deg F (2.7 - 12.2
deg C). Some fish will show no external signs while others show signs
that include bulging eyes, bloated abdomens, inactive or overactive
behavior, and hemorrhaging in the eyes, skin, gills, and at the base
of the fins. Infected fish may also have lesions that look like those
caused by other fish diseases. Therefore, testing is necessary to
determine whether the fish is infected.
