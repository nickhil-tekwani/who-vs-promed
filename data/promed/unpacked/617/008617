Ebola-Reston cull
-----------------
I was rather dismayed to read about the cull of pigs in the
Philippines [see ProMED-mail postings 20090226.0799 and
20090301.0849] for the following reasons:

1. I understand that infection experiments will be carried out at the
AAHL [Australian Animal Health Laboratory] in Geelong, Australia, to
determine more precisely what effect if any the virus has on the
health of pigs and how it is transmitted -- surely any drastic action
could await these results.

2. If massive culling is carried out for 'incidental findings' (as
this was) that are not linked to known disease, we may have no farm
animals left. Even for actual epizootic diseases, there is a serious
re-think about this approach to control (see Alternatives to animal
disposal including the use of foresight technology and
agri-intelligence. Veterinaria Italiana 2007, 43(2): 197-8 [available
at <http://www.izs.it/vet_italiana/2007/43_2/197_198.pdf>]).

3. Most importantly -- stun guns, electric or otherwise, stun pigs --
they do not kill them, which is why the throat is cut immediately
following stunning in an abattoir. Most of the pigs will be burnt
alive. Stun guns are dismayingly often recommended for 'humane'
killing but unless followed by bleeding out the method is very far
from humane.

[For OIE's internationally agreed recommendations for the killing of
animals for disease control purposes, see chapter 7.6 of the
Terrestrial Animal Health Code at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.7.6.htm>.

Article 7.6.5 presents a table summarising the killing methods
described in Articles 7.6.6-7.6.18 of the chapter. This table
includes the following 6 columns: species; age range; procedure;
restraint necessary; animal welfare concerns with inappropriate
application; article reference.

According to the table, the following killing methods are applicable to pigs:
7.6.6. Free bullet
7.6.7. Penetrating captive bolt
7.6.8. Non-penetrating captive bolt
7.6.10. Electrical -- two-stage application
7.6.11. Electrical -- single application
7.6.12. CO2 / air mixture (under study)
7.6.13. Nitrogen and/or inert gas mixed with CO2
7.6.14. Nitrogen and/or inert gases
7.6.15. Lethal injection

All methods, excluding 7.6.6 (free bullet), necessitate restraint of
the animals. - Mod.AS]
