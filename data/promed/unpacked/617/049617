[The OIE reports above include maps showing the location of the outbreaks.
An administrative map of South Korea is available at
<http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/korea-south-admin-map.jpg>. The
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the Republic of South Korea
showing Ch'ungch'ong-bukdo can be accessed at
<http://healthmap.org/r/01dM>. Inch'on-jikhalsi district can be seen at
<http://healthmap.org/r/01dL>. - Mods.PC/FE

While the outbreak in the mainland within the Ch'ungch'ong-bukdo province
maybe a new one, the other 2 occurring in Ganghwa Island and Gimpo City
both in Inch'on-jikhalsi Municipality are follow-ups of an outbreak
starting earlier this month (April 2010). Ganghwa island and Gimpo City are
very near the serotype O outbreak reported to OIE on 10 Apr 2010 (see
ProMED-mail Foot & mouth disease, bovine - S Korea (09): conf, serotype O,
OIE 20100410.1168). However, the outbreak reported today is near the center
of the country, in the heart of the mainland and is likewise a serotype O.
It is unclear why there is a new immediate notification rather than another
"follow-up report" in the previous series -- that is, "follow-up no. 3."

Either way, there is an implication here that a single or multiple
serotypes causing disease is spreading further in the country despite the
rigorous control measures being applied to stamp out the disease. Of
further note, is that these series of reports are affecting multiple animal
species including swine, dairy cattle, and goats. - Mods.FE/PC]
