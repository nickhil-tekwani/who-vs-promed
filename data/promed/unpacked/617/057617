A man in Keelung City has been diagnosed with hantavirus, the 1st case in northern Taiwan this year [2020] and the 4th nationwide. The patient, who is in his 40s, is a restaurant worker in the port city. He developed symptoms of the disease, including fever, diarrhea, and muscle pain, on [10 Apr 2020].

He was hospitalized on [11 Apr 2020], but the 1st screening failed to identify the cause of the illness. A 2nd test was conducted on 27 Apr [2020] and led to a confirmed diagnosis of [a] hantavirus [infection]on Tuesday [5 May 2020], according to the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The patient reported seeing rats, the carriers of the virus, at his workplace but said he had not been bitten. Sterilization and pest control have been conducted at locations he has visited, and those who have come into contact with him have not developed any symptoms.

Health authorities in Keelung urged restaurants, hotels, markets, food stalls, and food factories to beef up measures against rodents. Residents are advised to sterilize areas contaminated by rodent excrement with diluted bleach.

Hantavirus [infection] is contracted through contact with rodent urine and feces or rodent bites. Symptoms include fever, muscle pain, headache, abdominal pain, and flushing. Some patients experience hemorrhaging, shock, and renal failure.

[Taiwan has had sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in recent years. The circumstances under which the individual above acquired his hantavirus infection are not given, nor does the report above indicate which hantavirus is involved in this and in previous cases. However, the patient's mention that rats were observed in the workplace leads one to suspect Seoul hantavirus, assuming that the rats observed were brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_), the natural host of this virus.

In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in the brown rat, _Rattus norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in China.

The hantavirus most likely involved in the case above in Taiwan is Seoul virus harbored by _Rattus_ spp, as was the case in 2010 (see ProMED-mail 20100415.1221). People become infected when exposed to the virus in excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) of infected rats. It is not necessary to have contact with liquid urine; dust particles contaminated with dried urine may be inhaled.

An image of the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_, a reservoir of Seoul virus, can be seen at http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg. - Mod.TY
