Apprehension as mumps cases increase
------------------------------------
Doctors have warned parents to vaccinate their children following a
dramatic rise in the number of mumps cases. Public health experts are
blaming the upsurge on the numbers of youngsters missing out on vaccination
boosters. Controversy continues over the safety of the [combined measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Doctors say the increase in mumps cases
illustrates the importance of protecting children against the disease.
The problem is particularly bad in northern England. Nearly half of all
cases of the [disease in England and Wales are in Yorkshire and the north
east. Bradford and Leeds [have both recorded far more outbreaks of the
illness than last year. Dr Martin Schweiger, consultant in public health at
Leeds Health Authority, said: "This increase shows it is vital that
youngsters are vaccinated against these illnesses. If parents do not ensure
their children are protected then there will be a real price to pay later."
According to the latest figures from the Public Health Laboratory Service,
there were 176 cases of mumps in Leeds in the first 3 months of 2001,
compared with 18 over the same period last year. In Bradford there were 153
cases of the illness between Jan and Mar 2001 and only 5 in the first 3
months of 2000.
Health experts said the rise was expected because youngsters were not given
boosters against mumps. Children were immunised against measles and rubella
in separate booster injections. These did not offer protection against
mumps. Dr Schweiger said: "It was thought that there was going to be a rise
in the cases of measles and rubella so we embarked on a massive
immunisation programme and offered protection to every child in the UK.
This has kept levels of these illnesses down. We would have offered a
similar vaccination for mumps but there were insufficient supplies."
Some parents are refusing to allow their children to have the injection
because of fears that the MMR vaccine could be linked to autism. The
Department of Health, however, backed by the overwhelming majority of
medical opinion, insists that the [triple vaccine is safe. About a third
of those affected in the latest mumps cases were aged over 15, when the
impact of the disease can be more serious. Dr Schweiger said: "In older
children mumps can lead to inflammation of the brain or pancreas. There is
no cure and all we can do is make sufferers as comfortable as possible.
There can be no stronger warning against not having your children immunised
than this increase in cases of mumps." All children are offered the chance
to have the MMR vaccine within their first 2 years and a booster is given
before they start school.

[The previous report in this thread recorded a similar upsurge in the
number of mumps cases in Northern Ireland. It is unfortunate that public
suspicion of the triple MMR vaccine remains unallayed, despite the best
efforts of the UK government and medical profession. The 2-dose trivalent
vaccine has been administered to children in Finland over a period of 17
years (1983-1999) and has interrupted circulation of the target viruses. As
a result in 1999 Finland became the first country documented to be free of
indigenous mumps and rubella (measles was eliminated in 1996). - Mod.CP
