Monkeypox multi-country outbreak -- 2nd update
----------------------------------------------
Since early May [2022], and as of 11 Oct 2022, 20 455 confirmed cases of monkeypox (MPX) have been reported from 29 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries, including 4 deaths. As of 30 Sep [2022], MPX confirmed cases reported from EU/EEA countries represented almost 1/3 (29.7%) of the cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) globally (68 267 cases).

Executive summary
-----------------
The weekly number of MPX cases reported in the EU/EEA peaked in July 2022 and a steady declining trend has been observed since, with only a few cases being reported at the time of this update. Multiple factors have probably contributed to the decline of this outbreak, including efforts in risk communication and community engagement, increasing immunity in the most affected population due to natural immunity and vaccination, and a decrease after the summer in large cultural and social events frequented by the main risk groups for this outbreak.

The majority of cases continue to be detected in males between 18 and 50 years (87%), and primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM). Summer mass gatherings and specific sexual practices have facilitated the transmission of MPX among MSM groups until now. Sporadic cases in women and children have also been reported. Cases in the current outbreak continue to present with a spectrum of symptoms and signs that differs from what has been described in past outbreaks of MPX in endemic countries. In general, cases have presented in this outbreak with relatively mild symptoms although some patients describe significant discomfort, pain, and complications. From the total number of cases reported in the EU/EEA, 1.1% have required hospitalisation for clinical care and 5 cases were admitted to intensive care.

Based on the evidence in the current outbreak and the declining number of new infections, the overall risk of MPX infection is assessed as moderate for MSM and low for the broader population.

Early diagnosis, isolation, and effective contact tracing, supported by appropriate vaccination strategies remain key for the effective control of this outbreak. Mass vaccination against MPX is currently not required nor recommended. Considering limitations in vaccine supplies, primary preventive vaccination (PPV) and post-exposure preventive vaccination (PEPV) strategies may be combined focusing on individuals at substantially higher risk of exposure and close contacts of cases, respectively. PPV strategies should prioritise gay, bisexual, or other men or transgender people who have sex with men who are at higher risk of exposure based on epidemiological or behavioural criteria. Individuals at risk for occupational exposure should be considered based on risk assessment. Vaccination strategies will need to be kept under review as evidence on effectiveness is accumulated and adapted to the situation in each country according to the trajectory of the outbreak.

While some encouraging preliminary evidence is emerging on the performance of the MVA-BN vaccine, more robust data on vaccine efficacy and effectiveness is needed. Targeted national vaccination programmes should be implemented within a framework of collaborative research and clinical trial protocols with standardised data collection tools for clinical and outcome data. Health promotion interventions and community engagement are also critical to ensure effective outreach and high vaccine acceptance and uptake among those most at risk of exposure.

Despite the improving epidemiological situation, it is important to continue active risk communication and community engagement efforts with the affected population to prevent a resurgence. Activities to increase awareness of health professionals across specialties should also continue in order to ensure prompt diagnosis and the appropriate management of cases and contacts. Testing services for orthopoxvirus should be available, while support to sexual health services is important to the continuation of case detection, contact tracing, and management of cases.

Future considerations for the evolution of the MPX outbreak and for preventing similar outbreaks are outlined, including the scenario that the outbreak resurges, it causes a continued low number of new cases almost exclusively among MSM, which is considered more likely currently, MPX wanes, and finally, it is eliminated in EU/EEA countries through concerted efforts in the European region.

What's new in this update
-------------------------
This update was triggered by the continuous decline in case numbers since the end of July 2022. It includes an updated risk assessment for the most affected sub-population and health professionals based on evidence from this outbreak and new information on MPX vaccine effectiveness. It reinforces the need for continued investment in the response to the MPX outbreak and finally, it includes a section on considerations for the evolution of the outbreak and for preventing similar outbreaks with qualitative scenarios.

Liu J, Mucker EM, Chapman JL, et al. Retrospective detection of monkeypox virus in the testes of nonhuman primate survivors. Nat Microbiol. 2022. Epub ahead of print
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Close contact through sexual activity has been associated with the spread of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in the ongoing, global 2022 epidemic. However, it remains unclear whether MPXV replicates in the testes or is transmitted via semen to produce an active infection. We carried out a retrospective analysis of MPXV-infected crab-eating macaque archival tissue samples from acute and convalescent phases of infection of clade I or clade II MPXV using immunostaining and RNA in situ hybridization. We detected MPXV in interstitial cells and seminiferous tubules of testes as well as epididymal lumina, which are the sites of sperm production and maturation. We also detected inflammation and necrosis during the acute phase of the disease by histological analysis. Finally, we found that MPXV was cleared from most organs during convalescence, including healed skin lesions, but could be detected for up to 37âd post-exposure in the testes of convalescent macaques. Our findings highlight the potential for sexual transmission of MPXV in humans.

[re: ProMED post Monkeypox update (90): cases, observations 20221018.8706218]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The article states that the physician, "was wearing the recommended personal protective equipment; the gloves appeared intact to him, and there was no wound or bleeding." In other words, at the time it didn't appear to the physician that the needle had even touched his skin, although obviously, it had. It should be emphasized again that sharps should be avoided in these situations, but if sharps are used, even the slightest hint of a possible needle touch, even through an apparently intact barrier, should be reported and prophylaxis given.
