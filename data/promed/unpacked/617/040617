Australian health authorities issued a national alert on Tuesday after
eight people, including two babies, were diagnosed with the potentially
fatal, mosquito-borne virus Australian Encephalitis [Murray valley
encephalitis or Kunjin encephalitis. - Mod. CHC. The outbreak of the
disease was described by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia New
Zealand (CDNANZ) as the worst since 1974. Five people died from Australian
Encephalitis between 1987-93.
CDNANZ spokeswoman Dr Vicki Krause said above-average rain and flooding in
central Australia had resulted in large-scale breeding of mosquito types
able to transmit the virus. She warned people to protect themselves from
mosquito bites.
Krause said eight cases of the disease had been confirmed in the Northern
Territory in the country's far north and in Western Australia state in the
past two weeks. The cases from the Northern Territory included two babies
aged two months and three months, a four-year-old child and an elderly man.
One of the babies was in a critical condition in a hospital in Adelaide,
South Australia. In Western Australia, a 45-year-old man was in a serious
but stable condition in hospital after being infected while travelling in
the country's northwest in early April.
