Favourable conditions [for the fungus] experienced late in the 2013 season have led to the outbreak of the soil-borne fungal disease sclerotinia in canola crops across the Wheatbelt [region of WA].

The emergence of the disease is a concern for affected growers, who were set to reap the benefits of a bumper season but will now likely experience yield losses in severely affected crops. According to the Department of Agriculture and Food (DAFWA), incidence of the disease was widespread and worse than any previous years.

Late wet conditions following early flowering were conducive to the development of sclerotinia. But the prevalence of the disease has extended beyond high rainfall districts to some low to medium rainfall areas.

Crops associated with tight rotations in canola have been hit hardest [due to] a lot of pre-inoculum in the paddocks. The inoculum stays in the paddock for 6-7 years. It is too late for growers to combat the effects of sclerotinia this season [2013].

[Sclerotinia of oilseed rape (also called stem rot, white mould), is caused by _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. The fungus is one of the most nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens, with around 400 known hosts worldwide, including many crop species. It causes white fungal growth on aerial plant parts which leads to rotting, wilting, and death of plants. On oilseed rape, infected leaves collapse around the stem, then stem lesions showing a typical bleached appearance develop.

The pathogen is primarily soilborne and has a complex disease cycle. It can survive in soil as sclerotia and is also spread by infected plant material, mechanical means, and wind-borne spores. It is thought that the fungus may also survive in the soil by colonising the roots of other plant species which then serve as inoculum sources for crops. Risk of crop infection depends on the previous disease history of a field as well as weather conditions.

Disease management includes cultural practices (such as long term crop rotation with non-hosts and deep ploughing to minimise inoculum) and fungicide applications. However, fungicides may not be very effective against soilborne fungal pathogens.
