Legionnaire's disease has raised its ugly head recently on the
Riviera. Since Christmas [2009], 7 patients have been admitted to the
CHU University Hospital in Nice for illness associated with this
serious lung infection. So far those affected are adults only. The
condition is not life-threatening for any of the victims and some have
already returned home following the appropriate treatment.

However, with a mortality rate close to 15 per cent, the disease is
ranked among the 30 listed diseases that are systematically
investigated by the state's health services. It is unclear at the
moment the exact origin of the contamination; a cooling tower in Nice
is suspected. Companies are encouraged to check their heating and air
conditioning systems for signs of the bacteria as it is generally
spread by the droplets through the air conditioning equipment, storage
tanks, tubs, shower heads, and faucets. The disease does not spread
from one person to another.

An outbreak of fever and a persistent cough may be accompanied by the
onset of appetite and muscle aches. The condition can rapidly worsen.
People are advised to see their doctor if symptoms appear.

[The following has been extracted from ProMED Mod.ML's comments in a
prior ProMED post, Legionellosis, neonatal, nosocomial, fatal -
Cyprus: susp. 20090102.0011:

Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of disease caused by
_Legionella_ bacteria, usually _Legionella pneumophila_. About 80-90
percent of cases are caused by _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1.
Legionnaires' disease is usually acquired by inhalation by a
susceptible person of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_.
Risk factors in adults include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking,
diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and immuno-suppression.
Pediatric cases of Legionnaires' disease are uncommon.

Usually a building's water system is incriminated as the source.
_Legionella_ are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing
systems and in cooling towers. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C
(77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in
plumbing systems. In addition, _Legionella_ are embedded in a biofilm
that lines the inner walls of the plumbing system's pipes and
containers. Concentrations of the organism in the water can be
increased by any disruption of this biofilm. Infectious aerosols can
be generated by a building's faulty air conditioning systems, shower
heads, misters, and whirlpool spas.

Elimination or reduction of legionella colonization in a hot water
system is difficult. For a discussion, please see
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>.

Nice is a city of about 350 000 people in southern France and is
located on the Mediterranean coast, between Marseille, France, and
Genoa, Italy (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice>). The city is a
major tourist attraction in the Department of Alpes-Maritimes on the
French Riviera (Cote d'Azur). France can be located on the
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/012H>. - Mod.ML]

[Persons traveling to Nice should note the risk factors listed above:
age over 50 years, cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic heart or lung
disease, and immuno-suppression. People having any of these risk
factors would be well advised to reconsider their trip until the
source of the infection has been found and sterilized. - Mod.JW]
