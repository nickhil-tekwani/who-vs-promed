----------------------------------------------------------
Although vaccine coverage in Qatar has lagged slightly behind those
of neighboring countries, a slight increase in disease incidence
during 2007 belies the fact that measles cases have been dramatically
reduced through expanded immunization since 1990. The following graph
links illustrate regional vaccine coverage estimates

and trends in measles incidence for Qatar in comparison with
concurrent vaccine coverage
