Congo-Kinshasa: Bokungu - 39 cases of monkeypox recorded since March
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The cases include 19 children from 0 to 5 years, including 3 deaths, in
Bokungu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo-Kinshasa).

Radiookapi.net has reported that according to Dr Didier Lolobi, the interim
medical officer of the health zone, since the epidemic was declared, the
health area office of Bokungu has received no outside assistance and the
value of treatment available is problematic.

Dr Didier Lolobi indicated that a doctor who was treating the patients has
also contracted infection. He stated that: "Our chief of staff, Dr Robert
Trabongo Bongo, who was in contact with a sick child, has contracted
infection. He is in isolation and is under treatment but we have no
effective means of treatment, such as protective clothing, disinfectants,
and pharmaceuticals products to address this epidemic. We have not
benefited from external assistance. The Diocesan Office for Medical Affair
(BDOM) have given us some drugs but these are insufficient. The area health
organisation does not have enough resources to supervise remote localities
in order to detect still unknown cases in the community."

According to the WHO/Equateur medical epidemiologist, 250 kg of drugs
should reach Bokungu by Wednesday [16 Jul 2008].

[According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) website monkeypox is a rare viral disease that occurs mostly in
central and western Africa. It is called "monkeypox" because it was first
found in 1958 in laboratory monkeys. Blood tests of animals in Africa later
found that other types of animals probably had monkeypox. Scientists also
recovered the virus that causes monkeypox from an African squirrel. These
types of squirrels might be the common host for the disease. Rats, mice,
and rabbits can get monkeypox, too. Monkeypox was reported in humans for
the first time in 1970.

In humans, the signs and symptoms of monkeypox are like those of smallpox,
but usually they are milder. Another difference is that monkeypox causes
the lymph nodes to swell. About 12 days after people are infected with the
virus, they will get a fever, headache, muscle aches, and backache; their
lymph nodes will swell; and they will feel tired. One to 3 days (or longer)
after the fever starts, they will get a rash. This rash develops into
raised bumps filled with fluid and often starts on the face and spreads,
but it can start on other parts of the body too. The bumps go through
several stages before they get crusty, scab over, and fall off. The illness
usually lasts for 2 to 4 weeks. In Africa, monkeypox has killed between 1
per cent and 10 per cent of people who get it. There is no specific
treatment for monkeypox. Physicians caring for monkeypox patients are
advised to receive smallpox vaccination.
