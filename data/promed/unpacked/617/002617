Montana state veterinarian reports rise in canine brucellosis
-------------------------------------------------------------
Dog owners will want to pay close attention and maybe place a call to their vet because the state's veterinarian is tracking a rise in canine brucellosis.

The Montana Department of Livestock started to notice the rise in recent years, although officials say the disease has been around in Montana since roughly the year 2015.

More than 100 dogs have tested positive for the disease so far this year [2022]. But several years ago, the number was fewer than 10.

The rise is alarming for area animal shelters and rescue operations like Dog Tag Buddies, which pairs dogs with veterans to help treat invisible injuries.

"I can't take the risk of bringing in a dog who's potentially infected," said DeeDe Baker, who founded the organization and serves as the executive director.

It's a problem because Dog Tag Buddies gets its dogs from a variety of places.

"Primarily we try to work with shelters and rescues, and we also have owners which will relinquish dogs upon occasion, as well as breeders which will donate," said Baker.

The disease usually means a dog will be put down. And even worse, it can spread to humans.

"It's kind of the same impact on dogs as it has on cattle, where they can abort the fetuses will fail to thrive, only tend to transmit it to other animals, they can transmit it to humans," said Merry Michalski with the Department of Livestock.

Michalski says those positive cases are linked to Montana's largest cities and reservations, specifically Valley and Roosevelt counties, near Fort Peck. Most are found in intact stray dogs.

Those with the Department of Livestock also say it's often spread through dog breeding, though it can be passed from dog to dog through nose and mouth contact or blood.

There is no cure or vaccine for dogs, and experts recommend dogs be euthanized or are subject to a life in isolation through quarantine.

Neither is a good option, something Baker knows well after a case of canine brucellosis fell into the lap of the nonprofit recently.

"The dog was a year and a half [in age]," said Baker. ''Really super nice dog started experiencing some issues and the veteran who had already been paired with took him into the veterinarian and they did a CT scan thinking maybe he had something going on. They weren't sure and, in the process, found out this dog was a carrier of canine brucellosis."

Now Baker says she's forced to consider every impact on her organization considering the rise in cases.

"I can't take the risk of bringing in a dog who's potentially infected," she said. "There's a huge monetary impact. There's also the other impact of how these impacts of veterans."

It's a predicament many animal shelters and rescue operations have had to come to terms with.

Trinit Halverson with the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter says the nonprofit follows recommendations for shelters laid out by the University of Wisconsin Shelter of Medicine Program and says they only test if there are clinical signs.

"Since the testing for C.B. [canine brucellosis] is so sensitive, routine testing would result in a large amount of unnecessary euthanasia," she said.

But Baker recommends testing be done more often to keep dogs and humans safe and protect organizations like hers.

"You know, we're trying to do the best we can and not create new trauma for veterans and here I've just created a whole new set of traumas by saying this dog has brucellosis," she said. "I can't take the risk of bringing in a dog who's potentially infected."

[This is not an easy situation for the shelter personnel, the dog recipients/owners, or the veterinarians. It is extremely sad and disheartening that there is no treatment for canine brucellosis. Surely technology should be able to solve this issue.

"Canine brucellosis is an infectious and zoonotic disease caused by _Brucella canis_, which has been reported worldwide, and is a major public health concern due to close contact between dogs and humans. In dogs, canine brucellosis manifests with abortion outbreaks, reproductive failure, enlargement of lymph nodes, and occasionally affects the osteoarticular system, although the occurrence of asymptomatic infections in dogs are not uncommon. In humans, the disease is associated with a febrile syndrome, commonly with non-specific symptoms including splenomegaly, fatigue, and weakness. Infection of dogs occurs mostly by the oronasal route when in contact with contaminated tissues such as aborted fetuses, semen, urine, and vaginal secretions. In humans, contact with contaminated fluids from infected dogs is an important source of infection, and it is an occupational risk for veterinarians, breeders, laboratory workers, among other professionals who deal with infected animals or biological samples. The diagnosis in dogs is largely based on serologic methods. However, serologic diagnosis of canine brucellosis remains very challenging due to the low accuracy of available tests. Molecular diagnostic methods have been increasingly used in the past few years. Treatment of infected dogs is associated with a high frequency of relapse, and should be employed only in selected cases. Currently there are no commercially available vaccines for prevention of canine brucellosis. Therefore, development of novel and improved diagnostic methods as well as the development of efficacious and safe vaccination protocols are needed for an effective control of canine brucellosis and its associated zoonotic risk.

"_B. canis_ is the most common cause of canine brucellosis (18, 19), although occasional infections with _B. melitensis_, _B. abortus_, or _B. suis_ occur in dogs that have close contact with tissues or secretions of infected livestock animals, especially raw milk, aborted fetuses, and placentas (20, 21). Interestingly, _B. canis_ was isolated from a lymph node of a cow, but the clinical and epidemiological implications of this finding is unknown (22).

"In dogs, there is no evidence of breed predisposition, and the high number of well-documented outbreaks in beagles may be due to the broad use of this breed for research purposes (23-26). _B. canis_ infection in dogs has been reported during outbreaks in kennels (23, 25-28) or serological surveys of stray and pet dogs (29-34). Serologic surveys demonstrated higher frequencies of _B. canis_ infections in stray dogs when compared to responsibly owned dogs (30, 31), probably due to the absence of mating control in stray dogs, which favors transmission of the disease. In a recent study performed in Mississippi, the prevalence of _B. canis_ infection in shelter dogs was 2.3%, but the prevalence in shelters varies from 0 to 8.6%, which indicates that a small number of shelters may have a high seroprevalence of brucellosis (34).

"_B. canis_ was first isolated in 1966 from aborted fetuses in a Beagle kennel in the USA during an outbreak of abortions and reproductive failures (35). Since then, canine brucellosis caused by _B. canis_ has been diagnosed in several countries (16, 19, 24, 27, 36), with the exception of Antarctica (37). Although the literature supports the notion that _B. canis_ infection has a worldwide distribution (38), there are no consistent epidemiological studies assessing the prevalence of canine brucellosis. The lack of specific and efficient commercial laboratory tests may contribute to neglect the importance of canine brucellosis in many countries (17, 19, 39).

"Human Infections with _Brucella canis_
"A recent study demonstrated that _B. canis_ is stealthier than pathogenic smooth Brucella (141), which supports the notion that _B. canis_ may be under-diagnosed in human patients. The incidence of human brucellosis is estimated as half a million new cases per year, and this is considered an underestimation. The prevalence is extremely variable among different countries, and it is directly associated with infection in domestic animals and control policies (36, 142).

"Human infections with _B. canis_ were first reported in 1968, affecting individuals who had contact with infected dogs (23, 143). Although human infections with _B. canis_ have been described in several countries, the prevalence of the disease is unknown (24, 36, 140, 144-147). Human infection with _B. canis_ is considered self-limiting and occasional. It has been estimated that only 1 percent of the diagnosed human brucellosis are due to _B. canis_ infection (146, 148). However, the incidence of human _B. canis_ infection is may be underestimated.

"Human brucellosis is considered an occupational disease, so veterinarians, pet store workers, kennels employees and owners, dog caregivers, dog trainers, and laboratory technicians are professionals with the higher risk of occupational exposure to infection (23, 140, 144, 152, 153). A study of 306 asymptomatic adults with occupational exposure risk demonstrated a seroprevalence of 3.6% for _B. canis_ (140). An interesting epidemiological study made by Monroe et al. (144) demonstrated higher prevalence of anti-_B. canis_ antibodies in veterinarians and patients with unknown origin fever. Human _B. canis_ infection may result from contact with aerosols formed during routine laboratory practices or accidental laboratorial exposure (23, 138, 151, 154). Importantly, manipulation of most Brucella spp., including _B. canis_, should be performed under biosafety level 3 conditions (155).

"Human brucellosis caused by _B. canis_ resembles the clinical manifestations associated with other Brucella spp. infections (Figure 2), with unspecific symptoms, including intermittent fever, chills, sweating, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, headaches, back pain or joint pain (146, 148, 156). Although _B. canis_ is considered less pathogenic to human than other Brucella species, severe manifestations such as endocarditis, aneurysm, peritonitis, arthritis, osteomielitis, and epidural abscess have been described in _B. canis_ infected patients (138, 149, 157-160). Neurobrucellosis, another important clinical manifestation of the disease in human patients, is usually due to _B. melitensis_ infection, but there are reports of rare cases of neurologic disease associated with _B. canis_ infection (161). Secondary neurological syndromes such as Guillain-Barre (138) have been associated with _B. canis_ infection as well as with other Brucella spp. (162). Association of _B. canis_ infection with other metabolic or immune diseases can aggravate brucellosis in human patients (138, 163-165). Indeed, immunodeficiency may be a risk factor for human infection with _B. canis_ (163, 164).

"Treatment in Humans
"The treatment of brucellosis in humans is based on the use of antibiotics capable to act in intracellular medium for an adequate length of time (156), including doxycycline (138, 153, 157, 159, 163-165, 255), streptomycin (143, 150, 153, 154, 256, 257), rifampicin (129, 138, 157, 159, 163, 255), gentamicin (138, 160, 165), trimethropim-sulfametoxazole (129, 138, 150, 152), ofloxacin (157), ciprofloxacin (164), tetracycline (23, 255, 258), ampicillin (138, 143, 160, 259), sulfadiazine (154), ceftriaxone (152) and cephalothin (138, 160).

"In the first reports of human infection with __B. canis__, Morisset and Spink (23) and Munford et al. (259) described the use of monotherapy with tetracycline and ampicillin, respectively. However, the association of two or more antibiotics is considered the most consistent and effective treatment due to the high relapse rates of monotherapy (260). The treatment is usually prolonged and varies (up to 6 weeks) according to antibiotics (156).

"Treatment in Dogs
"In dogs, the treatment with antibiotics is not encouraged, especially due to the high rates of relapse, and the cure for the disease still uncertain after antibiotic treatment, resulting in high risk of transmission to humans and other dogs (16, 261). In addition, expensive antibiotic may be prohibitive for some owners (262). It is important to highlight that antibiotic therapy does not completely eliminate __B. canis__. Therefore, absence of the clinical signs after treatment does not indicate the absence of the bacterium (263).

"__B. canis__ isolated from dogs are usually susceptible to doxycycline and tetracycline (264, 265), whereas some __B. canis__ strains are considered more resistant to streptomycin and tetracycline than other _Brucella_ spp. (264). Importantly, enrofloxacin and streptomycin have synergic activity in vitro against the bacteria, while doxycycline and rifampicin have antagonistic effects (265).

"Treatment with oxytetracycline for 4 weeks and streptomycin in the 1st week of treatment results in effective treatment in 79% of dogs, when elimination of bacteremia and absence of __B. canis__ in lymph nodes, spleen and reproductive organs are considered (262). Enrofloxacin have good results to prevent occurrence of abortion, with results that are similar to streptomycin, which may be toxic and is not indicated during pregnancy (263).

"Control and Prevention
"__B. canis__ infection causes infertility in dogs (24, 137) and has progressively gained more attention from dog breeders due to significant economic losses as well as the public health risk (24, 38).

"Unfortunately, there is not any commercially available vaccine for prevention of canine brucellosis. Therefore, control measures include (i) screening tests for dogs and kennels suspected of having brucellosis, (ii) treatment or euthanasia of infected dogs, and (iii) elimination of the bacteria from the environment (24, 137).

"In commercial kennels, dogs should be subjected to screening tests annually or twice a year, and in case of positive or inconclusive results, dogs must be subjected to quarantine and confirmatory tests (24, 202). In case of confirmation of the diagnosis, euthanasia should be considered (24).

"Precaution is required when introducing new dogs into a kennel. Newly acquired dogs must remain isolated for at least 1 month, and they should only be introduced in the kennel after two negative diagnostic test results with an interval of one month (24, 202, 204, 245, 266-268). Dogs with clinical signs compatible with brucellosis should not be acquired (202). Besides, dogs from a positive kennel should be monthly tested for at least 3 months after becoming negative, particularly prior to breeding (24, 137, 202). Importantly, since canine brucellosis is a zoonosis with high occupational risk, owners and/or kennel employees must be properly educated and protected, mostly in order to prevent contact with infected dogs and secretions, especially during parturition or abortion. Personnel must be aware of _B. canis_ infection in the kennel and be subjected to diagnostic tests or treatment if needed (137, 202).

"Elimination of _B. canis_ from the environment is another very important control procedure. _B. canis_ does not survive for prolonged periods under environmental conditions. It is quickly killed by most disinfectants including 1% sodium hypochlorite, 70% ethanol, ethanol/iodine solutions, glutaraldehyde, and formaldehyde (24, 137). However, organic matter and low temperatures may impair disinfectant efficiency. Surfaces may be decontaminated with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite, which should be maintained over the surface for at least 1 h. Decontamination of body surfaces may be done with 70% ethanol or iodine solutions. Equipment may be decontaminated by autoclaving at 121°C for at least 15 min or by dry heat at 160-170°C for at least 1 h. Boiling for 10 min also inactivates _Brucella_ (269).

"In case of pet dogs infected with Brucella, owners must be informed about the zoonotic risks before choosing treatment or euthanasia. Orchiectomy or ovary-hysterectomy should be considered to eliminate the primary site of infection and decrease the risk of transmission. In addition, infected dogs must be treated since the pathogen remains in tissues of castrated dogs in spite of a lower risk of transmission (24, 202). Electing treatment instead of euthanasia should be performed only under rigorous supervision of a veterinarian, and in case of treatment is chosen, infants should not be in contact with the infected dog (270). Dog owners must also be aware that even under stringent conditions, treatment may not result in cure, and a second round of treatment may be required (24, 202). Treated dogs must be tested again, and negative results by serology, PCR and bacterial isolation may be interpreted as a presumptive of cure (202). In addition, measures for controlling environmental contamination should be applied to households (24, 137).

"Good practices for controlling zoonotic diseases in general play an important role in controlling canine brucellosis. Therefore, contraceptive methods, preferably surgical sterilization, for stray dog populations are important in this context.

"In spite of a significant research effort in the field of _Brucella_ vaccinology (271), studies specifically aiming the development of a vaccine for canine brucellosis are scarce and restricted to the last decade (272, 273). Strategies employed for experimental vaccines include inactivated vaccines (273), a recombinant outer membrane proteins (Omp31) (274, 275), recombinant VirB proteins (276), attenuated mutant vaccine strains such as a _B. canis_ mutant in SST4 (272) and a mutant versions of B. abortus RB51 vaccine strain (277). However, despite its attenuation, the vaccine strain B. abortus RB51 retains pathogenic potential (277). Live attenuated vaccines provide the highest levels of protection (271). Indeed, recently two new vaccine candidates for canine brucellosis have emerged, namely a mutant strain _B. canis_ (delta)vjbR (278) and _B. ovis_ (delta)abcBA (279). This later vaccine strain has been developed by our group taking advantage of the antigenic similarities between _B. canis_ and B ovis, utilizing a background that has no zoonotic potential since there is not a reported case of human brucellosis attributed to _B. ovis_, and no residual pathogenicity for animals including sheep (280). A recent study demonstrated that the vaccine candidate B. ovis (delta)abcBA protects against experimental challenge with _B. canis_ in mice, and when this vaccine strain is encapsulated in alginate and administered to dogs, it is not shed in the semen or urine and is safe (279).

"Future Perspectives
"Diagnosis of _B. canis_ infection is very challenging. Although the dog is the most common host of _B. canis_, canine infections with other Brucella spp. such as _B. suis_ (281) and _B. abortus_ (282) may occur. Therefore, the development of effective and accurate _B. canis_-specific diagnostic methods is extremely relevant.

"Currently, prevention and control of canine brucellosis are not easily achieved, especially due to the difficulty in identifying infected dogs, which could prevent spreading of the disease. In this context, development of novel diagnostic methods is highly desirable as well as the development of efficacious and safe vaccines.

"In addition to the development of novel diagnostic methods and vaccines for the control of canine brucellosis, which will be a turning point in controlling this disease, raising awareness among human health professionals could have a significant impact. This may lead to a better knowledge of the impact of human brucellosis associated with _B. canis_, allowing proper therapeutic interventions and mitigation of deleterious effects of the disease."
