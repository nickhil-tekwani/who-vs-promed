A deer from outside the boundary of the chronic wasting disease [CWD] management zone in Grant County has tested positive for the disease.

The 2.5 year old buck was killed and registered 18 Nov 2012 according to a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) news release.

"It's disappointing but not unexpected to have a CWD-positive outside the current zone boundary. This is why we have focused surveillance around the fringes of the CWD management zone, to better understand the distribution of the disease and identify the presence of the disease in periphery areas," said Don Bates, DNR area wildlife supervisor, in the release.

The CWD-positive deer was harvested near the center of the county about 6.5 miles [10.5 km] from the border of the CWD management zone and about 8 miles [13 km] from the nearest positive.

This is the 2nd year that DNR has focused surveillance around the boundaries of the existing CWD management zone. Sampling of deer is voluntary in these areas and in Grant County, DNR partners with taxidermists to collect samples.

The DNR said this sampling result does not change any remaining hunting seasons nor does it change the current CWD management zone boundary. Baiting and feeding of deer is already banned in the county and will continue to be illegal, the DNR said.

A deer from outside the chronic wasting disease management zone in Grant County has tested positive for the disease, according to a statement released Monday [10 Dec 2012] by the Department of Natural Resources [DNR].

The 2.5-year-old buck was killed and registered 18 Nov 2012. "It's disappointing but not unexpected to have a CWD-positive outside the current zone boundary," said DNR wildlife supervisor Don Bates in the statement. "This is why we have focused surveillance around the fringes of the CWD management zone, to better understand the distribution of the disease and identify the presence of the disease in periphery areas."

The CWD-positive deer was killed about 6 miles [9.7 km] outside the border of the CWD management zone and about 8 miles [13 km] from the nearest positive. This is the 2nd year the DNR has focused surveillance around the boundaries of the existing CWD management zone. Sampling of deer is voluntary in these areas and in Grant County, DNR partners with taxidermists to collect samples.

The DNR's CWD-sampling goal for 2012 is 4200 deer in southern Wisconsin and 1000 deer near Shell Lake, according to the agency. Most of the samples were obtained during the gun deer hunting season, which ran 17-25 Nov 2012.

Testing for the disease is conducted at the University of Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Madison. Test results are typically available in 21 days.

CWD is a neurological disease caused by a misfolded prion or protein. The disease is contagious and fatal to deer, elk, and moose. It has not been shown to affect the health of humans or livestock.

The disease was first documented in the 1960s in western states. It was discovered in Wisconsin in 2002.

CWD was found only in southern Wisconsin until November 2011 when a CWD-positive deer was found near Shell Lake in northwestern Wisconsin.

The CWD-positive finding in Grant County does not change any remaining hunting seasons nor does it change the current CWD management zone boundary, according to the DNR. Baiting and feeding of deer is already banned in the county and will continue to be illegal.

A deer from Racine County has tested positive for chronic wasting disease, the 1st known CWD-positive in the county. The 3.5-year-old doe was harvested near Bohners Lake and volunteered to the Department of Natural Resources for sampling by a bow hunter when it was registered, 12 Nov 2012.

"It's disappointing but not unexpected to have a CWD-positive in Racine County. The county has been included in the CWD management zone for years due to the potential for the disease in the area," said DNR's Tim Lizotte, CWD operations supervisor.

The south-western Racine County positive is about 7 miles [11.3 km] from the nearest positive in Walworth County and about 8 miles [13 km] from the nearest positive in Kenosha County, Lizotte said.

DNR has focused sampling in Racine and Kenosha counties to look for the disease. Sampling enables the department to better document the distribution of this disease. DNR surveillance will continue, in an ongoing effort to identify presence of the disease in the periphery areas of southeast Wisconsin.

"We thank this hunter, and all hunters, who bring deer in for voluntary CWD testing," Lizotte said. "We will continue to sample deer in the area and encourage hunters who want their deer tested to bring them to sampling locations throughout the muzzleloader, late archery, and Holiday Hunt in the CWD management zone."

Hunters participating in the remaining deer seasons in the CWD management zone, can bring harvested deer in for sampling at the cooperating sampling stations [PDF].

This sampling result does not change any remaining hunting seasons nor does it change the current CWD management zone boundary. Baiting and feeding of deer is already banned in the county and will continue to be illegal.

[It initially may seem confusing but this is a buck in Grant County [items 1 and 2 above], which is outside of the surveillance zone.

The doe is inside Racine County [item 3 above], but was within the surveillance zone as a perimeter county.

Certainly Grant County represents and expansion of territory of this disease and a case can be made for the fact that Racine County is a technical expansion as well.

Both of these cases will certainly cause an increase in the borders of the surveillance zone.
