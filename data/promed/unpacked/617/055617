[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest.
To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours there has been 1 newly confirmed case in China, an imported case in Guangdong Province. No new deaths were reported. Also, no new cases were reported in Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan. A total of 1763 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 4 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours, all imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The last report of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic was on 1 Jun 2020 when 2 conversions were reported. Prior to that a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions are, what is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of symptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

The previous day's (2 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 318 cases and 55 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also in decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4851_1_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Liguria.

Lombardy again reported the most newly confirmed cases in the 24 hour period (237), and the only province reporting more than 100 new cases. 15 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (9 provinces reported no new cases), another 4 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (237), followed by Piedmont (19), Liguria (17), Emilia-Romagna (14), and Campania (12).

Italy is now 31 days post phase 2 initial opening up, and 15 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 160 696 total cases, 8012 deaths
Date: Wed 3 Jun 2020

The spread of novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] has accelerated again this month [May 2020] in Iran which on Wednesday [3 Jun 2020] officially confirmed over 3000 new cases for a 3rd consecutive day.

The country has recorded an additional 3134 cases, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told state television, bringing the total number of infections to 160 696.

New cases were at their highest on [30 Mar 2020] hitting 3186.

Another 70 people have died, Jahanpour added, taking the death toll to 8012 since the outbreak was first declared in the country in February [2020].

Infections have been on a rising trajectory in the Islamic republic since hitting a near 2-month low on [2 May 2020], though the official number of daily deaths has remained below 100 in recent weeks.

Health Minister Saeed Namaki on Tuesday [2 Jun 2020] lamented that people were ignoring social distancing rules. "The fact that people have become completely careless regarding this disease" was of great concern, he said. "They either have total confidence in us or think the coronavirus has gone. The latter is not true at all," the ISNA news agency quoted him as saying.

9 of the country's 31 provinces are still under a "health alert", Jahanpour said Wednesday, while the southwestern province of Khuzestan remains classified as a "red zone".

Iran has since last month [May 2020] largely lifted the curbs it imposed to stem the outbreak, but experts both at home and abroad have voiced scepticism about its official figures, saying the real toll could be much higher.

[As of 3 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 160 696, including 8012 deaths, an increase of 3134 cases and 70 deaths since 2 Jun 2020, an increase in daily newly confirmed cases from 3117 newly confirmed cases and the reported 64 deaths in the preceding 24 hour period. Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports almost approaching the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear there is now a 2nd wave most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions.
