[Leptospirosis outbreak, Golan Heights, Israel]
-----------------------------------------------
The Israeli Ministry of Health [MOH] is currently managing an outbreak of human leptospirosis linked to recreational water exposure in Northern Israel.

The investigation began following reports of several suspected cases who presented to several hospitals across Israel during the weekend of 9-11 Aug 2018, following touristic excursions.

According to current active surveillance data and following public notification, over 250 individuals were identified as suspected cases per MOH case definition, after seeking medical advice for acute febrile illness following travel to the specific locations which are currently defined as possible exposure sites in Northern Israel.

Suspected cases are being evaluated and treated for possible infection at community clinics and hospitals. Of those, 32 cases have been initially confirmed by means of molecular and serological tests performed at the National Reference Laboratory for Leptospirosis. The infecting serovar is expected to be identified over the next days.

The epidemiological investigation suggests recreational exposure to natural water sources over the last weeks in certain locations (recreational natural water sources) in Northern Israel as the common risk factor.

The MOH is conducting an outbreak investigation targeting all suspected cases. Guidance to healthcare professionals on diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of leptospirosis has been issued and guidance concerning prevention of exposure to possible contaminated water sources has been communicated to the public.

Currently, 7 adjacent water sites, have been linked to clusters of suspected and confirmed cases and as a result were closed to the public, including the Jilbon, Majrase, Meshushim, Yarden (Jordan) Park, Yehudiya, Zakhi, and Zavitan. Environmental monitoring of surface water quality has identified varying abnormal levels of fecal coliforms at those sites, suggesting fecal contamination. Molecular testing for presence of pathogenic leptospira is ongoing and has identified at least 2 positive sites, thus substantiating the epidemiological link.

The MOH estimates that the current incident is related to the combination of long-standing drought conditions in the area, seasonally low water levels at the implicated sites and high incidence of leptospirosis in free-ranging cattle or wild boar reported in the area.

The MOH is working with a wide range of stakeholders in Israel as part of the incident management, including the entire healthcare sector, the Nature and Parks Authority, the Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development and Environmental Protection and the National Water Authority and Mekorot. [Mekorot is the national water company of Israel.]

Leptospirosis is an uncommon illness in Israel with only a handful of autochthonous cases reported annually. This incident constitutes the largest cluster of human leptospirosis ever reported from Israel.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Jacob Moran-Gilad and the Israeli Ministry of Health for the current situation report with regard to the leptospirosis outbreak associated with certain recreational water sites in the Golan Heights. Updated data would be welcome as it becomes available.

The Golan Heights has several hiking paths through streams and pools that attract many travelers; 7 such recreational water sites have been linked to the outbreak and as a result are closed to the public, including Jilbon, Majrase, Meshushim, Yarden (Jordan) Park, Yehudiya, Zakhi, and Zavitan:
- Yehudiya Nature Reserve is the largest nature reserve in the Golan Heights (see map at https://goo.gl/maps/wshPXRS9hDK2). There are several streams in the reserve including Zavitan and Yehudiya (http://www.beentheredonethattrips.com/yehudiya-and-zavitan-route-87-golan-heights/).
- The Jordan River National Park has walking trails that pass by water sources, aqueducts, pools, and sites of archaeological interest, such as the ancient Bethsaida (https://shalomisraeltours.com/jordan-river-national-park/, http://www.israeltripplanner.com/galilee-lake/nature-parks/jordan-park).
- Zakhi stream hike is 4 km (2.5 mi) that involves 1.5 km (1 mi) of wading and swimming in streams and lagoons (https://hike-israel.com/hikes/wet-summer-hikes/zaki-stream/ and https://www.israel-travel-secrets.com/zaki-trail/).
- The Meshushim Nature Reserve is a small pool in the southwest of the Golan Heights (see map at https://goo.gl/maps/BXovfW2zom22).
- The Majrase-Beteha (Bet Tsayda Valley) Nature Reserve drains the delta formed by a number of the major streams of the Golan on their way to the Sea of Galilee (TripAdvisor https://tinyurl.com/ycogrjy8).
