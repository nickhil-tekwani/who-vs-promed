50 ill people have been reported with enterohemorrhaigc _E. coli_ O26 from Washington (31) and Oregon (19). 14 people have been hospitalized in Washington (10) and Oregon (4). There have been no reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and no deaths.

33 isolates from ill people in Washington (22) and Oregon (11) have been uploaded to the CDC PulseNet database. All 33 people were infected with EHEC O26 that has the same DNA fingerprint. Additionally, as reported on 6 Nov 2015, a search of the PulseNet database identified one person in Minnesota infected with EHEC O26 that has the same DNA fingerprint. This ill person did not eat at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in the week before illness onset. Minnesota's investigation is ongoing. The illness does not appear to be related to the outbreak in Washington and Oregon linked to Chipotle Mexican Grill locations in those states. Whole genome sequencing, an advanced laboratory technique, is being used to give investigators more information about the DNA fingerprint of the pathogen causing illnesses in Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview them. Updates will be provided when more information is available.

Investigation Update
------------------
The investigation is still ongoing to determine whether the ill people ate a meal item or ingredient in common that was served at the Chipotle Mexican Grill locations. Several food items collected from Chipotle Mexican Grill locations in Washington and Oregon are being tested by FDA and Chipotle for the presence of bacteria. As of 12 Nov 2015, test results have not identified _E. coli_ in any of the food items tested. Additional results are pending and will be reported once available.

On 11 Nov 2015, Chipotle Mexican Grill began to reopen its restaurants in Washington and multiple locations in the Portland, Oregon area that had been closed since 30 Oct 2015 in response to this investigation. Most restaurants have been reopened, with the others reopening in the coming days. Chipotle agreed to carry out a range of food safety actions recommended by Washington and Oregon before reopening these restaurant locations.

[Without a doubt, the lack of positive cultures at the restaurant chain does not soften the relationship of the infection to the food served at the chain, which is clear epidemiologically. Especially with EHEC infections, which can have a longer incubation period than most foodborne infections, the food reservoir is already gone past its shelf-life and gone from the restaurant. - Mod.LL
