Started: 23 May 2021
Confirmed: 31 May 2021
Reported: 3 Jun 2021

This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks:
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Rehovot, HaMerkaz
Started: 23 May 2021
Ended: 2 Jun 2021
Epidemiological unit: backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Rabbits / 15 / 15 / 15 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: the rabbits were in a schoolyard. The population contained 11 adult rabbits, 3 one-week-old rabbits, and 1 4-week-old rabbit. All the rabbits were born in this location and there was no introduction of rabbits from outside at least in the past 12 months. [23 May 2021]: 2 adult rabbits were found dead. [24 May 2021]: 3 adult rabbits were found dead. [25 May 2021]: 5 adult rabbits were found dead. At this stage one female and her 3 young (one-week-old) and one 4-week-old rabbit were alive. [28 May 2021]: the dam was found dead followed by her young. [2 Jun 2021]: the 4-week-old rabbit was found dead. No other clinical signs have been observed.

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the source of the virus is unknown. No rabbits have been introduced in the last 12 months. There is a worker who has a rabbit at home but he is alive and feels well [sic].

Control measures applied, domestic: quarantine, disinfestation

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type: Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan National Laboratory
Species / Test / Outbreaks / Test date / Result
Rabbits / real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / 1 / 31 May 2021 / positive

["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) emerged around 2010 in Europe and caused outbreaks in animals that had immunity to [rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV)]. Although early variants of RHDV2 appeared somewhat less pathogenic than RHDV, some recent isolates can be just as virulent. RHDV only seems to affect European rabbits, but RHDV2 also causes disease in hares (_Lepus_ spp.), and its full host range might not yet be known. Like classical RHDV, RHDV2 spread to many countries within 10 years and became endemic in some. In some areas, it is now more common than RHDV.

"RHDV2 is known to affect European rabbits and at least some species of hares, including the European brown hare, Cape hare (_L. capensis_ var. _mediterraneus_), Italian hare (_L. corsicanus_) and mountain (varying) hare (_L. timidus_). Rabbits are reservoir hosts for RHDV, but whether hares can maintain the virus long term is currently uncertain. Infectious RHDV2 was detected in the liver of a Mediterranean pine vole (_Microtus duodecimcostatus_) and 2 white-toothed shrews (_Crocidura russula_) that died in the vicinity of affected rabbits in Europe.

"RHDV2 affects young rabbits as well as older animals; clinical cases have been reported in rabbits as young as 11 days of age. The clinical signs are indistinguishable from the illness caused by RHDV. However, at least some isolates seem to cause fewer peracute and acute cases, and rabbits may survive longer. A captive Italian hare infected with RHDV2 had no clinical signs other than epistaxis before death. Wild cape hares and European brown hares infected with this virus were found dead.

"As of 2020, RHDV2 has become established in wild lagomorphs in a number of European countries, Australia, and parts of Africa. In some locations, RHDV2 has largely replaced classical RHDV or RHDVa. Outbreaks have also been reported in New Zealand and some countries in the Middle East, Asia, and North America, but whether the virus will persist in some of these locations is not yet certain. In North America, this virus was found in both domestic and feral rabbits. There is no indication that any lagoviruses infect humans." (Source: Spickler, AR. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease factsheet.
