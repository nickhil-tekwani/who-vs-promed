NHS [National Health Service] Lanarkshire has warned that data suggest a "significant" number of individuals have not yet been diagnosed or treated [for syphilis]. The board said the potentially life-threatening sexually transmitted infection was mainly affecting young heterosexuals in North Lanarkshire.

If diagnosed early, syphilis can be easily treated with antibiotics. However, untreated it can affect the heart, cause deafness or psychiatric illness, seizures and death. Pregnant women can pass the condition on to their unborn baby, which can cause stillbirth or death of the baby shortly after labour.

A rise in syphilis cases was identified towards the end of 2012 and continued through 2013. It comes after new figures showed hundreds of children, some as young as 12, are being diagnosed each year in Scotland with sexually transmitted infections.

NHS Lanarkshire said testing services would be challenged if the number of people being diagnosed with syphilis increases. It is estimated that people with syphilis are 3-5 times more likely to catch HIV.

Dr John Logan, consultant in public health medicine, NHS Lanarkshire, said: "We would recommend that anyone who thinks they have symptoms of syphilis, or are otherwise at risk of infection, should be tested. For example, if you have a new sexual partner, both of you should have a sexual health check-up, including a blood test, to make sure you are not putting each other at risk of syphilis or any other sexually transmitted infection." Lanarkshire runs quick check clinics where patients can be tested for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. No appointment is necessary.

Alternatively, sexual health clinic appointments are available by calling 0845 6187191. The line operates Monday to Friday from 9 am to 4.45 pm. For more information, go to http://www.lanarkshiresexualhealth.org.

[The Lanarkshire sexual health site (http://www.lanarkshiresexualhealth.org/latest/nhs-lanarkshire-responds-rise-cases-syphilis-press-release/), in part quoting Dr Anne McLellan, lead clinician for NHS Lanarkshire's Sexual Health Service, says that: "We have particularly seen an increase in the number of young people aged under 25 [mainly in North Lanarkshire] who have been diagnosed with syphilis. ... During 2012, a total of 17 cases of syphilis were diagnosed by the NHS Lanarkshire Sexual Health Service. From 1 Jan to 24 Jun 2013, there have been 19 new cases. Although the overall numbers of cases in Lanarkshire are typically lower than in some areas of Scotland, additional action is being taken due to the recent increase."

North Lanarkshire is east of the City of Glasgow and contains much of Glasgow's commuter towns and villages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lanarkshire). An increase in syphilis 3 to 4 times over what would normally be expected in recent months has also been noted among heterosexual people aged 15 to 25 in Dundee, Scotland (http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/news/local/city-s-young-urged-to-take-care-of-their-sexual-health-as-infection-rates-rise-1.161088), which was previously reported in ProMED-mail post "Syphilis - UK: (Scotland) young heterosexuals 20131205.2094184."

Dundee is a city about 130 km (80 miles) north east of North Lanarkshire (http://calculate-distance.com/Dundee,UK/North-Lanarkshire,UK).

In contrast to the syphilis outbreak in North Lanarkshire and Dundee that is occurring among young heterosexuals, the Health Protection Agency/Scotland reported that for Scotland as a whole, 80 per cent of the 205 cases of infectious syphilis in 2012 occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) (http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/ewr/article.aspx). Only around 40 cases per year (37 in 2012) were acquired heterosexually.

Similarly, in England, syphilis continues to be predominantly seen in MSM, with 75 per cent (1955/2622) of the male cases being in this group in 2011. Almost 1/3rd (620/1955) of MSM diagnosed with syphilis had previously been diagnosed with HIV infection (Savage EJ, Marsh K, Duffell S, et al. Rapid increase in gonorrhoea and syphilis diagnoses in England in 2011. Euro Surveill. 2012; 17(29): pii=20224. Available at http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20224). Also in the US in recent years, MSM have accounted for an increasing number of syphilis cases; in 2011, 72 per cent of primary and secondary syphilis cases were among MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/syphilis.htm). - Mod.ML
