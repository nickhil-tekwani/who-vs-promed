A 50-year-old man and a senior became the 1st 2 people in Costa Rica -- and in the Americas -- found to be infected with the bacteria most resistant to antibiotics used in the treatment of meningitis and meningococcal septicemia that cause serious brain damage and even death.

The Centro Nacional de Referencia en Bacteriología (CNRB) -- National Center of Reference in Bacteriology, of the Instituto Costarricense de Investigación y Enseñanza en Nutrición y Salud (Inciensa) -- Costa Rican Institute for Research and Education in Nutrition and Health (Incense), issued an alert, in early February [2020], after documenting the circulation of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (_N. meningitidis_) serogroup Y, resistant to penicillin and not sensitive to cefotaxime [and ceftriaxone?], two 3rd generation antibiotics, reports La Nación.

[Invasive meningococcal disease (meningococcemia and meningitis) is a life-threatening infection caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ that evolves rapidly, often even when appropriate treatment has been started promptly. Because antimicrobial treatment for invasive meningococcal disease with a 3rd-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) is the widely accepted standard recommendation (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/39/9/1267/402080), resistance of _N. meningitidis_ to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone is very worrisome.

The news report above says that 2 patients in Costa Rica were infected with _N. meningitidis_ serogroup Y resistant to penicillin and 2 3rd generation cephalosporins, one of which was cefotaxime. The other 3rd generation cephalosporin is not specified, but is perhaps ceftriaxone, the other 3rd generation cephalosporin usually used to treat this disease. We are also not told in the news report above if the 2 patients were epidemiologically linked, nor are we told the extent (that is, MICs [minimum inhibitory concentration] of penicillin or cefotaxime), the mechanisms of resistance, or resistance to any of the other antimicrobial drugs used to prevent or treat this disease. More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Reduced susceptibility of _N. meningitidis_ to penicillin has been reported in the past in many countries, including the US (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1169190/), usually due to decreased affinity of target penicillin-binding proteins for penicillin and less commonly to beta-lactamase production (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC89938/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3134848-relative-penicillin-g-resistance-in-neisseria-meningitidis-and-reduced-affinity-of-penicillin-binding-protein-3/, and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC162989/pdf/392577.pdf). Meningococcal isolates with reduced susceptibility to penicillin G usually were reported susceptible to 3rd-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime and ceftriaxone). For example, despite the decrease in susceptibility to penicillin G in 33% of 2888 isolates of _N. meningitidis_, all isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone in Brazil from 2009 to 2016 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29717974-surveillance-of-antimicrobial-resistance-in-neisseria-meningitidis-strains-isolated-from-invasive-cases-in-brazil-from-2009-to-2016/). Similar data have been reported for the US (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1169190/). However, one previous study reported 8 clinical isolates _N. meningitidis_ in Delhi, India in 2006 that were resistant to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, with most also resistant to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1698303/). All of the isolates were identified as serogroup A _N. meningitidis_, but no further details concerning these isolates were given in this report (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1865813/).

Resistance to other antimicrobial agents that may be used for therapy of meningococcal infections or for prophylaxis of case contacts has been reported in several countries. This includes resistance to chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, and rifampin.

Horizontal exchange of genes that encode resistance for penicillin, rifampin, and the fluoroquinolones from other _Neisseria_ species that share a common ecological niche with _N. meningitidis_ in the nasopharynx has been proposed as one possible mechanism of acquisition of meningococcal antibiotic resistance (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/49/3/545). - Mod.ML
