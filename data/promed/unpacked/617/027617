Marshall Islands: Measles Outbreak Alert for Majuro Island
---------------------------------------------------
The Department of Public Health has issued an alert for those who plan on
traveling to the Republic of the Marshal Islands. The Secretary of Health
and Environment in the Marshals Islands has informed our local health
agency that there is a measles outbreak on the island of Majuro. According
to a media release suspect cases were first noted about 10 days ago. To
date, more than 40 suspect cases have been identified, all of which are in
Majuro. The illness is affecting most age groups up to age 40. 6 of 10
patient specimens sent to the Hawaii Department of Health Laboratory were
positive for measles virus .
Although there have been no suspect cases of measles reported in Guam,
according to Public Health, local physicians have been advised of this
outbreak in the region and have been asked to maintain a high level of
awareness for the possibility of measles when seeing patients with fever
and rash in their clinics.
