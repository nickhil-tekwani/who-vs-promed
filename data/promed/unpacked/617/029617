Firms open for pet passport ferry bookings
-------------------------------------------------------------
Six companies able to carry dogs and cats to and from Europe without
passing through quarantine were named by the Government yesterday.
Hoverspeed, P&O Stena and SeaFrance will offer facilities on the
Calais-Dover route under the pilot Pet Travel Scheme which starts on 28 Feb
2000. Brittany Ferries and P&O European will carry pets between Caen,
Cherbourg, Le Havre, St Malo and Portsmouth. Eurotunnel is also taking part
in the scheme but dogs and cats will not be allowed on Eurostar passenger
trains.
In all cases the return fare will be no more than Â£30 - whatever the route
or distance - but dogs and cats must not be allowed to leave the owner's
vehicle. The fare is designed to cover the cost of providing facilities -
including electronic scanners to enable owners to check their paperwork and
pet microchips meet all the requirements. This is aimed largely at
preventing incidents in which pets may be forced into quarantine on their
return after being refused entry to other European countries. Foot
passengers will not be allowed to take their pets under the trial scheme.
Baroness Hayman, minister of state at the Ministry of Agriculture, said at
a press conference in London yesterday to highlight the new measures, the
Government would start an advertising campaign this weekend to alert 9.7
million dog and cat owners to the change. Under the pilot project dogs and
cats will be allowed to enter Britain without having to spend 6 months in
quarantine provided they have been vaccinated against rabies, fitted with
identification micro-chips, and supplied with relevant "pet passport"
paperwork. Some countries, including France, need additional paperwork. The
animals must also have blood tests to prove their anti-rabies vaccinations
have worked and be dosed against dangerous parasites, which could prove
fatal to humans, between 24 and 48 hours before they enter or return to
this country.
Baroness Hayman disclosed the Government was looking at the possibility of
allowing some pets now in quarantine to be released early if they already
complied with the requirements of the pilot scheme. So far no airlines have
completed arrangements to fly pets to and from Heathrow under the trial
scheme. Details of their involvement would be announced later, said the
Ministry of Agriculture.
