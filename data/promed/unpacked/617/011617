[The UK Department of Health web-site has been revised and the monthly new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics are now appended to the
table "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the UK by Calendar Year (since 1990)" and
can be downloaded from the monthly statistics web-site. The definition of the
designations deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD cases, and the case
definitions can be found by accessing the Department of Health web-site, or,
by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in this thread (for example, CJD
(new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693)
Data on vCJD cases from all parts of the world are now included in these
updates. Also data on other forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic, familial and
GSS) are now included where they have some relevance to the incidence and
etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease Statistics - As of 3 Oct 2005
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 3 Oct 2005] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease.
This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD] - the form of the disease thought to be
linked to BSE. The position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 108
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 42
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
[Total] Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 151
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 157
(The next table will be published on Mon 7 Nov 2005)
[These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is
now in decline. The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD in the
UK during the first 9 months of 2005 is now 3. The peak numb or of deaths was
28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in
2004. - Mod.CP]
Totals for All Types of CJD Cases in the UK during 2005
-------------------------------------------------------
[As of 30 Sep 2005, so far in the UK for the year 2005 there have 92 referrals
of suspected CJD; and there have been 41 deaths from sporadic CJC, one from
GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome), 2 from familial CJD, one from
iatrogenic CJD and 3 from vCJD. Data for all years since 1990 can be
downloaded from this web-site. - Mod.CP]

[2] USA/Spain: Detection of prions in blood

Test for Detection of Prions in Blood
-------------------------------------
The following information has been abstracted from a paper entitled "Detection
of Prions in Blood", by Joaquin Castilla1, Paula Saa1, & Claudio Soto1; at the
Departments of Neurology, Human Biological Chemistry & Genetics and
Neuroscience & Cell Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301
University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas, 77555-0646, USA and 2 the Centro de
Biologia Molecular, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid 28409, Spain.
"Prion diseases are caused by an unconventional infectious agent termed prion,
composed mainly of the misfolded prion protein (PrPSc). The development of
highly sensitive assays for biochemical detection of PrPSc in blood is a top
priority for minimizing the spread of the disease. We have shown that protein
misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technology can be automated and
optimized for high-efficiency amplification of PrPSc. We show that 140 PMCA
cycles leads to a 6600-fold increase in sensitivity over standard detection
methods. 2 successive rounds of PMCA cycles resulted in a 10-million-fold
increase in sensitivity and a capability to detect as little as 8000
equivalent molecules of PrPSc. Notably, serial PMCA enables detection of PrPSc
in blood samples of scrapie-afflicted hamsters with 89 percent sensitivity and
100 percent specificity. These findings represent the first time that PrPSc
has been detected biochemically in blood, offering promise for developing a
non-invasive method for early diagnosis of prion diseases."

[3] UK: dental procedures risk
Date: Wed 14 Sep 2005
From: Mary Marshall <tropical.forestry@btinternet.com>

Scientists are to investigate whether [variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease], the
human form of mad cow disease, can be passed on through dental surgery. The
Health Protection Agency (HPA), a [UK] government advisory body, will use mice
to see if vCJD can be passed on from contaminated dental instruments. They
will also see if the mice show signs of the disease in the tissue in their
mouths. The risk is thought to be small, but comes after concerns vCJD could
be spread via donated blood and tissue.
The government has taken measures to protect the blood supply by banning
donations from certain groups, including those who have had blood transfusions
since 1980, after it emerged 2 people may have been infected after having a
blood transfusion. There have also been concerns about whether the prions
responsible for vCJD can be spread by surgical instruments, especially when
used during brain surgery.
The aim of the 3-year experiment is to give the Department of Health more
guidance on the risks posed by vCJD in dentistry and to determine whether
stricter advice on the best cleaning methods needs to be issued. The study was
outlined at the HPA's annual conference at the University of Warwick, which
heard an estimated 75 million dental procedures are conducted in the UK each
year and 2 million of these are invasive root canal treatments.
Experts will also look at the different methods of decontaminating surgical
instruments, such as manual scrubbing, the use of sound waves and washer
disinfection.
Researcher Joanne Dickinson said they believed the risks from dental
procedures were very small, but the study would help to quantify them. "The
Department of Health will have the information to decide what the level of
risk is and what measures need to be put in place."
Janet Gibbs, of the Human BSE Foundation, a victim support group, said while
dental procedures were not thought to be the highest-risk area, the research
was still welcome. "I think it is best that we investigate these things. There
are concerns about this, we know of families of people with vCJD who have
struggled to see a dentist. But one concern is that people will become alarmed
before we know what the risks are."
