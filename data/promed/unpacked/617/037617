A New Probable SARS Case - 9 Sep 2003
--------------------
The Singapore General Hospital (SGH) has picked up a new probable SARS
case. It appears to be a single, isolated case. The patient is currently
isolated at the Communicable Disease Centre [CDC]. Investigations are
on-going to establish the source of infection. His contacts have largely
been followed up and all of them are well. As a precautionary measure, MOH
has served HQOs on his close contacts.
Chronology of event
The patient is a 27-year-old Chinese Singaporean post-doctoral student
working on West Nile virus at a microbiology laboratory in the National
University of Singapore (NUS). He also does some work at the Environment
Health Institute (EHI) laboratory of the National Environment Agency. He
last visited the EHI laboratory on 23 Aug 2003. He has no history of travel
to previously SARS-affected areas and no known contact with SARS patients.
On 26 Aug 2003, he went to work at the NUS lab and was well but he
developed fever around midnight. On 27 Aug 2003, he consulted a general
practitioner [GP] and was given a course of antibiotics. The fever
persisted and he sought treatment at the SGH A&E [Emergency Department] on
29 Aug 2003. His chest X-ray was normal. He was diagnosed to have a viral
fever and discharged from the A&E. As he did not feel better, he consulted
a Chinese physician on 1 Sep 2003. Two days later, on 3 Sep 2003, he sought
treatment again at the SGH A&E and was admitted.
From the time he became unwell on midnight of 26 Aug 2003 till his
admission to SGH on 3 Sep 2003, he remained at home apart from his two
visits to SGH A&E, the GP and Chinese physician.
When he was admitted to the SGH, he complained of fever, muscle aches and
joint pains, but did not have any significant respiratory symptoms. He
developed a dry cough after admission. Three serial chest X-rays at SGH
were all normal. However, on 8 Sep 2003, when his PCR and serology test
results were returned positive, the patient was transferred to the CDC for
further management. He remains well.
Diagnosis
A repeat of his PCR tests was done in NUH lab today and was confirmed
positive. In view of his positive PCR and serology results, MOH is treating
him as a probable SARS case.
Source of infection
Investigations are underway to identify the patient's source of infection.
Precautionary measures at the laboratories
Pending investigation, the 2 laboratories have suspended all their research
activities. Meanwhile, the staff members of the laboratories have also been
asked to stay at home until the all-clear is given. No staff member has
fever or feels unwell.
Precautionary measures at the SGH
Although the patient was isolated throughout his stay in the SGH and the
staff who had contact with him were in protective gear, the SGH is not
taking any chances and has ramped up its precautionary measures to Orange
Alert Level. These include restrictions to visitation of the affected wards
and more intensive temperature surveillance of staff.
Home Quarantine Order
Group Number
Family members of case 8
TCM [Traditional Chinese Medicine Practicioner] Sinseh 2
SGH A&E outpatients 8
Visitors 3
Discharged patients 4
Total 25
Conclusion
MOH has notified the WHO of the incident and the details of the case. WHO
has informed us that the case does not fulfill the case definition for SARS
under the new WHO guidelines post-SARS.
MOH's assessment is that this case was a low public health risk as the
patient was picked up and isolated early.

[The above press release from the Singapore Ministry of Health is very
informative on the status of the investigation and control measures
implemented. The statement that the case does not meet the case definition
for SARS under the new WHO guidelines post-SARS refers to the guidelines
issued by WHO on 14 Aug 2003 (available for review at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/postoutbreak/en/>, and covered in ProMED-mail
posting SARS - worldwide (166): cases 20030817.2061). In this
document there is the statement:
"In the post-outbreak period, all countries must remain vigilant for the
recurrence of SARS and maintain their capacity to detect and respond to the
re-emergence of SARS should it occur. The WHO case definitions during the
outbreak period relied heavily on epidemiological criteria to increase the
specificity of syndromic clinical criteria for atypical pneumonia or
respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). However, epidemiological links to
cases of SARS and areas reporting recent local transmission are no longer
of use in helping to define incident cases. Furthermore, the non-specific
clinical features of SARS, the lack of a current rapid diagnostic test that
can reliably detect SARS-CoV (SARS associated coronavirus) in the first few
days of illness, and the seasonal occurrence of other respiratory diseases,
including influenza, may confound any surveillance for SARS or demand a
level of quality and intensity which few health care system worldwide can
sustain. Even with the most sophisticated surveillance systems, the first
case of SARS in the post-outbreak period may escape early detection."
The background piece goes on to discuss recommendations for surveillance
for re-introduction of SARS, dividing countries into 3 groups -- those
considered a Potential zone of re-emergence of SARS ("Identified as
source(s) of the previous outbreak in November 2002 or areas with an
increased likelihood of animal to human transmission of SARS-CoV infection"),
Nodal areas ("Sustained local transmission experienced during the previous
outbreak or entry of large numbers of persons from the potential zone of
re-emergence of SARS-CoV.") and Low risk areas ("Never reported cases,
reported only imported cases or experienced only limited local transmission
during the previous outbreak.").
The WHO document also provides a clinical case definition for a probable
case of SARS as:
"A person with a history of: Fever (= 38Â°C) AND One or more symptoms of
lower respiratory tract illness (cough, difficulty breathing, shortness of
breath) AND Radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with
pneumonia or RDS OR autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of
pneumonia or RDS without an identifiable cause. AND No alternative
diagnosis can fully explain the illness." and then provides a laboratory
case definition of SARS.
That being said, the above case described by the MOH press release does not
meet the full clinical case definition as there is no mention of Chest X
Ray abnormalities. Of note is that according to the description given, the
onset of cough began sometime after admission to hospital on 3 Sep 2003, or
6 days prior to this press release. The laboratory work presented --
validation of PCR testing by the NUH laboratory and the serology results,
is consistent with a laboratory diagnosis of infection with the SARS Co-V.
As we are very much on the upward slope of the learning curve with respect
to SARS including it's full spectrum of clinical presentation, the
epidemiology and transmission of the disease and etiologic agent, and the
laboratory diagnostic testing, the approach of the MOH of Singapore in
treating this case as a probable case, implementing control measures and
investigations consistent with this being a probable case are commendable
and highly prudent at this point in time. Singapore would classify as a
"nodal area" where heightened surveillance is recommended. The source of
infection/exposure to the SARS CoV at this time is unknown, albeit the
background information that this case is post-doctoral student working on
West Nile virus at a microbiology laboratory in the National University of
Singapore (NUS) and also does some work at the Environment Health Institute
(EHI) laboratory of the National Environment Agency, raises the possibility
that there may have been an occupational exposure in the laboratory that
resulted in infection with the SARS CoV.
We await further information as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
