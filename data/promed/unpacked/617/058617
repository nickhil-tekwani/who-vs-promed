Saudi Arabia: Risk of Resurgence of Rift Valley Fever
---------------------------------------------------
Changes, local or global, in climatic, environmental, and demographic
patterns have played a role in the emergence of zoonoses. Ecological
disasters such as floods can advance the emergence of vector-borne
diseases. With the recent floods following exceptionally heavy rainfalls in
southwestern Saudi Arabia, large swathes of human habitation were inundated
with floodwater, with many people displaced in Jizan province and related
areas. Roads were cut and connections with other parts of the country
affected. The rains were described as the heaviest in decades.
A geographically expanding arboviral disease, Rift Valley fever (RVF) is
caused by a phlebovirus [i.e. a type of virus with a tripartite
negative-stranded RNA virus genome classified in the genus _Phlebovirus_ of
the family _Bunyaviridae_, which with the exception of Rift Valley fever
virus is usually transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies. -
Mod.CP]. RVF-endemic zones are often predisposed to outbreaks following
unusually high rainfall and flooding. Heavy rainfalls also preceded the
2000 outbreak of RVF that confirmed the endemic nature of the disease in
Saudi Arabia.
The risk of RVF resurgence within the region and beyond is very high. The
abundance of potential vectors and the exposure of susceptible domestic
animals that are associated closely with displaced persons further
underscore the immediate and long-term risks. Mosquito vectors in the
region include _Aedes vexans arabiensis_, _Culex pipiens_, and _Culex
tritaeniorhynchus_. Other epidemic vectors may enter and modify the
transmission cycle. _Aedes albopticus_, another competent vector, exists
in the Makkah-Jeddah axis and may be more widespread than is presently known.
_Culicoides_ spp, usually abundant after floods, are locally endemic. RVF
virus (RVFV) has been isolated from biting midges in Nigeria and Kenya.
Flood-amplified populations of phlebotomine sandflies (competent RVFV
vectors) as well as ticks play complementary roles in RVF transmission. In
massive numbers, _Phlebotomus_ spp., _Simulium_ spp., _Glossina morsitans_,
and _Culicoides_ spp. may mechanically spread RVFV. The role of rodents in
RVF epizootic and inter-epizootic cycles needs to be evaluated.
Seropositive rodents in endemic areas may indicate enzootic activity.
In summary, flood-altered ecology often modifies local transmission
patterns [and increases] the risk of transmission of RVFV to other regions
of Saudi Arabia and beyond (especially during Hajj).
