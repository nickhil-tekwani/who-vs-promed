Schmallenberg virus is progressing west across Northern Ireland, according to the province's Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute [AFBI].

The Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was 1st identified in Germany in late 2011 as a cause of malformations in newborn calves and lambs.

It was 1st detected in Northern Ireland in a cattle herd in County Down in October 2012. Three further cases were confirmed the following spring in County Down in 2 cattle herds and one sheep flock. In 2017, the virus reappeared and was detected in one ovine abortion in County Down. Last year [2017] AFBI also detected positive tests for antibodies to Schmallenberg in 2 calves born with skeletal deformities and a cow from a herd experiencing abortions and calf abnormalities, providing evidence that the virus was circulating again in Northern Ireland.

Now AFBI has detected SBV in 8 ovine abortion cases in Counties Fermanagh and Tyrone. Further diagnostic testing has revealed the presence of Schmallenberg virus in the brain, lung and spinal cord sampled from 7 of the cases. These are 1st virus positive cases confirmed by AFBI in the west of the province.

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the Republic of Ireland have also recently reported suspected cases in counties Sligo, Cavan and Leitrim. Antibodies have also recently been detected in blood samples from ewes in Armagh, Antrim and Fermanagh, indicating exposure to the virus or vaccination.

Schmallenberg virus is transmitted to livestock by _Culicoides_ biting midges, which are very effective at transmitting SBV and are very difficult to control, or prevent from spreading the virus. Although they are less active during the colder winter months, temperatures last winter were not low enough across the British Isles to kill all infected midges.

Problems with malformed calves and lambs arise when pregnant cows and sheep are exposed to the virus during a critical time window in early to mid-pregnancy. AFBI noted that, following infection, exposed animals may give birth to malformed progeny but are likely to develop a strong immunity to subsequent infection. They are therefore unlikely to suffer any ill-effects if exposed to the same virus in subsequent years. Commercial vaccines against the Schmallenberg virus are also available for use in cattle and sheep.

[Sheep, due to their relatively short pregnancy (5 months, compared to 9 in cattle) will be the 1st to demonstrate deformed offspring following their exposure to the SBV during pregnancy, earlier than pregnant cows that have been simultaneously exposed.

SBV belongs to the Bunyaviridae family, within the _Orthobunyavirus_ genus. It is a member of the Simbu serogroup viruses, which includes Shamonda, Akabane, and Aino viruses.

As experienced decades back in countries affected by Akabane and Aino viruses, such as Japan, Australia and Israel, the ruminant population remained immune for several years following an episode of the disease. In fact, natural infection of young animals prior to their 1st pregnancy is rather advantageous, rendering them with natural immunity and preventing foetal infection/damage if/when exposed to the virus later during pregnancy.
