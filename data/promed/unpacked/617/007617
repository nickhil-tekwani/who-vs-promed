Rice menace surrenders gene secrets
-----------------------------------
Scientists have unraveled the genome of the rice plant's greatest fungal
menace, a harvest-wrecking foe that each year destroys the potential to
feed 60 million people.
_Magnaporthe grisea_ is the 1st disease-causing plant fungus to have its
genetic code unraveled. Researchers hope it will open the way to newer,
smarter and less damaging weapons against the menace.
Also called rice blast, [RB] the fungal pathogen _M. grisea_ [Mg], spores
germinate on rice leaves, colonizes the leaf, producing grayish
spindle-shaped lesions from which more spores emerge. Aided by rain or dew,
young infected seedlings are often destroyed; in older plants, the grain is
lost.
"RB is one of the most destructive diseases of rice because of its wide
distribution and its destructiveness," according to the Manila-based
International Rice Research Institute. In India, more than 266 000 tonnes
of rice are lost each year, about 0.8 per cent of total yield. In Japan,
about 865 000 hectares of rice are at risk and in the Philippines many
thousands of hectares suffer more than 50 per cent yield losses. Mg strains
attack 50 other kinds of grasses, including wheat, barley, and millet.
The fungal genome, published today in Nature (21 Apr 2005. Dean RA, et al.
Nature 2005; 434: 980-6. Abstract:
<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7036/abs/nature03449.html>,
news item <http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050418/full/050418-9.html>)
suggests the organism has 11 109 genes -- similar to other fungi that have
been sequenced. Mg is believed to be able to secrete 739 proteins -- twice
as many as in other sequenced fungal genomes -- in order to penetrate and
infect its host. 8 genes alone are used to synthesize cuticle-degrading
enzymes called methyl esterases that aid in disease expression. By
identifying the genes of crop pathogens and seeing how they work,
scientists can target ways of blocking them chemically or of breeding
plants that are resistant to the invader. Ideally, these solutions will be
cheaper and environmentally safer than spraying with expensive pesticides.

[Worldwide, RB disease is one of the most devastating diseases of rice, the
staple food for 2/3 of humanity. Crop losses associated with RB have been
magnified in recent times due to intensification of rice production.
Genetic resistance continues to be the major means of disease management
for RB, but Mg is able to overcome this resistance rapidly. A gene has been
isolated that controls cultivar-specificity of Mg with rice and has been
identified with the corresponding disease resistance gene.
Disease management involves several options, including manipulation of
planting time and fertilizer and water management, early rather than late
sowing of seeds after onset of the rainy season, avoidance of excessive
fertilizer, especially nitrogen, which increases RB incidence, and water
management practices in rainfed areas to lessen the likelihood of stress,
which also aids RB control.
Planting resistant varieties against RB is the most practical and
economical way of controlling the disease and, if necessary, systemic
fungicides such as pyroquilon and tricyclazone are possible chemicals for
controlling the disease.
