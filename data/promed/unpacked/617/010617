Epidemiological comments: In response to the immediate notification of Newcastle disease sent by Costa Rica to the OIE and concerning the province of Guanacaste, the epidemiological surveillance service of the Institute for Animal Health and Protection (IPSA) initiated an epidemiological monitoring in border regions in the south of the country in the municipalities of Cardenas and San Juan del Sur. In a locality called El Progreso, Cardenas, sick poultry was found with signs consistent with Newcastle disease. In this situation, movement control of poultry was implemented in the affected zone. On 29 Apr 2015, samples were taken and immediately sent to the IPSA National Veterinary Diagnosis Laboratory on 30 Apr 2015; the diagnosis was confirmed on 6 May 2015, then all of the susceptible population in the outbreak zone was culled. On 5 May 2015, the Direction for Animal Health launched a vaccination campaign against the disease in 33 border communities in the municipalities of Cardenas and San Juan del Sur. 12 975 poultry from 811 owners were vaccinated. Also, 33 talks were given to 812 poultry owners in both municipalities. Currently, epidemiological surveillance continues in all affected communities in the affected municipality and the zone around the outbreak. Epidemiological surveillance staff continues to monitor the zone.

[The measures taken by Nicaragua show a quick response given the case that was recently reported by neighboring Costa Rica (see ProMED post 20150430.3331529). Nicaragua has applied appropriate measures to avoid the spread of this disease.

The department of Rivas borders Lake Nicaragua to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The southern part of the department borders Costa Rica http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivas_Department. The municipality of Cardenas, where the outbreak was detected, is located on the southwestern shore of Lake Nicaragua, near the border with Costa Rica.

The outbreaks in Costa Rica and Nicaragua can be seen in the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/l9tstz8 (click on the Central America section of the map, zoom in). Since both events are likely to be related, these neighboring countries may want to coordinate their surveillance and response activities along their common border to minimize the potential spread of the disease.
