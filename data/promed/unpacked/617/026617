One year after the 1st Ebola cases surfaced in Guinea, WHO has published a series of 14 papers that take an in-depth look at West Africa's 1st epidemic of Ebola virus disease. The papers look at how West Africa's epidemic of Ebola virus disease has evolved over the past year, giving special attention to the situation in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The success stories in Senegal, Nigeria, and likely Mali are described to show what has worked best to limit onward transmission of Ebola following an imported case and bring the outbreak to a rapid end. The fact that a densely populated city like Lagos was successful in containing Ebola offers encouragement that other developing countries can do the same.

One of the papers that presents an overview of how the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo evolved and was brought under control underscores the many differences between the outbreaks in West Africa and in equatorial Africa, where all previous outbreaks since the 1st 2 in 1976 have occurred. ... - more [A full report is available in PDF format at the URL above. - Mod.LK]

[2] Fighting Ebola now

Since working on the Ebola response, a number of practicalities and truths have become very clear about who is needed in Sierra Leone for all the roles involved in the Ebola fight, who we [Crown Agents] are able to get, and how we can get them out there.

Because of the fast moving nature of Ebola and the necessary speed of the response, we've needed people who are experienced enough in the relevant fields for them to hit the ground running. We've also needed to get them out there quickly, with minimal visa delays and transport difficulties (see more below). ... - more

Passengers going to and from Ebola affected countries are now not allowed to transit through Nairobi and Johannesburg. As these are 2 of Africa's most important transport hubs, it's very difficult to get people from other African countries to Sierra Leone. Some of the routes have taken up to 72 hours to get people to Freetown. To get someone from Malawi to Sierra Leone recently, for example, we had to book a route that sent them from Malawi, through Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, up to Istanbul in Turkey, then across to Casablanca in Morocco before eventually connecting through to Freetown. ... - more

Visa issues can easily hold up a deployment. We've been working closely with our visa agent to make sure that everyone we need to send out there has the appropriate visa rights and has things like landing cards, which they need in order to get into Sierra Leone once the plane lands. We've also had to design routes around visa issues in the connecting airports. ... - more

Our experience in getting people to Sierra Leone has highlighted the difficulties and restrictions there are in trying to make use of the global workforce to fight Ebola. ... -more

[3] USD 1 billion needed
Date: 21 Jan 2015
Source: Bloomberg [edited]
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-21/ebola-fight-requires-1-billion-more-for-un-as-outbreak-weakens.html


Ebola remains a global health emergency, the United Nations said today [21 Jan 2015] as it sought another USD one billion in donations to fight the deadly outbreak in West Africa. More money is needed for the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the World Food Programme, David Nabarro, the UN's special envoy for Ebola, said at a briefing today at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

"We can't let down our guard," Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a Bloomberg Television interview at Davos. "We have to get over the finish line and then learn from this experience to build better systems so that it doesn't get out of control the next time" an infectious disease epidemic occurs.

The Ebola outbreak, which has infected more than 21 000 people and killed about 8400, has started to "turn" as efforts to identify cases and make burials safer bear fruit, Nabarro said. While that has resulted in some empty beds at treatment centers, containment must be sustained, said Peter Piot, a co-discoverer of the virus and director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

"Don't be fooled," Piot said today [21 Jan 2015] at Davos. "It's not over yet." The epidemic can be reignited by any individual case, requiring the UN and partners to deploy hundreds of "disease detectives" to track down people who are infected, Nabarro said.

The workers will need "to go to every single nook and cranny and find people who've got Ebola or are suspected of having it and bring them into treatment quickly," he said. The additional funding is necessary to cover a geographic region "that is bigger than the British Isles and only slightly smaller than France."

The CDC, which isn't a UN agency, has more than "210 of our top disease detectives in West Africa helping to put out the fire," Frieden said. In preparation for future epidemics, many countries need better networks to find outbreaks of disease, including improved reporting systems and lab networks, said Frieden. For Ebola, it's difficult work that "is within reach" with funding from the U.S., though more countries need to give in order to improve health systems beyond the Ebola-affected countries.

Frieden gave an example from Uganda, where the building of a national network for disease identification meant that several years ago, the infection of one girl with Ebola didn't lead to an outbreak. Infection control training at hospitals, a lab network, quick dissemination of test results and rapid isolation stopped the virus in its tracks, he said.

In general, though, "public health strengthening has really been neglected," Frieden said. Containment activities should now be intensified at the local level, said David Heymann, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "The time has passed to try to coordinate things out of Geneva, or even out of capital cities in the countries where the outbreaks are occurring," Heymann said in a telephone interview. "It's now important that districts be empowered to do the job." At the same time, global health responses must be strengthened, Frieden and Piot agreed at their Davos discussion.

The World Health Organization, which has been criticized widely for a slow response to Ebola, must develop the "capacity and courage to intervene" in emergencies, Piot said. "There are countries on the right trajectory," said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, a U.K. charitable trust that funds medical research. "There is not a need to just throw everything out."

http://www.southafrica.info/about/health/ebola-team-21115.htm#.VL_ll0eG--0


South Africa has deployed its 1st batch of trained health care professionals to work in Sierra Leone in an effort to help contain the spread of Ebola in the country and other parts of West Africa.

The team, comprising one medical doctor and about 10 nurses were recruited and trained by the Right to Care organisation and will leave for Sierra Leone on 23 Jan 2015. The Department of Health has already sent a team of experts from the National Health Laboratory Service to run mobile testing facilities in Sierra Leone. ... -more

http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/01/21/tech-firms-extend-internet-access-to-help-ebola-treatment-in-africa/


Inveneo, a San Francisco non-profit, this week began a 3-month effort to bring Internet access to 100 locations in West Africa to fight the spread of Ebola. To determine how to deploy its equipment, Inveneo turned to an unlikely group: Facebook data-science team.

Facebook's scientists analyzed cellular coverage and usage maps in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia to find the fastest and cheapest way to extend Internet connections so that aid workers can more quickly send data to international health organizations.

The effort is part of the Ebola Response Connectivity Initiative launched last month [December 2014] by Inveneo to expand Internet coverage to remote Ebola treatment centers and non-governmental agencies, and it has since grown into a partnership of several organizations. ... - more
