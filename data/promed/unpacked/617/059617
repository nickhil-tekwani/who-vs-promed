[It is shocking that on Sun 27 Jun 2021, "Russia confirmed 20 538 new coronavirus cases, the highest number since January 2021, and 599 deaths. Moscow recorded 6723 cases and 114 deaths, a new daily mortality record [see next post]. On Fri 25 Jun 2021, Moscow authorities reimposed work-from-home restrictions as the Russian capital posted a new daily record for Covid-19 deaths due to a surging outbreak of the Delta variant. In a decree published on his website, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin ordered that businesses cut their number of in-office workers by 30% from [28 Jun 2021]. Vaccinated employees would be excluded, the decree said, adding that all workers aged over 65 as well as those with pre-existing conditions would have to work from home. Furthermore, Russia is investigating reports of the first Delta Plus coronavirus variant infections within its borders, the country's consumer protection watchdog told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency on Fri 25 Jun 2021."

[2] Delta variant
[A] US (California)
Date: Sun 27 Jun 2021
Source: LA Times [edited]
https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-27/highly-contagious-delta-coronavirus-variant-spreading-in-california?_amp=true&__twitter_impression=true


Highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant makes up 14.5% of California coronavirus cases analyzed so far in June [2021], up from 4.7% in May [2021], when it was the 4th-most identified variant in California, according to data released by the California Department of Public Health.

Experts say the Delta variant poses a greater chance of infection for unvaccinated people if they are exposed. The variant, first identified in India, may be twice as transmissible as the conventional coronavirus strains. It has been responsible for the rise in cases recently in India, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

But vaccinated people are well protected against infection and illness from the Delta variant. One recent study found that the full 2-dose course of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective against symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant and 96% protective against hospitalization.

There is no widespread scientific consensus on whether the Delta variant is more likely to cause more serious illness than other strains.

Delta's rise comes as California's dominant strain, Alpha, first identified in the United Kingdom, may have peaked. In May [2021], the Alpha variant made up 58.4% of coronavirus cases that were analyzed in California. Alpha's share fell in June [2021], now making up 37.7% of analyzed cases -- still the top variant but with a much smaller share.

The Gamma variant, first identified in Brazil, is also being seen more often in California. In May [2021], the variant represented 10.1% of analyzed cases. It now makes up 21.6% of analyzed cases in the state, but Delta is still growing at a more rapid rate.

Los Angeles County, the nation's most populous, has confirmed 123 Delta variant cases -- 49 of them among residents of Palmdale and Lancaster. A total of 14 cases of the Delta variant were in people from a single household.

L.A. County data suggest that vaccines are still overwhelmingly effective in protecting people against the Delta variant, as well as other known variants. Of those 123 confirmed cases of the Delta variant in the county, 89% of them occurred among people who were not vaccinated against COVID-19, and 2% among those who were partially vaccinated.

No one has died from the Delta variant in L.A. County. The few fully vaccinated people who have been infected with the Delta variant "experienced relatively mild illness," L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said.

Almost everyone who has died in L.A. County of COVID-19 in the last 6 months has been unvaccinated.

Data released by the county showed that 99.8% of COVID-19 deaths between [7 Dec 2020] and [7 Jun 2021] occurred among unvaccinated people. "If you are fully vaccinated, you have a lot of protection," Ferrer said, adding that for the "very small numbers" of people who contracted the Delta variant despite vaccination, "they really did not have serious illness. ... This is a pandemic of unvaccinated people."

The results of outbreaks of the Delta variant elsewhere also support the vaccines' effectiveness. In Israel, an outbreak of the Delta variant is "driven primarily by the unvaccinated," tweeted Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. Some vaccinated people in Israel are still getting infected "because no vaccine is 100%," Jha wrote. But the infections that are breaking through the immunity provided by the vaccines are causing mild disease. "What's happening in Israel is vaccines working exactly as we all expected," Jha wrote.

In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa on [Sun 27 Jun 2021] announced a sweeping set of new coronavirus restrictions, including curfews and school closures, as the country faces another surge in cases that threatens to outpace two previous spikes. The Delta variant, first discovered in India, appears to be driving South Africa's new increase, Ramaphosa said.

South Africa recorded more than 15 000 new coronavirus cases [Sun 27 Jun 2021], including 122 deaths, bringing its total number of fatalities to nearly 60 000.

Meanwhile, data released by California show that the %age of the tested population who have antibodies to the coronavirus -- a sign of immunity to COVID-19 -- is also increasing.

Between [16 May and 12 Jun 2021], 85.9% of Californians who were tested for coronavirus antibodies had them -- a promising sign of growing immunity, either because of immunization or past exposure to the virus. That's up from 76.6%, calculated during a 4-week period in May [2021].

Experts have estimated that 70% -- 85% of a population needs to have immunity for a region to develop "herd immunity" to COVID-19, which interrupts the sustained transmission of the virus.

Officials are continuing to urge everyone to be vaccinated against COVID-19, including people who survived a previous infection. Experts say immunity provided by the vaccination is more robust and longer-lasting than immunity from an infection.

The highly infectious Delta variant is making the task of getting to herd immunity more difficult.

With conventional coronavirus strains, it could take perhaps 71% of the population to be immune for a region to reach herd immunity and interrupt the virus' transmission, UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said. But a variant such as Delta -- because it is so transmissible -- would increase that threshold to, say, 84%, he said.

The Delta variant is also spreading nationwide.

Between [9 May and 22 May 2021], the Delta variant made up less than 3% of analyzed coronavirus samples nationwide. But from [6 Jun to 19 Jun 2021], that proportion rose to more than 20%.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-disease expert, called the strain "currently the greatest threat in the U.S. to our attempt to eliminate COVID-19."

[This news is really only serious for unvaccinated individuals, and apparently more than 85% of the population tested in CA is immune either from prior infection or vaccination. These immune individuals will likely experience mild illness if anything following infection with the delta variant. But it is a warning to others to get vaccinated if they have not already done so. The vaccines are highly effective against the variants. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective against symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant and 96% protective against hospitalization following the full course of 2 doses. - Mod.LK]

Authorities in Afghanistan confirmed on Sat 26 Jun 2021 that the delta coronavirus variant, 1st identified in India, has been mainly responsible for the recent surge in cases and deaths in the war-torn country.

Minister for Public Health Wahid Majrooh told reporters in Kabul that out of 19 samples examined in national laboratories a day earlier, nearly 60% tested positive for the delta variant and the rest for the [alpha] (British) variant. "It shows the delta variant of the coronavirus is rapidly spreading in Afghanistan, and this is the main reason for the rise and criticality of the cases," Majrooh warned in his nationally televised news conference.

The minister stressed that the crisis required the Afghan nation to strictly observe safety guidelines to help contain the spread of the delta variant, which is more infectious and more resistant to existing vaccines. The coronavirus, which causes COVID-19 disease, hit Afghanistan early last year [2020], infecting 114 000 people and killing 4600 to date. Afghan officials have documented an average of more than 80 deaths a day, however, from COVID-19 over the past week or so. The data accounts only for a fraction of cases, though, because of capacity issues and a lack of access to areas controlled by the Taliban insurgency.

The pandemic has led to a shortage of medical oxygen, with hospitals throughout Afghanistan refusing to accept new coronavirus patients, citing a lack of beds and other shortages. The outbreak forced the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to lock down much of the diplomatic mission after dozens of its staff contracted the coronavirus. The deteriorating security has added to the challenges facing Afghan health authorities in battling the COVID-19 outbreak.

Afghan authorities are said to have administered 766 000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine in a country with an estimated population of more than 35 million people, with less than a 0.5% fully vaccinated so far. The conflict and suspicions about vaccines are blamed for the slow-moving national inoculation campaign. Kabul has received donations of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India and the Sinopharm vaccine from China. The United States has pledged to deliver 3 million doses of the single-shot Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine as early as next week to help the Afghan government combat what is being termed the deadliest wave of the pandemic.

[Like many other south Asian countries, Afghanistan is also experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases during recent weeks. As mentioned in the news report above, among a fraction of the samples tested for genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in Afghanistan, around 60% of the samples were found to be positive for the delta variant of the virus, while the rest of the samples were positive for the alpha variant.

According to US CDC, none of the variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified as variants of high consequence with clear evidence that preventive measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating
variants (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html).

Both delta and alpha variants of the virus, labelled as variants of concern (VoC), detected in Afghanistan have been associated with increase transmissibility; however, the delta variant also has the potential of reduction in neutralization by post-vaccination sera.

The spread of variants of viruses with high transmissibility in countries with fragmented surveillance and contact tracing, limited testing, and management facilities could have serious consequences as the health system may not be able to cope with the high number of moderate to severe COVID-19 cases. In addition to implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, there is a need to ramp up vaccination efforts to minimize the impact of the current wave of the pandemic in Afghanistan. - Mod.MS]
