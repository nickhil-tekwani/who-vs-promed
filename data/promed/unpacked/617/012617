An outbreak of a contagious disease transmitted from animals to humans has been found among dairy workers in north eastern China's Heilongjiang province, according to local publication Legal Weekly.

Employees of Gannan Flying Crane Dairy Products were found to have brucellosis, a disease characterized by fever, sweating, weakness, and body pain. 11 cases were confirmed in March 2012 during checkups, and another 26 workers were found to have the disease after further examination. 600 cows are also infected.

The company denied the report. However, infected workers have reportedly been sent home on sick leave pending investigation. The disease was found among a large number of company cows as far back as October 2011, but a worker said requests for health examinations of employees were denied.

According to an article published in the Chinese Journal of Endemic Disease Control, brucellosis threatens 350 million people in China. From 1996 to 2011, the incidence rate increased by nearly 30 times.
