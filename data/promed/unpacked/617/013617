On 16 Jan 2007, the State Health Secretary confirmed the 1st case of
yellow fever (YF) in the region this year [2007], which was in a
38-year-old physician in Bom Despacho.
In recent months, especially in December 2006, the Regional Health
Directorate had alerted the state government that monkeys were dying
in rural areas of the region, especially in Moema e Leandro Ferreira,
presumably from YF.
There is serious concern because the dengue mosquito [_Aedes
aegypti_] also transmits YF, therefore, inhabitants of the region who
are not vaccinated against YF run the risk of infection.

[Monkey deaths in South America have historically signaled an
outbreak of jungle YF. Towns throughout Minas Gerais state are
infested with _Ae. aegypti_ and, therefore, are at risk from the
introduction of YF if a viremic patient from a rural area were to be
hospitalized in town and not protected from mosquito bites.
It is not clear why this is being reported in the local press so
late. The case has not appeared on either the PAHO or WHO outbreak
news web pages, so it presumably has not yet been reported to them as
required by the International Health Regulations.
