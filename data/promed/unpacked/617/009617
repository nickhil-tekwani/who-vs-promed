The Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong has
confirmed that a dog has tested positive for Hendra virus.

Queensland chief veterinary officer, Dr Rick Symons said this was an
unprecedented situation. "This is the 1st time outside of a laboratory
that an animal other than a flying fox or a horse, or a human, has
been confirmed with Hendra virus infection," Dr Symons said.

"The dog is on a property where Hendra virus infection has been
confirmed and is currently under quarantine. Biosecurity Queensland's
policy is to test cats and dogs on properties where there are infected
horses. "In this case, the dog returned 2 negative results for the
presence of the virus but a different type of test conducted at AAHL
has confirmed the presence of antibodies. This means that at some
point the dog has been exposed to the virus but to our knowledge has
shown no signs of illness."

Dr Symons said this case raised many questions for biosecurity and
health officials and researchers. "We don't know how the dog
contracted the virus or when it happened," he said. "Based on our
knowledge to date, it is most likely that the dog caught the virus
from an infected horse. The remaining horses and dogs on this property
are still being monitored daily and show no signs of illness.

"Biosecurity Queensland has tested other cats and dogs on the 11
properties currently under quarantine in Queensland and has received
no other positive results.

"We recommend that people keep dogs and cats away from sick horses to
reduce the risk of such an infection happening."

Queensland's chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said Queensland
Health would today [26 Jul 2011] speak with the property owners to
assess if there were any further people who may have had contact with
the infected dog.

"We will continue to monitor the property owners and all previously
identified contacts for infected horses on this property," Dr Young
said. "While we have not seen Hendra virus in a dog before, I believe
there is a minimal risk of infection to humans from this animal. For a
human to become infected, they would have had to have significant
contact with bodily secretions (saliva and/or blood) that contain the
Hendra virus."

Dr Young said Queensland Health continued to have a number of staff
working on the Hendra response, including public health officials,
medical and testing staff.

"Staff are also available to assist anyone with concerns via 13 HEALTH
(13 43 25 84), and mental health staff are on standby to provide
counselling or support," she said.

A dog has tested positive to the potentially fatal Hendra virus for
the 1st time.

The pet kelpie tested positive to the virus last night [25 Jul 2011],
authorities announced this afternoon.

It lives on a property near Beaudesert, in south-east Queensland,
which was already under quarantine because of a recent Hendra case in
a horse.

Queensland chief vet Rick Symons said it was the 1st time outside a
laboratory that an animal other than a flying fox, horse, or human had
been confirmed with the virus.

"We don't know how the dog contracted the virus or when it happened,"
Dr Symons said. "Based on our knowledge to date, it is most likely
that the dog caught the virus from an infected horse."

Dr Symons said the case involving a dog did not necessarily mean the
virus had evolved. "We don't know in this instance but we do know the
virus is a very stable virus. We're not seeing different strands of
the virus," he said.

The dog had returned 2 negative results for the virus but a different
type of test conducted at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in
Victoria confirmed the presence of Hendra antibodies.

"This means that at some point the dog has been exposed to the virus
but to our knowledge has shown no signs of illness," Dr Symons said.

Dr Symons said the dog would have to be put down because of a national
policy to euthanise animals infected with Hendra. "I've talked to the
family. They are struggling with it as you can imagine. It's their
family pet," he said. "It is part of the family and of course they
will grieve. If destruction is the policy, they have to come to terms
with that."

Dr Symons said an animal health committee comprising the nation's
chief vets had discussed the case today [26 Jul 2011] and decided to
keep the policy of destroying animals that contract the virus.

He said it would be risky to keep the dog alive.

Dr Symons said because the virus had spread among horses on the
property, it was believed to have also spread to the dog because of
contact it had with a horse.

"We know that that property had 3 horses affected ... we know that
transmission has occurred on that property. We know that one of the
horses lay for a while and the access of dogs to that is quite
plausible, that the dogs contacted that. We don't exactly know because
we weren't there at the time," he said.

Biosecurity Queensland's policy is to test cats and dogs on properties
where there are infected horses. Tests on cats and dogs on 11
properties currently under quarantine in Queensland have turned up no
other positive results.

Dr Symons said there were no cats on the property but there were 2
other dogs. One of those dogs had tested negative to the virus while
further testing was being done on the other.

The case has raised many questions for biosecurity and health
officials and researchers.

The 1st dog to contract the Hendra virus has scientists guessing
whether the virus is being transmitted differently or if humans can
now catch the disease from canines.

The male kelpie tested positive to the virus yesterday [25 Jul 2011].
It has been taken from its owners and they'll be asked for permission
to put it down, as required under national Hendra guidelines,
Biosecurity Queensland says. The much-loved family pet lives on a
property in Mt Alford, west of the Gold Coast, where 3 horses died of
the virus in late June and early July [2011]. One of the horses is
believed to have infected the dog.

Only humans, bats, and horses have carried the virus previously.

Queensland chief vet Rick Symons said it was unclear if the leap to a
dog indicated a change in the way the virus was transmitted. "What we
are seeing here is an evolving disease, and an evolving virus, and
there are changes as the virus evolves and the exposure changes," he
told reporters in Brisbane. "We don't know in this instance (if the
virus has changed) ... all the work done to date has been that this is
a very stable virus."

Queensland's chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said scientists
were yet to confirm if humans could contract the disease from animals
other than horses. "I don't know," she said. "We know about the risk
of horses. We don't really know the risk from other animals."

She said the dog was not excreting the virus and had a very low risk
of transmitting the disease, and humans needed to be exposed to a very
large amount of the virus to become unwell.

"I don't know about greater risk, but it is something we do need to
look at very carefully," she said. "This has changed our knowledge
quite significantly."

Two other dogs on the property have been found to be negative for the
virus so far.

Premier Anna Bligh said she'd meet with a joint Queensland-NSW Hendra
taskforce on Wednesday [27 Jul 2011].

"We need to understand better what is happening with this disease,"
she told reporters in Brisbane. "It is relatively unknown and, despite
the scientific effort to date, there are continuing developments that
I think are very worrying."

Dr Peter Reid, the vet involved in the 1st Hendra outbreak in 1994,
said proof dogs could also contract the potentially deadly Hendra
virus was a huge concern for every pet owner. "Now we know it can jump
to dogs it's a bigger fight and opens up a whole gamut of concerns,"
he said.

Scientific research has shown the virus can jump to cats, guinea pigs,
hamsters, ferrets, pigs, and dogs, but this is the 1st case of an
actual transmission in natural conditions.

Since [20 Jun 2011], 14 horses infected with Hendra have died or been
put down, 10 in Queensland and 4 in NSW.

The virus has only ever been detected in the 2 eastern Australian
states. Cases have spanned from west of Cairns, in north Queensland,
to Chinchilla on Queensland's western Darling Downs, and to Macksville
on the New South Wales mid-north coast.

More than 57 people are believed to have been exposed to
Hendra-infected horses in Queensland and NSW. All are now undergoing
tests.

[Since 1994 it seems there has been some evidence, even laboratory
transmissions, that other species were capable of supporting the
virus. Further if this kelpie is not ill, not shedding virus, then he
is presenting us with a fantastic opportunity for study. Such an
approach would allow his life to be spared and let us learn a great
deal. Perhaps there are animals that seroconvert but never become ill,
and never shed virus. This may indicate exposure but nothing else.

Further, it would seem prudent to be sure the test is validated,
especially since he was negative on the 1st 2 tests. What is different
about this test?

Has any one looked at how much virus is being shed from the saliva of
a horse? Or even the urine of the horse? It seems it would be
important to learn from the horse as well as from the dog.

Learning from this situation, vs simply euthanasia may be more
valuable in saving lives in the future. Does a dog pass virus in
saliva? Urine? Feces? These are important when it comes to having pets
in our homes, many stations have pets as well as working animals, and
some animals are both.

There really is so much to learn yet about this virus. We need to
operate in a cautious but extremely curious atmosphere to learn all we
can and solve the many unanswered questions. - Mod.TG]
