NEW DELHI: Should India press the panic button on the contagious foot and
mouth disease (FMD)? Animal deaths have been reported from Haryana, Punjab,
and Jammu; the latest to report more than 400 animals dead is Rajasthan.
[Both Madhya Pradesh [and Rajasthan have ordered animal vaccinations.
Officials, however, see no reason to panic. By itself, FMD [is endemic in
the country, [and is not considered a major problem.
The virus takes a toll on productivity, but not generally on life, and it
is said to be harmless to humans. Vaccination is possible but is not done
on a large scale. The problem this time, says the Indian Council of
Agricultural Research, is [that the disease -- the same strain of the
virus as in Britain -- seems to have combined with the deadly hemorrhagic
septicemia, another disease endemic in India.
What happens, say scientists, is that FMD lowers an animal's immunity and
the "killer" hemorrhagic septicemia gets it by the throat -- the neck
swells, the respiratory tract is blocked and, if not treated immediately,
the animal dies within 24 hours. [Hemorrhagic septicemia rather than FMD
has killed many animals in Haryana, Punjab, and Jammu over the past couple
of months, say scientists, [who have advised vaccinations of healthy and
affected animals against FMD and segregation of the sick ones.
[Scientists are not clear yet about the outbreak in Rajasthan. Union
government officials are not particularly worried. "There is no outbreak of
FMD. It is prevalent all over the country, every year; this year, it is
much less," insists a senior agriculture ministry official. He admits
[that the plan for nationwide simultaneous vaccination has been dug out of
the files, since animals which live through the disease remain carriers.
The virus can still travel, even on the wind. But vaccination of all
cloven-footed animals, [which are susceptible to FMD, would require a
tremendous effort, huge doses of vaccine and cost a packet. Say, about 400
million doses a year, each dose costing Rs 6 - that is Rs 240 crore. And,
immunity doesn't last more than 6 months, so animals have to be vaccinated
regularly.
The scale of the problem becomes clearer when one is told vaccination is so
far limited to selected animals on organized farms, or less than 2 per cent
of the susceptible animals. Over the years, 2 vaccination options have
been, and are being, considered -- a countrywide strategy or a zone-by-zone
strategy, the latter made somewhat tougher by the fact officials
acknowledge it is difficult to enforce restrictions on movement of animals.
But strategies against FMD may be well worth the effort given the economic
toll -- the disease lowers milk production, reduces the working ability of
draught animals, and leaves export of animal products out in the cold.
Losses on the first 2 counts alone are between Rs 1500 crore and Rs 2000
crore a year.

GUWAHATI, India: Officials said 25 per cent of cattle in India's
northeastern Assam state are infected with foot and mouth disease (FMD) but
there is no cause for panic.
Government veterinarian Kushal Konwar Sharma said the disease was a "common
phenomenon in Assam" and had been detected in most of the 1500 cattle
brought to a routine vaccination camp last week. "There is no cause for
panic. It can be easily controlled," Sharma said. "25 per cent of the
estimated 7.5 million cattle in Assam are afflicted with FMD and steps have
been taken to prevent further spread," he added.
India's desert state of Rajasthan has launched a vaccination drive to
prevent the spread of FMD after some cases of the devastating livestock
illness were reported in the province in the winter season.
