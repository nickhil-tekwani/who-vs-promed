Foot & mouth disease in Mozambique: confirmation of diagnosis
-------------------------------------------------------------
(last FMD outbreak reported in Mozambique in 1985)
Information received on 13 Nov 2002 from Dr Adolfo Paulo Mavale, head of
the Animal Health Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Maputo:
The Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, South Africa, confirmed the
outbreak in Calanga (see Disease Information, 15 [45], 234, 8 November
2002) as being due to foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus type SAT 1. Virus
isolates are closely related to ZIM/14/98 isolated from buffalo in
Lubangwua Island Kariba, Zimbabwe in 1998. Supposed source of infection
seems to be animals originating in Chicualacuala.
A new outbreak was detected. This new outbreak is located in Manzir (25ยบ
03' 20.8 S - 33ยบ 03' 00.5 E), Gaza Province, Macia District, 46 km from the

Total number of susceptible animals in the new outbreak: 2000 head of cattle.
Number of cases: 20.
Number of deaths: 2.

[Last month, Zimbabwe reported an FMD outbreak, suspected to be caused by
FMD virus serotype SAT 2. Previously, FMD virus SAT 2 had been identified
in samples from Zimbabwe by the Onderstepoort reference laboratory in June
2002. The current report on the identification of FMD virus SAT 1 in
Mozambique indicates that both serotypes are evolving at present in the
region. Chicualacuala, supposed to be the source of the current outbreak,
is situated on the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border and not far from the South
African territory. - Mod.AS]
