The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare reported 1 case of polio, the 1st
reported case in Bangladesh since August 2000. On 8 Mar [2006], polio was
confirmed in a 9-year-old girl from Chandpur district of Chittagong division
who became paralyzed on 23 Jan 2006.
On 10 Mar [2006], genetic sequencing of the virus by the Global
Specialized Polio Laboratory in Mumbai India, which tests all polio
samples from Bangladesh, showed that the virus is closely related to
viruses from western Uttar Pradesh in India.

The case -- a 9-year-old girl who became paralyzed on 23 Jan [2006]
-- is the 1st reported case of polio in Bangladesh since August 2000.
Situation
23 Jan: [The patient], aged 9 years, living in Chandpur district,
became ill with paralysis.
26 Jan: [She] is admitted to Chandpur hospital where the national
polio surveillance system rapidly came into action with a full case
investigation.
28-30 Jan: 2 stools collected and sent to Bangladesh's national polio
and measles laboratory.
2 Feb: outbreak response immunization conducted by health workers who
immunized 215 children living in close proximity to [her].
20 Feb: Bangladesh's national polio and measles laboratory detected
poliovirus in the stools.
22 Feb: virus isolate sent for intra-typic differentiation to Global
Polio Specialized Laboratory in Mumbai, India.
8 Mar: Global Specialized Polio Laboratory identified the virus as
wild poliovirus type 1. The Director of Primary Health Care and a WHO
National Professional Officer for Immunization, visit the area.
9 Mar: a team lead by the Ministry of Health, and supported by WHO
and UNICEF, was in the affected area conducting an initial outbreak
response investigation. The team immediately intensified acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance in the infected district and in
areas the child had visited prior to contracting polio. Children at
risk in the girl's locality were immunized.
12 Mar: additional WHO staff from WHO's Regional Office, in New
Delhi, and from WHO headquarters in Geneva joined this team to
support and guide the investigation and response.
14 Mar: the investigation team concludes that the surveillance and
immunizations systems are functioning well, but the whole country may
be at risk of polio spreading from this importation.
16 Mar: Minister of Health and Family Welfare is briefed by the
assessment team and announces nation-wide immunization campaign to
reach Bangladesh's 18 million children under the age of 5 with
monovalent oral polio vaccine.
Next steps:
The Minister of Health and Family Welfare is planning 3 large-scale
polio immunization campaigns, in line with the polio resolution
endorsed by the Executive Board of WHO in January 2006. The 1st
campaign will kick off on 16 April [2006].
Following a meeting on 16 Mar between the Minister, senior members of
his team and outbreak response investigation team members, including
those from WHO and UNICEF, the Minister announced that:
- An active house-to-house search for paralysed children will
continue in communities in the area of the confirmed case.
- Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is treating this case as an
outbreak emergency, and has issued a notification to all divisions
and to all surveillance units nationally to ensure that all new
paralysis cases anywhere in the country will be reported immediately.
- 3 rounds of large-scale immunization campaigns for all children
aged less than 5 years of age will be conducted to ensure that
transmission of wild poliovirus is rapidly interrupted, and to
rapidly improve population immunity in Bangladesh. The rounds will be
started 16 Apr 2006 and conducted at 4 week intervals. This strategy
will be revised as the epidemiology evolves.
- The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare will work with WHO,
UNICEF and other development partners to ensure that the USD 13.7
million required to conduct these activities are quickly mobilized.
Risks:
The outbreak may continue to spread in the immediate area of the case
and beyond. Circulation of wild poliovirus could be occurring in
other parts of Bangladesh; however this is unknown at the moment.
Experience in polio eradication demonstrates that outbreaks can be
quickly contained with rapidly-conducted, high-quality immunization
campaigns reaching every child under 5 years of age. On the other
hand, recent experience from other countries, including in the
South-East Asia region, has demonstrated the devastating consequences
of delaying the initial emergency response.
Global eradication efforts have reduced the number of polio cases
from 350 000 annually in 1988, to 1938 cases in 2005. Only 4
countries in the world -- Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan --
remain polio-endemic, and the number of countries still reporting
cases of imported polio after the 2003-2005 multi-country polio
epidemic dropped to 8 from 21.
Bangladesh's 3-campaign outbreak response is expected to cost USD
13.7 million. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is working
with WHO, UNICEF and other development partners to ensure funds are
rapidly mobilized to ensure that Bangladesh's investment in polio
eradication is protected.
Background
Bangladesh has had a highly effective polio eradication system in
place for many years: in 1999, 29 cases were reported, but prior to
the 8 Mar 2006 case, Bangladesh had not reported a case of polio
since August 2000.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare conducted national polio
immunization campaigns each year from 1995 to 2003. Surveys show that
routine polio immunization coverage has been consistently above 80
percent nationally.
Bangladesh's surveillance system for paralysis in children has
exceeded globally recognized minimum standards since 2001, this was
confirmed by a review team of international experts in March 2004.

[In the absence of discussion of a history of travel to Uttar Pradesh
(UP) India on the part of the case, or contact on the part of the case
with known travellers from Uttar Pradesh, there is the likelihood
that the wild poliovirus (WPV) responsible for this case has been
circulating in Bangladesh. This is clearly another setback for the
polio eradication initiative, as Bangladesh had been certified as
having interrupted transmission of WPV (3 years with no documented
WPV circulation).
Of note, since 1 Jan 2006 there have been 58 cases of polio confirmed
in India. In 1995 there were 54 confirmed casers, of which 25 were
from UP. 51 of the cases were associated with WPV type 1 and 3 cases
in UP were associated with WPV type 3.

We await more information on further epidemiologic and laboratory
investigations surrounding this case. - Mod.MPP]
