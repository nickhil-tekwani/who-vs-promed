WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2003 - USA (16)
**************************************
A ProMED-mail post

[Now that the West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through ArboNET are
appearing weekly in MMWR (see part 4 below), ProMED-mail will no longer
provide abstracted information from the USGS West Nile virus maps. A
summary map of the current situation is reproduced in MMWR, and the more
detailed USGS maps, down to county level in some categories, can be
accessed via <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov> for anyone requiring such
detailed information.
Only extensions of West Nile virus geographic range or host species, and
exceptional items, will be posted separately from now on.
This update includes reports of detection of West Nile virus in blood
donations in Texas and Colorado, a report of a probable case of human
infection in Minnesota, and confirmation of human infection in Alabama,
South Carolina, and Texas. - Mod.CP]
In this update:
[1] Positive blood donation; confirmed (Texas)
[2] Positive blood donations; suspected (Colorado)
[3] Human, suspected (Minnesota)

Texas: accuracy of blood supply test confirmed
----------------------------------------------
[Dr Rossmann has forwarded the following additional information concerning
the West Nile virus positive blood donation given by a woman in Texas last
month (see part [1] of West Nile virus update 2003 - USA (15)
20030711.1706). I am grateful for Dr Rossmann's prompt and informed
response to my request for information. Since the original report of the
positive blood donation was received, 3 suspected human cases of West Nile
virus infection have been reported from Montgomery county and north west
Houston, Texas. - Mod.CP]
The virus was sequenced (by Roche) to confirm that it is West Nile virus.
Donor follow-up will continue as part of the clinical trial for this test.
The donation was given the week of 22 Jun 2003. In our area there has been
bird and mosquito activity for some time, preceding the human cases that
have now also been reported (see part [6] of West Nile virus update 2003 -
USA (15) 20030711.1706).

Colorado: blood from 4 donors positive for West Nile virus
----------------------------------------------------------
4 people who donated blood to the Bonfils Blood Center in the past 15 days
have tested positive for West Nile virus, the mosquitoborne disease that
killed 284 Americans last year. A new test that the center began using on 1
Jul 2003 on all donated blood [detected] the virus, Bonfils spokeswoman
Jessica Maitland said on Tue 15 Jul 2003. The blood was quarantined and not
given to any patients. 2 cases were reported on Friday and 2 on Monday.
None of the donors reported any symptoms. Maitland said confirmation
testing could take 2 weeks. The 4 donors are letting doctors draw blood to
see whether they have developed antibodies to the virus.
In 2002, the first year that West Nile virus was found in Colorado, 14
residents tested positive for the virus. All recovered. The head of
communicable diseases for the state Department of Public Health and
Environment said he would be surprised if each of the 4 donors is confirmed
to have been infected. It's not unusual for a new test to show many false
positive results, Dr Ken Gershman said.
Maitland and Gershman said the blood supply in Colorado and across the
country is safe. Bonfils is one of 22 large blood centers around the nation
to use new screening tests. The center also includes specific West Nile
symptoms on the screening checklist for prospective donors, Maitland said.
West Nile virus infection usually starts with a fever, headache, muscle
aches, and fatigue.
[As of Wed 16 Jul 2003 (see below), West Nile virus has been detected in
both wild birds and mosquitoes in Colorado. There have been no reports of
West Nile virus infection of equines, humans, or sentinel flocks in
Colorado. - Mod.CP]

Minnesota: suspected human case of West Nile virus infection
------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials reported Minnesota's first probable human case of West
Nile virus infection for the season on Thu 17 Jul 2003. The Minnesota
Department of Health said a cerebrospinal fluid sample from an 80 year old
Faribault County man tested positive for West Nile virus antibody at a
hospital laboratory and the department's laboratory. The sample has been
sent to CDC in Atlanta for confirmation.
The man was admitted to hospital in late June 2003 with symptoms including
fever, severe headache, disorientation, unsteady gait, and fatigue. He has
since been discharged and is recovering, the health department said.

United States: West Nile virus activity, Thu 10 to Wed 16 Jul 2003
------------------------------------------------------------------
This report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to
CDC through ArboNET as of 7 a.m. Mountain Daylight Time, Wed 16 Jul 2003.
During the reporting week of Thu 10 to Wed 16 Jul 2003, 4 human cases of
WNV infection were reported from 2 states (Alabama and Texas). [A suspected
case of human infection in Minnesota is described in the preceding report
-- see (3) above -- and is awaiting confirmation]. During the same period,
WNV infections were reported in 112 dead corvids (crows and related
species), 18 other dead birds, 20 horses, and 130 mosquito pools.
During 2003, a total of 5 human cases of WNV infection have been reported:
3 from Texas and one from each of Alabama and South Carolina [illustrated
by a figure in the original text]. Three of the cases have been men; the
median age was 64 years (range: 42 to 73 years) and the dates of illness
onset ranged from 29 May to 24 Jun 2003. In addition, 242 dead corvids and
81 other dead birds with WNV infection have been reported from 29 states;
42 WNV infections in horses have been reported from 14 states (Alabama,
Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) and one
WNV infection has been reported in a dog (South Dakota). During 2003, WNV
seroconversions have been reported in 56 sentinel chicken flocks from
Florida, Iowa, and North Carolina. South Dakota reported 9 sero-positive
sentinel horses; 183 WNV positive mosquito pools have been reported from 10
states (Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan,
Mississippi, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Texas).
Additional information about WNV activity is available from CDC at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm> and
