A herd of cattle in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, has been hit with
an outbreak of anthrax. Officials with the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency said Friday [20 Aug 2010] that 12 cows were destroyed [died,
not destroyed - Mod.MHJ] because of the outbreak.

The affected animals were from a herd in the Fillmore area, about 110
kilometres [68 miles] south of Regina. The case follows an earlier
outbreak which hit a herd of bison in the Weyburn area, southeast of Regina.

Dr. Lynn Bates, a veterinarian with the CFIA, is recommending
ranchers vaccinate herds to guard against anthrax.
