Just days before the World Health Organization (WHO) was prepared to declare the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) over, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said today [10 Apr 2020] that officials have confirmed a new case.

"After 52 days without a case, surveillance and response teams on the ground have confirmed a new case. We have been preparing for and expecting more cases," Tedros tweeted.

"Unfortunately, this means the government of DRC will not be able to declare an end to the Ebola outbreak on Monday [13 Apr 2020], as hoped," he added. "But WHO remains on the ground and committed as ever to working with the government, affected communities and our partners to end the outbreak."

The WHO declares an outbreak over when a country goes through 42 days without identifying a new case. Monday would have marked 42 days since the last patient left a treatment center, but now the clock begins anew. The outbreak began in August 2018 and is the world's second-largest ever, behind the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa.

The new case involves a 26-year-old man in Beni, one of the outbreak's previous hot spots, according to The Hill. The case will bring the DRC outbreak to 3454 cases, which includes 2264 deaths.

[One can also see this report in The Hill (https://thehill.com/policy/international/492206-congo-reports-new-ebola-case-days-before-declaring-outbreak-over).

"The positive news is that the government of Congo, the teams, the partners on the ground and WHO were alert," said Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Program.

Ryan said WHO teams on the ground are still testing thousands of potential Ebola patients, and that vaccinations have continued as well. But he added the new case would reset the clock for declaring the outbreak over.

"We will continue that active surveillance right the way through. We'll just have to go again for another 42 days," Ryan said. "There is no exit strategy until you're in control of the strategy, and you must always be ready to go back again and start again."

There is no information on how this 26-year-old individual became infected with Ebola, but it is suggested in The Hill that since Beni was a hot spot of virus activity, it is possible the virus has been circulating in the region at a low level that has gone undetected until this recent case. Although occasional cases may be detected, which will always be concerning, it is more so in light of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and measles. - Mod.LK]

- Thu 2 April 2020. Update
[WHO Disease Outbreak News, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/02-April-2020-ebola-drc/en/

Since 17 Feb 2020, no new cases have been reported in the ongoing ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although this is a positive development, there is still a high risk of re-emergence of EVD given the current challenges related to limited resources amidst other local and global emergencies, continued insecurity and population displacement in previous hotspots, and limited access to some affected communities. It is therefore critical to maintain surveillance and response operations in the period leading up to the declaration of the end of the outbreak, as well as after the declaration -- as outlined in the WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak (https://bit.ly/2wzR9zu).

Ongoing outbreak response efforts continue, which include investigating and validating new alert cases, supporting appropriate care and rapid diagnosis of suspected cases (which continue to be detected), supporting survivors through a multidisciplinary programme, and strategically transitioning activities. From 24-31 Mar 2020, an average of 4082 alerts were reported and investigated daily. Of these alerts, 274 were validated as suspected cases, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule out EVD. From 23-29 Mar 2020, 2376 samples were tested, including 1322 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 365 swabs from community deaths; and 689 samples from retested patients. Overall, laboratory activity decreased by 14% compared with the prior week.

As of 31 Mar 2020, a total of 3453 EVD cases [see updated case number above] were reported from 29 health zones (see Table 1 [at source URL]), including 3310 confirmed and 143 probable cases, of which 2273 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n = 1935) were female, 28% (n = 979) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n = 171) were healthcare workers.

An urgent injection of USD 20 million is required to ensure that response teams have the capacity to maintain the appropriate level of operations through to the beginning of May 2020. If no new resources are received, WHO risks running out of funds for the Ebola response before the end of the outbreak.

Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. "Non-active zones" indicate health zones that have not reported new cases in the last 42 days.]
