Acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong SAR, Viet Nam
---------------------------------------------
WHO issues a global alert about cases of atypical pneumonia

Cases of severe respiratory illness may spread to hospital staff

Since mid February 2003, WHO has been actively working to confirm
reports of outbreaks of a severe form of pneumonia in Viet Nam, Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), China, & Guangdong province in
China.

Viet Nam
---------
In Viet Nam the outbreak began with a single initial case who was
hospitalized for treatment of severe, acute respiratory syndrome of unknown
origin. He felt unwell during his journey and fell ill shortly after arrival in
Hanoi from Shanghai and Hong Kong SAR, China. Following his admission
to the hospital, approximately 20 hospital staff became sick with similar
symptoms.

The signs and symptoms of the disease in Hanoi include initial flu-like illness
(rapid onset of high fever followed by muscle aches, headache and sore
throat). These are the most common symptoms. Early laboratory findings
may include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and leucopenia (low white
blood cell count). In some, but not all cases, this is followed by bilateral
pneumonia, in some cases progressing to acute respiratory distress
requiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are recovering
but some patients remain critically ill.

China (Hong Kong SAR)
----------------------
Today, the Department of Health Hong Kong SAR has reported on an
outbreak of respiratory illness in one of its public hospitals. As of midnight
11 March, 50 health care workers had been screened and 23 of them were
found to have febrile illness. They were admitted to the hospital for
observation as a precautionary measure. In this group, 8 have developed
early chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Their conditions are stable. 3 other
health care workers self-presented to hospitals with febrile illness and 2 of
them have chest x-ray signs of pneumonia.

Investigation by Hong Kong SAR public health authorities is on-going. The
Hospital Authority has increased infection control measures to prevent the
spread of the disease in the hospital. So far, no link has been found between
these cases and the outbreak in Hanoi.

China (Guangdong province)
-----------------------
In mid February 2003, the Government of China reported that 305 cases of
atypical pneumonia, with 5 deaths, had occurred in Guangdong province. In
2 cases that died, chlamydia infection was found. Further investigations of
the cause of the outbreak is ongoing.

Overall the outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong SAR appear to be confined to
the hospital environment. Those at highest risk appear to be staff caring for
the patients.

No link has so far been made between these outbreaks of acute respiratory
illness in Hanoi and Hong Kong and the outbreak of 'bird flu,' A(H5N1) in
Hong Kong SAR reported on 19 Feb 2003. Further investigations continue
and laboratory tests on specimens from Viet Nam and Hong Kong SAR are
being studied by WHO collaborating centres in Japan and the United States.

Until more is known about the cause of these outbreaks, WHO recommends
patients with atypical pneumonia who may be related to these outbreaks be
isolated with barrier nursing techniques. At the same time, WHO
recommends that any suspect cases be reported to national health
authorities.

WHO is in close contact with relevant national authorities and has also
offered epidemiological, laboratory and clinical support. WHO is working
with national authorities to ensure appropriate investigation, reporting and
containment of these outbreaks.
