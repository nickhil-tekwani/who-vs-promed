[The occurrence of 33 new cases in just 2 days in Volgograd city is of
concern. The 1 Sep 2010 ProMED-mail report (archive number 20100902.3141)
indicated that a total of 206 West Nile [WN] fever cases have been
registered in Russia's southern Volgograd region since 16 Jul [2010]. The
number for the oblast has now increased to 239, and virus transmission is
unlikely to stop until cold weather arrives.
