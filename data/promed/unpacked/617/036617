Wheat rust sightings spread to Scotland
---------------------------------------
New rust sightings in winter wheat crops are now emerging in Scotland.
These are in addition to earlier reports from across parts of England [see
recent ProMED-mail post no. 20090417.1452].

According to SAC [Scottish Agricultural College] senior researcher Dr Simon
Oxley, yellow rust in Scotland has now been sighted in a number of winter
wheat crops. But while yellow rust isn't uncommon in wheat, he is concerned
that what may catch growers out is its appearance after such a cold winter.
"A lot of people assumed disease pressure would be low this year [2009],"
he observes.

Recent foggy weather could have encouraged the symptoms, he says, so where
there's a risk it should be targeted with an early-season fungicide. "The
advice in the regions is to protect from yellow rust and try to eradicate
it," he says.

Further south, Syngenta cereal disease specialist Rod Burke says these
latest sightings add to earlier reports from East Anglia, Warwickshire, and
Northamptonshire, and even further afield. "It could be one of those years
where you have to watch for rusts all season," says Mr Burke.

Disease strikes wheat crop in Sindh
-----------------------------------
Wheat production in Sindh is likely to fall below target as a disease has
damaged the grain in the upper parts of the province. The disease called
"rust" has attacked a wheat variety 'bakhar', causing severe damage to the
grain. In some cases, the grain is missing and only the weeds are found
during harvesting.

"Bakhar is a variety of Punjab, which is sown earlier than local Sindh
varieties. It is vulnerable to the atmosphere of Sindh," said Abdul Majeed
Nizamani, president Sindh Abadgar Board. More than 50 per cent of land was
sown with this variety in Khairpur and Nausheroferoze districts. It was
also sown in other upper Sindh districts as well as some parts of Balochistan.

The government has set a production target of 25 million tonnes of wheat
for 2008-09 but the disease attack has put it in jeopardy. The government
has so far imported around 350 000 tonnes of wheat in 2008-09. Urea
shortage would also affect production of other local varieties.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereal crops is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow leaf
stripes, stunting of plants, and reduces grain production with yield losses
of 40 to 100 per cent. Spores are spread by wind and with infected straw,
and some grasses or volunteer wheat may generate a "green bridge" providing
inoculum for the next cropping season. Disease management includes the use
of resistant varieties, fungicides, and control of volunteer wheat.

Outbreaks of stripe rust have been reported earlier from the UK in parts of
England. Several recent outbreaks, including a new strain, have also been
reported from northern India where it was claimed that the epidemic
originated in Pakistan. Item [2] above may refer to this stripe rust
problem, but it cannot be excluded that one of the other 2 wheat rusts are
involved.

Leaf rust, also called brown rust, of wheat is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia recondita_. It reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant
and can cause serious yield losses of over 40 per cent in individual
fields. Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 70 per cent are reported, but some
fields are totally destroyed. For more information on the 3 wheat rusts
please see previous ProMED-mail posts and links below.
