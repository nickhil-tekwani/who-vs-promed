[Following the winter pause, the LSD virus and its vectors have resumed their activity in the 2 affected European regions, namely in the Balkan/adjacent countries and in the Caucasus and adjacent south-western Russian territories. In the latter, the virus has now spread northward's into the hitherto unaffected Kalmyk Republic, threatening Kazakhstan.

An interactive OIE map showing the new LSD outbreaks since the beginning of 2016 is available at http://tinyurl.com/zn2jwwl (click on the selected cluster, zoom-in).

While in the Balkan region and adjacent countries, emergency vaccination has been applied, no vaccination is known to have been applied, so far, within the affected Russian territories.

LSD is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
