[This very brief report indicates that there have been 4 monkeypox cases reported in the Central African Republic (CAR) so far this year (2022), of which 2 died of the disease.

ProMED has reported sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX) in the Central African Republic (CAR). Since 2013, except for 2020 and 2021, CAR has been reporting at least one MPX outbreak every year, especially in its eastern region. The case fatality rate continues to be very low except for the 2 deaths of 4 cases reported above. However, these are very small numbers and do not provide reliable case fatality rates.

Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection. The question remains about the source of these recent infections within the CAR as well as in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Liberia. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received.

Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

The MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak and previous ones in the CAR is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of up to17 percent -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. - Mod.TY
