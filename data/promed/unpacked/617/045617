LEGIONELLOSIS - NEW ZEALAND (03): (MARLBOROUGH)

Steam from a cooling tower is suspected to be behind an outbreak of
Legionnaires' disease in the Marlborough region. Nelson Marlborough
Public Health Service has tested 19 cooling towers and found one
contained the same strain of bacteria that infected 3 people last
month [April 2011]. That is 2 more cases than are normally reported in
the region for the entire year.

Regional medical officer of health Ed Kiddle says the 3 men worked in
the same area as the infected tower; 6 more people who have symptoms
of legionellosis are being tested for the disease. Dr Kiddle says all
the towers have been shock-dosed with chemicals to remove the bacteria
and the threat seems to be over.

[For a discussion of legionellosis, see the prior ProMED-mail post
that concerned this outbreak of legionellosis in the town of Blenheim,
New Zealand (Legionellosis - New Zealand (02): (MA) 20110525.1586).
The news release in this prior ProMED-mail post stated there were 3
confirmed cases of legionellosis from this industrial estate area plus
8 suspected cases of legionellosis that were awaiting serologic
confirmation of the diagnosis (not 6 suspected cases as stated in the
above news release).

The above news release says that one of the 19 cooling towers in the
area where the 3 men worked contained the same "strain" of bacteria
that infected the 3 people last month [April 2011] but fails to
specify whether this determination was based on speciation or actual
genotyping of patient isolates and the environmental isolate. Because
_Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to
any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir
should be demonstrated by means of genotyping methods, if possible
(see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). If the
genotype of clinical and environmental isolates match, this would
confirm the cooling tower as the source of the outbreak.

Marlborough is one of the regions of New Zealand, located on the
northeast coast of the South Island. Blenheim, the most populous town
in the Marlborough region, is the seat of the regional council and has
a population of 30 200 (June 2010 estimate)
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough_Region). The area that
surrounds the town is well known as a center of New Zealand's wine
industry. For a map of the Riverlands Industrial Estate on the
outskirts of Blenheim and its relation to Blenheim, see
