Mystery virus wreaks havoc
------------------------------
Abalone means rich pickings for some, but now a devastating virus is
putting a dent in the state's USD 80 million share of the market.
Paul Heinrichs reports that scientists are at a loss to explain how
the virus appeared, where it came from, or what to do about it.
Victoria's USD 80 million abalone industry, which turned USD 2
fishing license holders into multi-millionaires, is experiencing its
1st big setback with the spread of a devastating new virus.
The industry contributes to Australia's supplying half the world's
abalone but has become bitterly divided by suspicions that the
disease might have spread from farms to the wild stocks.
Abalone, a rich-tasting and costly shellfish, is being wiped out in
western Victorian waters by a herpes-like virus known as ganglioneuritis.
The virus was unknown until it was 1st noticed 15 months ago on
commercial abalone farms at Portland and near Port Fairy.
It is not known to have any ill effects on people, but infected
abalone, which lose their grip on undersea rocks and eventually die,
are not being harvested.
After the virus reappeared last May 2006, the farms voluntarily
quarantined themselves, sacrificed abalone stock worth millions of
dollars and decontaminated equipment.
But the virus appeared in the sea off Port Fairy at the same time and
has now spread east to Warrnambool, 25 km away, and west to Portland,
wiping an estimated USD 45 million from western region license values.
Now the Victorian Abalone Divers Association, which represents the
majority central region from Warrnambool to Lakes Entrance, is taking
drastic steps to try to prevent the virus spreading to its lucrative waters.
It wants a voluntary ban on all fishing between Warrnambool and Port
Campbell to make sure human activity does not inadvertently
contribute to the spread.
Fisheries Victoria has also come under attack from state Opposition
agriculture spokesman John Vogels, who accuses it of having been
"very slack" in not quarantining the initial outbreaks, a charge it denies.
Executive director Peter Appleford says: "Once these diseases get
into the wild, if they are spreading, there's nothing we can do to stop it."
Divers at Port Fairy such as Peter Riddle say the local wild abalone
harvest will be severely reduced for years, damaging their incomes
and reducing turnover through the local cannery.
Biosecurity measures are in place, but the virus appears to be
spreading by sea, turning up in abalone in the Merri Marine Sanctuary
off Warrnambool.
Dr Appleford says Fisheries Victoria's practice in the case has been
reviewed and praised by international experts, who were called in to
do epidemiological studies.
He says there is no certainty about how or where the virus came from.
The Australian Abalone Growers Association, which represents
commercial farms, says a panel of experts feels it is most likely a
naturally-occurring virus and has simultaneously affected the farm
and wild sectors alike.
"We feel the reputation of our industry is being sullied with a wide
range of accusations that do not have credible scientific support,"
spokesman Shane McLinden says.

[Ganglioneuritis is an interesting condition causing inflammation in
the nervous tissue, which swells. The result is curling of the
abalone foot and swelling of the mouth. Thus, the organism cannot eat
and looses its grip on the rocks it so depends on.
In June 2006, coastal waters off Port Fairy were declared a Control
Area under the Victorian Livestock Disease Control Act (1994), as the
disease is listed as notifiable.
Fishing and diving activities in the Control Area were restricted to
minimize the risk of human activity transferring the disease to
unaffected abalone populations elsewhere in the State.
The Control Area was replaced by a Temporary Abalone Closure in the
form of a Fisheries Notice under the Fisheries Act 1998. It was put
in place to protect vulnerable and accessible abalone stocks close to
Port Fairy from fishing pressure.
The Fisheries Notice prohibits the:
* Taking of abalone, other shellfish and sea urchins,
* Use of commercial abalone fishing equipment,
* Collection of any substrate.
Vessels may move through and anchor within the area. Line fishing
from the shore or boats is also permitted, as are surfing, swimming,
diving (including for rock lobster) and walking along the shore/rocks.
The Fisheries Notice expires on 31 Mar 2007.
Additional management measures (biosecurity protocols) have been
developed for the recreational, commercial and aquaculture fishing sectors.
Protocols were developed for waters inside and outside of the
Temporary Abalone Closure to further minimize the risk of spreading
the disease. These controls require the:
* Decontamination of vessels, wetsuits, dive equipment, catch bags,
boxes and people who come into contact with abalone with soapy freshwater,
* Appropriate disposal of abalone shell, meat and gut.
Abalone shell, viscera (meat and gut) should not be:
* shucked (taken from the shell) at sea,
* dumped into the sea,
* used as fishing bait.
The abalone catch should be taken home, where the waste can be
disposed of with household rubbish.
