[Tom Pringle ressurected an account of an apparent instance of conjugal CJD.
I am circulating it to ProMED members as there are some valuable lessons
involved in this event. MHJ]

In the report by Jellinger,(48) the onset of disease and date of death of a
husband and wife are closely related in cases of conjugal CJD. This could
imply a common exposure, as well as a lateral transmission. Similarly, in a
study of CJD cases according to profession, nurses accounted for 2.27%,
which was a higher representation than in the general population. Whether
this was the result of self injection with infected materials while working
within a neurological department or whether these were patient-care nurses
was not identified.

This early report of "conjugal CJD" could _not_ be confirmed as CJD in both
spouses when modern methods including immunocytochemistry for PrP were used
on archival tissue (Lancet 1996;347:616-617). Thus we still need to wait for
a definite case of conjugal CJD and noninvasive lateral transmission between
humans.

This couple from Vienna was reported in the papers by Garzuly F, Jellinger
K, Pilz P: Subakute spongi=F6se Encephalopathie (Jakob-Creutzfeldt-Syndrom).
Klinisch-morphologische Analyse von 9 F=E4llen. Arch Psychiatr Nervenkr
1971;214:207-227 (cases 7 & 8), and Jellinger K, Seitelberger F, Heiss WD,
Holczabek W: Konjugale Form der subakuten spongi=F6sen Enzephalopathie. Wien
Klin Wochenschr 1972;84:245-249.=20
According to the rather limited experience of that time, these cases were
considered to be compatible clinicopathologically with CJD. Both spouses
fell ill almost simultaneously and died after 2 and 4 months, respectively.
An initial psychiatric stage was followed by progressive dementia with
cerebellar, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs and symptoms and terminal
decerebration. None had a CJD-typical EEG or myoclonus. Although some
intoxication, especially from organic pesticides, was suspected, it could
not be verified by forensic chemistry. We recently reexamined archival brain
tissue from both spouses; histopathology was not convincing for TSE,
especially unequivocal spongiform change was lacking, and
immunocytochemistry for PrP was negative (Hainfellner JA, Jellinger K, Budka
H: Testing for prion protein does not
confirm previously reported conjugal CJD. Lancet 1996;347:616-617).=20
Although this rules out CJD, I cannot give now a definite diagnosis for this
couple. My guess is some sort of toxic encephalopathy, but this is not a
mere neuropathological diagnosis.
