2 new cases of leptospirosis confirmed in Hong Kong
-------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) <http://www.chp.gov.hk> of
the Department of Health has confirmed 2 new cases of leptospirosis
involving participants of the hiking activity "Team Challenge 36" held in
Aug 2004.
A CHP spokesman said: "The 2 affected are a 36-year-old man and a
19-year-old woman. Their blood samples were confirmed positive for
leptospirosis today." CHP's investigations revealed that the 2 cases were
epidemiologically linked to the leptospirosis case involving a 21-year-old
man confirmed during the week of 20 Aug 2004.
The 36-year-old man was reported to develop fever, chills and vomiting on 5
Sep 2004 and admitted to Ruttonjee Hospital on 8 Sep. He had recovered and
was discharged on 16 Sep. His left leg and elbow were wounded and soaked
with water during the activity.
In the woman's case, the patient developed fever, headache and muscle pain
on 7 Sep and sought medical treatment from a government clinic on 9 Sep.
Her symptoms gradually improved without hospitalization and she recovered.
She had also visited some stream areas and participated in rafting during
the activity. She had multiple abrasions, not properly covered, over both
upper limbs and feet, during the hiking.
Neither family members nor team members of either patient have any symptoms
of the disease at present. Meanwhile, CHP also tried to contact some other
400 participants in the activity to screen for symptoms, provide health
advice and make referrals as necessary. At present, none of the 309 persons
followed up so far have symptoms of the disease.
Leptospiral organisms can be found in some animals including rodents,
cattle, pigs, horses, and dogs. Most human infections occur through
contact with urine excreted by infected mammals primarily through skin
abrasions, open wounds or mucous membranes, and occasionally through
ingestion or inhalation.
Leptospirosis is normally not transmitted from person to person, and the
incubation period is usually between 4 and 19 days.
"Patients with leptospirosis commonly present with a flu-like illness with
high fever, headache, muscle pains, red eyes, sore throat and rash. In some
cases, the disease can cause anemia and affect the liver, kidneys, lungs,
and other internal organs. The disease can be treated effectively with
antibiotics," the spokesman said.
"The risk of leptospirosis infection can be minimized by covering open
wounds properly and avoiding contact with urine of live mammals and objects
contaminated by them as well as polluted water. Overseas outbreaks of
leptospirosis are usually related to occupational or recreational water
exposures, such as water contaminated with urine of infected animals," the
spokesman said.
The incidence of leptospirosis is low in Hong Kong. There was one local
case in 2001, 2 local cases in 2002, and 1 imported case in 2003. So far in
2004, there have been 1 imported and 4 local cases.

[Although only 3 cases have been identified, many human infections are
subclinical or very mild.
An outbreak of leptospirosis was associated with the Ironhorse Triathlon
and Bally Total Fitness USTS Triathlon, which both took place in the USA in
1998. These events were associated with high attack rates among the
participants: 11 percent in the Illinois-only participants, 5 percent in
the Wisconsin-only participants, and 7 percent in athletes participating in
both events.
