**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Blood donors
------------
A total of 192 presumptive West Nile viremic blood donors (PVDs) have been
reported to ArboNET in 2004. Of these, 68 (35 per cent) were reported in
California; 35 (18 per cent) in Arizona; 16 in Texas; 15 in New Mexico; 7
in Colorado; 6 each in Louisiana and Oklahoma; 5 in Nevada; 4 in Georgia
and Iowa; 3 each in Florida, Michigan, and South Dakota; 2 each in
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, and Wisconsin; and one each in Delaware,
Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon,
and Pennsylvania. Of the 192 PVDs, 3 persons aged 35, 69, and 77 years
subsequently had neuroinvasive illness, and 55 people (median age: 52
years; range: 17 to 73 years) subsequently had West Nile fever.
Dead birds
----------
In addition, 5660 dead corvids and 1414 other dead birds with WNV infection
have been reported from 46 states and New York City during 2004.
Equines
-------
WNV infections have been reported in horses in 37 states.
[Details of the numbers and distribution of equine cases can be obtained by
accessing the APHIS-USDA map
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahps/equine/wnv/map2004.html>.
As of Thu 18 Nov 2004 (the latest update), the total number of equine cases
in the USA in 2004 stands at 1305. California heads the list with 534 cases
(41 per cent of the total), followed by Arizona with 113 cases, Texas with
97 and Nevada with 86. The following states have not reported cases in
2004: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
Vermont and Washington. - Mod.CP]
Other animals
-------------
WNV has been confirmed in one bat in Wisconsin; 9 dogs in Nevada, New
Mexico, and Wisconsin; 7 squirrels in Arizona and Wyoming; and 14
unidentified animal species in 9 states (Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa,
Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, New York, and South Carolina).
Sentinel chickens and others
----------------------------
WNV seroconversions have been reported in 1429 sentinel chicken flocks in
14 states (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Iowa,
Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
and Utah) and in 31 wild hatchling birds in Missouri and Ohio. Four
seropositive sentinel horses were reported in Minnesota and Puerto Rico.
Mosquito pools
--------------
A total of 8263 WNV positive mosquito pools have been reported in 38
states, DC, and New York City.

Mexico: West Nile virus infection surveillance data
---------------------------------------------------
[The following updated figures have been extracted from the Resumen
Epidemiologico file accompanying the pictorial Maps of West Nile Virus
Activity in Mexico.
<http://www.cenave.gob.mx/von/archivos/ResumenCASOSVON.xls> - Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals -- humans
---------------------------
As of Thu 11 Nov 2004, the cumulative total of human tests carried out in
Mexico remains unchanged, and no additional seropositive individuals have
been detected: that is, in total 226 individuals resident in 25 of the 32
states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection; 225 were
seronegative and asymptomatic, and one individual in the state of Sonora
exhibited signs of disease [see: West Nile virus - Mexico (Sonora)
20040905.2486].
Cumulative totals - equines
---------------------------
As of Thu 11 Nov 2004, a total of 3065 horses from all 32 states had been
tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these animals 2272
were seronegative and 793 (25.9 per cent) were seropositive. All the
seropositive animals were asymptomatic. [These figures have not changed
since the update of Thu 28 Oct 2004.]
Cumulative totals - birds
-------------------------
As of Thu 11 Nov 2004, the number of birds tested remains unchanged at 4940
(given wrongly as 44 940 previously) since the previous update on Thu 4 Nov
2004. These birds were collected from 8 of the 32 states and have been
tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds 4750 were
seronegative and 188 were seropositive (and considered to be asymptomatic),
and one case in the state of Sonora and one case in the state of Baja
California exhibited signs of disease. (Initially both birds appear to have
been assigned to the state of Sonora). The seropositive birds were detected
in the states of Baja California, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Queretaro, Sonora
and Yucatan.
[Sonora state, where the single human case and one of the 2 avian cases
were confirmed, shares its northern border with the state of Arizona in the
USA. - Mod.CP]

On the possibility of cross protection as an explanation for the relative
lack of WNV in Mexico
--------------------------------------------------
In the 11 Nov 2004 ProMED-mail post "West Nile virus update - Western
Hemisphere (24) 20041111.3047" on West Nile virus activity in the Western
Hemisphere, the moderator mentioned the possibility that prior infection
with other arboviruses in Mexico (presumably the flaviviruses dengue virus
and St Louis encephalitis virus) could explain the relative lack of
symptomatic West Nile disease in Mexico. There is precedent for this
concept in the relative protection to Japanese encephalitis in children
previously infected with dengue. Are there any supportive data such as a
high prevalence of antibody to dengue and SLE in Mexicans, particularly
elderly Mexicans?

[Professor Seligman has posed interesting questions, and comments from
others would be welcomed. The moderator's comment (repeated below) was less
specific and did not attempt to identify specific agents.
"The results from Mexico differ significantly from those reported from the
USA and Canada in that there is no mortality other than the 2 birds in a
border state. The reason for this is unclear; possibilities are differences
in test criteria or occurrence of cross-protection as a result of
increasing exposure to infection by other arboviruses." - Mod.CP]
