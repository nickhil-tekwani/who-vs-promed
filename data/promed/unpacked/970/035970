In the Rostov region 38 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been recorded, 2 of whom have died. According to the Rostov-on-Don Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare], the victims were residents of the Peschanokopsky and Kagalnitsky areas and had been exposed to ixodid ticks. The cases of [of CCHF] infection were recorded in 17 localities in the region.

It is worth noting that the ticks are vectors not only of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, but also of other dangerous diseases. There have been 4 cases of Lyme disease in the Donetsk region, as well as 3 cases of leptospirosis, and 4 cases of West Nile fever [not normally a tick-transmitted disease?]. In total about 6344 individuals in the region have been treated for tick bits, which is 26 percent higher than last year's [2012] total.

Rostov epidemiologists remind the population that ticks are a hazard for all the region's communities. The symptoms of possible exposure to tick-transmitted diseases are fever, fatigue, sensation of tension in the muscles, especially in the calf, and headache.
