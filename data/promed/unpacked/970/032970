The number of people needing NHS care for the deadly mosquito-borne illness malaria has hit a 10-year high with hospital doctors having to deal with more than 7 cases a day.

The illness, which singer Cheryl Cole famously suffered from in 2010 after a trip to Tanzania, is brought into the country by travellers returning from exotic destinations where the disease is prevalent.

Figures from the NHS show that last year [2011] there were 2590 occasions where a patient needed treatment for malaria, up 27 per cent in the last 2 years.

Malaria is spread by mosquitoes in tropical areas but it cannot be transmitted directly from person to person.

The symptoms include a flu-like illness, fever, shaking, headache, muscle aches and tiredness, as well as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.

Patients suffering from the infection, which is the world's 2nd biggest killer, accounted for a total of 5127 NHS hospital bed nights.

The disease is responsible for killing an average of 9 people in the UK every year.

The NHS spend on anti-malarial drugs that are given to people who are going to places where the disease is found also hit a new high last year [2011] at GBP 4 million [USD 6.4 million].

'Malaria is a potentially deadly disease but is almost completely preventable,' said Dr Jane Jones, a travel health expert at the Health Protection Agency. 'All travellers to malaria risk areas need to be aware of the risk when travelling and to take anti-mosquito precautions and medication to keep safe.'

[According to the Health protection Agency, 1761 cases of malaria were imported into the United Kingdom in 2010, the last year the agency provided information (see http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Malaria/EpidemiologicalData/malaEpi20Importedmalariacasesbyreason/). 1495 cases were reported in 2009, 1370 in 2008, 1548 in 2007, and 1758 cases in 2006. The change in numbers primarily reflects cases in immigrants to the United Kingdom visiting their country of origin, so called "visiting friends and relatives" travelers.
