A 6th infant has died from syphilis amid a devastating outbreak of the disease in parts of remote Australia. The young children have all died in Queensland, where the spate of cases emerged in 2011. Department of Health official Sharon Appleyard told Senate Estimates that 6 of 13 infants with reported cases of congenital syphilis had died. The latest death occurred in northern Queensland in January [2018].

The bacterial outbreak is severely impacting indigenous communities and has now spread to Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth is coordinating a national response and has committed USD 8.8 million over 3 years for testing, treatment, and additional health workers. But Labor senator Patrick Dodson said syphilis cases were rising and the response was inadequate.

"Something's not working here," Senator Dodson said. "If this was happening in Victoria, you wouldn't be standing around having a meeting; someone would be doing something and fixing the problem up. USD 8 million; people are having a meeting ... it's not satisfactory."

But Department of Health official Caroline Edwards defended its work to date. "We are also very alarmed and distressed by the changes in this particular epidemic," Ms Edwards said. "We do take it very seriously and see it as a very important thing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout Australia." The department said it was looking to work with several Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations to pilot its response.

The Australian Medical Association has called for a national centre for disease control (CDC) to help control the outbreak. But Ms. Appleyard said a new, stand-alone authority was unnecessary. "Because of the federated nature of governance in this country ... providing national coordination in the way we do we think works best," she said.

[ProMED-mail previously reported an ongoing syphilis outbreak among young heterosexual indigenous people in remote communities that has spread across Australia since 2011 and that has been associated with increasing numbers of cases of congenital syphilis (Syphilis - Australia (02): (NT,WA) increase, indigenous, congenital, fatal 20151102.3760394, Syphilis - Australia: (NT) increased incidence, indigenous people, RFI 20150713.3507530, Syphilis - Australia (03): (QL) indigenous, RFI 20120808.1234631).

Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people (Indigenous Australians) includes many regional groups. There are about 650 000 Indigenous Australians; they make up about 30 per cent of the population in the Northern Territory, 4 per cent of the population in Queensland, and 3.4 per cent of the population in Western Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians). 70 per cent of the indigenous population live outside major cities, of which about 1/3rd live in remote communities, where access to health services is likely to be poor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians): "Only 20 per cent of Aboriginal people who live in remote communities of more than 50 people have access to a doctor on a daily basis according to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures from 2006. A further 41 per cent have local access to a doctor once a week or once a fortnight" (http://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/health/hospitals-doctors-health-aboriginal-people#ixzz3fk6Jag2m).

The following has been extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA: congenital, rising incidence Archive Number: 20180208.5615435:

Congenital syphilis occurs when a child is exposed in utero to a mother with untreated early syphilis. Up to 40 percent of babies born to women with untreated early syphilis may be stillborn, or die from the infection as a newborn (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm). Some babies are asymptomatic at birth, but, if untreated, may show developmental delay and damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain either in the 1st few weeks after birth or years later.

All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the 1st prenatal visit or at the time that pregnancy is confirmed. Testing should be repeated for pregnant women at high risk and in areas of high prevalence at the beginning of the 3rd trimester and at delivery.

The 2015 U.S. CDC guidelines for syphilis screening in pregnancy can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/syphilis-pregnancy.htm:

"All women should be screened serologically for syphilis early in pregnancy (106). Most states mandate screening at the 1st prenatal visit for all women (441). In populations in which receipt of prenatal care is not optimal, RPR test screening [the RPR, or rapid plasma reagin, test, is a blood test for syphilis that detects nontreponemal antibody] and treatment (if the RPR test is reactive) should be performed at the time pregnancy is confirmed (442). Antepartum screening by nontreponemal antibody testing is typical, but treponemal antibody testing is being used in some settings. Pregnant women with reactive treponemal screening tests should have additional quantitative nontreponemal testing, because titers are essential for monitoring treatment response. For communities and populations in which the prevalence of syphilis is high and for women at high risk for infection, serologic testing should also be performed twice during the 3rd trimester: once at 28-32 weeks' gestation and again at delivery. Any woman who has a fetal death after 20 weeks' gestation should be tested for syphilis. No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without maternal serologic status having been documented at least once during pregnancy, and if the mother is considered high risk, documented at delivery."
