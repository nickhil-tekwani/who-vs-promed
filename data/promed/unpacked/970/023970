Wyoming: First Case of West Nile Virus Infection in State Resident
------------------------------------------------------------------
State health officials said on Fri 11 Oct 2002 that an adult from Goshen
County has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). This marks the first
residential human case in Wyoming. Scott Seys, the deputy state
epidemiologist for the Wyoming Department of Health, said that the
individual became ill on 8 Sep 2002 with a mild infection and has since
recovered. The person was not hospitalized. Seys said the national Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have duplicated a positive result
from the agency's public health laboratory in Cheyenne. Although the
department of health is treating the case as a positive, final CDC
confirmation is pending and should be available by the end of the month.
Insect-borne disease transmission season has come to an end in many parts
of Wyoming, but individuals are encouraged to contact their healthcare
provider if they have concerns about WNV.
Terry Creekmore, WNV Project Coordinator for the Wyoming Department of
Health, asked that state residents discontinue sending birds to local and
or state health officials for testing until next spring. He will, however,
continue to test horses. Consultation on WNV information and testing for
horse owners and veterinarians is available by calling Dr. Cornish, Wyoming
State Veterinary Laboratory, University of Wyoming, at (307) 742-6638.
To date, WNV has been detected in [horses] in 12 of Wyoming's 23 counties:
Big Horn County, 6 horses; Campbell County, 9 horses 1 bird; Carbon County,
2 horses; Fremont County, 3 horses; Goshen County, 41 horses, 13 birds;
Johnson County, 2 birds; Laramie County, 11 horses; Natrona County, 3
horses; Niobrara County, 1 horse; Park County, 4 horses; Platte County, 3
horses 1 bird; Sheridan County, 3 horses; and Weston County, 1 horse.
