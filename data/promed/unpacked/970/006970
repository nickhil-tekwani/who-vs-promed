Qatar: Asian games hit by chickenpox outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
The Asian Games have been hit by a chickenpox outbreak amongst the
Maldives team, but the organizers insist that the problem will not
affect the 10 000 athletes taking part. [The 15th Asian Games are
being held in Doha, Qatar from 1 to 15 Dec 2006. The Maldives
volleyball team was scheduled to participate in a pre-Games
qualifying round. - Mod.CP]
The disease hit 3 members of the Indian Ocean [Maldives] island's
volleyball squad. Dr. Abdullah Al-Mussleh, the Games program manager
for health care and doping control, said that the disease was 1st
spotted in one player shortly after his arrival in Doha. "He was
immediately isolated, and all of the national Olympic committee of
the team concerned was screened for chickenpox. None of them showed
any indication of the disease at that stage," said Dr. Al-Mussleh.
Eight of the team were immune from the disease, but 7 were not. The
whole team has since been isolated, and all are on anti-viral
medicine. On Tuesday [28 Nov 2006], 2 more Maldives volleyball
players developed chickenpox rash, and they have also been isolated
at the city's main Hamad Hospital. "One has chickenpox; the other has
a high possibility of having chickenpox," added Dr. Al-Mussleh.
As a result of the outbreak, the team was forced to cancel its match
against Taiwan on Tuesday [28 Nov 2006]. But the Olympic Council of
Asia (OCA) has said that the team will be free to resume their
campaign as volleyball is not a contact sport.

[Varicella (chickenpox) is caused by Human herpesvirus 3 (formerly
known as Varicella-zoster virus) resulting in febrile illness in
children and occasionally adults, and herpes-zoster (shingles/hives)
in adults. Chickenpox is a common childhood illness, with an
incubation period of about 2 weeks, with a characteristic rash and
mild fever. In adults, illness can be more severe, with a painful
rash developing centripetally on the face and trunk. The rash becomes
vesicular and eventually resolves.
The virus is spread by the respiratory route and in some individuals
becomes latent in a dorsal route ganglion. Reactivation of infection
occurs predominantly to the elderly and immune-compromised.
In temperate climates, chickenpox is primarily a disease of
childhood, but there is some evidence that the age of onset may be
later in the Indian sub-continent. Consequently, there may be some
enhanced risk of transmission of this virus among participants in the
Asian Games in Doha, notwithstanding the fact that volleyball is not
a contact sport.

[This outbreak is being posted as an alert as the participants in
these athletic games include members from 45 countries (Afghanistan,
Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Taiwan, North
Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan,
Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Macau, Malaysia,
Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Palestinian team,
Philippines, Qatar, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, East Timor, Turkmenistan, United Arab
Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Yemen). Hence, the threat of
importation of cases to other countries is high. The incubation
period is approximately 7-21 days, and participants returning to
their home countries might very well be within the incubation period
for clinical illness onset upon after return to their homes. While
chickenpox (varicella) is usually a benign disease, it is one of the
predisposing illnesses that have been associated with Reyes syndrome,
a serious and at times fatal encephalopathy seen in children
following viral infections. It is also mistaken for smallpox
(variola) and has resulted in false alarms of possible variola
outbreaks when the affected cases included older age groups. - Mod.
