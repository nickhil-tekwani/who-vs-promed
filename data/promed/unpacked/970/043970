Movement of horses interstate and internationally: Limitations of
certification process
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Randall Crom provided some very informative points about the
epidemiology of West Nile virus (WNV)and horses in his comment dated 2 Aug
2000 [see West Nile virus surveillance - USA (17). Further to the issue
about the movement of horses interstate and internationally, I would like
to point out the limits of the health certification program relating to the
movement of horses with health certificates and the condition of infection.
While all horses that are moving interstate and internationally do require
health certificates, normally the time interval from the date of the actual
physical health inspection of the horse to the date of the issuance of the
health certificate can be 2 to 3 days and then the certificate is valid for
a period of up to 30 days. (This is also the case for Canadian Federal Vet
Certificates issued for horses travelling internationally).
Considering that clinical infection may not be apparent on the day of the
actual physical health inspection, a horse could develop symptoms and be
ill any time during the period of the 30 days while the certificate is
valid; that is prior to movement, during movement, or after movement.
Although, for horses moving internationally there can be an additional
check by a federal vet at the port of entry, this is limited to horses that
will be on an extended stay or are being imported to that country. Even
with this in place, unless the horse is obviously symptomatic and in great
discomfort, the very limited inspection at the port of entry will not
identify horses ill with WNV. All other horses moving internationally for
short periods of time do not need to check in with the federal vet at the
port of entry.
Due to time constraints it is not feasible to consider much alteration on
this regulation, but it is important to be aware of the limits of this
certification program and acknowledge that the only way to limit the
movement of ill horses interstate and internationally is through good
education strategies to horse owners about the risks of this infection and
the consideration they should give to the equine industry about spreading
disease. As Dr. Crom has pointed out horses appear to be a dead end host
for this infection, therefore movement of horses should not be a concern in
this case, but one should be aware of the problem with this certificate
program in relation to other highly infectious and contagious diseases.
