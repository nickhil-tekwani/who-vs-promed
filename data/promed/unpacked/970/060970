Even as the COVID-19 cases are going down steadily in Mumbai, it is struggling to control the outbreak of measles among children, as 8 deaths and 184 confirmed cases have so far been reported in the city per civic officials. Poor living conditions; big family sizes; lack of proper health services, sanitation facilities, and nutrition; poor immunity; missed vaccine doses; and reluctance for the inoculation are some of the major reasons for the outbreak of the disease in the city, they told PTI.

Mumbai has seen a multi-fold rise in the cases of measles this year [2022] versus 25 cases recorded in 2020 and 9 last year [2021] per civic data.

The metropolis has witnessed the outbreak of the disease when the government has targeted to eradicate it by 2023 end.

Earlier, Mumbai had reported 3 deaths due to measles in 2019; one death was recorded in each of Nagpur, Chandrapur, and Akola in 2020; while Thane and Mumbai had reported one death each in 2021, per a state bulletin.

If there are 5 suspected cases of an infection in a week, of which more than 2 have been confirmed in laboratory testing, then it is termed an outbreak, Maharashtra health surveillance officer Pradip Awate told PTI.

Measles is one of the leading causes of diarrhoea, pneumonia, and lowering of immunity, among other conditions, and leads to children getting stuck in the vicious cycle of various diseases and malnutrition, according to health experts.

As per the state bulletin, the health department is conducting house-to-house surveillance for measles, and special vaccination sessions are being arranged on a campaign mode.

This year [2022] Maharashtra reported 503 cases of measles till 17 Nov, compared to 153 in 2019, 193 in 2020, and 92 cases last year [2021], according to the bulletin.

Outside Mumbai as well, the outbreak of the viral disease has been witnessed in a few places, such as Bhiwandi town in neighbouring Thane district with 7 cases and Malegaon in Nashik district reporting 5 cases, it said.

A Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) official said due to the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, the regular inoculation programmes were affected and, as a result, the vaccination against measles was also hampered. Hence a large number of children either missed the 1st or 2nd doses. "We have now undertaken a 3-point programme to control the measles outbreak," BMC's executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said.

This includes search of the suspected cases of measles, speedy immunisation of children who have missed a vaccine shot or not taken any dose, and spreading awareness about the inoculation, she said.

"In a household survey of 0-2-year-old children, it was found that about 20 000 children have missed either their 1st or 2nd dose of the vaccine. We are organising additional sessions for them," Dr Gomare said.

She said they would arrange 100-150 extra sessions of inoculation camps for the children who have missed the measles doses.

The official said they have already inoculated 10 000 children in the 0-2 years age group and targeted to complete within a week's time the vaccination of the remaining 10 000 kids in that age bracket group and 40 000 children up to 5 years of age who have missed the vaccine doses for any reason.

This year [2022] the cases suddenly started rising from the last week of September, and the situation has now become alarming, BMC officials said.

The civic-run Kasturba Hospital added a special isolation ward following the outbreak in September [2022].

The viral disease has spread to 17 localities in 8 wards out of the total 24 civic in the city, said BMC officials, adding that a few of the patients are on ventilator support.

The maximum spread of the infection is in M-east ward, which includes areas like Govandi and Deonar, followed by L-ward comprising Kurla and Chunabhatti areas, they said.

The BMC has so far detected 2900 suspected cases of measles with patients having common symptoms like fever and rashes.

"All the deaths are from the Muslim community, and the areas where they were living are also dominated by the community,'' a civic official said. The reasons behind the measles outbreak in the slum-dominated M-east ward are poor living conditions and services, lack of sanitation facilities, and poor immunity and nutritious value, said a civic doctor who has worked there.

There are also many fake doctors in the area who do not provide the right treatment to the patients, worsening the health issues, the health official said.

Mumbai's biggest dumping ground is located in the M-east ward, where most of the people are from the poor financial background. They are engaged in informal occupations, and the living conditions are not good, according to activists working in the area.

Srushti Jaitely, a therapist who also works for an NGO, said as per a 2009 report, the human development index of the area is 0.05%, which she claimed is equivalent to the sub-Saharan countries.

''There is extreme poverty and a lot of vulnerability as the ward is situated on the periphery of the city. When the city was developing, the ward was accommodating dumping grounds [and] scrap yards, and with time, people also came to settle in the area. A lot of people have been relocated there in the name of rehabilitation. Hence, the largest number of R and R (relocation and rehabilitation) colonies are in this ward,'' Jaitely said.

After the outbreak of the disease, the BMC along with the Maharashtra and central governments swung into action and took multiple steps to contain the spread of the viral disease to other parts of the city.

The Union Health Ministry immediately sent a high-level multi-disciplinary team to Mumbai to take stock of the upsurge of measles cases in the city.

On 17 Nov [2022], Chief Minister Eknath Shinde also reviewed the measles outbreak situation and directed the BMC and the state health department officials to take help of religious leaders in spreading awareness about vaccination against the disease. He also visited the Kasturba Hospital to take stock of the situation. Acting on the high-level team's suggestion, the civic body has already called meetings with religious and community leaders as well as prominent people from the affected areas for spreading awareness about the disease and the immunisation, officials said.

The civic body is also giving 2 doses of vitamin A to suspected patients, and they are being admitted to hospital or referred to a paediatrician if necessary, they said. Awate said the health department will take a weekly review of the situation in the state on Monday [21 Nov 2022], and it has already undertaken necessary steps to contain the spread of the diseases including social mobilisation.

The South Africa National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) reports 57 measles outbreak cases were reported in Limpopo province and Mpumalanga province from 1 Sep to 16 Nov 2022.

Capricorn and Waterberg districts in Limpopo province and Ehlanzeni in Mpumalanga province reported 3 or more laboratory-confirmed measles cases within 30 days in the district, which meets the criteria for declaring a measles outbreak.

Laboratory-confirmed measles cases in Limpopo province have increased to 52 measles cases since the beginning of the measles outbreak, and laboratory-confirmed measles cases are increasing in Capricorn, Greater Sekhukhune, Mopani, and Waterberg districts. Vhembe district reported 2 laboratory-confirmed measles cases, one measles case epidemiologically linked to the measles circulation in Zimbabwe. In the past 7 days, 4 laboratory-confirmed measles cases were reported in the Bushbuckridge area of Ehlanzeni district in Mpumalanga province. Ehlanzeni district shares the border with Greater Sekhukhune and Mopani districts, which were the 1st districts to declare measles outbreaks. The spread of measles cases in Limpopo province and Ehlanzeni district, Mpumalanga province, poses the risk of measles spread. The sporadic laboratory-confirmed measles cases were reported in Northern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, Free State, and Western Cape provinces.

The laboratory-confirmed measles cases were identified aged from 6 months to 24 years in the Greater Sekhukhune district, and 2-42 years in the Mopani district. The measles in Ehlanzeni district in Mpumalanga province aged between 18 months and 10 years. The measles incidence is high in age groups 13 months to 4 years and 5-9 years. No deaths or other complications have been reported after 2 children were discharged from the hospital.

Affected districts continue with the public health response, tracing laboratory-confirmed measles cases and vaccinating the contacts. In healthcare facilities, catch-up measles vaccine doses are given to children who missed their measles vaccinations to increase immunity in the community. The public health response to the measles outbreak in Limpopo province should target improving measles immunity. Vaccination of measles case contacts is necessary in Ehlanzeni district for laboratory-confirmed measles cases to prevent the spread of the measles virus. To prevent the spread of the measles virus in other provinces, the sporadic measles case contacts should be traced and given measles vaccine doses per the National Measles Surveillance Guidelines.

The [percentage of] laboratory-confirmed measles cases with unknown measles vaccination history was 86% (49/57), impacting the evaluation of the measles coverage in affected areas. The affected districts in Limpopo province are continuing with the investigation of measles cases and vaccination of measles contacts. Measles catchup vaccination continues at healthcare facilities for the children who missed the routine measles vaccination doses.

Measles patients present with fever, rash, and one or more of the following symptoms: cough, red eyes, and runny nose. Complications of measles include pneumonia, diarrhea, dehydration, encephalitis, blindness, and death. Measles complications are severe in malnourished children and those young infants under 2 years of age. Persons of any age who are not vaccinated can catch measles and develop the disease. Clinicians and caregivers should be on alert for anyone presenting with the above symptoms and signs and check children's road-to-health booklets to ensure measles vaccinations are up to date. Measles vaccine doses are given routinely at 6 and 12 months of age. It is never too late to vaccinate against measles.

The Ecuador Ministry of Public Health (MSP) commenced a measles vaccination campaign for boys and girls between the ages of 6 months and 11 years in Ibarra (Imbabura) on Saturday [19 Nov 2022]. This action was transferred Mon 21 Nov 2022 to the educational establishments of the city after the identification of a case of measles in that town in the northern Sierra of the country.

On Fri 18 Nov 2022, an 8-month-old patient with measles was identified. He is in home isolation and has no complications. The epidemiological fence was carried out on more than 150 contacts where 2 suspected cases were identified that, after the analysis, were negative. In addition, 330 homes surrounding the patient's residence were visited to comply with the vaccination sweep.

Francisco Pérez, National Undersecretary of Surveillance of the MSP, explained that Ecuador is a country that has the measles elimination certification. This implies that vigilance is maintained and the regular vaccination schedule is reinforced. "Thanks to the surveillance processes we can determine whether or not there are suspected cases, take samples, and send them to the National Institute for Public Health Research (INSPI) for immediate analysis."

Pérez also mentioned that a reinforcement will be applied to children who have the complete scheme, or the vaccine will be placed to complete the said scheme. "Depending on the evolution, the actions may be increased to 2 or 3 more locations. Vaccines are safe, it is the best invention after clean water, and it has saved millions of lives."

The MSP urges parents, especially from Ibarra, to go to health centers to comply with the regular vaccination schedule and thus prevent the spread of the virus.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/3-cases-of-measles-detected-on-a-qantas-flight-from-s-pore-to-melbourne


Australia's Victoria state authorities have issued an urgent health warning about measles to passengers on a Qantas flight from Singapore and to visitors to Melbourne's international airport on Tuesday [15 Nov 2022].

Two members of a family of 3 travelling from Singapore to Melbourne were classified as infectious measles cases and were given immediate medical attention after landing.

The family is believed to be residing in Melbourne, Victoria.

Since the detection of the measles cases, Victoria's health department has listed 2 exposure sites: Qantas flight QF36 that departed Singapore on Monday [14 Nov 2022] evening and arrived in Melbourne at 6:10 a.m. on Tuesday [15 Nov 2022], and Melbourne Airport's international arrivals hall between 6:10 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. on Tuesday [15 Nov 2022].

Measles, a highly contagious viral infection that affects the respiratory system and often results in a skin rash, is more common among children, but it is also possible to contract the illness at any age.

The ages of the family members have not been disclosed.

Victoria's health department said in a statement, "Measles usually begins with common cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, red eyes, and a cough, followed by fever and a rash.

"The characteristic measles rash usually begins 3 to 4 days after the 1st symptoms, generally starting on the face and then spreading to the rest of the body," it added.

The department advised passengers and visitors present at the exposure sites to monitor their health and look out for any symptoms.

This year [2022] alone, Victoria has detected 5 cases of measles so far.

Singapore has detected 2 cases this year [2022], according to the Ministry of Health's website. Measles cases in Singapore are considered uncommon as all children are required to receive 2 immunisation doses as part of the Singapore National Childhood Immunisation Schedule.

The Straits Times has contacted Changi Airport, Qantas, and the Ministry of Health for comment.

[Low vaccination rates in a world reopening from COVID-19 combined with increasing international travel continue to help measles not only spread locally but move to locations with pockets of unvaccinated children susceptible to the highly infectious measles virus. We can only hope vaccination rates quickly rebound globally, but with public health resources (and especially funding) continuing to be stretched by COVID-19, monkeypox, and Sudan Ebolavirus surveillance and response activities, it is unclear how long it may take to return to "normal" on the measles-prevention front. - Mod.JH]
