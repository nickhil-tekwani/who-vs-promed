A 79-year-old patient, resident of Los Hatillos in Pese, is currently in the Gustavo Nelson Collado Hospital, in Chitre, a victim of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS].

This information was issued this morning [7 May 2015] by Alcibiades Dominguez, Regional Health Director of Herrera [province], who indicated that this is the 6th case of hantavirus infection in Herrera province so far in 2015, where a death [from HPS] has also occurred.

To date, 4 cases [of infection by a hantavirus] have been diagnosed in Pese, [as well as] one in Parita and one in Chitre.

Dominguez said that the residence of the patient had risk factors [for exposure via hantavirus infected rodents] in that as well as being surrounded by croplands also had stored grain near the house.

[Herrera and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. No data on this or the previous cases include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible. Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. In the report above, limited mention is made of the ecological setting in which the infection occurred. The croplands and food sources mentioned, such as stored grain, attract the rodent host of Choclo virus. The preventive measures indicated in previous reports include elimination of sites attractive to rodents. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
