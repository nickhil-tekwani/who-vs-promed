Hong Kong scales down avian flu response level to "alert"
---------------------------------------------------------
The Secretary for Food and Health of Hong Kong York Chow Wednesday [9
Jul 2008] announced the scale down of the response level for avian
influenza from "serious" to "alert."

After the detection of H5N1 avian influenza in environmental samples
collected from poultry stalls in Po On Road Market, Sham Shui Po, on
7 Jun 2008, the government had raised the response level to "serious."

With more environmental samples from 3 other retail markets found to
have the virus on 11 Jun 2008, live chicken trading in Hong Kong was
suspended for 21 days.

Expert warns Hong Kong's avian flu vaccine is waning
-----------------------------------------------------
A poultry vaccine designed to protect chickens in Hong Kong from H5
avian influenza has lost effectiveness over the past 7 years of use,
an expert told the Chinese media recently.

Yuen Kwok-yung, who heads the microbiology department at the
University of Hong Kong, told the South China Morning Post newspaper
that the virus is shifting away from the Fujian strain that it was
developed for, according to a 8 Jul 2008 Deutsche Presse-Argentur (DPA) report.

He told city officials that they must ban all live chickens from
markets before the vaccine becomes completely ineffective, the DPA
report said. Tests on birds in 2005 suggested that the vaccine
generated only a quarter of the antibody response it did in 2001.

"It takes time for the manufacturers to produce new vaccines. Hong
Kong is taking its own risk if it still has live chickens in the
market," Yuen said.

In early June [2008], animal health workers detected the virus in
poultry feces at several market stalls. They did not say if the
testing was done in response to sick or dead birds, and the source of
the virus has not been determined.

Since then, officials have banned poultry from overnight stays in the
market and have proposed a total ban on live poultry in Hong Kong
markets. They have offered traders and farmers compensation packages
in return for surrendering their sales licenses, but the offer has
angered the poultry merchants, who have said the government's offer
was too low, according to previous reports.

[Until February/March 2002, stamping-out policy was applied to
control HPAI H5N1. With endemic presence of the virus in the region
becoming apparent and in view of the large daily importation of
poultry to Hong Kong, the Administration considered that further risk
management measures, in addition to improved biosecurity and enhanced
surveillance, were necessary to prevent outbreaks. The decision to
add vaccination is analysed in the paper "Use of avian influenza
vaccination in Hong Kong" by Ellis, Simms et al. from the Agriculture
Fisheries and Conservation Department, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR,
published in Dev Biol (Basel). 2006;124:133-43. Its abstract includes
the following data:

"Vaccination using a killed H5N2 vaccine was evaluated over a
12-month period in the district with the last HPAI cases in the early
2002 outbreak. The vaccination trial showed that farmer-administered
killed H5N2 vaccine produced suitable flock antibody responses;
vaccinated birds were protected against H5N1 HPAI virus challenge and
excreted significantly less H5N1 virus; and vaccination was able to
control virus excretion in flocks during field outbreaks. Universal
vaccination of local chicken farms was introduced in June 2003 and by
the end of 2003 all chickens entering the live poultry markets in
Hong Kong were vaccinated by killed H5N2 vaccine. In addition to
vaccination, an enhanced biosecurity programme on farms and in live
poultry markets and a comprehensive surveillance programme in
poultry, wild birds, recreation park birds and pet birds were in
place. Vaccination use and performance is closely monitored. This
programme was successful in protecting local farms and live poultry
markets from H5N1 outbreaks during the regional H5N1 outbreaks in 2004."

Hong-Kong's policy and its meticulous applications have been regarded
appropriate, even exemplary, for several years. As commented in the
above paper, its performance is closely monitored, and rightly so.
The recent comments of Yuen Kwok-yung from the microbiology
department at the University of Hong Kong deserve considerations by
the evaluators. - Mod.AS]
