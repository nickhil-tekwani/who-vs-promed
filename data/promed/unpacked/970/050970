[The total for Ontario differs from that reported on Wed 3 Oct 2001, only
by the re-designation of a presumed positive bird in Waterloo Region as a
confirmed positive bird. The overall total remains the same, and it has to
be concluded that the 2001 West Nile virus season in Canada is drawing to a
close, or is even effectively over. - Mod.CP
