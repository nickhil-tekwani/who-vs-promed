==========================================

USDA restricted imports of pork and pork products from Spain after an
outbreak of hog cholera was discovered. "We have taken immediate action to
protect U.S. livestock from this deadly disease," said Joan M. Arnoldi,
deputy administrator of veterinary services with the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.
The US eradicated the disease in 1978 [after a long campaign- Mod. pc].
The restrictions prohibit imports of live swine but permit shipments of
other pork products if they are cooked or cured and dried in accordance
with U.S. regulations.
