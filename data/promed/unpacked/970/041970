Suspected Ebola death in Koboko
-------------------------------
A boda boda cyclist who was admitted to Koboko Health Centre IV with signs of Ebola virus [disease] virus has died. The man, whose identity was not disclosed by the doctor who treated him, was brought in on Monday [12 Nov 2012] and passed away on Tuesday [13 Nov 2012]. [Boda-boda (or bodaboda) is a bicycle taxi, originally in East Africa (from English border-border). The bicycle rider can also be called boda-boda. In Uganda it is often abbreviated as simply Boda. - Mod.CP]

The district health officer, Dr Alfred Driwale, told the Daily Monitor on Tuesday evening [13 Nov 2012] that they were treating a case of Ebola virus disease and it was under investigation. "The patient came with hemorrhagic fever and it is unfortunate that he died. Blood samples have been sent to Entebbe to confirm whether he died of Ebola virus disease of or Marburg virus disease," he said.

Dr Driwale explained that the patient had fever, headache, general body ache, yellowing of the eyes, bleeding from the nose and ears, was vomiting blood, and was in a state of mental confusion. This, he said caused suspicion. "We had to use protective gear when treating and burying him. But people should be calm because the disease is not yet confirmed," he added.

The man, from Kuluba Sub-county, was admitted after being unwell for 3 days. Upon admission, he was quarantined. A team from Arua hospital was called in to help. According to the doctors, the man had no recent history of travel to neighbouring DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo], South Sudan, or Kampala [the capital of Uganda].

[The location of Koboko District (43) can be found in the map of the Districts of Uganda at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda. It lies in the extreme north west of Uganda, remote from both the Luwero District and the Kibaale District where other outbreaks of Ebola virus disease are occurring. At present there is no known connection between these outbreaks.

It has been established that the Sudan strain of ebolavirus is responsible for the confirmed outbreaks in both the Luwero and the Kibaale Districts.

Laboratory confirmation of this new outbreak in Luwero District is awaited. - Mod.CP
