Man hospitalized in Kazakhstan with plague
------------------------------------------
A 41-year-old man has been hospitalized with plague in Aralsk, Kyzyl-Orda
region of Kazakhstan. Medics are taking anti-epidemic measures in the place
of his residence, the Agency for Emergency Situations told Itar-Tass on
Saturday.
The first death from plague in the last 25 years was reported in Kazakhstan
in 1999 when a 13-year-old boy died from bubonic plague in Aralsk. He had
been bitten by a steppe flea.
Health authorities say that natural hotbeds of plague are located in 8
western and southern regions of the country. These are the largest and most
active hotbeds in the world. They accounted for 90 percent of all plague
hotbeds in the former Soviet Union.
Plague is transmitted by fleas and rodents. Of domestic animals, it is
carried only by camels [Transmission to humans has also been documented
from sheep and cats. - Man. Ed. DS

[I presume the anti-epidemic measures to be primarily rodent control and
vigilance for additional cases. Person-to-person transmission of bubonic
plague is unlikely except when disease progresses to the terminal pneumonic
form, but all patients should be hospitalized. Patients who develop
pneumonic symptoms can initiate outbreaks of primary pneumonic plague,
especially where living conditions are overcrowded. - Mod.ES
