VARICELLA, NEONATAL (6)
=======================
In a general pediatric practice I saw a 9 month old girl with zoster;
typical vesicles in a dermatomal pattern of the thorax. She had not had
any previous illness but the mother experienced chickenpox in the last
week of her preganancy. I've not heard of other cases.
