A mystery virus has left 12 people dead over the past 3 days in the
northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh taking the toll from the
disease to 336 in the past 9 months, news reports said Sunday [21 Oct
2007]. Local people believe the virus is a deadly strain of Japanese
encephalitis, but health officials and experts say this is unlikely,
IANS (Indo-Asian News Service) reported. Extensive immunization
against Japanese encephalitis was carried out in the region after an
outbreak of the disease killed over a 1000 people in 2005, most of
them children.

The districts currently worst hit by the mystery virus are Gorakhpur,
Kushinagar, and Maharajganj in eastern Uttar Pradesh, and Saharanpur
and Muzaffarnagar in the western part of the state. Uttar Pradesh's
top health officials visited some of these districts on Friday [19
Oct 2007] to take stock of the situation.

"We have directed local officials to enhance surveillance and also
create greater awareness among people," principal health secretary AK
Misra said. "It is widely believed that the virus is waterborne and
proliferates in unhygienic conditions," he added. "The virus might be
mosquito-borne and widespread fogging was being carried out in the
affected areas," he said.

According to the Gorakhpur Medical College hospital records, at least
1600 people have been admitted to the hospital after being affected
by the mysterious virus since January [2007]. "Though some of them
were adults, the larger chunk of the affected people were children,"
said KP Kushwaha, who heads a panel of the hospital set up for
combating the virus. Kushwaha believes the virus is a variation of
[viral?] encephalitis. "Surely, this is not Japanese encephalitis,
against which we had immunised 7.5 million children in May-June this
year [2007]," he said. "From my experience, I could say that the
virus is a new kind of encephalitis."

Experts from 3 leading national scientific institutions -- the
National Institute of Virology, the National Institute of
Communicable Diseases, and the Centre for Research and Medical
Entomology -- have not yet been able to identify the virus, the IANS
agency reported.

[This outbreak appears to be an extension of the outbreak of Japanese
encephalitis reported in the preceding ProMED-mail report from Uttar
Pradesh in September (see: Japanese encephalitis - India (Uttar
Pradesh) 20070930.3233). The reluctance in the current report to
attribute the outbreak to Japanese encephalitis virus infection may
be a consequence of the fact that although a vaccination drive
against vector-borne disease had been undertaken by the state
government its efficacy has been in doubt.

Mod.TY commented previously that the current (2007) epidemic of
Japanese encephalitis is in fact somewhat larger than last year's
(2006). It is regrettable that the Japanese encephalitis virus
vaccine campaign has not achieved the coverage in this endemic area
(see archives below) needed to reduce the number of clinical cases
reported here although effective vaccines are available.

Clarification of the diagnosis of the disease affecting mainly
children in Uttar Pradesh is awaited. A map of Uttar Pradesh showing
the major population centres is available at
