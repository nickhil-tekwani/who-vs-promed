Deaths from Suspected Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Now Attributed to Malaria
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I am referring to the report of 2 suspect cases of viral hemorrhagic fever
(VHF) in Munich, Germany. We have received urine and blood samples from
both of the patients today, and we have clearly ruled out by RT-PCR the
following agents: Marburg virus, Ebola virus, Lassa virus, and
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. Validated sensitivity limits of the
methods are 2647 genome equivalents (geq)/ml for the filoviruses, 2445
geq/ml for Lassa fever virus, 2779 geq/ml for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever virus. Every patient of VHF we have diagnosed so far in our
laboratory had viral RNA concentrations surpassing these values by orders of
magnitude.
In contrast, a very high-level parasitemia was diagnosed in blood smears of
both of the patients yesterday by a pathology laboratory in Munich.
Parasitemia was stated to be >80 percent. The parasite was identified as
_Plasmodium falciparum_

Some clarification in response to your recent posting
-----------------------------------------------------
A German couple has indeed been found dead in their Munich flat during the
late evening of 10 Sep 2001. Both had recently (3 Sep 2001) returned from
Burkina Faso. As far as our information goes, no antimalarial precautions
were taken.
The bodies were transported to a postmortem under the provisional suspicion
of possible Ebola fever. Blood smears done on the morning of 11 Sep 2001
were brought to our laboratory and diagnosed as _P. falciparum_
positive. The husband, who obviously died somewhat later than the wife,
had a parasitaemia of >80 percent.
This message has been distributed within the German infectious disease
network SIMPID during the morning of 11 Sep 2001.
