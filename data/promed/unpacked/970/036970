Had you considered substitution of diethylene glycol for propylene glycol as the vehicle?

For example, see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2550149/:

Abstract
----------
Objective: To determine the cause of a large increase in the number of children with unexplained renal failure

Design: Case-control study

Setting: Children's hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh

Subjects: Cases were all 339 children with initially unexplained renal failure; controls were 90 children with cause of renal failure identified; all were admitted to hospital during 35 months after January 1990.

Main outcome measures: Differences between the case and control patients in clinical and histological features and outcome; toxicological examination of 69 bottles of paracetamol from patients and pharmacies.

Results: Compared with children with an identified cause for their renal failure, children with initially unexplained renal failure were significantly (P < 0.05) more likely to have hepatomegaly (58% v 33%), oedema (37% v 20%), and hypertension (58% v 23%); to have a higher serum creatinine concentration (mean 519 mumol/l v 347 mumol/l) and lower serum bicarbonate concentration (10.1 mmol/l v 12.4 mmol/l); to have been given a drug for fever (91% v 31%); to have ingested a brand of paracetamol shown to contain diethylene glycol (20% v 0%); and to have died in hospital (70% v 33%).

Diethylene glycol was identified in 19 bottles of paracetamol, from 7 of 28 brands tested. In the 12 months after a government ban on the sale of paracetamol elixir, new cases of renal failure decreased by 54%, and cases of unexplained renal failure decreased by 84%.

Conclusion: Paracetamol elixirs with diethylene glycol as a diluent were responsible for a large outbreak of fatal renal failure in Bangladesh.

[We appreciate the communication. This would actually be a very logical explanation for the situation in Gambia (see ProMED posts 20220912.8705536 and 20220911.8705510).

Hopefully those in Gambia will think to test the syrup for diethylene glycol. - Mod.TG
