SUMMARY - Week 18/2015 (27 Apr - 3 May 2015)
-----
Influenza activity continued to decrease in most of the 42 reporting countries: the proportion of influenza-virus-positive specimens from sentinel sources decreased from 20 percent in week 17/2015 to 14 percent in week 18. Since week 51/2014, the positivity rate has been over the threshold of 10 percent, indicating seasonal influenza activity.

Low intensity of influenza activity was reported by 37 countries.

Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and type B viruses continued to circulate in the WHO European Region, but type B viruses accounted for 86 percent of sentinel detections in week 18/2015.

Excess all-cause mortality among people aged 65 years and above, concomitant with increased influenza activity and the predominance of A(H3N2) viruses, had been observed in most countries participating in the European project for monitoring excess mortality for public health action (EuroMOMO), but has now abated (see the EuroMOMO website).

Antigenic drift in a proportion of A(H3N2) viruses was observed in the 2014-2015 influenza season, so the northern hemisphere vaccine did not provide broad protection against A(H3N2) viruses. Despite some antigenic drift among B/Yamagata viruses, the A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Yamagata components in the vaccine are likely to protect against circulating viruses.

Of all the influenza viruses screened for reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors, only 4 A(H3N2) viruses and 2 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have shown genetic or phenotypic evidence of reduced susceptibility: one A(H3N2) virus to oseltamivir and zanamivir and the other five to oseltamivir only.

Virus Characteristics
----
Since week 40/2014, 1426 influenza viruses have been attributed to a genetic group, and 1871 have been attributed to an antigenic category In addition, 42 A(H3N2) viruses were attributed to a genetic group not listed in the database, and 48 A(H3N2), eight A(H1N1)pdm09, 36 B/Yamagata- and three B/Victoria-lineage viruses were reported that were not attributable to an antigenic category.

A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses
----
All 241 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterized genetically fell in clade 6, with 235 (98 percent) falling in subgroup 6B. Viruses falling in these genetic groups, along with the 373 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses attributed to an antigenic category to date, are similar to the components included in the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere vaccines.

A(H3N2) viruses
----
Of the 869 A(H3N2) viruses attributed to a genetic group, most fell into genetic subgroups that have been shown to be antigenically dissimilar to the current A(H3N2) vaccine virus: 63 percent in genetic subgroup 3C.2a, represented by A/Hong Kong/5738/2014; and 8 percent in genetic subgroup 3C.3a, represented by A/Switzerland/9715293/2013. Of the remaining viruses, 28 percent fell into genetic group 3C.3, represented by A/Samara/73/2013, which has been shown to be antigenically similar to the current A(H3N2) vaccine virus. A proportion of the latter viruses can be designated as subgroup 3C.3b, but these remain antigenically similar to the current A(H3N2) vaccine virus.

Of 840 A(H3N2) viruses attributed to an antigenic category, 71 percent were A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like and thus dissimilar to the A/Texas/50/2012 vaccine virus. Together, these observations indicate that the current A(H3N2) component of influenza vaccines will probably have limited effectiveness as reported for North America.

Influenza B viruses
----
Of the 310 B/Yamagata-lineage viruses characterized genetically to date, all fell in clade 3, with 99 percent being represented by B/Phuket/3073/2013. The five B/Victoria-lineage viruses all belonged to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (clade 1A).

Similar proportions were observed among the 658 influenza B viruses characterized antigenically, with 98 percent being attributed to antigenic groups of the Yamagata lineage; the 10 Victoria-lineage viruses were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like, the virus recommended for inclusion in quadrivalent vaccines. Of the 648 Yamagata-lineage viruses, 140 (22 percent) were similar to B/Massachusetts/2/2012, a virus from genetic clade 2 included in the current 2014-2015 northern hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, while 501 (77 percent) were B/Phuket/3073/2013-like, the virus from genetic clade 3 recommended for the southern hemisphere 2015 and northern hemisphere 2015-2016 influenza season vaccines. In addition, 1 B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like and 6 B/Florida/4/2006-like Yamagata-lineage viruses have been reported; such viruses show antigenic similarity to B/Phuket/3073/2013.
