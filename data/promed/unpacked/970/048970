Eye specialists have warned of a resurgence in syphilis-related eye
infections as cases of the sexually-transmitted disease escalate in gay
communities. Ophthalmologists say they are treating growing numbers of men
who present with painful, red eyes or hazy vision caused by syphilis
infection.
"Many of them aren't aware they have the infection because the only
symptoms they have are in their eyes," said Dr. Chathri Amaratunge, a
specialist at Melbourne's Alfred Hospital. "That is problematic,
especially as it's happening more and more."
Syphilis rates doubled in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria between 2001
and 2005 after a 50-year lull in the disease, when only a handful of cases
were reported annually. Homosexual men are most commonly affected, with
infectious disease experts predicting the epidemic will spread through gay
communities nationwide with time.
Dr. Amaratunge says eye-related syphilis is relatively uncommon, with 15
cases expected in Victoria this year [2007], but numbers are rising fast.
Fewer than 10 percent of people who catch the disease develop symptoms in
their eyes, causing redness, pain, light sensitivity and loss of vision.
But in those who do, 25 percent will have no other symptoms of the
syphilis and therefore often have no idea they have the debilitating
condition.
Dr. Amaratunge will present data to a Victorian ophthalmology meeting on
Saturday [12 May 2007] on 4 men who presented to a Melbourne hospital
unaware they had the disease. "Because we're used to syphilis being a rare
disease we don't necessarily think of it as a cause of eye problems
anymore," she will tell colleagues. "That thinking has to start changing
because sadly it's coming back and this is an important way of picking it
up."
Syphilis notifications rose more than 20-fold in inner-Sydney between 1999
and 2003 -- from 6 cases to 162. Victoria State statistics show there were only
2 notifications of syphilis in 1999, but annual reports had ballooned to
238 by 2006. There were almost 80 cases in the first 3 months of 2007,
showing numbers are rising further.

[Syphilis may result in 3 classic stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary
syphilis. The eye may be involved in any of the 3 stages. Primary syphilis
is characterized by the development of a painless chancre (ulcer) at the
site of inoculation, typically in the genital area. The lesion appears
about 4 weeks after infection, and heals about 6 to 8 weeks later. It may
rarely occur on the conjunctiva.
Untreated, primary syphilis may progress to secondary syphilis within 4 to
12 months. There is fever and a rash. Ocular complications of inflammation
can involve any structure of the eye. Tertiary syphilis may follow
untreated secondary syphilis.
In the secondary stage of syphilis 10 percent of patients may develop
inflammatory signs and symptoms involving virtually any structure of the
eye (e.g., conjunctivitis, iritis, vitritis, episcleritis, scleritis,
neuroretinitis, chorioretinitis, and retinal detachment). Tertiary
syphilis may cause granulomatous disease of any structure of the eye as
well as abnormal pupillary findings, oculomotor palsies, and glaucoma.
Blindness may result. - Mod.DK]
