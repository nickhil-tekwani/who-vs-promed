A 7 year old boy is currently hospitalized in the city [Capiatá] in the intensive care unit in the IPS Central Hospital, for [a] presumed hantavirus [infection]. The hospital director, Gabriel Aguilera, said that up to now this is the 1st known case in the city. The boy resides behind the ContiParaguay Company (CAPSA) at Kilometer 21 of the Mariscal-Estigarriba route. He was seen, along with his mother, in the local hospital last week for fever and was taken to the Previsión Social Institute (IPS).

The result from a private laboratory was positive for the disease, which is transmitted by rats. However, in order to officially report that this is [a] hantavirus [infection], Dr Aguilera stated that they are awaiting results from the Central Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, which will be issued on [Mon 25 Feb 2019]. He added that health personnel inspected the house and surrounding area, but did not find any resident with fever or other symptoms. He also stated that neither the boy nor his family traveled to Boquerón department, the endemic area in the country.

Dr Aguilera added that contact with rodent excrement and urine can cause the disease [transmit the virus]. He stressed that any produce that one acquires from storehouses, supermarkets and similar establishments must be cleaned, because it is known that rodents frequently circulate in these places.

Some of the 1st symptoms of the disease can be confused with influenza since they usually are fever and mild body pain. Only when the condition worsens do they go to the doctor if they suspect that they might have the condition [hantavirus infection].

[The condition of the patient at the time of writing is not mentioned. However, his transfer into an intensive care unit in a more sophisticated hospital suggests that he might have developed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).

Most of the previous cases of hantavirus infection have been diagnosed in Boquerón department in north western Paraguay. This is the 1st report of a possible hantavirus infection in the Central Department of Paraguay. The possible hantavirus involved in this suspected case is not stated. A 2011 report indicated that Leguna Negra hantavirus was responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases in Presidente Hayes department. In addition to Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_), other hantaviruses that can cause HPS and are found in Paraguay (and their rodent hosts) include Juquitiba (__Akodon cursor_), Ape Aime-Itapúa (_Akodon montensis_), Arauaria (_A. montensis_, _Oligoryzomys nigripes_), Jabora and Jabora-like (_A. montensis_), Alto Paraguay (_Holochilus chararius_), and Lechiguanas (_Oligoryzomys nigripes_).
